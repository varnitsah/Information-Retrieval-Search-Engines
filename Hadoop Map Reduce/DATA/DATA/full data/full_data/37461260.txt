37461260	armadale  by wilkie collins                  to                 john forster  in acknowledgment of the services which he has rendered to the cause of literature by his life of goldsmith and in affectionate remembrance of a friendship which is associated with some of the happiest years of my life   readers in generalon whose friendly reception experience has given me some reason to relywill i venture to hope appreciate whatever merit there may be in this story without any prefatory pleading for it on my part they will i think see that it has not been hastily meditated or idly wrought out they will judge it accordingly and i ask no more  readers in particular will i have some reason to suppose be here and there disturbed perhaps even offended by finding that armadale oversteps in more than one direction the narrow limits within which they are disposed to restrict the development of modern fictionif they can  nothing that i could say to these persons here would help me with them as time will help me if my work lasts i am not afraid of my design being permanently misunderstood provided the execution has done it any sort of justice estimated by the claptrap morality of the present day this may be a very daring book judged by the christian morality which is of all time it is only a book that is daring enough to speak the truth  london april 1866     armadale     prologue     i the travelers  it was the opening of the season of eighteen hundred and thirtytwo at the baths of wildbad  the evening shadows were beginning to gather over the quiet little german town and the diligence was expected every minute before the door of the principal inn waiting the arrival of the first visitors of the year were assembled the three notable personages of wildbad accompanied by their wivesthe mayor representing the inhabitants the doctor representing the waters the landlord representing his own establishment beyond this select circle grouped snugly about the trim little square in front of the inn appeared the townspeople in general mixed here and there with the country people in their quaint german costume placidly expectant of the diligencethe men in short black jackets tight black breeches and threecornered beaver hats the women with their long light hair hanging in one thickly plaited tail behind them and the waists of their short woolen gowns inserted modestly in the region of their shoulderblades round the outer edge of the assemblage thus formed flying detachments of plump whiteheaded children careered in perpetual motion while mysteriously apart from the rest of the inhabitants the musicians of the baths stood collected in one lost corner waiting the appearance of the first visitors to play the first tune of the season in the form of a serenade the light of a may evening was still bright on the tops of the great wooded hills watching high over the town on the right hand and the left and the cool breeze that comes before sunset came keenly fragrant here with the balsamic odor of the first of the black forest  mr landlord said the mayors wife giving the landlord his title have you any foreign guests coming on this first day of the season  madame mayoress replied the landlord returning the compliment i have two they have writtenthe one by the hand of his servant the other by his own hand apparentlyto order their rooms and they are from england both as i think by their names if you ask me to pronounce those names my tongue hesitates if you ask me to spell them here they are letter by letter first and second in their order as they come first a highborn stranger by title mister who introduces himself in eight letters a r m a d a l eand comes ill in his own carriage second a highborn stranger by title mister also who introduces himself in four lettersn e a land comes ill in the diligence his excellency of the eight letters writes to me by his servant in french his excellency of the four letters writes to me in german the rooms of both are ready i know no more  perhaps suggested the mayors wife mr doctor has heard from one or both of these illustrious strangers  from one only madam mayoress but not strictly speaking from the person himself i have received a medical report of his excellency of the eight letters and his case seems a bad one god help him  the diligence cried a child from the outskirts of the crowd  the musicians seized their instruments and silence fell on the whole community from far away in the windings of the forest gorge the ring of horses bells came faintly clear through the evening stillness which carriage was approachingthe private carriage with mr armadale or the public carriage with mr neal  play my friends cried the mayor to the musicians public or private here are the first sick people of the season let them find us cheerful  the band played a lively dance tune and the children in the square footed it merrily to the music at the same moment their elders near the inn door drew aside and disclosed the first shadow of gloom that fell over the gayety and beauty of the scene through the opening made on either hand a little procession of stout country girls advanced each drawing after her an empty chair on wheels each in waiting and knitting while she waited for the paralyzed wretches who came helpless by hundreds thenwho come helpless by thousands nowto the waters of wildbad for relief  while the band played while the children danced while the buzz of many talkers deepened while the strong young nurses of the coming cripples knitted impenetrably a womans insatiable curiosity about other women asserted itself in the mayors wife she drew the landlady aside and whispered a question to her on the spot  a word more maam said the mayors wife about the two strangers from england are their letters explicit have they got any ladies with them  the one by the diligenceno replied the landlady but the one by the private carriageyes he comes with a child he comes with a nurse and concluded the landlady skillfully keeping the main point of interest till the last he comes with a wife  the mayoress brightened the doctoress assisting at the conference brightened the landlady nodded significantly in the minds of all three the same thought started into life at the same momentwe shall see the fashions  in a minute more there was a sudden movement in the crowd and a chorus of voices proclaimed that the travelers were at hand  by this time the coming vehicle was in sight and all further doubt was at an end it was the diligence that now approached by the long street leading into the squarethe diligence in a dazzling new coat of yellow paint that delivered the first visitors of the season at the inn door of the ten travelers released from the middle compartment and the back compartment of the carriageall from various parts of germanythree were lifted out helpless and were placed in the chairs on wheels to be drawn to their lodgings in the town the front compartment contained two passengers onlymr neal and his traveling servant with an arm on either side to assist him the stranger whose malady appeared to be locally confined to a lameness in one of his feet succeeded in descending the steps of the carriage easily enough while he steadied himself on the pavement by the help of his sticklooking not overpatiently toward the musicians who were serenading him with the waltz in der freischutzhis personal appearance rather damped the enthusiasm of the friendly little circle assembled to welcome him he was a lean tall serious middleaged man with a cold gray eye and a long upper lip with overhanging eyebrows and high cheekbones a man who looked what he wasevery inch a scotchman  where is the proprietor of this hotel he asked speaking in the german language with a fluent readiness of expression and an icy coldness of manner fetch the doctor he continued when the landlord had presented himself i want to see him immediately  i am here already sir said the doctor advancing from the circle of friends and my services are entirely at your disposal  thank you said mr neal looking at the doctor as the rest of us look at a dog when we have whistled and the dog has come i shall be glad to consult you tomorrow morning at ten oclock about my own case i only want to trouble you now with a message which i have undertaken to deliver we overtook a traveling carriage on the road here with a gentleman in itan englishman i believewho appeared to be seriously ill a lady who was with him begged me to see you immediately on my arrival and to secure your professional assistance in removing the patient from the carriage their courier has met with an accident and has been left behind on the road and they are obliged to travel very slowly if you are here in an hour you will be here in time to receive them that is the message who is this gentleman who appears to be anxious to speak to me the mayor if you wish to see my passport sir my servant will show it to you no you wish to welcome me to the place and to offer your services i am infinitely flattered if you have any authority to shorten the performances of your town band you would be doing me a kindness to exert it my nerves are irritable and i dislike music where is the landlord no i want to see my rooms i dont want your arm i can get upstairs with the help of my stick mr mayor and mr doctor we need not detain one another any longer i wish you goodnight  both mayor and doctor looked after the scotchman as he limped upstairs and shook their heads together in mute disapproval of him the ladies as usual went a step further and expressed their opinions openly in the plainest words the case under consideration so far as they were concerned was the scandalous case of a man who had passed them over entirely without notice mrs mayor could only attribute such an outrage to the native ferocity of a savage mrs doctor took a stronger view still and considered it as proceeding from the inbred brutality of a hog  the hour of waiting for the travelingcarriage wore on and the creeping night stole up the hillsides softly one by one the stars appeared and the first lights twinkled in the windows of the inn as the darkness came the last idlers deserted the square as the darkness came the mighty silence of the forest above flowed in on the valley and strangely and suddenly hushed the lonely little town  the hour of waiting wore out and the figure of the doctor walking backward and forward anxiously was still the only living figure left in the square five minutes ten minutes twenty minutes were counted out by the doctors watch before the first sound came through the night silence to warn him of the approaching carriage slowly it emerged into the square at the walking pace of the horses and drew up as a hearse might have drawn up at the door of the inn  is the doctor here asked a womans voice speaking out of the darkness of the carriage in the french language  i am here madam replied the doctor taking a light from the landlords hand and opening the carriage door  the first face that the light fell on was the face of the lady who had just spokena young darkly beautiful woman with the tears standing thick and bright in her eager black eyes the second face revealed was the face of a shriveled old negress sitting opposite the lady on the back seat the third was the face of a little sleeping child in the negresss lap with a quick gesture of impatience the lady signed to the nurse to leave the carriage first with the child pray take them out of the way she said to the landlady pray take them to their room she got out herself when her request had been complied with then the light fell clear for the first time on the further side of the carriage and the fourth traveler was disclosed to view  he lay helpless on a mattress supported by a stretcher his hair long and disordered under a black skullcap his eyes wide open rolling to and fro ceaselessly anxious the rest of his face as void of all expression of the character within him and the thought within him as if he had been dead there was no looking at him now and guessing what he might once have been the leaden blank of his face met every question as to his age his rank his temper and his looks which that face might once have answered in impenetrable silence nothing spoke for him now but the shock that had struck him with the deathinlife of paralysis the doctors eye questioned his lower limbs and deathinlife answered i am here the doctors eye rising attentively by way of his hands and arms questioned upward and upward to the muscles round his mouth and deathinlife answered i am coming  in the face of a calamity so unsparing and so dreadful there was nothing to be said the silent sympathy of help was all that could be offered to the woman who stood weeping at the carriage door  as they bore him on his bed across the hall of the hotel his wandering eyes encountered the face of his wife they rested on her for a moment and in that moment he spoke  the child he said in english with a slow thick laboring articulation  the child is safe upstairs she answered faintly  my desk  it is in my hands look i wont trust it to anybody i am taking care of it for you myself  he closed his eyes for the first time after that answer and said no more tenderly and skillfully he was carried up the stairs with his wife on one side of him and the doctor ominously silent on the other the landlord and the servants following saw the door of his room open and close on him heard the lady burst out crying hysterically as soon as she was alone with the doctor and the sick man saw the doctor come out half an hour later with his ruddy face a shade paler than usual pressed him eagerly for information and received but one answer to all their inquirieswait till i have seen him tomorrow ask me nothing tonight they all knew the doctors ways and they augured ill when he left them hurriedly with that reply  so the two first english visitors of the year came to the baths of wildbad in the season of eighteen hundred and thirtytwo     ii the solid side of the scotch character  at ten oclock the next morning mr nealwaiting for the medical visit which he had himself appointed for that hourlooked at his watch and discovered to his amazement that he was waiting in vain it was close on eleven when the door opened at last and the doctor entered the room  i appointed ten oclock for your visit said mr neal in my country a medical man is a punctual man  in my country returned the doctor without the least illhumor a medical man is exactly like other menhe is at the mercy of accidents pray grant me your pardon sir for being so long after my time i have been detained by a very distressing casethe case of mr armadale whose travelingcarriage you passed on the road yesterday  mr neal looked at his medical attendant with a sour surprise there was a latent anxiety in the doctors eye a latent preoccupation in the doctors manner which he was at a loss to account for for a moment the two faces confronted each other silently in marked national contrastthe scotchmans long and lean hard and regular the germans plump and florid soft and shapeless one face looked as if it had never been young the other as if it would never grow old  might i venture to remind you said mr neal that the case now under consideration is my case and not mr armadales  certainly replied the doctor still vacillating between the case he had come to see and the case he had just left you appear to be suffering from lameness let me look at your foot  mr neals malady however serious it might be in his own estimation was of no extraordinary importance in a medical point of view he was suffering from a rheumatic affection of the anklejoint the necessary questions were asked and answered and the necessary baths were prescribed in ten minutes the consultation was at an end and the patient was waiting in significant silence for the medical adviser to take his leave  i cannot conceal from myself said the doctor rising and hesitating a little that i am intruding on you but i am compelled to beg your indulgence if i return to the subject of mr armadale  may i ask what compels you  the duty which i owe as a christian answered the doctor to a dying man  mr neal started those who touched his sense of religious duty touched the quickest sense in his nature  you have established your claim on my attention he said gravely my time is yours  i will not abuse your kindness replied the doctor resuming his chair i will be as short as i can mr armadales case is briefly this he has passed the greater part of his life in the west indiesa wild life and a vicious life by his own confession shortly after his marriagenow some three years sincethe first symptoms of an approaching paralytic affection began to show themselves and his medical advisers ordered him away to try the climate of europe since leaving the west indies he has lived principally in italy with no benefit to his health from italy before the last seizure attacked him he removed to switzerland and from switzerland he has been sent to this place so much i know from his doctors report the rest i can tell you from my own personal experience mr armadale has been sent to wildbad too late he is virtually a dead man the paralysis is fast spreading upward and disease of the lower part of the spine has already taken place he can still move his hands a little but he can hold nothing in his fingers he can still articulate but he may wake speechless tomorrow or next day if i give him a week more to live i give him what i honestly believe to be the utmost length of his span at his own request i told him as carefully and as tenderly as i could what i have just told you the result was very distressing the violence of the patients agitation was a violence which i despair of describing to you i took the liberty of asking him whether his affairs were unsettled nothing of the sort his will is in the hands of his executor in london and he leaves his wife and child well provided for my next question succeeded better it hit the mark have you something on your mind to do before you die which is not done yet he gave a great gasp of relief which said as no words could have said it yes can i help you yes i have something to write that i must write can you make me hold a pen  he might as well have asked me if i could perform a miracle i could only say no if i dictate the words he went on can you write what i tell you to write once more i could only say no i understand a little english but i can neither speak it nor write it mr armadale understands french when it is spoken as i speak it to him slowly but he cannot express himself in that language and of german he is totally ignorant in this difficulty i said what any one else in my situation would have said why ask me there is mrs armadale at your service in the next room before i could get up from my chair to fetch her he stopped menot by words but by a look of horror which fixed me by main force of astonishment in my place surely i said your wife is the fittest person to write for you as you desire the last person under heaven he answered what i said you ask me a foreigner and a stranger to write words at your dictation which you keep a secret from your wife conceive my astonishment when he answered me without a moments hesitation yes i sat lost i sat silent if you cant write english he said find somebody who can i tried to remonstrate he burst into a dreadful moaning crya dumb entreaty like the entreaty of a dog hush hush i said i will find somebody today he broke out before my speech fails me like my hand today in an hours time he shut his eyes he quieted himself instantly while i am waiting for you he said let me see my little boy he had shown no tenderness when he spoke of his wife but i saw the tears on his cheeks when he asked for his child my profession sir has not made me so hard a man as you might think and my doctors heart was as heavy when i went out to fetch the child as if i had not been a doctor at all i am afraid you think this rather weak on my part  the doctor looked appealingly at mr neal he might as well have looked at a rock in the black forest mr neal entirely declined to be drawn by any doctor in christendom out of the regions of plain fact  go on he said i presume you have not told me all that you have to tell me yet  surely you understand my object in coming here now returned the other  your object is plain enough at last you invite me to connect myself blindfold with a matter which is in the last degree suspicious so far i decline giving you any answer until i know more than i know now did you think it necessary to inform this mans wife of what had passed between you and to ask her for an explanation  of course i thought it necessary said the doctor indignant at the reflection on his humanity which the question seemed to imply if ever i saw a woman fond of her husband and sorry for her husband it is this unhappy mrs armadale as soon as we were left alone together i sat down by her side and i took her hand in mine why not i am an ugly old man and i may allow myself such liberties as these  excuse me said the impenetrable scotchman i beg to suggest that you are losing the thread of the narrative  nothing more likely returned the doctor recovering his good humor it is in the habit of my nation to be perpetually losing the thread and it is evidently in the habit of yours sir to be perpetually finding it what an example here of the order of the universe and the everlasting fitness of things  will you oblige me once for all by confining yourself to the facts persisted mr neal frowning impatiently may i inquire for my own information whether mrs armadale could tell you what it is her husband wishes me to write and why it is that he refuses to let her write for him  there is my thread foundand thank you for finding it said the doctor you shall hear what mrs armadale had to tell me in mrs armadales own words the cause that now shuts me out of his confidence she said is i firmly believe the same cause that has always shut me out of his heart i am the wife he has wedded but i am not the woman he loves i knew when he married me that another man had won from him the woman he loved i thought i could make him forget her i hoped when i married him i hoped again when i bore him a son need i tell you the end of my hopesyou have seen it for yourself wait sir i entreat you i have not lost the thread again i am following it inch by inch is this all you know i asked all i knew she said till a short time since it was when we were in switzerland and when his illness was nearly at its worst that news came to him by accident of that other woman who has been the shadow and the poison of my lifenews that she like me had borne her husband a son on the instant of his making that discoverya trifling discovery if ever there was one yeta mortal fear seized on him not for me not for himself a fear for his own child the same day without a word to me he sent for the doctor i was mean wicked what you pleasei listened at the door i heard him say i have something to tell my son when my son grows old enough to understand me shall i live to tell it the doctor would say nothing certain the same night still without a word to me he locked himself into his room what would any woman treated as i was have done in my place she would have done as i didshe would have listened again i heard him say to himself i shall not live to tell it i must write it before i die i heard his pen scrape scrape scrape over the paper i heard him groaning and sobbing as he wrote i implored him for gods sake to let me in the cruel pen went scrape scrape scrape the cruel pen was all the answer he gave me i waited at the doorhoursi dont know how long on a sudden the pen stopped and i heard no more i whispered through the keyhole softly i said i was cold and weary with waiting i said oh my love let me in not even the cruel pen answered me now silence answered me with all the strength of my miserable hands i beat at the door the servants came up and broke it in we were too late the harm was done over that fatal letter the stroke had struck himover that fatal letter we found him paralyzed as you see him now those words which he wants you to write are the words he would have written himself if the stroke had spared him till the morning from that time to this there has been a blank place left in the letter and it is that blank place which he has just asked you to fill upin those words mrs armadale spoke to me in those words you have the sum and substance of all the information i can give say if you please sir have i kept the thread at last have i shown you the necessity which brings me here from your countrymans deathbed  thus far said mr neal you merely show me that you are exciting yourself this is too serious a matter to be treated as you are treating it now you have involved me in the business and i insist on seeing my way plainly dont raise your hands your hands are not a part of the question if i am to be concerned in the completion of this mysterious letter it is only an act of justifiable prudence on my part to inquire what the letter is about mrs armadale appears to have favored you with an infinite number of domestic particularsin return i presume for your polite attention in taking her by the hand may i ask what she could tell you about her husbands letter so far as her husband has written it  mrs armadale could tell me nothing replied the doctor with a sudden formality in his manner which showed that his forbearance was at last failing him before she was composed enough to think of the letter her husband had asked for it and had caused it to be locked up in his desk she knows that he has since time after time tried to finish it and that time after time the pen has dropped from his fingers she knows when all other hope of his restoration was at an end that his medical advisers encouraged him to hope in the famous waters of this place and last she knows how that hope has ended for she knows what i told her husband this morning  the frown which had been gathering latterly on mr neals face deepened and darkened he looked at the doctor as if the doctor had personally offended him  the more i think of the position you are asking me to take he said the less i like it can you undertake to say positively that mr armadale is in his right mind  yes as positively as words can say it  does his wife sanction your coming here to request my interference  his wife sends me to youthe only englishman in wildbadto write for your dying countryman what he cannot write for himself and what no one else in this place but you can write for him  that answer drove mr neal back to the last inch of ground left him to stand on even on that inch the scotchman resisted still  wait a little he said you put it strongly let us be quite sure you put it correctly as well let us be quite sure there is nobody to take this responsibility but myself there is a mayor in wildbad to begin witha man who possesses an official character to justify his interference  a man of a thousand said the doctor with one faulthe knows no language but his own  there is an english legation at stuttgart persisted mr neal  and there are miles on miles of the forest between this and stuttgart rejoined the doctor if we sent this moment we could get no help from the legation before tomorrow and it is as likely as not in the state of this dying mans articulation that tomorrow may find him speechless i dont know whether his last wishes are wishes harmless to his child and to others wishes hurtful to his child and to others but i do know that they must be fulfilled at once or never and that you are the only man that can help him  that open declaration brought the discussion to a close it fixed mr neal fast between the two alternatives of saying yes and committing an act of imprudence or of saying no and committing an act of inhumanity there was a silence of some minutes the scotchman steadily reflected and the german steadily watched him  the responsibility of saying the next words rested on mr neal and in course of time mr neal took it he rose from his chair with a sullen sense of injury lowering on his heavy eyebrows and working sourly in the lines at the corners of his mouth  my position is forced on me he said i have no choice but to accept it  the doctors impulsive nature rose in revolt against the merciless brevity and gracelessness of that reply i wish to god he broke out fervently i knew english enough to take your place at mr armadales bedside  bating your taking the name of the almighty in vain answered the scotchman i entirely agree with you i wish you did  without another word on either side they left the room togetherthe doctor leading the way     iii the wreck of the timber ship  no one answered the doctors knock when he and his companion reached the antechamber door of mr armadales apartments they entered unannounced and when they looked into the sittingroom the sittingroom was empty  i must see mrs armadale said mr neal i decline acting in the matter unless mrs armadale authorizes my interference with her own lips  mrs armadale is probably with her husband replied the doctor he approached a door at the inner end of the sittingroom while he spokehesitatedand turning round again looked at his sour companion anxiously i am afraid i spoke a little harshly sir when we were leaving your room he said i beg your pardon for it with all my heart before this poor afflicted lady comes in will youwill you excuse my asking your utmost gentleness and consideration for her  no sir retorted the other harshly i wont excuse you what right have i given you to think me wanting in gentleness and consideration toward anybody  the doctor saw it was useless i beg your pardon again he said resignedly and left the unapproachable stranger to himself  mr neal walked to the window and stood there with his eyes mechanically fixed on the prospect composing his mind for the coming interview  it was midday the sun shone bright and warm and all the little world of wildbad was alive and merry in the genial springtime now and again heavy wagons with blackfaced carters in charge rolled by the window bearing their precious lading of charcoal from the forest now and again hurled over the headlong current of the stream that runs through the town great lengths of timber loosely strung together in interminable serieswith the booted raftsmen pole in hand poised watchful at either endshot swift and serpentlike past the houses on their course to the distant rhine high and steep above the gabled wooden buildings on the riverbank the great hillsides crested black with firs shone to the shining heavens in a glory of lustrous green in and out where the forest footpaths wound from the grass through the trees from the trees over the grass the bright spring dresses of women and children on the search for wild flowers traveled to and fro in the lofty distance like spots of moving light below on the walk by the stream side the booths of the little bazar that had opened punctually with the opening season showed all their glittering trinkets and fluttered in the balmy air their splendor of manycolored flags longingly here the children looked at the show patiently the sunburned lasses plied their knitting as they paced the walk courteously the passing townspeople by fours and fives and the passing visitors by ones and twos greeted each other hat in hand and slowly slowly the cripple and the helpless in their chairs on wheels came out in the cheerful noontide with the rest and took their share of the blessed light that cheers of the blessed sun that shines for all  on this scene the scotchman looked with eyes that never noted its beauty with a mind far away from every lesson that it taught one by one he meditated the words he should say when the wife came in one by one he pondered over the conditions he might impose before he took the pen in hand at the husbands bedside  mrs armadale is here said the doctors voice interposing suddenly between his reflections and himself  he turned on the instant and saw before him with the pure midday light shining full on her a woman of the mixed blood of the european and the african race with the northern delicacy in the shape of her face and the southern richness in its colora woman in the prime of her beauty who moved with an inbred grace who looked with an inbred fascination whose large languid black eyes rested on him gratefully whose little dusky hand offered itself to him in mute expression of her thanks with the welcome that is given to the coming of a friend for the first time in his life the scotchman was taken by surprise every selfpreservative word that he had been meditating but an instant since dropped out of his memory his thrice impenetrable armor of habitual suspicion habitual selfdiscipline and habitual reserve which had never fallen from him in a womans presence before fell from him in this womans presence and brought him to his knees a conquered man he took the hand she offered him and bowed over it his first honest homage to the sex in silence  she hesitated on her side the quick feminine perception which in happier circumstances would have pounced on the secret of his embarrassment in an instant failed her now she attributed his strange reception of her to pride to reluctanceto any cause but the unexpected revelation of her own beauty i have no words to thank you she said faintly trying to propitiate him i should only distress you if i tried to speak her lip began to tremble she drew back a little and turned away her head in silence  the doctor who had been standing apart quietly observant in a corner advanced before mr neal could interfere and led mrs armadale to a chair dont be afraid of him whispered the good man patting her gently on the shoulder he was hard as iron in my hands but i think by the look of him he will be soft as wax in yours say the words i told you to say and let us take him to your husbands room before those sharp wits of his have time to recover themselves  she roused her sinking resolution and advanced halfway to the window to meet mr neal my kind friend the doctor has told me sir that your only hesitation in coming here is a hesitation on my account she said her head drooping a little and her rich color fading away while she spoke i am deeply grateful but i entreat you not to think of me what my husband wishes her voice faltered she waited resolutely and recovered herself what my husband wishes in his last moments i wish too  this time mr neal was composed enough to answer her in low earnest tones he entreated her to say no more i was only anxious to show you every consideration he said i am only anxious now to spare you every distress as he spoke something like a glow of color rose slowly on his sallow face her eyes were looking at him softly attentive and he thought guiltily of his meditations at the window before she came in  the doctor saw his opportunity he opened the door that led into mr armadales room and stood by it waiting silently mrs armadale entered first in a minute more the door was closed again and mr neal stood committed to the responsibility that had been forced on himcommitted beyond recall  the room was decorated in the gaudy continental fashion and the warm sunlight was shining in joyously cupids and flowers were painted on the ceiling bright ribbons looped up the white windowcurtains a smart gilt clock ticked on a velvetcovered mantelpiece mirrors gleamed on the walls and flowers in all the colors of the rainbow speckled the carpet in the midst of the finery and the glitter and the light lay the paralyzed man with his wandering eyes and his lifeless lower facehis head propped high with many pillows his helpless hands laid out over the bedclothes like the hands of a corpse by the bed head stood grim and old and silent the shriveled black nurse and on the counterpane between his fathers outspread hands lay the child in his little white frock absorbed in the enjoyment of a new toy when the door opened and mrs armadale led the way in the boy was tossing his playthinga soldier on horsebackbackward and forward over the helpless hands on either side of him and the fathers wandering eyes were following the toy to and fro with a stealthy and ceaseless vigilancea vigilance as of a wild animal terrible to see  the moment mr neal appeared in the doorway those restless eyes stopped looked up and fastened on the stranger with a fierce eagerness of inquiry slowly the motionless lips struggled into movement with thick hesitating articulation they put the question which the eyes asked mutely into words are you the man  mr neal advanced to the bedside mrs armadale drawing back from it as he approached and waiting with the doctor at the further end of the room the child looked up toy in hand as the stranger came near opened his bright brown eyes in momentary astonishment and then went on with his game  i have been made acquainted with your sad situation sir said mr neal and i have come here to place my services at your disposalservices which no one but myself as your medical attendant informs me is in a position to render you in this strange place my name is neal i am a writer to the signet in edinburgh and i may presume to say for myself that any confidence you wish to place in me will be confidence not improperly bestowed  the eyes of the beautiful wife were not confusing him now he spoke to the helpless husband quietly and seriously without his customary harshness and with a grave compassion in his manner which presented him at his best the sight of the deathbed had steadied him  you wish me to write something for you he resumed after waiting for a reply and waiting in vain  yes said the dying man with the allmastering impatience which his tongue was powerless to express glittering angrily in his eye my hand is gone and my speech is going write  before there was time to speak again mr neal heard the rustling of a womans dress and the quick creaking of casters on the carpet behind him mrs armadale was moving the writingtable across the room to the foot of the bed if he was to set up those safeguards of his own devising that were to bear him harmless through all results to come now was the time or never he kept his back turned on mrs armadale and put his precautionary question at once in the plainest terms  may i ask sir before i take the pen in hand what it is you wish me to write  the angry eyes of the paralyzed man glittered brighter and brighter his lips opened and closed again he made no reply  mr neal tried another precautionary question in a new direction  when i have written what you wish me to write he asked what is to be done with it  this time the answer came  seal it up in my presence and post it to my ex  his laboring articulation suddenly stopped and he looked piteously in the questioners face for the next word  do you mean your executor  yes  it is a letter i suppose that i am to post there was no answer may i ask if it is a letter altering your will  nothing of the sort  mr neal considered a little the mystery was thickening the one way out of it so far was the way traced faintly through that strange story of the unfinished letter which the doctor had repeated to him in mrs armadales words the nearer he approached his unknown responsibility the more ominous it seemed of something serious to come should he risk another question before he pledged himself irrevocably as the doubt crossed his mind he felt mrs armadales silk dress touch him on the side furthest from her husband her delicate dark hand was laid gently on his arm her full deep african eyes looked at him in submissive entreaty my husband is very anxious she whispered will you quiet his anxiety sir by taking your place at the writingtable  it was from her lips that the request camefrom the lips of the person who had the best right to hesitate the wife who was excluded from the secret most men in mr neals position would have given up all their safeguards on the spot the scotchman gave them all up but one  i will write what you wish me to write he said addressing mr armadale i will seal it in your presence and i will post it to your executor myself but in engaging to do this i must beg you to remember that i am acting entirely in the dark and i must ask you to excuse me if i reserve my own entire freedom of action when your wishes in relation to the writing and the posting of the letter have been fulfilled  do you give me your promise  if you want my promise sir i will give itsubject to the condition i have just named  take your condition and keep your promise my desk he added looking at his wife for the first time  she crossed the room eagerly to fetch the desk from a chair in a corner returning with it she made a passing sign to the negress who still stood grim and silent in the place that she had occupied from the first the woman advanced obedient to the sign to take the child from the bed at the instant when she touched him the fathers eyesfixed previously on the deskturned on her with the stealthy quickness of a cat no he said no echoed the fresh voice of the boy still charmed with his plaything and still liking his place on the bed the negress left the room and the child in high triumph trotted his toy soldier up and down on the bedclothes that lay rumpled over his fathers breast his mothers lovely face contracted with a pang of jealousy as she looked at him  shall i open your desk she asked pushing back the childs plaything sharply while she spoke an answering look from her husband guided her hand to the place under his pillow where the key was hidden she opened the desk and disclosed inside some small sheets of manuscript pinned together these she inquired producing them  yes he said you can go now  the scotchman sitting at the writingtable the doctor stirring a stimulant mixture in a corner looked at each other with an anxiety in both their faces which they could neither of them control the words that banished the wife from the room were spoken the moment had come  you can go now said mr armadale for the second time  she looked at the child established comfortably on the bed and an ashy paleness spread slowly over her face she looked at the fatal letter which was a sealed secret to her and a torture of jealous suspicionsuspicion of that other woman who had been the shadow and the poison of her lifewrung her to the heart after moving a few steps from the bedside she stopped and came back again armed with the double courage of her love and her despair she pressed her lips on her dying husbands cheek and pleaded with him for the last time her burning tears dropped on his face as she whispered to him oh allan think how i have loved you think how hard i have tried to make you happy think how soon i shall lose you oh my own love dont dont send me away  the words pleaded for her the kiss pleaded for her the recollection of the love that had been given to him and never returned touched the heart of the fastsinking man as nothing had touched it since the day of his marriage a heavy sigh broke from him he looked at her and hesitated  let me stay she whispered pressing her face closer to his  it will only distress you he whispered back  nothing distresses me but being sent away from you  he waited she saw that he was thinking and waited too  if i let you stay a little  yes yes  will you go when i tell you  i will  on your oath  the fetters that bound his tongue seemed to be loosened for a moment in the great outburst of anxiety which forced that question to his lips he spoke those startling words as he had spoken no words yet  on my oath she repeated and dropping on her knees at the bedside passionately kissed his hand the two strangers in the room turned their heads away by common consent in the silence that followed the one sound stirring was the small sound of the childs toy as he moved it hither and thither on the bed  the doctor was the first who broke the spell of stillness which had fallen on all the persons present he approached the patient and examined him anxiously mrs armadale rose from her knees and first waiting for her husbands permission carried the sheets of manuscript which she had taken out of the desk to the table at which mr neal was waiting flushed and eager more beautiful than ever in the vehement agitation which still possessed her she stooped over him as she put the letter into his hands and seizing on the means to her end with a womans headlong selfabandonment to her own impulses whispered to him read it out from the beginning i must and will hear it her eyes flashed their burning light into his her breath beat on his cheek before he could answer before he could think she was back with her husband in an instant she had spoken and in that instant her beauty had bent the scotchman to her will frowning in reluctant acknowledgment of his own inability to resist her he turned over the leaves of the letter looked at the blank place where the pen had dropped from the writers hand and had left a blot on the paper turned back again to the beginning and said the words in the wifes interest which the wife herself had put into his lips  perhaps sir you may wish to make some corrections he began with all his attention apparently fixed on the letter and with every outward appearance of letting his sour temper again get the better of him shall i read over to you what you have already written  mrs armadale sitting at the bed head on one side and the doctor with his fingers on the patients pulse sitting on the other waited with widely different anxieties for the answer to mr neals question mr armadales eyes turned searchingly from his child to his wife  you will hear it he said her breath came and went quickly her hand stole up and took his she bowed her head in silence her husband paused taking secret counsel with his thoughts and keeping his eyes fixed on his wife at last he decided and gave the answer read it he said and stop when i tell you  it was close on one oclock and the bell was ringing which summoned the visitors to their early dinner at the inn the quick beat of footsteps and the gathering hum of voices outside penetrated gayly into the room as mr neal spread the manuscript before him on the table and read the opening sentences in these words   i address this letter to my son when my son is of an age to understand it having lost all hope of living to see my boy grow up to manhood i have no choice but to write here what i would fain have said to him at a future time with my own lips  i have three objects in writing first to reveal the circumstances which attended the marriage of an english lady of my acquaintance in the island of madeira secondly to throw the true light on the death of her husband a short time afterward on board the french timber ship la grace de dieu thirdly to warn my son of a danger that lies in wait for hima danger that will rise from his fathers grave when the earth has closed over his fathers ashes  the story of the english ladys marriage begins with my inheriting the great armadale property and my taking the fatal armadale name  i am the only surviving son of the late mathew wrentmore of barbadoes i was born on our family estate in that island and i lost my father when i was still a child my mother was blindly fond of me she denied me nothing she let me live as i pleased my boyhood and youth were passed in idleness and selfindulgence among peopleslaves and halfcastes mostlyto whom my will was law i doubt if there is a gentleman of my birth and station in all england as ignorant as i am at this moment i doubt if there was ever a young man in this world whose passions were left so entirely without control of any kind as mine were in those early days  my mother had a womans romantic objection to my fathers homely christian name i was christened allan after the name of a wealthy cousin of my fathersthe late allan armadalewho possessed estates in our neighborhood the largest and most productive in the island and who consented to be my godfather by proxy mr armadale had never seen his west indian property he lived in england and after sending me the customary godfathers present he held no further communication with my parents for years afterward i was just twentyone before we heard again from mr armadale on that occasion my mother received a letter from him asking if i was still alive and offering no less if i was than to make me the heir to his west indian property  this piece of good fortune fell to me entirely through the misconduct of mr armadales son an only child the young man had disgraced himself beyond all redemption had left his home an outlaw and had been thereupon renounced by his father at once and forever having no other near male relative to succeed him mr armadale thought of his cousins son and his own godson and he offered the west indian estate to me and my heirs after me on one conditionthat i and my heirs should take his name the proposal was gratefully accepted and the proper legal measures were adopted for changing my name in the colony and in the mother country by the next mail information reached mr armadale that his condition had been complied with the return mail brought news from the lawyers the will had been altered in my favor and in a week afterward the death of my benefactor had made me the largest proprietor and the richest man in barbadoes  this was the first event in the chain the second event followed it six weeks afterward  at that time there happened to be a vacancy in the clerks office on the estate and there came to fill it a young man about my own age who had recently arrived in the island he announced himself by the name of fergus ingleby my impulses governed me in everything i knew no law but the law of my own caprice and i took a fancy to the stranger the moment i set eyes on him he had the manners of a gentleman and he possessed the most attractive social qualities which in my small experience i had ever met with when i heard that the written references to character which he had brought with him were pronounced to be unsatisfactory i interfered and insisted that he should have the place my will was law and he had it  my mother disliked and distrusted ingleby from the first when she found the intimacy between us rapidly ripening when she found me admitting this inferior to the closest companionship and confidence i had lived with my inferiors all my life and i liked it she made effort after effort to part us and failed in one and all driven to her last resources she resolved to try the one chance leftthe chance of persuading me to take a voyage which i had often thought ofa voyage to england  before she spoke to me on the subject she resolved to interest me in the idea of seeing england as i had never been interested yet she wrote to an old friend and an old admirer of hers the late stephen blanchard of thorpe ambrose in norfolka gentleman of landed estate and a widower with a grownup family afterdiscoveries informed me that she must have alluded to their former attachment which was checked i believe by the parents on either side and that in asking mr blanchards welcome for her son when he came to england she made inquiries about his daughter which hinted at the chance of a marriage uniting the two families if the young lady and i met and liked one another we were equally matched in every respect and my mothers recollection of her girlish attachment to mr blanchard made the prospect of my marrying her old admirers daughter the brightest and happiest prospect that her eyes could see of all this i knew nothing until mr blanchards answer arrived at barbadoes then my mother showed me the letter and put the temptation which was to separate me from fergus ingleby openly in my way  mr blanchards letter was dated from the island of madeira he was out of health and he had been ordered there by the doctors to try the climate his daughter was with him after heartily reciprocating all my mothers hopes and wishes he proposed if i intended leaving barbadoes shortly that i should take madeira on my way to england and pay him a visit at his temporary residence in the island if this could not be he mentioned the time at which he expected to be back in england when i might be sure of finding a welcome at his own house of thorpe ambrose in conclusion he apologized for not writing at greater length explaining that his sight was affected and that he had disobeyed the doctors orders by yielding to the temptation of writing to his old friend with his own hand  kindly as it was expressed the letter itself might have had little influence on me but there was something else besides the letter there was inclosed in it a miniature portrait of miss blanchard at the back of the portrait her father had written halfjestingly halftenderly i cant ask my daughter to spare my eyes as usual without telling her of your inquiries and putting a young ladys diffidence to the blush so i send her in effigy without her knowledge to answer for herself it is a good likeness of a good girl if she likes your sonand if i like him which i am sure i shallwe may yet live my good friend to see our children what we might once have been ourselvesman and wife my mother gave me the miniature with the letter the portrait at once struck mei cant say why i cant say howas nothing of the kind had ever struck me before  harder intellects than mine might have attributed the extraordinary impression produced on me to the disordered condition of my mind at that time to the weariness of my own base pleasures which had been gaining on me for months past to the undefined longing which that weariness implied for newer interests and fresher hopes than any that had possessed me yet i attempted no such sober selfexamination as this i believed in destiny then i believe in destiny now it was enough for me to knowas i did knowthat the first sense i had ever felt of something better in my nature than my animal self was roused by that girls face looking at me from her picture as no womans face had ever looked at me yet in those tender eyesin the chance of making that gentle creature my wifei saw my destiny written the portrait which had come into my hands so strangely and so unexpectedly was the silent messenger of happiness close at hand sent to warn to encourage to rouse me before it was too late i put the miniature under my pillow at night i looked at it again the next morning my conviction of the day before remained as strong as ever my superstition if you please to call it so pointed out to me irresistibly the way on which i should go there was a ship in port which was to sail for england in a fortnight touching at madeira in that ship i took my passage   thus far the reader had advanced with no interruption to disturb him but at the last words the tones of another voice low and broken mingled with his own  was she a fair woman asked the voice or dark like me  mr neal paused and looked up the doctor was still at the bed head with his fingers mechanically on the patients pulse the child missing his midday sleep was beginning to play languidly with his new toy the fathers eyes were watching him with a rapt and ceaseless attention but one great change was visible in the listeners since the narrative had begun mrs armadale had dropped her hold of her husbands hand and sat with her face steadily turned away from him the hot african blood burned red in her dusky cheeks as she obstinately repeated the question was she a fair woman or dark like me  fair said her husband without looking at her  her hands lying clasped together in her lap wrung each other hardshe said no more mr neals overhanging eyebrows lowered ominously as he returned to the narrative he had incurred his own severe displeasurehe had caught himself in the act of secretly pitying her   i have saidthe letter proceededthat ingleby was admitted to my closest confidence i was sorry to leave him and i was distressed by his evident surprise and mortification when he heard that i was going away in my own justification i showed him the letter and the likeness and told him the truth his interest in the portrait seemed to be hardly inferior to my own he asked me about miss blanchards family and miss blanchards fortune with the sympathy of a true friend and he strengthened my regard for him and my belief in him by putting himself out of the question and by generously encouraging me to persist in my new purpose when we parted i was in high health and spirits before we met again the next day i was suddenly struck by an illness which threatened both my reason and my life  i have no proof against ingleby there was more than one woman on the island whom i had wronged beyond all forgiveness and whose vengeance might well have reached me at that time i can accuse nobody i can only say that my life was saved by my old black nurse and that the woman afterward acknowledged having used the known negro antidote to a known negro poison in those parts when my first days of convalescence came the ship in which my passage had been taken had long since sailed when i asked for ingleby he was gone proofs of his unpardonable misconduct in his situation were placed before me which not even my partiality for him could resist he had been turned out of the office in the first days of my illness and nothing more was known of him but that he had left the island  all through my sufferings the portrait had been under my pillow all through my convalescence it was my one consolation when i remembered the past and my one encouragement when i thought of the future no words can describe the hold that first fancy had now taken of mewith time and solitude and suffering to help it my mother with all her interest in the match was startled by the unexpected success of her own project she had written to tell mr blanchard of my illness but had received no reply she now offered to write again if i would promise not to leave her before my recovery was complete my impatience acknowledged no restraint another ship in port gave me another chance of leaving for madeira another examination of mr blanchards letter of invitation assured me that i should find him still in the island if i seized my opportunity on the spot in defiance of my mothers entreaties i insisted on taking my passage in the second shipand this time when the ship sailed i was on board  the change did me good the seaair made a man of me again after an unusually rapid voyage i found myself at the end of my pilgrimage on a fine still evening which i can never forget i stood alone on the shore with her likeness in my bosom and saw the white walls of the house where i knew that she lived  i strolled round the outer limits of the grounds to compose myself before i went in venturing through a gate and a shrubbery i looked into the garden and saw a lady there loitering alone on the lawn she turned her face toward meand i beheld the original of my portrait the fulfillment of my dream it is useless and worse than useless to write of it now let me only say that every promise which the likeness had made to my fancy the living woman kept to my eyes in the moment when they first looked on her let me say thisand no more  i was too violently agitated to trust myself in her presence i drew back undiscovered and making my way to the front door of the house asked for her father first mr blanchard had retired to his room and could see nobody upon that i took courage and asked for miss blanchard the servant smiled my young lady is not miss blanchard any longer sir he said she is married those words would have struck some men in my position to the earth they fired my hot blood and i seized the servant by the throat in a frenzy of rage its a lie i broke out speaking to him as if he had been one of the slaves on my own estate its the truth said the man struggling with me her husband is in the house at this moment who is he you scoundrelthe servant answered by repeating my own name to my own face allan armadale  you can now guess the truth fergus ingleby was the outlawed son whose name and whose inheritance i had taken and fergus ingleby was even with me for depriving him of his birthright  some account of the manner in which the deception had been carried out is necessary to explaini dont say to justifythe share i took in the events that followed my arrival at madeira  by inglebys own confession he had come to barbadoesknowing of his fathers death and of my succession to the estateswith the settled purpose of plundering and injuring me my rash confidence put such an opportunity into his hands as he could never have hoped for he had waited to possess himself of the letter which my mother wrote to mr blanchard at the outset of my illnesshad then caused his own dismissal from his situationand had sailed for madeira in the very ship that was to have sailed with me arrived at the island he had waited again till the vessel was away once more on her voyage and had then presented himself at mr blanchardsnot in the assumed name by which i shall continue to speak of him here but in the name which was as certainly his as mine allan armadale the fraud at the outset presented few difficulties he had only an ailing old man who had not seen my mother for half a lifetime and an innocent unsuspicious girl who had never seen her at all to deal with and he had learned enough in my service to answer the few questions that were put to him as readily as i might have answered them myself his looks and manners his winning ways with women his quickness and cunning did the rest while i was still on my sickbed he had won miss blanchards affections while i was dreaming over the likeness in the first days of my convalescence he had secured mr blanchards consent to the celebration of the marriage before he and his daughter left the island  thus far mr blanchards infirmity of sight had helped the deception he had been content to send messages to my mother and to receive the messages which were duly invented in return but when the suitor was accepted and the weddingday was appointed he felt it due to his old friend to write to her asking her formal consent and inviting her to the marriage he could only complete part of the letter himself the rest was finished under his dictation by miss blanchard there was no chance of being beforehand with the postoffice this time and ingleby sure of his place in the heart of his victim waylaid her as she came out of her fathers room with the letter and privately told her the truth she was still under age and the position was a serious one if the letter was posted no resource would be left but to wait and be parted forever or to elope under circumstances which made detection almost a certainty the destination of any ship which took them away would be known beforehand and the fastsailing yacht in which mr blanchard had come to madeira was waiting in the harbor to take him back to england the only other alternative was to continue the deception by suppressing the letter and to confess the truth when they were securely married what arts of persuasion ingleby usedwhat base advantage he might previously have taken of her love and her trust in him to degrade miss blanchard to his own leveli cannot say he did degrade her the letter never went to its destination and with the daughters privity and consent the fathers confidence was abused to the very last  the one precaution now left to take was to fabricate the answer from my mother which mr blanchard expected and which would arrive in due course of post before the day appointed for the marriage ingleby had my mothers stolen letter with him but he was without the imitative dexterity which would have enabled him to make use of it for a forgery of her handwriting miss blanchard who had consented passively to the deception refused to take any active share in the fraud practiced on her father in this difficulty ingleby found an instrument ready to his hand in an orphan girl of barely twelve years old a marvel of precocious ability whom miss blanchard had taken a romantic fancy to befriend and whom she had brought away with her from england to be trained as her maid that girls wicked dexterity removed the one serious obstacle left to the success of the fraud i saw the imitation of my mothers writing which she had produced under inglebys instructions and if the shameful truth must be told with her young mistresss knowledgeand i believe i should have been deceived by it myself i saw the girl afterwardand my blood curdled at the sight of her if she is alive now woe to the people who trust her no creature more innately deceitful and more innately pitiless ever walked this earth  the forged letter paved the way securely for the marriage and when i reached the house they were as the servant had truly told me man and wife my arrival on the scene simply precipitated the confession which they had both agreed to make inglebys own lips shamelessly acknowledged the truth he had nothing to lose by speaking outhe was married and his wifes fortune was beyond her fathers control i pass over all that followedmy interview with the daughter and my interview with the fatherto come to results for two days the efforts of the wife and the efforts of the clergyman who had celebrated the marriage were successful in keeping ingleby and myself apart on the third day i set my trap more successfully and i and the man who had mortally injured me met together alone face to face  remember how my confidence had been abused remember how the one good purpose of my life had been thwarted remember the violent passions rooted deep in my nature and never yet controlledand then imagine for yourself what passed between us all i need tell here is the end he was a taller and a stronger man than i and he took his brutes advantage with a brutes ferocity he struck me  think of the injuries i had received at that mans hands and then think of his setting his mark on my face by a blow  i went to an english officer who had been my fellowpassenger on the voyage from barbadoes i told him the truth and he agreed with me that a meeting was inevitable dueling had its received formalities and its established laws in those days and he began to speak of them i stopped him i will take a pistol in my right hand i said and he shall take a pistol in his i will take one end of a handkerchief in my left hand and he shall take the other end in his and across that handkerchief the duel shall be fought the officer got up and looked at me as if i had personally insulted him you are asking me to be present at a murder and a suicide he said i decline to serve you he left the room as soon as he was gone i wrote down the words i had said to the officer and sent them by a messenger to ingleby while i was waiting for an answer i sat down before the glass and looked at his mark on my face many a man has had blood on his hands and blood on his conscience i thought for less than this  the messenger came back with inglebys answer it appointed a meeting for three oclock the next day at a lonely place in the interior of the island i had resolved what to do if he refused his letter released me from the horror of my own resolution i felt grateful to himyes absolutely grateful to himfor writing it  the next day i went to the place he was not there i waited two hours and he never came at last the truth dawned on me once a coward always a coward i thought i went back to mr blanchards house before i got there a sudden misgiving seized me and i turned aside to the harbor i was right the harbor was the place to go to a ship sailing for lisbon that afternoon had offered him the opportunity of taking a passage for himself and his wife and escaping me his answer to my challenge had served its purpose of sending me out of the way into the interior of the island once more i had trusted in fergus ingleby and once more those sharp wits of his had been too much for me  i asked my informant if mr blanchard was aware as yet of his daughters departure he had discovered it but not until the ship had sailed this time i took a lesson in cunning from ingleby instead of showing myself at mr blanchards house i went first and looked at mr blanchards yacht  the vessel told me what the vessels master might have concealedthe truth i found her in the confusion of a sudden preparation for sea all the crew were on board with the exception of some few who had been allowed their leave on shore and who were away in the interior of the island nobody knew where when i discovered that the sailingmaster was trying in to supply their places with the best men he could pick up at a moments notice my resolution was instantly taken i knew the duties on board a yacht well enough having had a vessel of my own and having sailed her myself hurrying into the town i changed my dress for a sailors coat and hat and returning to the harbor i offered myself as one of the volunteer crew i dont know what the sailingmaster saw in my face my answers to his questions satisfied him and yet he looked at me and hesitated but hands were scarce and it ended in my being taken on board an hour later mr blanchard joined us and was assisted into the cabin suffering pitiably in mind and body both an hour after that we were at sea with a starless night overhead and a fresh breeze behind us  as i had surmised we were in pursuit of the vessel in which ingleby and his wife had left the island that afternoon the ship was french and was employed in the timber trade her name was la grace de dieu nothing more was known of her than that she was bound for lisbon that she had been driven out of her course and that she had touched at madeira short of men and short of provisions the last want had been supplied but not the first sailors distrusted the seaworthiness of the ship and disliked the look of the vagabond crew when those two serious facts had been communicated to mr blanchard the hard words he had spoken to his child in the first shock of discovering that she had helped to deceive him smote him to the heart he instantly determined to give his daughter a refuge on board his own vessel and to quiet her by keeping her villain of a husband out of the way of all harm at my hands the yacht sailed three feet and more to the ships one there was no doubt of our overtaking la grace de dieu the only fear was that we might pass her in the darkness  after we had been some little time out the wind suddenly dropped and there fell on us an airless sultry calm when the order came to get the topmasts on deck and to shift the large sails we all knew what to expect in little better than an hour more the storm was upon us the thunder was pealing over our heads and the yacht was running for it she was a powerful schoonerrigged vessel of three hundred tons as strong as wood and iron could make her she was handled by a sailingmaster who thoroughly understood his work and she behaved nobly as the new morning came the fury of the wind blowing still from the southwest quarter subsided a little and the sea was less heavy just before daybreak we heard faintly through the howling of the gale the report of a gun the men collected anxiously on deck looked at each other and said there she is  with the daybreak we saw the vessel and the timbership it was she lay wallowing in the trough of the sea her foremast and her mainmast both gonea waterlogged wreck the yacht carried three boats one amidships and two slung to davits on the quarters and the sailingmaster seeing signs of the storm renewing its fury before long determined on lowering the quarterboats while the lull lasted few as the people were on board the wreck they were too many for one boat and the risk of trying two boats at once was thought less in the critical state of the weather than the risk of making two separate trips from the yacht to the ship there might be time to make one trip in safety but no man could look at the heavens and say there would be time enough for two  the boats were manned by volunteers from the crew i being in the second of the two when the first boat was got alongside of the timbershipa service of difficulty and danger which no words can describeall the men on board made a rash to leave the wreck together if the boat had not been pulled off again before the whole of them had crowded in the lives of all must have been sacrificed as our boat approached the vessel in its turn we arranged that four of us should get on boardtwo i being one of them to see to the safety of mr blanchards daughter and two to beat back the cowardly remnant of the crew if they tried to crowd in first the other threethe coxswain and two oarsmenwere left in the boat to keep her from being crushed by the ship what the others saw when they first boarded la grace de dieu i dont know what i saw was the woman whom i had lost the woman vilely stolen from me lying in a swoon on the deck we lowered her insensible into the boat the remnant of the crewfive in numberwere compelled by main force to follow her in an orderly manner one by one and minute by minute as the chance offered for safely taking them in i was the last who left and at the next roll of the ship toward us the empty length of the deck without a living creature on it from stem to stern told the boats crew that their work was done with the louder and louder howling of the fastrising tempest to warn them they rowed for their lives back to the yacht  a succession of heavy squalls had brought round the course of the new storm that was coming from the south to the north and the sailingmaster watching his opportunity had wore the yacht to be ready for it before the last of our men had got on board again it burst on us with the fury of a hurricane our boat was swamped but not a life was lost once more we ran before it due south at the mercy of the wind i was on deck with the rest watching the one rag of sail we could venture to set and waiting to supply its place with another if it blew out of the boltropes when the mate came close to me and shouted in my ear through the thunder of the storm she has come to her senses in the cabin and has asked for her husband where is he not a man on board knew the yacht was searched from one end to another without finding him the men were mustered in defiance of the weatherhe was not among them the crews of the two boats were questioned all the first crew could say was that they had pulled away from the wreck when the rush into their boat took place and that they knew nothing of whom they let in or whom they kept out all the second crew could say was that they had brought back to the yacht every living soul left by the first boat on the deck of the timbership there was no blaming anybody but at the same time there was no resisting the fact that the man was missing  all through that day the storm raging unabatedly never gave us even the shadow of a chance of returning and searching the wreck the one hope for the yacht was to scud toward evening the gale after having carried us to the southward of madeira began at last to breakthe wind shifted againand allowed us to bear up for the island early the next morning we got back into port mr blanchard and his daughter were taken ashore the sailingmaster accompanying them and warning us that he should have something to say on his return which would nearly concern the whole crew  we were mustered on deck and addressed by the sailingmaster as soon as he came on board again he had mr blanchards orders to go back at once to the timbership and to search for the missing man we were bound to do this for his sake and for the sake of his wife whose reason was despaired of by the doctors if something was not done to quiet her we might be almost sure of finding the vessel still afloat for her ladling of timber would keep her above water as long as her hull held together if the man was on boardliving or deadhe must be found and brought back and if the weather continued to be moderate there was no reason why the men with proper assistance should not bring the ship back too and their master being quite willing earn their share of the salvage with the officers of the yacht  upon this the crew gave three cheers and set to work forthwith to get the schooner to sea again i was the only one of them who drew back from the enterprise i told them the storm had upset mei was ill and wanted rest they all looked me in the face as i passed through them on my way out of the yacht but not a man of them spoke to me  i waited through that day at a tavern on the port for the first news from the wreck it was brought toward nightfall by one of the pilotboats which had taken part in the enterprisea successful enterprise as the event provedfor saving the abandoned ship la grace de dieu had been discovered still floating and the body of ingleby had been found on board drowned in the cabin at dawn the next morning the dead man was brought back by the yacht and on the same day the funeral took place in the protestant cemetery   stop said the voice from the bed before the reader could turn to a new leaf and begin the next paragraph  there was a change in the room and there were changes in the audience since mr neal had last looked up from the narrative a ray of sunshine was crossing the deathbed and the child overcome by drowsiness lay peacefully asleep in the golden light the fathers countenance had altered visibly forced into action by the tortured mind the muscles of the lower face which had never moved yet were moving distortedly now warned by the damps gathering heavily on his forehead the doctor had risen to revive the sinking man on the other side of the bed the wifes chair stood empty at the moment when her husband had interrupted the reading she had drawn back behind the bed head out of his sight supporting herself against the wall she stood there in hiding her eyes fastened in hungering suspense on the manuscript in mr neals hand  in a minute more the silence was broken again by mr armadale  where is she he asked looking angrily at his wifes empty chair the doctor pointed to the place she had no choice but to come forward she came slowly and stood before him  you promised to go when i told you he said go now  mr neal tried hard to control his hand as it kept his place between the leaves of the manuscripts but it trembled in spite of him a suspicion which had been slowly forcing itself on his mind while he was reading became a certainty when he heard those words from one revelation to another the letter had gone on until it had now reached the brink of a last disclosure to come at that brink the dying man had predetermined to silence the readers voice before he had permitted his wife to hear the narrative read there was the secret which the son was to know in after years and which the mother was never to approach from that resolution his wifes tenderest pleadings had never moved him an inchand now from his own lips his wife knew it  she made him no answer she stood there and looked at him looked her last entreatyperhaps her last farewell his eyes gave her back no answering glance they wandered from her mercilessly to the sleeping boy she turned speechless from the bed without a look at the childwithout a word to the two strangers breathlessly watching hershe kept the promise she had given and in dead silence left the room  there was something in the manner of her departure which shook the selfpossession of both the men who witnessed it when the door closed on her they recoiled instinctively from advancing further in the dark the doctors reluctance was the first to express itself he attempted to obtain the patients permission to withdraw until the letter was completed the patient refused  mr neal spoke next at greater length and to more serious purpose  the doctor is accustomed in his profession he began and i am accustomed in mine to have the secrets of others placed in our keeping but it is my duty before we go further to ask if you really understand the extraordinary position which we now occupy toward one another you have just excluded mrs armadale before our own eyes from a place in your confidence and you are now offering that same place to two men who are total strangers to you  yes said mr armadale because you are strangers  few as the words were the inference to be drawn from them was not of a nature to set distrust at rest mr neal put it plainly into words  you are in urgent need of my help and of the doctors help he said am i to understand so long as you secure our assistance that the impression which the closing passages of this letter may produce on us is a matter of indifference to you  yes i dont spare you i dont spare myself i do spare my wife  you force me to a conclusion sir which is a very serious one said mr neal if i am to finish this letter under your dictation i must claim permissionhaving read aloud the greater part of it alreadyto read aloud what remains in the hearing of this gentleman as a witness  read it  gravely doubting the doctor resumed his chair gravely doubting mr neal turned the leaf and read the next words   there is more to tell before i can leave the dead man to his rest i have described the finding of his body but i have not described the circumstances under which he met his death  he was known to have been on deck when the yachts boats were seen approaching the wreck and he was afterward missed in the confusion caused by the panic of the crew at that time the water was five feet deep in the cabin and was rising fast there was little doubt of his having gone down into that water of his own accord the discovery of his wifes jewel box close under him on the floor explained his presence in the cabin he was known to have seen help approaching and it was quite likely that he had thereupon gone below to make an effort at saving the box it was less probablethough it might still have been inferredthat his death was the result of some accident in diving which had for the moment deprived him of his senses but a discovery made by the yachts crew pointed straight to a conclusion which struck the men one and all with the same horror when the course of their search brought them to the cabin they found the scuttle bolted and the door locked on the outside had some one closed the cabin not knowing he was there setting the panicstricken condition of the crew out of the question there was no motive for closing the cabin before leaving the wreck but one other conclusion remained had some murderous hand purposely locked the man in and left him to drown as the water rose over him  yes a murderous hand had locked him in and left him to drown that hand was mine   the scotchman started up from the table the doctor shrank from the bedside the two looked at the dying wretch mastered by the same loathing chilled by the same dread he lay there with his childs head on his breast abandoned by the sympathies of man accursed by the justice of godhe lay there in the isolation of cain and looked back at them  at the moment when the two men rose to their feet the door leading into the next room was shaken heavily on the outer side and a sound like the sound of a fall striking dull on their ears silenced them both standing nearest to the door the doctor opened it passed through and closed it instantly mr neal turned his back on the bed and waited the event in silence the sound which had failed to awaken the child had failed also to attract the fathers notice his own words had taken him far from all that was passing at his deathbed his helpless body was back on the wreck and the ghost of his lifeless hand was turning the lock of the cabin door  a bell rang in the next roomeager voices talked hurried footsteps moved in itan interval passed and the doctor returned was she listening whispered mr neal in german the women are restoring her the doctor whispered back she has heard it all in gods name what are we to do next before it was possible to reply mr armadale spoke the doctors return had roused him to a sense of present things  go on he said as if nothing had happened  i refuse to meddle further with your infamous secret returned mr neal you are a murderer on your own confession if that letter is to be finished dont ask me to hold the pen for you  you gave me your promise was the reply spoken with the same immovable selfpossession you must write for me or break your word  for the moment mr neal was silenced there the man laysheltered from the execration of his fellowcreatures under the shadow of deathbeyond the reach of all human condemnation beyond the dread of all mortal laws sensitive to nothing but his one last resolution to finish the letter addressed to his son  mr neal drew the doctor aside a word with you he said in german do you persist in asserting that he may be speechless before we can send to stuttgart  look at his lips said the doctor and judge for yourself  his lips answered for him the reading of the narrative had left its mark on them already a distortion at the corners of his mouth which had been barely noticeable when mr neal entered the room was plainly visible now his slow articulation labored more and more painfully with every word he uttered the position was emphatically a terrible one after a moment more of hesitation mr neal made a last attempt to withdraw from it  now my eyes are open he said sternly do you dare hold me to an engagement which you forced on me blindfold  no answered mr armadale i leave you to break your word  the look which accompanied that reply stung the scotchmans pride to the quick when he spoke next he spoke seated in his former place at the table  no man ever yet said of me that i broke my word he retorted angrily and not even you shall say it of me now mind this if you hold me to my promise i hold you to my condition i have reserved my freedom of action and i warn you i will use it at my own sole discretion as soon as i am released from the sight of you  remember he is dying pleaded the doctor gently  take your place sir said mr neal pointing to the empty chair what remains to be read i will only read in your hearing what remains to be written i will only write in your presence you brought me here i have a right to insistand i do insiston your remaining as a witness to the last  the doctor accepted his position without remonstrance mr neal returned to the manuscript and read what remained of it uninterruptedly to the end   without a word in my own defense i have acknowledged my guilt without a word in my own defense i will reveal how the crime was committed  no thought of him was in my mind when i saw his wife insensible on the deck of the timbership i did my part in lowering her safely into the boat then and not till then i felt the thought of him coming back in the confusion that prevailed while the men of the yacht were forcing the men of the ship to wait their time i had an opportunity of searching for him unobserved i stepped back from the bulwark not knowing whether he was away in the first boat or whether he was still on boardi stepped back and saw him mount the cabin stairs emptyhanded with the water dripping from him after looking eagerly toward the boat without noticing me he saw there was time to spare before the crew were taken once more he said to himselfand disappeared again to make a last effort at recovering the jewel box the devil at my elbow whispered dont shoot him like a man drown him like a dog he was under water when i bolted the scuttle but his head rose to the surface before i could close the cabin door i looked at him and he looked at meand i locked the door in his face the next minute i was back among the last men left on deck the minute after it was too late to repent the storm was threatening us with destruction and the boats crew were pulling for their lives from the ship  my son i have pursued you from my grave with a confession which my love might have spared you read on and you will know why  i will say nothing of my sufferings i will plead for no mercy to my memory there is a strange sinking at my heart a strange trembling in my hand while i write these lines which warns me to hasten to the end i left the island without daring to look for the last time at the woman whom i had lost so miserably whom i had injured so vilely when i left the whole weight of the suspicion roused by the manner of inglebys death rested on the crew of the french vessel no motive for the supposed murder could be brought home to any of them but they were known to be for the most part outlawed ruffians capable of any crime and they were suspected and examined accordingly it was not till afterward that i heard by accident of the suspicion shifting round at last to me the widow alone recognized the vague description given of the strange man who had made one of the yachts crew and who had disappeared the day afterward the widow alone knew from that time forth why her husband had been murdered and who had done the deed when she made that discovery a false report of my death had been previously circulated in the island perhaps i was indebted to the report for my immunity from all legal proceedings perhaps no eye but inglebys having seen me lock the cabin door there was not evidence enough to justify an inquiry perhaps the widow shrank from the disclosures which must have followed a public charge against me based on her own bare suspicion of the truth however it might be the crime which i had committed unseen has remained a crime unpunished from that time to this  i left madeira for the west indies in disguise the first news that met me when the ship touched at barbadoes was the news of my mothers death i had no heart to return to the old scenes the prospect of living at home in solitude with the torment of my own guilty remembrances gnawing at me day and night was more than i had the courage to confront without landing or discovering myself to any one on shore i went on as far as the ship would take meto the island of trinidad  at that place i first saw your mother it was my duty to tell her the truthand i treacherously kept my secret it was my duty to spare her the hopeless sacrifice of her freedom and her happiness to such an existence as mineand i did her the injury of marrying her if she is alive when you read this grant her the mercy of still concealing the truth the one atonement i can make to her is to keep her unsuspicious to the last of the man she has married pity her as i have pitied her let this letter be a sacred confidence between father and son  the time when you were born was the time when my health began to give way some months afterward in the first days of my recovery you were brought to me and i was told that you had been christened during my illness your mother had done as other loving mothers doshe had christened her firstborn by his fathers name you too were allan armadale even in that early timeeven while i was happily ignorant of what i have discovered sincemy mind misgave me when i looked at you and thought of that fatal name  as soon as i could be moved my presence was required at my estates in barbadoes it crossed my mindwild as the idea may appear to youto renounce the condition which compelled my son as well as myself to take the armadale name or lose the succession to the armadale property but even in those days the rumor of a contemplated emancipation of the slavesthe emancipation which is now close at handwas spreading widely in the colony no man could tell how the value of west indian property might be affected if that threatened change ever took place no man could tellif i gave you back my own paternal name and left you without other provision in the future than my own paternal estatehow you might one day miss the broad armadale acres or to what future penury i might be blindly condemning your mother and yourself mark how the fatalities gathered one on the other mark how your christian name came to you how your surname held to you in spite of me  my health had improved in my old homebut it was for a time only i sank again and the doctors ordered me to europe avoiding england why you may guess i took my passage with you and your mother for france from france we passed into italy we lived here we lived there it was useless death had got met and death followed me go where i might i bore it for i had an alleviation to turn to which i had not deserved you may shrink in horror from the very memory of me now in those days you comforted me the only warmth i still felt at my heart was the warmth you brought to it my last glimpses of happiness in this world were the glimpses given me by my infant son  we removed from italy and went next to lausannethe place from which i am now writing to you the post of this morning has brought me news later and fuller than any i had received thus far of the widow of the murdered man the letter lies before me while i write it comes from a friend of my early days who has seen her and spoken to herwho has been the first to inform her that the report of my death in madeira was false he writes at a loss to account for the violent agitation which she showed on hearing that i was still alive that i was married and that i had an infant son he asks me if i can explain it he speaks in terms of sympathy for hera young and beautiful woman buried in the retirement of a fishingvillage on the devonshire coast her father dead her family estranged from her in merciless disapproval of her marriage he writes words which might have cut me to the heart but for a closing passage in his letter which seized my whole attention the instant i came to it and which has forced from me the narrative that these pages contain  i now know what never even entered my mind as a suspicion till the letter reached me i now know that the widow of the man whose death lies at my door has borne a posthumous child that child is a boya year older than my own son secure in her belief in my death his mother has done what my sons mother did she has christened her child by his fathers name again in the second generation there are two allan armadales as there were in the first after working its deadly mischief with the fathers the fatal resemblance of names has descended to work its deadly mischief with the sons  guiltless minds may see nothing thus far but the result of a series of events which could lead no other way iwith that mans life to answer fori going down into my grave with my crime unpunished and unatoned see what no guiltless minds can discern i see danger in the future begotten of the danger in the pasttreachery that is the offspring of his treachery and crime that is the child of my crime is the dread that now shakes me to the soul a phantom raised by the superstition of a dying man i look into the book which all christendom venerates and the book tells me that the sin of the father shall be visited on the child i look out into the world and i see the living witnesses round me to that terrible truth i see the vices which have contaminated the father descending and contaminating the child i see the shame which has disgraced the fathers name descending and disgracing the childs i look in on myself and i see my crime ripening again for the future in the selfsame circumstance which first sowed the seeds of it in the past and descending in inherited contamination of evil from me to my son   at those lines the writing ended there the stroke had struck him and the pen had dropped from his hand  he knew the place he remembered the words at the instant when the readers voice stopped he looked eagerly at the doctor i have got what comes next in my mind he said with slower and slower articulation help me to speak it  the doctor administered a stimulant and signed to mr neal to give him time after a little delay the flame of the sinking spirit leaped up in his eyes once more resolutely struggling with his failing speech he summoned the scotchman to take the pen and pronounced the closing sentences of the narrative as his memory gave them back to him one by one in these words   despise my dying conviction if you will but grant me i solemnly implore you one last request my son the only hope i have left for you hangs on a great doubtthe doubt whether we are or are not the masters of our own destinies it may be that mortal freewill can conquer mortal fate and that going as we all do inevitably to death we go inevitably to nothing that is before death if this be so indeed respectthough you respect nothing elsethe warning which i give you from my grave never to your dying day let any living soul approach you who is associated directly or indirectly with the crime which your father has committed avoid the widow of the man i killedif the widow still lives avoid the maid whose wicked hand smoothed the way to the marriageif the maid is still in her service and more than all avoid the man who bears the same name as your own offend your best benefactor if that benefactors influence has connected you one with the other desert the woman who loves you if that woman is a link between you and him hide yourself from him under an assumed name put the mountains and the seas between you be ungrateful be unforgiving be all that is most repellent to your own gentler nature rather than live under the same roof and breathe the same air with that man never let the two allan armadales meet in this world never never never  there lies the way by which you may escapeif any way there be take it if you prize your own innocence and your own happiness through all your life to come  i have done if i could have trusted any weaker influence than the influence of this confession to incline you to my will i would have spared you the disclosure which these pages contain you are lying on my breast sleeping the innocent sleep of a child while a strangers hand writes these words for you as they fall from my lips think what the strength of my conviction must be when i can find the courage on my deathbed to darken all your young life at its outset with the shadow of your fathers crime think and be warned think and forgive me if you can   there it ended those were the fathers last words to the son  inexorably faithful to his forced duty mr neal laid aside the pen and read over aloud the lines he had just written is there more to add he asked with his pitilessly steady voice there was no more to add  mr neal folded the manuscript inclosed it in a sheet of paper and sealed it with mr armadales own seal the address he said with his merciless business formality to allan armadale junior he wrote as the words were dictated from the bed care of godfrey hammick esq offices of messrs hammick and ridge lincolns inn fields london having written the address he waited and considered for a moment is your executor to open this he asked  no he is to give it to my son when my son is of an age to understand it  in that case pursued mr neal with all his wits in remorseless working order i will add a dated note to the address repeating your own words as you have just spoken them and explaining the circumstances under which my handwriting appears on the document he wrote the note in the briefest and plainest terms read it over aloud as he had read over what went before signed his name and address at the end and made the doctor sign next as witness of the proceedings and as medical evidence of the condition in which mr armadale then lay this done he placed the letter in a second inclosure sealed it as before and directed it to mr hammick with the superscription of private added to the address do you insist on my posting this he asked rising with the letter in his hand  give him time to think said the doctor for the childs sake give him time to think a minute may change him  i will give him five minutes answered mr neal placing his watch on the table implacable just to the very last  they waited both looking attentively at mr armadale the signs of change which had appeared in him already were multiplying fast the movement which continued mental agitation had communicated to the muscles of his face was beginning under the same dangerous influence to spread downward his once helpless hands lay still no longer they struggled pitiably on the bedclothes at sight of that warning token the doctor turned with a gesture of alarm and beckoned mr neal to come nearer put the question at once he said if you let the five minutes pass you may be too late  mr neal approached the bed he too noticed the movement of the hands is that a bad sign he asked  the doctor bent his head gravely put your question at once he repeated or you may be too late  mr neal held the letter before the eyes of the dying man do you know what this is  my letter  do you insist on my posting it  he mastered his failing speech for the last time and gave the answer yes  mr neal moved to the door with the letter in his hand the german followed him a few steps opened his lips to plead for a longer delay met the scotchmans inexorable eye and drew back again in silence the door closed and parted them without a word having passed on either side  the doctor went back to the bed and whispered to the sinking man let me call him back there is time to stop him yet it was useless no answer came nothing showed that he heeded or even heard his eyes wandered from the child rested for a moment on his own struggling hand and looked up entreatingly in the compassionate face that bent over him the doctor lifted the hand paused followed the fathers longing eyes back to the child and interpreting his last wish moved the hand gently toward the boys head the hand touched it and trembled violently in another instant the trembling seized on the arm and spread over the whole upper part of the body the face turned from pale to red from red to purple from purple to pale again then the toiling hands lay still and the shifting color changed no more   the window of the next room was open when the doctor entered it from the death chamber with the child in his arms he looked out as he passed by and saw mr neal in the street below slowly returning to the inn  where is the letter he asked  three words sufficed for the scotchmans answer  in the post  the end of the prologue     the story     book the first     i the mystery of ozias midwinter  on a warm may night in the year eighteen hundred and fiftyone the reverend decimus brockat that time a visitor to the isle of manretired to his bedroom at castletown with a serious personal responsibility in close pursuit of him and with no distinct idea of the means by which he might relieve himself from the pressure of his present circumstances  the clergyman had reached that mature period of human life at which a sensible man learns to decline as often as his temper will let him all useless conflict with the tyranny of his own troubles abandoning any further effort to reach a decision in the emergency that now beset him mr brock sat down placidly in his shirt sleeves on the side of his bed and applied his mind to consider next whether the emergency itself was as serious as he had hitherto been inclined to think it following this new way out of his perplexities mr brock found himself unexpectedly traveling to the end in view by the least inspiriting of all human journeysa journey through the past years of his own life  one by one the events of those yearsall connected with the same little group of characters and all more or less answerable for the anxiety which was now intruding itself between the clergyman and his nights restrose in progressive series on mr brocks memory the first of the series took him back through a period of fourteen years to his own rectory on the somersetshire shores of the bristol channel and closeted him at a private interview with a lady who had paid him a visit in the character of a total stranger to the parson and the place   the ladys complexion was fair the ladys figure was well preserved she was still a young woman and she looked even younger than her age there was a shade of melancholy in her expression and an undertone of suffering in her voiceenough in each case to indicate that she had known trouble but not enough to obtrude that trouble on the notice of others she brought with her a fine fairhaired boy of eight years old whom she presented as her son and who was sent out of the way at the beginning of the interview to amuse himself in the rectory garden her card had preceded her entrance into the study and had announced her under the name of mrs armadale mr brock began to feel interested in her before she had opened her lips and when the son had been dismissed he awaited with some anxiety to hear what the mother had to say to him  mrs armadale began by informing the rector that she was a widow her husband had perished by shipwreck a short time after their union on the voyage from madeira to lisbon she had been brought to england after her affliction under her fathers protection and her childa posthumous sonhad been born on the family estate in norfolk her fathers death shortly afterward had deprived her of her only surviving parent and had exposed her to neglect and misconstruction on the part of her remaining relatives two brothers which had estranged her from them she feared for the rest of her days for some time past she had lived in the neighboring county of devonshire devoting herself to the education of her boy who had now reached an age at which he required other than his mothers teaching leaving out of the question her own unwillingness to part with him in her solitary position she was especially anxious that he should not be thrown among strangers by being sent to school her darling project was to bring him up privately at home and to keep him as he advanced in years from all contact with the temptations and the dangers of the world  with these objects in view her longer sojourn in her own locality where the services of the resident clergyman in the capacity of tutor were not obtainable must come to an end she had made inquiries had heard of a house that would suit her in mr brocks neighborhood and had also been told that mr brock himself had formerly been in the habit of taking pupils possessed of this information she had ventured to present herself with references that vouched for her respectability but without a formal introduction and she had now to ask whether in the event of her residing in the neighborhood any terms that could be offered would induce mr brock to open his doors once more to a pupil and to allow that pupil to be her son  if mrs armadale had been a woman of no personal attractions or if mr brock had been provided with an intrenchment to fight behind in the shape of a wife it is probable that the widows journey might have been taken in vain as things really were the rector examined the references which were offered to him and asked time for consideration when the time had expired he did what mrs armadale wished him to dohe offered his back to the burden and let the mother load him with the responsibility of the son  this was the first event of the series the date of it being the year eighteen hundred and thirtyseven mr brocks memory traveling forward toward the present from that point picked up the second event in its turn and stopped next at the year eighteen hundred and fortyfive    the fishingvillage on the somersetshire coast was still the scene and the characters were once againmrs armadale and her son  through the eight years that had passed mr brocks responsibility had rested on him lightly enough the boy had given his mother and his tutor but little trouble he was certainly slow over his books but more from a constitutional inability to fix his attention on his tasks than from want of capacity to understand them his temperament it could not be denied was heedless to the last degree he acted recklessly on his first impulses and rushed blindfold at all his conclusions on the other hand it was to be said in his favor that his disposition was open as the day a more generous affectionate sweettempered lad it would have been hard to find anywhere a certain quaint originality of character and a natural healthiness in all his tastes carried him free of most of the dangers to which his mothers system of education inevitably exposed him he had a thoroughly english love of the sea and of all that belongs to it and as he grew in years there was no luring him away from the waterside and no keeping him out of the boatbuilders yard in course of time his mother caught him actually working there to her infinite annoyance and surprise as a volunteer he acknowledged that his whole future ambition was to have a yard of his own and that his one present object was to learn to build a boat for himself wisely foreseeing that such a pursuit as this for his leisure hours was exactly what was wanted to reconcile the lad to a position of isolation from companions of his own rank and age mr brock prevailed on mrs armadale with no small difficulty to let her son have his way at the period of that second event in the clergymans life with his pupil which is now to be related young armadale had practiced long enough in the builders yard to have reached the summit of his wishes by laying with his own hands the keel of his own boat  late on a certain summer day not long after allan had completed his sixteenth year mr brock left his pupil hard at work in the yard and went to spend the evening with mrs armadale taking the times newspaper with him in his hand  the years that had passed since they had first met had long since regulated the lives of the clergyman and his neighbor the first advances which mr brocks growing admiration for the widow had led him to make in the early days of their intercourse had been met on her side by an appeal to his forbearance which had closed his lips for the future she had satisfied him at once and forever that the one place in her heart which he could hope to occupy was the place of a friend he loved her well enough to take what she would give him friends they became and friends they remained from that time forth no jealous dread of another mans succeeding where he had failed imbittered the clergymans placid relations with the woman whom he loved of the few resident gentlemen in the neighborhood none were ever admitted by mrs armadale to more than the merest acquaintance with her contentedly selfburied in her country retreat she was proof against every social attraction that would have tempted other women in her position and at her age mr brock and his newspaper appearing with monotonous regularity at her teatable three times a week told her all she knew or cared to know of the great outer world which circled round the narrow and changeless limits of her daily life  on the evening in question mr brock took the armchair in which he always sat accepted the one cup of tea which he always drank and opened the newspaper which he always read aloud to mrs armadale who invariably listened to him reclining on the same sofa with the same sort of needlework everlastingly in her hand  bless my soul cried the rector with his voice in a new octave and his eyes fixed in astonishment on the first page of the newspaper  no such introduction to the evening readings as this had ever happened before in all mrs armadales experience as a listener she looked up from the sofa in a flutter of curiosity and besought her reverend friend to favor her with an explanation  i can hardly believe my own eyes said mr brock here is an advertisement mrs armadale addressed to your son  without further preface he read the advertisement as follows   if this should meet the eye of allan armadale he is desired to communicate either personally or by letter with messrs hammick and ridge lincolns inn fields london on business of importance which seriously concerns him any one capable of informing messrs e and r where the person herein advertised can be found would confer a favor by doing the same to prevent mistakes it is further notified that the missing allan armadale is a youth aged fifteen years and that this advertisement is inserted at the instance of his family and friends   another family and other friends said mrs armadale the person whose name appears in that advertisement is not my son  the tone in which she spoke surprised mr brock the change in her face when he looked up shocked him her delicate complexion had faded away to a dull white her eyes were averted from her visitor with a strange mixture of confusion and alarm she looked an older woman than she was by ten good years at least  the name is so very uncommon said mr brock imagining he had offended her and trying to excuse himself it really seemed impossible there could be two persons  there are two interposed mrs armadale allan as you know is sixteen years old if you look back at the advertisement you will find the missing person described as being only fifteen although he bears the same surname and the same christian name he is i thank god in no way whatever related to my son as long as i live it will be the object of my hopes and prayers that allan may never see him may never even hear of him my kind friend i see i surprise you will you bear with me if i leave these strange circumstances unexplained there is past misfortune and misery in my early life too painful for me to speak of even to you will you help me to bear the remembrance of it by never referring to this again will you do even morewill you promise not to speak of it to allan and not to let that newspaper fall in his way  mr brock gave the pledge required of him and considerately left her to herself  the rector had been too long and too truly attached to mrs armadale to be capable of regarding her with any unworthy distrust but it would be idle to deny that he felt disappointed by her want of confidence in him and that he looked inquisitively at the advertisement more than once on his way back to his own house  it was clear enough now that mrs armadales motives for burying her son as well as herself in the seclusion of a remote country village was not so much to keep him under her own eye as to keep him from discovery by his namesake why did she dread the idea of their ever meeting was it a dread for herself or a dread for her son mr brocks loyal belief in his friend rejected any solution of the difficulty which pointed at some past misconduct of mrs armadales that night he destroyed the advertisement with his own hand that night he resolved that the subject should never be suffered to enter his mind again there was another allan armadale about the world a stranger to his pupils blood and a vagabond advertised in the public newspapers so much accident had revealed to him more for mrs armadales sake he had no wish to discoverand more he would never seek to know  this was the second in the series of events which dated from the rectors connection with mrs armadale and her son mr brocks memory traveling on nearer and nearer to present circumstances reached the third stage of its journey through the bygone time and stopped at the year eighteen hundred and fifty next  the five years that had passed had made little if any change in allans character he had simply developed to use his tutors own expression from a boy of sixteen to a boy of twentyone he was just as easy and open in his disposition as ever just as quaintly and inveterately goodhumored just as heedless in following his own impulses lead him where they might his bias toward the sea had strengthened with his advance to the years of manhood from building a boat he had now got onwith two journeymen at work under himto building a decked vessel of fiveandthirty tons mr brock had conscientiously tried to divert him to higher aspirations had taken him to oxford to see what college life was like had taken him to london to expand his mind by the spectacle of the great metropolis the change had diverted allan but had not altered him in the least he was as impenetrably superior to all worldly ambition as diogenes himself which is best asked this unconscious philosopher to find out the way to be happy for yourself or to let other people try if they can find it out for you from that moment mr brock permitted his pupils character to grow at its own rate of development and allan went on uninterruptedly with the work of his yacht  time which had wrought so little change in the son had not passed harmless over the mother  mrs armadales health was breaking fast as her strength failed her temper altered for the worse she grew more and more fretful more and more subject to morbid fears and fancies more and more reluctant to leave her own room since the appearance of the advertisement five years since nothing had happened to force her memory back to the painful associations connected with her early life no word more on the forbidden topic had passed between the rector and herself no suspicion had ever been raised in allans mind of the existence of his namesake and yet without the shadow of a reason for any special anxiety mrs armadale had become of late years obstinately and fretfully uneasy on the subject of her son more than once mr brock dreaded a serious disagreement between them but allans natural sweetness of temper fortified by his love for his mother carried him triumphantly through all trials not a hard word or a harsh look ever escaped him in her presence he was unchangeably loving and forbearing with her to the very last  such were the positions of the son the mother and the friend when the next notable event happened in the lives of the three on a dreary afternoon early in the month of november mr brock was disturbed over the composition of his sermon by a visit from the landlord of the village inn  after making his introductory apologies the landlord stated the urgent business on which he had come to the rectory clearly enough  a few hours since a young man had been brought to the inn by some farm laborers in the neighborhood who had found him wandering about one of their masters fields in a disordered state of mind which looked to their eyes like downright madness the landlord had given the poor creature shelter while he sent for medical help and the doctor on seeing him had pronounced that he was suffering from fever on the brain and that his removal to the nearest town at which a hospital or a workhouse infirmary could be found to receive him would in all probability be fatal to his chances of recovery after hearing this expression of opinion and after observing for himself that the strangers only luggage consisted of a small carpetbag which had been found in the field near him the landlord had set off on the spot to consult the rector and to ask in this serious emergency what course he was to take next  mr brock was the magistrate as well as the clergyman of the district and the course to be taken in the first instance was to his mind clear enough he put on his hat and accompanied the landlord back to the inn  at the inn door they were joined by allan who had heard the news through another channel and who was waiting mr brocks arrival to follow in the magistrates train and to see what the stranger was like the village surgeon joined them at the same moment and the four went into the inn together  they found the landlords son on one side and the hostler on the other holding the man down in his chair young slim and undersized he was strong enough at that moment to make it a matter of difficulty for the two to master him his tawny complexion his large bright brown eyes and his black beard gave him something of a foreign look his dress was a little worn but his linen was clean his dusky hands were wiry and nervous and were lividly discolored in more places than one by the scars of old wounds the toes of one of his feet off which he had kicked the shoe grasped at the chair rail through his stocking with the sensitive muscular action which is only seen in those who have been accustomed to go barefoot in the frenzy that now possessed him it was impossible to notice to any useful purpose more than this after a whispered consultation with mr brock the surgeon personally superintended the patients removal to a quiet bedroom at the back of the house shortly afterward his clothes and his carpetbag were sent downstairs and were searched on the chance of finding a clew by which to communicate with his friends in the magistrates presence  the carpetbag contained nothing but a change of clothing and two booksthe plays of sophocles in the original greek and the faust of goethe in the original german both volumes were much worn by reading and on the flyleaf of each were inscribed the initials o m so much the bag revealed and no more  the clothes which the man wore when he was discovered in the field were tried next a purse containing a sovereign and a few shillings a pipe a tobacco pouch a handkerchief and a little drinkingcup of horn were produced in succession the next object and the last was found crumpled up carelessly in the breastpocket of the coat it was a written testimonial to character dated and signed but without any address  so far as this document could tell it the strangers story was a sad one indeed he had apparently been employed for a short time as usher at a school and had been turned adrift in the world at the outset of his illness from the fear that the fever might be infectious and that the prosperity of the establishment might suffer accordingly not the slightest imputation of any misbehavior in his employment rested on him on the contrary the schoolmaster had great pleasure in testifying to his capacity and his character and in expressing a fervent hope that he might under providence succeed in recovering his health in somebody elses house the written testimonial which afforded this glimpse at the mans story served one purpose more it connected him with the initials on the books and identified him to the magistrate and the landlord under the strangely uncouth name of ozias midwinter  mr brock laid aside the testimonial suspecting that the schoolmaster had purposely abstained from writing his address on it with the view of escaping all responsibility in the event of his ushers death in any case it was manifestly useless under existing circumstances to think of tracing the poor wretchs friends if friends he had to the inn he had been brought and as a matter of common humanity at the inn he must remain for the present the difficulty about expenses if it came to the worst might possibly be met by charitable contributions from the neighbors or by a collection after a sermon at church assuring the landlord that he would consider this part of the question and would let him know the result mr brock quitted the inn without noticing for the moment that he had left allan there behind him  before he had got fifty yards from the house his pupil overtook him allan had been most uncharacteristically silent and serious all through the search at the inn but he had now recovered his usual high spirits a stranger would have set him down as wanting in common feeling  this is a sad business said the rector i really dont know what to do for the best about that unfortunate man  you may make your mind quite easy sir said young armadale in his offhand way i settled it all with the landlord a minute ago  you exclaimed mr brock in the utmost astonishment  i have merely given a few simple directions pursued allan our friend the usher is to have everything he requires and is to be treated like a prince and when the doctor and the landlord want their money they are to come to me  my dear allan mr brock gently remonstrated when will you learn to think before you act on those generous impulses of yours you are spending more money already on your yachtbuilding than you can afford  only think we laid the first planks of the deck the day before yesterday said allan flying off to the new subject in his usual birdwitted way theres just enough of it done to walk on if you dont feel giddy ill help you up the ladder mr brock if youll only come and try  listen to me persisted the rector im not talking about the yacht now that is to say i am only referring to the yacht as an illustration  and a very pretty illustration too remarked the incorrigible allan find me a smarter little vessel of her size in all england and ill give up yachtbuilding tomorrow whereabouts were we in our conversation sir im rather afraid we have lost ourselves somehow  i am rather afraid one of us is in the habit of losing himself every time he opens his lips retorted mr brock come come allan this is serious you have been rendering yourself liable for expenses which you may not be able to pay mind i am far from blaming you for your kind feeling toward this poor friendless man  dont be lowspirited about him sir hell get over ithell be all right again in a week or so a capital fellow i have not the least doubt continued allan whose habit it was to believe in everybody and to despair of nothing suppose you ask him to dinner when he gets well mr brock i should like to find out when we are all three snug and friendly together over our wine you know how he came by that extraordinary name of his ozias midwinter upon my life his father ought to be ashamed of himself  will you answer me one question before i go in said the rector stopping in despair at his own gate this mans bill for lodging and medical attendance may mount to twenty or thirty pounds before he gets well again if he ever does get well how are you to pay for it  whats that the chancellor of the exchequer says when he finds himself in a mess with his accounts and doesnt see his way out again asked allan he always tells his honorable friend he is quite willing to leave a something or other  a margin suggested mr brock  thats it said allan im like the chancellor of the exchequer im quite willing to leave a margin the yacht bless her heart doesnt eat up everything if im short by a pound or two dont be afraid sir theres no pride about me ill go round with the hat and get the balance in the neighborhood deuce take the pounds shillings and pence i wish they could all three get rid of themselves like the bedouin brothers at the show dont you remember the bedouin brothers mr brock ali will take a lighted torch and jump down the throat of his brother muli muli will take a lighted torch and jump down the throat of his brother hassan and hassan taking a third lighted torch will conclude the performances by jumping down his own throat and leaving the spectators in total darkness wonderfully good thatwhat i call real wit with a fine strong flavor about it wait a minute where are we we have lost ourselves again oh i remembermoney what i cant beat into my thick head concluded allan quite unconscious that he was preaching socialist doctrines to a clergyman is the meaning of the fuss thats made about giving money away why cant the people who have got money to spare give it to the people who havent got money to spare and make things pleasant and comfortable all the world over in that way youre always telling me to cultivate ideas mr brock theres an idea and upon my life i dont think its a bad one  mr brock gave his pupil a goodhumored poke with the end of his stick go back to your yacht he said all the little discretion you have got in that flighty head of yours is left on board in your toolchest how that lad will end pursued the rector when he was left by himself is more than any human being can say i almost wish i had never taken the responsibility of him on my shoulders  three weeks passed before the stranger with the uncouth name was pronounced to be at last on the way to recovery  during this period allan had made regular inquiries at the inn and as soon as the sick man was allowed to see visitors allan was the first who appeared at his bedside so far mr brocks pupil had shown no more than a natural interest in one of the few romantic circumstances which had varied the monotony of the village life he had committed no imprudence and he had exposed himself to no blame but as the days passed young armadales visits to the inn began to lengthen considerably and the surgeon a cautious elderly man gave the rector a private hint to bestir himself mr brock acted on the hint immediately and discovered that allan had followed his usual impulses in his usual headlong way he had taken a violent fancy to the castaway usher and had invited ozias midwinter to reside permanently in the neighborhood in the new and interesting character of his bosom friend  before mr brock could make up his mind how to act in this emergency he received a note from allans mother begging him to use his privilege as an old friend and to pay her a visit in her room  he found mrs armadale suffering under violent nervous agitation caused entirely by a recent interview with her son allan had been sitting with her all the morning and had talked of nothing but his new friend the man with the horrible name as poor mrs armadale described him had questioned allan in a singularly inquisitive manner on the subject of himself and his family but had kept his own personal history entirely in the dark at some former period of his life he had been accustomed to the sea and to sailing allan had unfortunately found this out and a bond of union between them was formed on the spot with a merciless distrust of the strangersimply because he was a strangerwhich appeared rather unreasonable to mr brock mrs armadale besought the rector to go to the inn without a moments loss of time and never to rest until he had made the man give a proper account of himself find out everything about his father and mother she said in her vehement female way make sure before you leave him that he is not a vagabond roaming the country under an assumed name  my dear lady remonstrated the rector obediently taking his hat whatever else we may doubt i really think we may feel sure about the mans name it is so remarkably ugly that it must be genuine no sane human being would assume such a name as ozias midwinter  you may be quite right and i may be quite wrong but pray go and see him persisted mrs armadale go and dont spare him mr brock how do we know that this illness of his may not have been put on for a purpose  it was useless to reason with her the whole college of physicians might have certified to the mans illness and in her present frame of mind mrs armadale would have disbelieved the college one and all from the president downward mr brock took the wise way out of the difficultyhe said no more and he set off for the inn immediately  ozias midwinter recovering from brainfever was a startling object to contemplate on a first view of him his shaven head tied up in an old yellow silk handkerchief his tawny haggard cheeks his bright brown eyes preternaturally large and wild his rough black beard his long supple sinewy fingers wasted by suffering till they looked like clawsall tended to discompose the rector at the outset of the interview when the first feeling of surprise had worn off the impression that followed it was not an agreeable one mr brock could not conceal from himself that the strangers manner was against him the general opinion has settled that if a man is honest he is bound to assert it by looking straight at his fellowcreatures when he speaks to them if this man was honest his eyes showed a singular perversity in looking away and denying it possibly they were affected in some degree by a nervous restlessness in his organization which appeared to pervade every fiber in his lean lithe body the rectors healthy anglosaxon flesh crept responsively at every casual movement of the ushers supple brown fingers and every passing distortion of the ushers haggard yellow face god forgive me thought mr brock with his mind running on allan and allans mother i wish i could see my way to turning ozias midwinter adrift in the world again  the conversation which ensued between the two was a very guarded one mr brock felt his way gently and found himself try where he might always kept politely more or less in the dark  from first to last the mans real character shrank back with a savage shyness from the rectors touch he started by an assertion which it was impossible to look at him and believehe declared that he was only twenty years of age all he could be persuaded to say on the subject of the school was that the bare recollection of it was horrible to him he had only filled the ushers situation for ten days when the first appearance of his illness caused his dismissal how he had reached the field in which he had been found was more than he could say he remembered traveling a long distance by railway with a purpose if he had a purpose which it was now impossible to recall and then wandering coastward on foot all through the day or all through the nighthe was not sure which the sea kept running in his mind when his mind began to give way he had been employed on the sea as a lad he had left it and had filled a situation at a booksellers in a country town he had left the booksellers and had tried the school now the school had turned him out he must try something else it mattered little what he triedfailure for which nobody was ever to blame but himself was sure to be the end of it sooner or later friends to assist him he had none to apply to and as for relations he wished to be excused from speaking of them for all he knew they might be dead and for all they knew he might be dead that was a melancholy acknowledgment to make at his time of life there was no denying it it might tell against him in the opinions of others and it did tell against him no doubt in the opinion of the gentleman who was talking to him at that moment  these strange answers were given in a tone and manner far removed from bitterness on the one side or from indifference on the other ozias midwinter at twenty spoke of his life as ozias midwinter at seventy might have spoken with a long weariness of years on him which he had learned to bear patiently  two circumstances pleaded strongly against the distrust with which in sheer perplexity of mind mr brock blindly regarded him he had written to a savingsbank in a distant part of england had drawn his money and had paid the doctor and the landlord a man of vulgar mind after acting in this manner would have treated his obligations lightly when he had settled his bills ozias midwinter spoke of his obligationsand especially of his obligation to allanwith a fervor of thankfulness which it was not surprising only but absolutely painful to witness he showed a horrible sincerity of astonishment at having been treated with common christian kindness in a christian land he spoke of allans having become answerable for all the expenses of sheltering nursing and curing him with a savage rapture of gratitude and surprise which burst out of him like a flash of lightning so help me god cried the castaway usher i never met with the like of him i never heard of the like of him before in the next instant the one glimpse of light which the man had let in on his own passionate nature was quenched again in darkness his wandering eyes returning to their old trick looked uneasily away from mr brock and his voice dropped back once more into its unnatural steadiness and quietness of tone i beg your pardon sir he said i have been used to be hunted and cheated and starved everything else comes strange to me half attracted by the man half repelled by him mr brock on rising to take leave impulsively offered his hand and then with a sudden misgiving confusedly drew it back again you meant that kindly sir said ozias midwinter with his own hands crossed resolutely behind him i dont complain of your thinking better of it a man who cant give a proper account of himself is not a man for a gentleman in your position to take by the hand  mr brock left the inn thoroughly puzzled before returning to mrs armadale he sent for her son the chances were that the guard had been off the strangers tongue when he spoke to allan and with allans frankness there was no fear of his concealing anything that had passed between them from the rectors knowledge  here again mr brocks diplomacy achieved no useful results  once started on the subject of ozias midwinter allan rattled on about his new friend in his usual easy lighthearted way but he had really nothing of importance to tell for nothing of importance had been revealed to him they had talked about boatbuilding and sailing by the hour together and allan had got some valuable hints they had discussed with diagrams to assist them and with more valuable hints for allan the serious impending question of the launch of the yacht on other occasions they had diverged to other subjectsto more of them than allan could remember on the spur of the moment had midwinter said nothing about his relations in the flow of all this friendly talk nothing except that they had not behaved well to himhang his relations was he at all sensitive on the subject of his own odd name not the least in the world he had set the example like a sensible fellow of laughing at it himself  mr brock still persisted he inquired next what allan had seen in the stranger to take such a fancy to allan had seen in himwhat he didnt see in people in general he wasnt like all the other fellows in the neighborhood all the other fellows were cut out on the same pattern every man of them was equally healthy muscular loud hardhearted cleanskinned and rough every man of them drank the same draughts of beer smoked the same short pipes all day long rode the best horse shot over the best dog and put the best bottle of wine in england on his table at night every man of them sponged himself every morning in the same sort of tub of cold water and bragged about it in frosty weather in the same sort of way every man of them thought getting into debt a capital joke and betting on horseraces one of the most meritorious actions that a human being can perform they were no doubt excellent fellows in their way but the worst of them was they were all exactly alike it was a perfect godsend to meet with a man like midwintera man who was not cut out on the regular local pattern and whose way in the world had the one great merit in those parts of being a way of his own  leaving all remonstrances for a fitter opportunity the rector went back to mrs armadale he could not disguise from himself that allans mother was the person really answerable for allans present indiscretion if the lad had seen a little less of the small gentry in the neighborhood and a little more of the great outside world at home and abroad the pleasure of cultivating ozias midwinters society might have had fewer attractions for him  conscious of the unsatisfactory result of his visit to the inn mr brock felt some anxiety about the reception of his report when he found himself once more in mrs armadales presence his forebodings were soon realized try as he might to make the best of it mrs armadale seized on the one suspicious fact of the ushers silence about himself as justifying the strongest measures that could be taken to separate him from her son if the rector refused to interfere she declared her intention of writing to ozias midwinter with her own hand remonstrance irritated her to such a pitch that she astounded mr brock by reverting to the forbidden subject of five years since and referring him to the conversation which had passed between them when the advertisement had been discovered in the newspaper she passionately declared that the vagabond armadale of that advertisement and the vagabond midwinter at the village inn might for all she know to the contrary be one and the same foreboding a serious disagreement between the mother and son if the mother interfered mr brock undertook to see midwinter again and to tell him plainly that he must give a proper account of himself or that his intimacy with allan must cease the two concessions which he exacted from mrs armadale in return were that she should wait patiently until the doctor reported the man fit to travel and that she should be careful in the interval not to mention the matter in any way to her son  in a weeks time midwinter was able to drive out with allan for his coachman in the pony chaise belonging to the inn and in ten days the doctor privately reported him as fit to travel toward the close of that tenth day mr brock met allan and his new friend enjoying the last gleams of wintry sunshine in one of the inland lanes he waited until the two had separated and then followed the usher on his way back to the inn  the rectors resolution to speak pitilessly to the purpose was in some danger of failing him as he drew nearer and nearer to the friendless man and saw how feebly he still walked how loosely his worn coat hung about him and how heavily he leaned on his cheap clumsy stick humanely reluctant to say the decisive words too precipitately mr brock tried him first with a little compliment on the range of his reading as shown by the volume of sophocles and the volume of goethe which had been found in his bag and asked how long he had been acquainted with german and greek the quick ear of midwinter detected something wrong in the tone of mr brocks voice he turned in the darkening twilight and looked suddenly and suspiciously in the rectors face  you have something to say to me he answered and it is not what you are saying now  there was no help for it but to accept the challenge very delicately with many preparatory words to which the other listened in unbroken silence mr brock came little by little nearer and nearer to the point long before he had really reached itlong before a man of no more than ordinary sensibility would have felt what was comingozias midwinter stood still in the lane and told the rector that he need say no more  i understand you sir said the usher mr armadale has an ascertained position in the world mr armadale has nothing to conceal and nothing to be ashamed of i agree with you that i am not a fit companion for him the best return i can make for his kindness is to presume on it no longer you may depend on my leaving this place tomorrow morning  he spoke no word more he would hear no word more with a selfcontrol which at his years and with his temperament was nothing less than marvelous he civilly took off his hat bowed and returned to the inn by himself  mr brock slept badly that night the issue of the interview in the lane had made the problem of ozias midwinter a harder problem to solve than ever  early the next morning a letter was brought to the rector from the inn and the messenger announced that the strange gentleman had taken his departure the letter inclosed an open note addressed to allan and requested allans tutor after first reading it himself to forward it or not at his own sole discretion the note was a startlingly short one it began and ended in a dozen words dont blame mr brock mr brock is right thank you and goodbyo m  the rector forwarded the note to its proper destination as a matter of course and sent a few lines to mrs armadale at the same time to quiet her anxiety by the news of the ushers departure this done he waited the visit from his pupil which would probably follow the delivery of the note in no very tranquil frame of mind there might or might not be some deep motive at the bottom of midwinters conduct but thus far it was impossible to deny that he had behaved in such a manner as to rebuke the rectors distrust and to justify allans good opinion of him  the morning wore on and young armadale never appeared after looking for him vainly in the yard where the yacht was building mr brock went to mrs armadales house and there heard news from the servant which turned his steps in the direction of the inn the landlord at once acknowledged the truth young mr armadale had come there with an open letter in his hand and had insisted on being informed of the road which his friend had taken for the first time in the landlords experience of him the young gentleman was out of temper and the girl who waited on the customers had stupidly mentioned a circumstance which had added fuel to the fire she had acknowledged having heard mr midwinter lock himself into his room overnight and burst into a violent fit of crying that trifling particular had set mr armadales face all of a flame he had shouted and sworn he had rushed into the stables and forced the hostler to saddle him a horse and had set off full gallop on the road that ozias midwinter had taken before him  after cautioning the landlord to keep allans conduct a secret if any of mrs armadales servants came that morning to the inn mr brock went home again and waited anxiously to see what the day would bring forth  to his infinite relief his pupil appeared at the rectory late in the afternoon  allan looked and spoke with a dogged determination which was quite new in his old friends experience of him without waiting to be questioned he told his story in his usual straightforward way he had overtaken midwinter on the road andafter trying vainly first to induce him to return then to find out where he was going tohad threatened to keep company with him for the rest of the day and had so extorted the confession that he was going to try his luck in london having gained this point allan had asked next for his friends address in london had been entreated by the other not to press his request had pressed it nevertheless with all his might and had got the address at last by making an appeal to midwinters gratitude for which feeling heartily ashamed of himself he had afterward asked midwinters pardon i like the poor fellow and i wont give him up concluded allan bringing his clinched fist down with a thump on the rectory table dont be afraid of my vexing my mother ill leave you to speak to her mr brock at your own time and in your own way and ill just say this much more by way of bringing the thing to an end here is the address safe in my pocketbook and here am i standing firm for once on a resolution of my own ill give you and my mother time to reconsider this and when the time is up if my friend midwinter doesnt come to me ill go to my friend midwinter  so the matter rested for the present and such was the result of turning the castaway usher adrift in the world again    a month passed and brought in the new year51 overleaping that short lapse of time mr brock paused with a heavy heart at the next event to his mind the one mournful the one memorable event of the seriesmrs armadales death  the first warning of the affliction that was near at hand had followed close on the ushers departure in december and had arisen out of a circumstance which dwelt painfully on the rectors memory from that time forth  but three days after midwinter had left for london mr brock was accosted in the village by a neatly dressed woman wearing a gown and bonnet of black silk and a red paisley shawl who was a total stranger to him and who inquired the way to mrs armadales house she put the question without raising the thick black veil that hung over her face mr brock in giving her the necessary directions observed that she was a remarkably elegant and graceful woman and looked after her as she bowed and left him wondering who mrs armadales visitor could possibly be  a quarter of an hour later the lady still veiled as before passed mr brock again close to the inn she entered the house and spoke to the landlady seeing the landlord shortly afterward hurrying round to the stables mr brock asked him if the lady was going away yes she had come from the railway in the omnibus but she was going back again more creditably in a carriage of her own hiring supplied by the inn  the rector proceeded on his walk rather surprised to find his thoughts running inquisitively on a woman who was a stranger to him when he got home again he found the village surgeon waiting his return with an urgent message from allans mother about an hour since the surgeon had been sent for in great haste to see mrs armadale he had found her suffering from an alarming nervous attack brought on as the servants suspected by an unexpected and possibly an unwelcome visitor who had called that morning the surgeon had done all that was needful and had no apprehension of any dangerous results finding his patient eagerly desirous on recovering herself to see mr brock immediately he had thought it important to humor her and had readily undertaken to call at the rectory with a message to that effect  looking at mrs armadale with a far deeper interest in her than the surgeons interest mr brock saw enough in her face when it turned toward him on his entering the room to justify instant and serious alarm she allowed him no opportunity of soothing her she heeded none of his inquiries answers to certain questions of her own were what she wanted and what she was determined to have had mr brock seen the woman who had presumed to visit her that morning yes had allan seen her no allan had been at work since breakfast and was at work still in his yard by the waterside  this latter reply appeared to quiet mrs armadale for the moment she put her next questionthe most extraordinary question of the threemore composedly did the rector think allan would object to leaving his vessel for the present and to accompanying his mother on a journey to look out for a new house in some other part of england in the greatest amazement mr brock asked what reason there could possibly be for leaving her present residence mrs armadales reason when she gave it only added to his surprise the womans first visit might be followed by a second and rather than see her again rather than run the risk of allans seeing her and speaking to her mrs armadale would leave england if necessary and end her days in a foreign land taking counsel of his experience as a magistrate mr brock inquired if the woman had come to ask for money yes respectably as she was dressed she had described herself as being in distress had asked for money and had got it but the money was of no importance the one thing needful was to get away before the woman came again more and more surprised mr brock ventured on another question was it long since mrs armadale and her visitor had last met yes longer than all allans lifetimeas long ago as the year before allan was born  at that reply the rector shifted his ground and took counsel next of his experience as a friend  is this person he asked connected in any way with the painful remembrances of your early life  yes with the painful remembrance of the time when i was married said mrs armadale she was associated as a mere child with a circumstance which i must think of with shame and sorrow to my dying day  mr brock noticed the altered tone in which his old friend spoke and the unwillingness with which she gave her answer  can you tell me more about her without referring to yourself he went on i am sure i can protect you if you will only help me a little her name for instanceyou can tell me her name  mrs armadale shook her head the name i knew her by she said would be of no use to you she has been married since then she told me so herself  and without telling you her married name  she refused to tell it  do you know anything of her friends  only of her friends when she was a child they called themselves her uncle and aunt they were low people and they deserted her at the school on my fathers estate we never heard any more of them  did she remain under your fathers care  she remained under my care that is to say she traveled with us we were leaving england just as that time for madeira i had my fathers leave to take her with me and to train the wretch to be my maid  at those words mrs armadale stopped confusedly mr brock tried gently to lead her on it was useless she started up in violent agitation and walked excitedly backward and forward in the room  dont ask me any more she cried out in loud angry tones i parted with her when she was a girl of twelve years old i never saw her again i never heard of her again from that time to this i dont know how she has discovered me after all the years that have passed i only know that she has discovered me she will find her way to allan next she will poison my sons mind against me help me to get away from her help me to take allan away before she comes back  the rector asked no more questions it would have been cruel to press her further the first necessity was to compose her by promising compliance with all that she desired the second was to induce her to see another medical man mr brock contrived to reach his end harmlessly in this latter case by reminding her that she wanted strength to travel and that her own medical attendant might restore her all the more speedily to herself if he were assisted by the best professional advice having overcome her habitual reluctance to seeing strangers by this means the rector at once went to allan and delicately concealing what mrs armadale had said at the interview broke the news to him that his mother was seriously ill allan would hear of no messengers being sent for assistance he drove off on the spot to the railway and telegraphed himself to bristol for medical help  on the next morning the help came and mr brocks worst fears were confirmed the village surgeon had fatally misunderstood the case from the first and the time was past now at which his errors of treatment might have been set right the shock of the previous morning had completed the mischief mrs armadales days were numbered  the son who dearly loved her the old friend to whom her life was precious hoped vainly to the last in a month from the physicians visit all hope was over and allan shed the first bitter tears of his life at his mothers grave  she had died more peacefully than mr brock had dared to hope leaving all her little fortune to her son and committing him solemnly to the care of her one friend on earth the rector had entreated her to let him write and try to reconcile her brothers with her before it was too late she had only answered sadly that it was too late already but one reference escaped her in her last illness to those early sorrows which had weighed heavily on all her afterlife and which had passed thrice already like shadows of evil between the rector and herself even on her deathbed she had shrunk from letting the light fall clearly on the story of the past she had looked at allan kneeling by the bedside and had whispered to mr brock never let his namesake come near him never let that woman find him out no word more fell from her that touched on the misfortunes which had tried her in the past or on the dangers which she dreaded in the future the secret which she had kept from her son and from her friend was a secret which she carried with her to the grave  when the last offices of affection and respect had been performed mr brock felt it his duty as executor to the deceased lady to write to her brothers and to give them information of her death believing that he had to deal with two men who would probably misinterpret his motives if he left allans position unexplained he was careful to remind them that mrs armadales son was well provided for and that the object of his letter was simply to communicate the news of their sisters decease the two letters were dispatched toward the middle of january and by return of post the answers were received the first which the rector opened was written not by the elder brother but by the elder brothers only son the young man had succeeded to the estates in norfolk on his fathers death some little time since he wrote in a frank and friendly spirit assuring mr brock that however strongly his father might have been prejudiced against mrs armadale the hostile feeling had never extended to her son for himself he had only to add that he would be sincerely happy to welcome his cousin to thorpe ambrose whenever his cousin came that way  the second letter was a far less agreeable reply to receive than the first the younger brother was still alive and still resolute neither to forget nor forgive he informed mr brock that his deceased sisters choice of a husband and her conduct to her father at the time of her marriage had made any relations of affection or esteem impossible on his side from that time forth holding the opinions he did it would be equally painful to his nephew and himself if any personal intercourse took place between them he had adverted as generally as possible to the nature of the differences which had kept him apart from his late sister in order to satisfy mr brocks mind that a personal acquaintance with young mr armadale was as a matter of delicacy quite out of the question and having done this he would beg leave to close the correspondence  mr brock wisely destroyed the second letter on the spot and after showing allan his cousins invitation suggested that he should go to thorpe ambrose as soon as he felt fit to present himself to strangers  allan listened to the advice patiently enough but he declined to profit by it i will shake hands with my cousin willingly if i ever meet him he said but i will visit no family and be a guest in no house in which my mother has been badly treated mr brock remonstrated gently and tried to put matters in their proper light even at that timeeven while he was still ignorant of events which were then impendingallans strangely isolated position in the world was a subject of serious anxiety to his old friend and tutor the proposed visit to thorpe ambrose opened the very prospect of his making friends and connections suited to him in rank and age which mr brock most desired to see but allan was not to be persuaded he was obstinate and unreasonable and the rector had no alternative but to drop the subject  one on another the weeks passed monotonously and allan showed but little of the elasticity of his age and character in bearing the affliction that had made him motherless he finished and launched his yacht but his own journeymen remarked that the work seemed to have lost its interest for him it was not natural to the young man to brood over his solitude and his grief as he was brooding now as the spring advanced mr brock began to feel uneasy about the future if allan was not roused at once by change of scene after much pondering the rector decided on trying a trip to paris and on extending the journey southward if his companion showed an interest in continental traveling allans reception of the proposal made atonement for his obstinacy in refusing to cultivate his cousins acquaintance he was willing to go with mr brock wherever mr brock pleased the rector took him at his word and in the middle of march the two strangely assorted companions left for london on their way to paris  arrived in london mr brock found himself unexpectedly face to face with a new anxiety the unwelcome subject of ozias midwinter which had been buried in peace since the beginning of december rose to the surface again and confronted the rector at the very outset of his travels more unmanageably than ever  mr brocks position in dealing with this difficult matter had been hard enough to maintain when he had first meddled with it he now found himself with no vantageground left to stand on events had so ordered it that the difference of opinion between allan and his mother on the subject of the usher was entirely disassociated with the agitation which had hastened mrs armadales death allans resolution to say no irritating words and mr brocks reluctance to touch on a disagreeable topic had kept them both silent about midwinter in mrs armadales presence during the three days which had intervened between that persons departure and the appearance of the strange woman in the village in the period of suspense and suffering that had followed no recurrence to the subject of the usher had been possible and none had taken place free from all mental disquietude on this score allan had stoutly preserved his perverse interest in his new friend he had written to tell midwinter of his affliction and he now proposed unless the rector formally objected to it paying a visit to his friend before he started for paris the next morning  what was mr brock to do there was no denying that midwinters conduct had pleaded unanswerably against poor mrs armadales unfounded distrust of him if the rector with no convincing reason to allege against it and with no right to interfere but the right which allans courtesy gave him declined to sanction the proposed visit then farewell to all the old sociability and confidence between tutor and pupil on the contemplated tour environed by difficulties which might have been possibly worsted by a less just and a less kindhearted man mr brock said a cautious word or two at parting and with more confidence in midwinters discretion and selfdenial than he quite liked to acknowledge even to himself left allan free to take his own way  after whiling away an hour during the interval of his pupils absence by a walk in the streets the rector returned to his hotel and finding the newspaper disengaged in the coffeeroom sat down absently to look over it his eye resting idly on the titlepage was startled into instant attention by the very first advertisement that it chanced to light on at the head of the column there was allans mysterious namesake again figuring in capital letters and associated this time in the character of a dead man with the offer of a pecuniary reward thus it ran   supposed to be deadto parish clerks sextons and others twenty pounds reward will be paid to any person who can produce evidence of the death of allan armadale only son of the late allan armadale of barbadoes and born in trinidad in the year 1830 further particulars on application to messrs hammick and ridge lincolns inn fields london   even mr brocks essentially unimaginative mind began to stagger superstitiously in the dark as he laid the newspaper down again little by little a vague suspicion took possession of him that the whole series of events which had followed the first appearance of allans namesake in the newspaper six years since was held together by some mysterious connection and was tending steadily to some unimaginable end without knowing why he began to feel uneasy at allans absence without knowing why he became impatient to get his pupil away from england before anything else happened between night and morning  in an hour more the rector was relieved of all immediate anxiety by allans return to the hotel the young man was vexed and out of spirits he had discovered midwinters lodgings but he had failed to find midwinter himself the only account his landlady could give of him was that he had gone out at his customary time to get his dinner at the nearest eatinghouse and that he had not returned in accordance with his usual regular habits at his usual regular hour allan had therefore gone to inquire at the eatinghouse and had found on describing him that midwinter was well known there it was his custom on other days to take a frugal dinner and to sit half an hour afterward reading the newspaper on this occasion after dining he had taken up the paper as usual had suddenly thrown it aside again and had gone nobody knew where in a violent hurry no further information being attainable allan had left a note at the lodgings giving his address at the hotel and begging midwinter to come and say goodby before his departure for paris  the evening passed and allans invisible friend never appeared the morning came bringing no obstacles with it and mr brock and his pupil left london so far fortune had declared herself at last on the rectors side ozias midwinter after intrusively rising to the surface had conveniently dropped out of sight again what was to happen next    advancing once more by three weeks only from past to present mr brocks memory took up the next event on the seventh of april to all appearance the chain was now broken at last the new event had no recognizable connection either to his mind or to allans with any of the persons who had appeared or any of the circumstances that had happened in the bygone time  the travelers had as yet got no further than paris allans spirits had risen with the change and he had been made all the readier to enjoy the novelty of the scene around him by receiving a letter from midwinter containing news which mr brock himself acknowledged promised fairly for the future the exusher had been away on business when allan had called at his lodgings having been led by an accidental circumstance to open communications with his relatives on that day the result had taken him entirely by surprise it had unexpectedly secured to him a little income of his own for the rest of his life his future plans now that this piece of good fortune had fallen to his share were still unsettled but if allan wished to hear what he ultimately decided on his agent in london whose direction he inclosed would receive communications for him and would furnish mr armadale at all future times with his address  on receipt of this letter allan had seized the pen in his usual headlong way and had insisted on midwinters immediately joining mr brock and himself on their travels the last days of march passed and no answer to the proposal was received the first days of april came and on the seventh of the month there was a letter for allan at last on the breakfasttable he snatched it up looked at the address and threw the letter down again impatiently the handwriting was not midwinters allan finished his breakfast before he cared to read what his correspondent had to say to him  the meal over young armadale lazily opened the letter he began it with an expression of supreme indifference he finished it with a sudden leap out of his chair and a loud shout of astonishment wondering as he well might at this extraordinary outbreak mr brock took up the letter which allan had tossed across the table to him before he had come to the end of it his hands dropped helplessly on his knees and the blank bewilderment of his pupils expression was accurately reflected on his own face  if ever two men had good cause for being thrown completely off their balance allan and the rector were those two the letter which had struck them both with the same shock of astonishment did beyond all question contain an announcement which on a first discovery of it was simply incredible the news was from norfolk and was to this effect in little more than one weeks time death had mown down no less than three lives in the family at thorpe ambrose and allan armadale was at that moment heir to an estate of eight thousand a year  a second perusal of the letter enabled the rector and his companion to master the details which had escaped them on a first reading  the writer was the family lawyer at thorpe ambrose after announcing to allan the deaths of his cousin arthur at the age of twentyfive of his uncle henry at the age of fortyeight and of his cousin john at the age of twentyone the lawyer proceeded to give a brief abstract of the terms of the elder mr blanchards will the claims of male issue were as is not unusual in such cases preferred to the claims of female issue failing arthur and his issue male the estate was left to henry and his issue male failing them it went to the issue male of henrys sister and in default of such issue to the next heir male as events had happened the two young men arthur and john had died unmarried and henry blanchard had died leaving no surviving child but a daughter under these circumstances allan was the next heir male pointed at by the will and was now legally successor to the thorpe ambrose estate having made this extraordinary announcement the lawyer requested to be favored with mr armadales instructions and added in conclusion that he would be happy to furnish any further particulars that were desired  it was useless to waste time in wondering at an event which neither allan nor his mother had ever thought of as even remotely possible the only thing to be done was to go back to england at once the next day found the travelers installed once more in their london hotel and the day after the affair was placed in the proper professional hands the inevitable corresponding and consulting ensued and one by one the allimportant particulars flowed in until the measure of information was pronounced to be full  this was the strange story of the three deaths  at the time when mr brock had written to mrs armadales relatives to announce the news of her decease that is to say in the middle of the month of january the family at thorpe ambrose numbered five personsarthur blanchard in possession of the estate living in the great house with his mother and henry blanchard the uncle living in the neighborhood a widower with two children a son and a daughter to cement the family connection still more closely arthur blanchard was engaged to be married to his cousin the wedding was to be celebrated with great local rejoicings in the coming summer when the young lady had completed her twentieth year  the month of february had brought changes with it in the family position observing signs of delicacy in the health of his son mr henry blanchard left norfolk taking the young man with him under medical advice to try the climate of italy early in the ensuing month of march arthur blanchard also left thorpe ambrose for a few days only on business which required his presence in london the business took him into the city annoyed by the endless impediments in the streets he returned westward by one of the river steamers and so returning met his death  as the steamer left the wharf he noticed a woman near him who had shown a singular hesitation in embarking and who had been the last of the passengers to take her place in the vessel she was neatly dressed in black silk with a red paisley shawl over her shoulders and she kept her face hidden behind a thick veil arthur blanchard was struck by the rare grace and elegance of her figure and he felt a young mans passing curiosity to see her face she neither lifted her veil nor turned her head his way after taking a few steps hesitatingly backward and forward on the deck she walked away on a sudden to the stern of the vessel in a minute more there was a cry of alarm from the man at the helm and the engines were stopped immediately the woman had thrown herself overboard  the passengers all rushed to the side of the vessel to look arthur blanchard alone without an instants hesitation jumped into the river he was an excellent swimmer and he reached the woman as she rose again to the surface after sinking for the first time help was at hand and they were both brought safely ashore the woman was taken to the nearest police station and was soon restored to her senses her preserver giving his name and address as usual in such cases to the inspector on duty who wisely recommended him to get into a warm bath and to send to his lodgings for dry clothes arthur blanchard who had never known an hours illness since he was a child laughed at the caution and went back in a cab the next day he was too ill to attend the examination before the magistrate a fortnight afterward he was a dead man  the news of the calamity reached henry blanchard and his son at milan and within an hour of the time when they received it they were on their way back to england the snow on the alps had loosened earlier than usual that year and the passes were notoriously dangerous the father and son traveling in their own carriage were met on the mountain by the mail returning after sending the letters on by hand warnings which would have produced their effect under any ordinary circumstances were now vainly addressed to the two englishmen their impatience to be at home again after the catastrophe which had befallen their family brooked no delay bribes lavishly offered to the postilions tempted them to go on the carriage pursued its way and was lost to view in the mist when it was seen again it was disinterred from the bottom of a precipicethe men the horses and the vehicle all crushed together under the wreck and ruin of an avalanche  so the three lives were mown down by death so in a clear sequence of events a womans suicideleap into a river had opened to allan armadale the succession to the thorpe ambrose estates  who was the woman the man who saved her life never knew the magistrate who remanded her the chaplain who exhorted her the reporter who exhibited her in print never knew it was recorded of her with surprise that though most respectably dressed she had nevertheless described herself as being in distress she had expressed the deepest contrition but had persisted in giving a name which was on the face of it a false one in telling a commonplace story which was manifestly an invention and in refusing to the last to furnish any clew to her friends a lady connected with a charitable institution interested by her extreme elegance and beauty had volunteered to take charge of her and to bring her into a better frame of mind the first days experience of the penitent had been far from cheering and the second days experience had been conclusive she had left the institution by stealth andthough the visiting clergyman taking a special interest in the case had caused special efforts to be madeall search after her from that time forth had proved fruitless  while this useless investigation undertaken at allans express desire was in progress the lawyers had settled the preliminary formalities connected with the succession to the property all that remained was for the new master of thorpe ambrose to decide when he would personally establish himself on the estate of which he was now the legal possessor  left necessarily to his own guidance in this matter allan settled it for himself in his usual hotheaded generous way he positively declined to take possession until mrs blanchard and her niece who had been permitted thus far as a matter of courtesy to remain in their old home had recovered from the calamity that had befallen them and were fit to decide for themselves what their future proceedings should be a private correspondence followed this resolution comprehending on allans side unlimited offers of everything he had to give in a house which he had not yet seen and on the ladies side a discreetly reluctant readiness to profit by the young gentlemans generosity in the matter of time to the astonishment of his legal advisers allan entered their office one morning accompanied by mr brock and announced with perfect composure that the ladies had been good enough to take his own arrangements off his hands and that in deference to their convenience he meant to defer establishing himself at thorpe ambrose till that day two months the lawyers stared at allan and allan returning the compliment stared at the lawyers  what on earth are you wondering at gentlemen he inquired with a boyish bewilderment in his goodhumored blue eyes why shouldnt i give the ladies their two months if the ladies want them let the poor things take their own time and welcome my rights and my position oh pooh pooh im in no hurry to be squire of the parish its not in my way what do i mean to do for the two months what i should have done anyhow whether the ladies had stayed or not i mean to go cruising at sea thats what i like ive got a new yacht at home in somersetshirea yacht of my own building and ill tell you what sir continued allan seizing the head partner by the arm in the fervor of his friendly intentions you look sadly in want of a holiday in the fresh air and you shall come along with me on the trial trip of my new vessel and your partners too if they like and the head clerk who is the best fellow i ever met with in my life plenty of roomwell all shake down together on the floor and well give mr brock a rug on the cabin table thorpe ambrose be hanged do you mean to say if you had built a vessel yourself as i have you would go to any estate in the three kingdoms while your own little beauty was sitting like a duck on the water at home and waiting for you to try her you legal gentlemen are great hands at argument what do you think of that argument i think its unanswerableand im off to somersetshire tomorrow  with those words the new possessor of eight thousand a year dashed into the head clerks office and invited that functionary to a cruise on the high seas with a smack on the shoulder which was heard distinctly by his masters in the next room the firm looked in interrogative wonder at mr brock a client who could see a position among the landed gentry of england waiting for him without being in a hurry to occupy it at the earliest possible opportunity was a client of whom they possessed no previous experience  he must have been very oddly brought up said the lawyers to the rector  very oddly said the rector to the lawyers  a last leap over one month more brought mr brock to the present timeto the bedroom at castletown in which he was sitting thinking and to the anxiety which was obstinately intruding itself between him and his nights rest that anxiety was no unfamiliar enemy to the rectors peace of mind it had first found him out in somersetshire six months since and it had now followed him to the isle of man under the inveterately obtrusive form of ozias midwinter  the change in allans future prospects had worked no corresponding alteration in his perverse fancy for the castaway at the village inn in the midst of the consultations with the lawyers he had found time to visit midwinter and on the journey back with the rector there was allans friend in the carriage returning with them to somersetshire by allans own invitation  the exushers hair had grown again on his shaven skull and his dress showed the renovating influence of an accession of pecuniary means but in all other respects the man was unchanged he met mr brocks distrust with the old uncomplaining resignation to it he maintained the same suspicious silence on the subject of his relatives and his early life he spoke of allans kindness to him with the same undisciplined fervor of gratitude and surprise i have done what i could sir he said to mr brock while allan was asleep in the railway carriage i have kept out of mr armadales way and i have not even answered his last letter to me more than that is more than i can do i dont ask you to consider my own feeling toward the only human creature who has never suspected and never illtreated me i can resist my own feeling but i cant resist the young gentleman himself theres not another like him in the world if we are to be parted again it must be his doing or yoursnot mine the dogs master has whistled said this strange man with a momentary outburst of the hidden passion in him and a sudden springing of angry tears in his wild brown eyes and it is hard sir to blame the dog when the dog comes  once more mr brocks humanity got the better of mr brocks caution he determined to wait and see what the coming days of social intercourse might bring forth  the days passed the yacht was rigged and fitted for sea a cruise was arranged to the welsh coastand midwinter the secret was the same midwinter still confinement on board a little vessel of fiveandthirty tons offered no great attraction to a man of mr brocks time of life but he sailed on the trial trip of the yacht nevertheless rather than trust allan alone with his new friend  would the close companionship of the three on their cruise tempt the man into talking of his own affairs no he was ready enough on other subjects especially if allan led the way to them but not a word escaped him about himself mr brock tried him with questions about his recent inheritance and was answered as he had been answered once already at the somersetshire inn it was a curious coincidence midwinter admitted that mr armadales prospects and his own prospects should both have unexpectedly changed for the better about the same time but there the resemblance ended it was no large fortune that had fallen into his lap though it was enough for his wants it had not reconciled him with his relations for the money had not come to him as a matter of kindness but as a matter of right as for the circumstance which had led to his communicating with his family it was not worth mentioning seeing that the temporary renewal of intercourse which had followed had produced no friendly results nothing had come of it but the moneyand with the money an anxiety which troubled him sometimes when he woke in the small hours of the morning  at those last words he became suddenly silent as if for once his wellguarded tongue had betrayed him  mr brock seized the opportunity and bluntly asked him what the nature of the anxiety might be did it relate to money no it related to a letter which had been waiting for him for many years had he received the letter not yet it had been left under charge of one of the partners in the firm which had managed the business of his inheritance for him the partner had been absent from england and the letter locked up among his own private papers could not be got at till he returned he was expected back toward the latter part of that present may and if midwinter could be sure where the cruise would take them to at the close of the month he thought he would write and have the letter forwarded had he any family reasons to be anxious about it none that he knew of he was curious to see what had been waiting for him for many years and that was all so he answered the rectors questions with his tawny face turned away over the low bulwark of the yacht and his fishingline dragging in his supple brown hands  favored by wind and weather the little vessel had done wonders on her trial trip before the period fixed for the duration of the cruise had half expired the yacht was as high up on the welsh coast as holyhead and allan eager for adventure in unknown regions had declared boldly for an extension of the voyage northward to the isle of man having ascertained from reliable authority that the weather really promised well for a cruise in that quarter and that in the event of any unforeseen necessity for return the railway was accessible by the steamer from douglas to liverpool mr brock agreed to his pupils proposal by that nights post he wrote to allans lawyers and to his own rectory indicating douglas in the isle of man as the next address to which letters might be forwarded at the postoffice he met midwinter who had just dropped a letter into the box remembering what he had said on board the yacht mr brock concluded that they had both taken the same precaution and had ordered their correspondence to be forwarded to the same place  late the next day they set sail for the isle of man  for a few hours all went well but sunset brought with it the signs of a coming change with the darkness the wind rose to a gale and the question whether allan and his journeymen had or had not built a stout seaboat was seriously tested for the first time all that night after trying vainly to bear up for holyhead the little vessel kept the sea and stood her trial bravely the next morning the isle of man was in view and the yacht was safe at castletown a survey by daylight of hull and rigging showed that all the damage done might be set right again in a weeks time the cruising party had accordingly remained at castletown allan being occupied in superintending the repairs mr brock in exploring the neighborhood and midwinter in making daily pilgrimages on foot to douglas and back to inquire for letters  the first of the cruising party who received a letter was allan more worries from those everlasting lawyers was all he said when he had read the letter and had crumpled it up in his pocket the rectors turn came next before the weeks sojourn at castletown had expired on the fifth day he found a letter from somersetshire waiting for him at the hotel it had been brought there by midwinter and it contained news which entirely overthrew all mr brocks holiday plans the clergyman who had undertaken to do duty for him in his absence had been unexpectedly summoned home again and mr brock had no choice the day of the week being friday but to cross the next morning from douglass to liverpool and get back by railway on saturday night in time for sundays service  having read his letter and resigned himself to his altered circumstances as patiently as he might the rector passed next to a question that pressed for serious consideration in its turn burdened with his heavy responsibility toward allan and conscious of his own undiminished distrust of allans new friend how was he to act in the emergency that now beset him toward the two young men who had been his companions on the cruise  mr brock had first asked himself that awkward question on the friday afternoon and he was still trying vainly to answer it alone in his own room at one oclock on the saturday morning it was then only the end of may and the residence of the ladies at thorpe ambrose unless they chose to shorten it of their own accord would not expire till the middle of june even if the repairs of the yacht had been completed which was not the case there was no possible pretense for hurrying allan back to somersetshire but one other alternative remainedto leave him where he was in other words to leave him at the turningpoint of his life under the sole influence of a man whom he had first met with as a castaway at a village inn and who was still to all practical purposes a total stranger to him  in despair of obtaining any better means of enlightenment to guide his decision mr brock reverted to the impression which midwinter had produced on his own mind in the familiarity of the cruise  young as he was the exusher had evidently lived a varied life he could speak of books like a man who had really enjoyed them he could take his turn at the helm like a sailor who knew his duty he could cook and climb the rigging and lay the cloth for dinner with an odd delight in the exhibition of his own dexterity the display of these and other qualities like them as his spirits rose with the cruise had revealed the secret of his attraction for allan plainly enough but had all disclosures rested there had the man let no chance light in on his character in the rectors presence very little and that little did not set him forth in a morally alluring aspect his way in the world had lain evidently in doubtful places familiarity with the small villainies of vagabonds peeped out of him now and then and more significant still he habitually slept the light suspicious sleep of a man who has been accustomed to close his eyes in doubt of the company under the same roof with him down to the very latest moment of the rectors experience of himdown to that present friday nighthis conduct had been persistently secret and unaccountable to the very last after bringing mr brocks letter to the hotel he had mysterious disappeared from the house without leaving any message for his companions and without letting anybody see whether he had or had not received a letter himself at nightfall he had come back stealthily in the darkness had been caught on the stairs by allan eager to tell him of the change in the rectors plans had listened to the news without a word of remark and had ended by sulkily locking himself into his own room what was there in his favor to set against such revelations of his character as theseagainst his wandering eyes his obstinate reserve with the rector his ominous silence on the subject of family and friends little or nothing the sum of all his merits began and ended with his gratitude to allan   mr brock left his seat on the side of the bed trimmed his candle and still lost in his own thoughts looked out absently at the night the change of place brought no new ideas with it his retrospect over his own past life had amply satisfied him that his present sense of responsibility rested on no merely fanciful grounds and having brought him to that point had left him there standing at the window and seeing nothing but the total darkness in his own mind faithfully reflected by the total darkness of the night  if i only had a friend to apply to thought the rector if i could only find some one to help me in this miserable place  at the moment when the aspiration crossed his mind it was suddenly answered by a low knock at the door and a voice said softly in the passage outside let me come in  after an instants pause to steady his nerves mr brock opened the door and found himself at one oclock in the morning standing face to face on the threshold of his own bedroom with ozias midwinter  are you ill asked the rector as soon as his astonishment would allow him to speak  i have come here to make a clean breast of it was the strange answer will you let me in  with those words he walked into the room his eyes on the ground his lips ashy pale and his hand holding something hidden behind him  i saw the light under your door he went on without looking up and without moving his hand and i know the trouble on your mind which is keeping you from your rest you are going away tomorrow morning and you dont like leaving mr armadale alone with a stranger like me  startled as he was mr brock saw the serious necessity of being plain with a man who had come at that time and had said those words to him  you have guessed right he answered i stand in the place of a father to allan armadale and i am naturally unwilling to leave him at his age with a man whom i dont know  ozias midwinter took a step forward to the table his wandering eyes rested on the rectors new testament which was one of the objects lying on it  you have read that book in the years of a long life to many congregations he said has it taught you mercy to your miserable fellowcreatures  without waiting to be answered he looked mr brock in the face for the first time and brought his hidden hand slowly into view  read that he said and for christs sake pity me when you know who i am  he laid a letter of many pages on the table it was the letter that mr neal had posted at wildbad nineteen years since     ii the man revealed  the first cool breathings of the coming dawn fluttered through the open window as mr brock read the closing lines of the confession he put it from him in silence without looking up the first shock of discovery had struck his mind and had passed away again at his age and with his habits of thought his grasp was not strong enough to hold the whole revelation that had fallen on him all his heart when he closed the manuscript was with the memory of the woman who had been the beloved friend of his later and happier life all his thoughts were busy with the miserable secret of her treason to her own father which the letter had disclosed  he was startled out of the narrow limits of his own little grief by the vibration of the table at which he sat under a hand that was laid on it heavily the instinct of reluctance was strong in him but he conquered it and looked up there silently confronting him in the mixed light of the yellow candle flame and the faint gray dawn stood the castaway of the village innthe inheritor of the fatal armadale name  mr brock shuddered as the terror of the present time and the darker terror yet of the future that might be coming rushed back on him at the sight of the mans face the man saw it and spoke first  is my fathers crime looking at you out of my eyes he asked has the ghost of the drowned man followed me into the room  the suffering and the passion that he was forcing back shook the hand that he still kept on the table and stifled the voice in which he spoke until it sank to a whisper  i have no wish to treat you otherwise than justly and kindly answered mr brock do me justice on my side and believe that i am incapable of cruelly holding you responsible for your fathers crime  the reply seemed to compose him he bowed his head in silence and took up the confession from the table  have you read this through he asked quietly  every word of it from first to last  have i dealt openly with you so far has ozias midwinter  do you still call yourself by that name interrupted mr brock now your true name is known to me  since i have read my fathers confession was the answer i like my ugly alias better than ever allow me to repeat the question which i was about to put to you a minute since has ozias midwinter done his best thus far to enlighten mr brock  the rector evaded a direct reply few men in your position he said would have had the courage to show me that letter  dont be too sure sir of the vagabond you picked up at the inn till you know a little more of him than you know now you have got the secret of my birth but you are not in possession yet of the story of my life you ought to know it and you shall know it before you leave me alone with mr armadale will you wait and rest a little while or shall i tell it you now  now said mr brock still as far away as ever from knowing the real character of the man before him  everything ozias midwinter said everything ozias midwinter did was against him he had spoken with a sardonic indifference almost with an insolence of tone which would have repelled the sympathies of any man who heard him and now instead of placing himself at the table and addressing his story directly to the rector he withdrew silently and ungraciously to the windowseat there he sat his face averted his hands mechanically turning the leaves of his fathers letter till he came to the last with his eyes fixed on the closing lines of the manuscript and with a strange mixture of recklessness and sadness in his voice he began his promised narrative in these words   the first thing you know of me he said is what my fathers confession has told you already he mentions here that i was a child asleep on his breast when he spoke his last words in this world and when a strangers hand wrote them down for him at his deathbed that strangers name as you may have noticed is signed on the coveralexander neal writer to the signet edinburgh the first recollection i have is of alexander neal beating me with a horsewhip i dare say i deserved it in the character of my stepfather  have you no recollection of your mother at the same time asked mr brock  yes i remember her having shabby old clothes made up to fit me and having fine new frocks bought for her two children by her second husband i remember the servants laughing at me in my old things and the horsewhip finding its way to my shoulders again for losing my temper and tearing my shabby clothes my next recollection gets on to a year or two later i remember myself locked up in a lumberroom with a bit of bread and a mug of water wondering what it was that made my mother and my stepfather seem to hate the very sight of me i never settled that question till yesterday and then i solved the mystery when my fathers letter was put into my hands my mother knew what had really happened on board the french timbership and my stepfather knew what had really happened and they were both well aware that the shameful secret which they would fain have kept from every living creature was a secret which would be one day revealed to me there was no help for itthe confession was in the executors hands and there was i an illconditioned brat with my mothers negro blood in my face and my murdering fathers passions in my heart inheritor of their secret in spite of them i dont wonder at the horsewhip now or the shabby old clothes or the bread and water in the lumberroom natural penalties all of them sir which the child was beginning to pay already for the fathers sin  mr brock looked at the swarthy secret face still obstinately turned away from him is this the stark insensibility of a vagabond he asked himself or the despair in disguise of a miserable man  school is my next recollection the other went ona cheap place in a lost corner of scotland i was left there with a bad character to help me at starting i spare you the story of the masters cane in the schoolroom and the boys kicks in the playground i dare say there was ingrained ingratitude in my nature at any rate i ran away the first person who met me asked my name i was too young and too foolish to know the importance of concealing it and as a matter of course i was taken back to school the same evening the result taught me a lesson which i have not forgotten since in a day or two more like the vagabond i was i ran away for the second time the school watchdog had had his instructions i suppose he stopped me before i got outside the gate here is his mark among the rest on the back of my hand his masters marks i cant show you they are all on my back can you believe in my perversity there was a devil in me that no dog could worry out i ran away again as soon as i left my bed and this time i got off at nightfall i found myself with a pocketful of the school oatmeal lost on a moor i lay down on the fine soft heather under the lee of a great gray rock do you think i felt lonely not i i was away from the masters cane away from my schoolfellows kicks away from my mother away from my stepfather and i lay down that night under my good friend the rock the happiest boy in all scotland  through the wretched childhood which that one significant circumstance disclosed mr brock began to see dimly how little was really strange how little really unaccountable in the character of the man who was now speaking to him  i slept soundly midwinter continued under my friend the rock when i woke in the morning i found a sturdy old man with a fiddle sitting on one side of me and two performing dogs on the other experience had made me too sharp to tell the truth when the man put his first questions he didnt press them he gave me a good breakfast out of his knapsack and he let me romp with the dogs ill tell you what he said when he had got my confidence in this manner you want three things my man you want a new father a new family and a new name ill be your father ill let you have the dogs for your brothers and if youll promise to be very careful of it ill give you my own name into the bargain ozias midwinter junior you have had a good breakfast if you want a good dinner come along with me he got up the dogs trotted after him and i trotted after the dogs who was my new father you will ask a halfbreed gypsy sir a drunkard a ruffian and a thiefand the best friend i ever had isnt a man your friend who gives you your food your shelter and your education ozias midwinter taught me to dance the highland fling to throw somersaults to walk on stilts and to sing songs to his fiddle sometimes we roamed the country and performed at fairs sometimes we tried the large towns and enlivened bad company over its cups i was a nice lively little boy of eleven years old and bad company the women especially took a fancy to me and my nimble feet i was vagabond enough to like the life the dogs and i lived together ate and drank and slept together i cant think of those poor little fourfooted brothers of mine even now without a choking in the throat many is the beating we three took together many is the hard days dancing we did together many is the night we have slept together and whimpered together on the cold hillside im not trying to distress you sir im only telling you the truth the life with all its hardships was a life that fitted me and the halfbreed gypsy who gave me his name ruffian as he was was a ruffian i liked  a man who beat you exclaimed mr brock in astonishment  didnt i tell you just now sir that i lived with the dogs and did you ever hear of a dog who liked his master the worse for beating him hundreds of thousands of miserable men women and children would have liked that man as i liked him if he had always given them what he always gave meplenty to eat it was stolen food mostly and my new gypsy father was generous with it he seldom laid the stick on us when he was sober but it diverted him to hear us yelp when he was drunk he died drunk and enjoyed his favorite amusement with his last breath one day when i had been two years in his service after giving us a good dinner out on the moor he sat down with his back against a stone and called us up to divert himself with his stick he made the dogs yelp first and then he called to me i didnt go very willingly he had been drinking harder than usual and the more he drank the better he liked his afterdinner amusement he was in high goodhumor that day and he hit me so hard that he toppled over in his drunken state with the force of his own blow he fell with his face in a puddle and lay there without moving i and the dogs stood at a distance and looked at him we thought he was feigning to get us near and have another stroke at us he feigned so long that we ventured up to him at last it took me some time to pull him over he was a heavy man when i did get him on his back he was dead we made all the outcry we could but the dogs were little and i was little and the place was lonely and no help came to us i took his fiddle and his stick i said to my two brothers come along we must get our own living now and we went away heavyhearted and left him on the moor unnatural as it may seem to you i was sorry for him i kept his ugly name through all my afterwanderings and i have enough of the old leaven left in me to like the sound of it still midwinter or armadale never mind my name now we will talk of that afterward you must know the worst of me first  why not the best of you said mr brock gently  thank you sir but i am here to tell the truth we will get on if you please to the next chapter in my story the dogs and i did badly after our masters death our luck was against us i lost one of my little brothersthe best performer of the two he was stolen and i never recovered him my fiddle and my stilts were taken from me next by main force by a tramp who was stronger than i these misfortunes drew tommy and mei beg your pardon sir i mean the dogcloser together than ever  i think we had some kind of dim foreboding on both sides that we had not done with our misfortunes yet anyhow it was not very long before we were parted forever we were neither of us thieves our master had been satisfied with teaching us to dance but we both committed an invasion of the rights of property for all that young creatures even when they are half starved cannot resist taking a run sometimes on a fine morning tommy and i could not resist taking a run into a gentlemans plantation the gentleman preserved his game and the gentlemans keeper knew his business i heard a gun go off you can guess the rest god preserve me from ever feeling such misery again as i felt when i lay down by tommy and took him dead and bloody in my arms the keeper attempted to part us i bit him like the wild animal i was he tried the stick on me next he might as well have tried it on one of the trees the noise reached the ears of two young ladies riding near the placedaughters of the gentleman on whose property i was a trespasser they were too well brought up to lift their voices against the sacred right of preserving game but they were kindhearted girls and they pitied me and took me home with them i remember the gentlemen of the house keen sportsmen all of them roaring with laughter as i went by the windows crying with my little dead dog in my arms dont suppose i complain of their laughter it did me good service it roused the indignation of the two ladies one of them took me into her own garden and showed me a place where i might bury my dog under the flowers and be sure that no other hands should ever disturb him again the other went to her father and persuaded him to give the forlorn little vagabond a chance in the house under one of the upper servants yes you have been cruising in company with a man who was once a footboy i saw you look at me when i amused mr armadale by laying the cloth on board the yacht now you know why i laid it so neatly and forgot nothing it has been my good fortune to see something of society i have helped to fill its stomach and black its boots my experience of the servants hall was not a long one before i had worn out my first suit of livery there was a scandal in the house it was the old story there is no need to tell it over again for the thousandth time loose money left on a table and not found there again all the servants with characters to appeal to except the footboy who had been rashly taken on trial well well i was lucky in that house to the last i was not prosecuted for taking what i had not only never touched but never even seen i was only turned out one morning i went in my old clothes to the grave where i had buried tommy i gave the place a kiss i said goodby to my little dead dog and there i was out in the world again at the ripe age of thirteen years  in that friendless state and at that tender age said mr brock did no thought cross your mind of going home again  i went home again sir that very nighti slept on the hillside what other home had i in a day or twos time i drifted back to the large towns and the bad company the great open country was so lonely to me now i had lost the dogs two sailors picked me up next i was a handy lad and i got a cabinboys berth on board a coastingvessel a cabinboys berth means dirt to live in offal to eat a mans work on a boys shoulders and the ropesend at regular intervals the vessel touched at a port in the hebrides i was as ungrateful as usual to my best benefactors i ran away again some women found me half dead of starvation in the northern wilds of the isle of skye it was near the coast and i took a turn with the fishermen next there was less of the ropesend among my new masters but plenty of exposure to wind and weather and hard work enough to have killed a boy who was not a seasoned tramp like me i fought through it till the winter came and then the fishermen turned me adrift again i dont blame them food was scarce and mouths were many with famine staring the whole community in the face why should they keep a boy who didnt belong to them a great city was my only chance in the wintertime so i went to glasgow and all but stepped into the lions mouth as soon as i got there i was minding an empty cart on the broomielaw when i heard my stepfathers voice on the pavement side of the horse by which i was standing he had met some person whom he knew and to my terror and surprise they were talking about me hidden behind the horse i heard enough of their conversation to know that i had narrowly escaped discovery before i went on board the coastingvessel i had met at that time with another vagabond boy of my own age we had quarreled and parted the day after my stepfathers inquiries were made in that very district and it became a question with him a good personal description being unattainable in either case which of the two boys he should follow one of them he was informed was known as brown and the other as midwinter brown was just the common name which a cunning runaway boy would be most likely to assume midwinter just the remarkable name which he would be most likely to avoid the pursuit had accordingly followed brown and had allowed me to escape i leave you to imagine whether i was not doubly and trebly determined to keep my gypsy masters name after that but my resolution did not stop here i made up my mind to leave the country altogether after a day or twos lurking about the outwardbound vessels in port i found out which sailed first and hid myself on board hunger tried hard to force me out before the pilot had left but hunger was not new to me and i kept my place the pilot was out of the vessel when i made my appearance on deck and there was nothing for it but to keep me or throw me overboard the captain said i have no doubt quite truly that he would have preferred throwing me overboard but the majesty of the law does sometimes stand the friend even of a vagabond like me in that way i came back to a sealife in that way i learned enough to make me handy and useful as i saw you noticed on board mr armadales yacht i sailed more than one voyage in more than one vessel to more than one part of the world and i might have followed the sea for life if i could only have kept my temper under every provocation that could be laid on it i had learned a great deal but not having learned that i made the last part of my last voyage home to the port of bristol in irons and i saw the inside of a prison for the first time in my life on a charge of mutinous conduct to one of my officers you have heard me with extraordinary patience sir and i am glad to tell you in return that we are not far now from the end of my story you found some books if i remember right when you searched my luggage at the somersetshire inn  mr brock answered in the affirmative  those books mark the next change in my lifeand the last before i took the ushers place at the school my term of imprisonment was not a long one perhaps my youth pleaded for me perhaps the bristol magistrates took into consideration the time i had passed in irons on board ship anyhow i was just turned seventeen when i found myself out on the world again i had no friends to receive me i had no place to go to a sailors life after what had happened was a life i recoiled from in disgust i stood in the crowd on the bridge at bristol wondering what i should do with my freedom now i had got it back whether i had altered in the prison or whether i was feeling the change in character that comes with coming manhood i dont know but the old reckless enjoyment of the old vagabond life seemed quite worn out of my nature an awful sense of loneliness kept me wandering about bristol in horror of the quiet country till after nightfall i looked at the lights kindling in the parlor windows with a miserable envy of the happy people inside a word of advice would have been worth something to me at that time well i got it a policeman advised me to move on he was quite right what else could i do i looked up at the sky and there was my old friend of many a nights watch at sea the north star all points of the compass are alike to me i thought to myself ill go your way not even the star would keep me company that night it got behind a cloud and left me alone in the rain and darkness i groped my way to a cartshed fell asleep and dreamed of old times when i served my gypsy master and lived with the dogs god what i would have given when i woke to have felt tommys little cold muzzle in my hand why am i dwelling on these things why dont i get on to the end you shouldnt encourage me sir by listening so patiently after a week more of wandering without hope to help me or prospects to look to i found myself in the streets of shrewsbury staring in at the windows of a booksellers shop an old man came to the shop door looked about him and saw me do you want a job he asked and are you not above doing it cheap the prospect of having something to do and some human creature to speak a word to tempted me and i did a days dirty work in the booksellers warehouse for a shilling more work followed at the same rate in a week i was promoted to sweep out the shop and put up the shutters in no very long time after i was trusted to carry the books out and when quarterday came and the shopman left i took his place wonderful luck you will say here i had found my way to a friend at last i had found my way to one of the most merciless misers in england and i had risen in the little world of shrewsbury by the purely commercial process of underselling all my competitors the job in the warehouse had been declined at the price by every idle man in the town and i did it the regular porter received his weekly pittance under weekly protest i took two shillings less and made no complaint the shopman gave warning on the ground that he was underfed as well as underpaid i received half his salary and lived contentedly on his reversionary scraps never were two men so well suited to each other as that bookseller and i his one object in life was to find somebody who would work for him at starvation wages my one object in life was to find somebody who would give me an asylum over my head without a single sympathy in commonwithout a vestige of feeling of any sort hostile or friendly growing up between us on either sidewithout wishing each other goodnight when we parted on the house stairs or goodmorning when we met at the shop counter we lived alone in that house strangers from first to last for two whole years a dismal existence for a lad of my age was it not you are a clergyman and a scholarsurely you can guess what made the life endurable to me  mr brock remembered the wellworn volumes which had been found in the ushers bag the books made it endurable to you he said  the eyes of the castaway kindled with a new light  yes he said the booksthe generous friends who met me without suspicionthe merciful masters who never used me ill the only years of my life that i can look back on with something like pride are the years i passed in the misers house the only unalloyed pleasure i have ever tasted is the pleasure that i found for myself on the misers shelves early and late through the long winter nights and the quiet summer days i drank at the fountain of knowledge and never wearied of the draught there were few customers to serve for the books were mostly of the solid and scholarly kind no responsibilities rested on me for the accounts were kept by my master and only the small sums of money were suffered to pass through my hands he soon found out enough of me to know that my honesty was to be trusted and that my patience might be counted on treat me as he might the one insight into his character which i obtained on my side widened the distance between us to its last limits he was a confirmed opiumeater in secreta prodigal in laudanum though a miser in all besides he never confessed his frailty and i never told him i had found it out he had his pleasure apart from me and i had my pleasure apart from him week after week month after month there we sat without a friendly word ever passing between usi alone with my book at the counter he alone with his ledger in the parlor dimly visible to me through the dirty windowpane of the glass door sometimes poring over his figures sometimes lost and motionless for hours in the ecstasy of his opium trance time passed and made no impression on us the seasons of two years came and went and found us still unchanged one morning at the opening of the third year my master did not appear as usual to give me my allowance for breakfast i went upstairs and found him helpless in his bed he refused to trust me with the keys of the cupboard or to let me send for a doctor i bought a morsel of bread and went back to my books with no more feeling for him i honestly confess it than he would have had for me under the same circumstances an hour or two later i was roused from my reading by an occasional customer of ours a retired medical man he went upstairs i was glad to get rid of him and return to my books he came down again and disturbed me once more i dont much like you my lad he said but i think it my duty to say that you will soon have to shift for yourself you are no great favorite in the town and you may have some difficulty in finding a new place provide yourself with a written character from your master before it is too late he spoke to me coldly i thanked him coldly on my side and got my character the same day do you think my master let me have it for nothing not he he bargained with me on his deathbed i was his creditor for a months salary and he wouldnt write a line of my testimonial until i had first promised to forgive him the debt three days afterward he died enjoying to the last the happiness of having overreached his shopman aha he whispered when the doctor formally summoned me to take leave of him i got you cheap was ozias midwinters stick as cruel as that i think not well there i was out on the world again but surely with better prospects this time i had taught myself to read latin greek and german and i had got my written character to speak for me all useless the doctor was quite right i was not liked in the town the lower order of the people despised me for selling my services to the miser at the misers price as for the better classes i did with them god knows how what i have always done with everybody except mr armadalei produced a disagreeable impression at first sight i couldnt mend it afterward and there was an end of me in respectable quarters it is quite likely i might have spent all my savings my puny little golden offspring of two years miserable growth but for a school advertisement which i saw in a local paper the heartlessly mean terms that were offered encouraged me to apply and i got the place how i prospered in it and what became of me next there is no need to tell you the thread of my story is all wound off my vagabond life stands stripped of its mystery and you know the worst of me at last   a moment of silence followed those closing words midwinter rose from the windowseat and came back to the table with the letter from wildbad in his hand  my fathers confession has told you who i am and my own confession has told you what my life has been he said addressing mr brock without taking the chair to which the rector pointed i promised to make a clean breast of it when i first asked leave to enter this room have i kept my word  it is impossible to doubt it replied mr brock you have established your claim on my confidence and my sympathy i should be insensible indeed if i could know what i now know of your childhood and your youth and not feel something of allans kindness for allans friend  thank you sir said midwinter simply and gravely  he sat down opposite mr brook at the table for the first time  in a few hours you will have left this place he proceeded if i can help you to leave it with your mind at ease i will there is more to be said between us than we have said up to this time my future relations with mr armadale are still left undecided and the serious question raised by my fathers letter is a question which we have neither of us faced yet  he paused and looked with a momentary impatience at the candle still burning on the table in the morning light the struggle to speak with composure and to keep his own feelings stoically out of view was evidently growing harder and harder to him  it may possibly help your decision he went on if i tell you how i determined to act toward mr armadalein the matter of the similarity of our nameswhen i first read this letter and when i had composed myself sufficiently to be able to think at all he stopped and cast a second impatient look at the lighted candle will you excuse the odd fancy of an odd man he asked with a faint smile i want to put out the candle i want to speak of the new subject in the new light  he extinguished the candle as he spoke and let the first tenderness of the daylight flow uninterruptedly into the room  i must once more ask your patience he resumed if i return for a moment to myself and my circumstances i have already told you that my stepfather made an attempt to discover me some years after i had turned my back on the scotch school he took that step out of no anxiety of his own but simply as the agent of my fathers trustees in the exercise of their discretion they had sold the estates in barbadoes at the time of the emancipation of the slaves and the ruin of west indian property for what the estates would fetch having invested the proceeds they were bound to set aside a sum for my yearly education this responsibility obliged them to make the attempt to trace mea fruitless attempt as you already know a little later as i have been since informed i was publicly addressed by an advertisement in the newspapers which i never saw later still when i was twentyone a second advertisement appeared which i did see offering a reward for evidence of my death if i was alive i had a right to my half share of the proceeds of the estates on coming of age if dead the money reverted to my mother i went to the lawyers and heard from them what i have just told you after some difficulty in proving my identityand after an interview with my stepfather and a message from my mother which has hopelessly widened the old breach between usmy claim was allowed and my money is now invested for me in the funds under the name that is really my own  mr brock drew eagerly nearer to the table he saw the end now to which the speaker was tending  twice a year midwinter pursued i must sign my own name to get my own income at all other times and under all other circumstances i may hide my identity under any name i please as ozias midwinter mr armadale first knew me as ozias midwinter he shall know me to the end of my days whatever may be the result of this interviewwhether i win your confidence or whether i lose itof one thing you may feel sure your pupil shall never know the horrible secret which i have trusted to your keeping this is no extraordinary resolution for as you know already it costs me no sacrifice of feeling to keep my assumed name there is nothing in my conduct to praise it comes naturally out of the gratitude of a thankful man review the circumstances for yourself sir and set my own horror of revealing them to mr armadale out of the question if the story of the names is ever told there can be no limiting it to the disclosure of my fathers crime it must go back to the story of mrs armadales marriage i have heard her son talk of her i know how he loves her memory as god is my witness he shall never love it less dearly through me  simply as the words were spoken they touched the deepest sympathies in the rectors nature they took his thoughts back to mrs armadales deathbed there sat the man against whom she had ignorantly warned him in her sons interests and that man of his own freewill had laid on himself the obligation of respecting her secret for her sons sake the memory of his own past efforts to destroy the very friendship out of which this resolution had sprung rose and reproached mr brock he held out his hand to midwinter for the first time in her name and in her sons name he said warmly i thank you  without replying midwinter spread the confession open before him on the table  i think i have said all that it was my duty to say he began before we could approach the consideration of this letter whatever may have appeared strange in my conduct toward you and toward mr armadale may be now trusted to explain itself you can easily imagine the natural curiosity and surprise that i must have felt ignorant as i then was of the truth when the sound of mr armadales name first startled me as the echo of my own you will readily understand that i only hesitated to tell him i was his namesake because i hesitated to damage my positionin your estimation if not in hisby confessing that i had come among you under an assumed name and after all that you have just heard of my vagabond life and my low associates you will hardly wonder at the obstinate silence i maintained about myself at a time when i did not feel the sense of responsibility which my fathers confession has laid on me we can return to these small personal explanations if you wish it at another time they cannot be suffered to keep us from the greater interests which we must settle before you leave this place we may come now his voice faltered and he suddenly turned his face toward the window so as to hide it from the rectors view we may come now he repeated his hand trembling visibly as it held the page to the murder on board the timbership and to the warning that has followed me from my fathers grave  softlyas if he feared they might reach allan sleeping in the neighboring roomhe read the last terrible words which the scotchmans pen had written at wildbad as they fell from his fathers lips  avoid the widow of the man i killedif the widow still lives avoid the maid whose wicked hand smoothed the way to the marriageif the maid is still in her service and more than all avoid the man who bears the same name as your own offend your best benefactor if that benefactors influence has connected you one with the other desert the woman who loves you if that woman is a link between you and him hide yourself from him under an assumed name put the mountains and the seas between you be ungrateful be unforgiving be all that is most repellent to your own gentler nature rather than live under the same roof and breathe the same air with that man never let the two allan armadales meet in this world never never never  after reading those sentences he pushed the manuscript from him without looking up the fatal reserve which he had been in a fair way of conquering but a few minutes since possessed itself of him once more again his eyes wandered again his voice sank in tone a stranger who had heard his story and who saw him now would have said his look is lurking his manner is bad he is every inch of him his fathers son  i have a question to ask you said mr brock breaking the silence between them on his side why have you just read that passage in your fathers letter  to force me into telling you the truth was the answer you must know how much there is of my father in me before you trust me to be mr armadales friend i got my letter yesterday in the morning some inner warning troubled me and i went down on the seashore by myself before i broke the seal do you believe the dead can come back to the world they once lived in i believe my father came back in that bright morning light through the glare of that broad sunshine and the roar of that joyful sea and watched me while i read when i got to the words that you have just heard and when i knew that the very end which he had died dreading was the end that had really come i felt the horror that had crept over him in his last moments creeping over me i struggled against myself as he would have had me struggle i tried to be all that was most repellent to my own gentler nature i tried to think pitilessly of putting the mountains and the seas between me and the man who bore my name hours passed before i could prevail on myself to go back and run the risk of meeting allan armadale in this house when i did get back and when he met me at night on the stairs i thought i was looking him in the face as my father looked his father in the face when the cabin door closed between them draw your own conclusions sir say if you like that the inheritance of my fathers heathen belief in fate is one of the inheritances he has left to me i wont dispute it i wont deny that all through yesterday his superstition was my superstition the night came before i could find my way to calmer and brighter thoughts but i did find my way you may set it down in my favor that i lifted myself at last above the influence of this horrible letter do you know what helped me  did you reason with yourself  i cant reason about what i feel  did you quiet your mind by prayer  i was not fit to pray  and yet something guided you to the better feeling and the truer view  something did  what was it  my love for allan armadale  he cast a doubting almost a timid look at mr brock as he gave that answer and suddenly leaving the table went back to the windowseat  have i no right to speak of him in that way he asked keeping his face hidden from the rector have i not known him long enough have i not done enough for him yet remember what my experience of other men had been when i first saw his hand held out to mewhen i first heard his voice speaking to me in my sickroom what had i known of strangers hands all through my childhood i had only known them as hands raised to threaten and to strike me his hand put my pillow straight and patted me on the shoulder and gave me my food and drink what had i known of other mens voices when i was growing up to be a man myself i had only known them as voices that jeered voices that cursed voices that whispered in corners with a vile distrust his voice said to me cheer up midwinter well soon bring you round again youll be strong enough in a week to go out for a drive with me in our somersetshire lanes think of the gypsys stick think of the devils laughing at me when i went by their windows with my little dead dog in my arms think of the master who cheated me of my months salary on his deathbedand ask your own heart if the miserable wretch whom allan armadale has treated as his equal and his friend has said too much in saying that he loves him i do love him it will come out of me i cant keep it back i love the very ground he treads on i would give my lifeyes the life that is precious to me now because his kindness has made it a happy onei tell you i would give my life  the next words died away on his lips the hysterical passion rose and conquered him he stretched out one of his hands with a wild gesture of entreaty to mr brock his head sank on the windowsill and he burst into tears  even then the hard discipline of the mans life asserted itself he expected no sympathy he counted on no merciful human respect for human weakness the cruel necessity of selfsuppression was present to his mind while the tears were pouring over his cheeks give me a minute he said faintly ill fight it down in a minute i wont distress you in this way again  true to his resolution in a minute he had fought it down in a minute more he was able to speak calmly  we will get back sir to those better thoughts which have brought me from my room to yours he resumed i can only repeat that i should never have torn myself from the hold which this letter fastened on me if i had not loved allan armadale with all that i have in me of a brothers love i said to myself if the thought of leaving him breaks my heart the thought of leaving him is wrong that was some hours since and i am in the same mind still i cant believei wont believethat a friendship which has grown out of nothing but kindness on one side and nothing but gratitude on the other is destined to lead to an evil end judge you who are a clergyman between the dead father whose word is in these pages and the living son whose word is now on his lips what is it appointed me to do now that i am breathing the same air and living under the same roof with the son of the man whom my father killedto perpetuate my fathers crime by mortally injuring him or to atone for my fathers crime by giving him the devotion of my whole life the last of those two faiths is my faith and shall be my faith happen what may in the strength of that better conviction i have come here to trust you with my fathers secret and to confess the wretched story of my own life in the strength of that better conviction i can face you resolutely with the one plain question which marks the one plain end of all that i have come here to say your pupil stands at the startingpoint of his new career in a position singularly friendless his one great need is a companion of his own age on whom he can rely the time has come sir to decide whether i am to be that companion or not after all you have heard of ozias midwinter tell me plainly will you trust him to be allan armadales friend  mr brock met that fearlessly frank question by a fearless frankness on his side  i believe you love allan he said and i believe you have spoken the truth a man who has produced that impression on me is a man whom i am bound to trust i trust you  midwinter started to his feet his dark face flushing deep his eyes fixed brightly and steadily at last on the rectors face a light he exclaimed tearing the pages of his fathers letter one by one from the fastening that held them let us destroy the last link that holds us to the horrible past let us see this confession a heap of ashes before we part  wait said mr brock before you burn it there is a reason for looking at it once more  the parted leaves of the manuscript dropped from midwinters hands mr brock took them up and sorted them carefully until he found the last page  i view your fathers superstition as you view it said the rector but there is a warning given you here which you will do well for allans sake and for your own sake not to neglect the last link with the past will not be destroyed when you have burned these pages one of the actors in this story of treachery and murder is not dead yet read those words  he pushed the page across the table with his finger on one sentence midwinters agitation misled him he mistook the indication and read avoid the widow of the man i killed if the widow still lives  not that sentence said the rector the next  midwinter read it avoid the maid whose wicked hand smoothed the way to the marriage if the maid is still in her service  the maid and the mistress parted said mr brock at the time of the mistresss marriage the maid and the mistress met again at mrs armadales residence in somersetshire last year i myself met the woman in the village and i myself know that her visit hastened mrs armadales death wait a little and compose yourself i see i have startled you  he waited as he was bid his color fading away to a gray paleness and the light in his clear brown eyes dying out slowly what the rector had said had produced no transient impression on him there was more than doubt there was alarm in his face as he sat lost in his own thought was the struggle of the past night renewing itself already did he feel the horror of his hereditary superstition creeping over him again  can you put me on my guard against her he asked after a long interval of silence can you tell me her name  i can only tell you what mrs armadale told me answered mr brock the woman acknowledged having been married in the long interval since she and her mistress had last met but not a word more escaped her about her past life she came to mrs armadale to ask for money under a plea of distress she got the money and she left the house positively refusing when the question was put to her to mention her married name  you saw her yourself in the village what was she like  she kept her veil down i cant tell you  you can tell me what you did see  certainly i saw as she approached me that she moved very gracefully that she had a beautiful figure and that she was a little over the middle height i noticed when she asked me the way to mrs armadales house that her manner was the manner of a lady and that the tone of her voice was remarkably soft and winning lastly i remembered afterward that she wore a thick black veil a black bonnet a black silk dress and a red paisley shawl i feel all the importance of your possessing some better means of identifying her than i can give you but unhappily  he stopped midwinter was leaning eagerly across the table and midwinters hand was laid suddenly on his arm  is it possible that you know the woman asked mr brock surprised at the sudden change in his manner  no  what have i said then that has startled you so  do you remember the woman who threw herself from the river steamer asked the otherthe woman who caused that succession of deaths which opened allan armadales way to the thorpe ambrose estate  i remember the description of her in the police report answered the rector  that woman pursued midwinter moved gracefully and had a beautiful figure that woman wore a black veil a black bonnet a black silk gown and a red paisley shawl he stopped released his hold of mr brocks arm and abruptly resumed his chair can it be the same he said to himself in a whisper is there a fatality that follows men in the dark and is it following us in that womans footsteps  if the conjecture was right the one event in the past which had appeared to be entirely disconnected with the events that had preceded it was on the contrary the one missing link which made the chain complete mr brocks comfortable common sense instinctively denied that startling conclusion he looked at midwinter with a compassionate smile  my young friend he said kindly have you cleared your mind of all superstition as completely as you think is what you have just said worthy of the better resolution at which you arrived last night  midwinters head drooped on his breast the color rushed back over his face he sighed bitterly  you are beginning to doubt my sincerity he said i cant blame you  i believe in your sincerity as firmly as ever answered mr brock i only doubt whether you have fortified the weak places in your nature as strongly as you yourself suppose many a man has lost the battle against himself far oftener than you have lost it yet and has nevertheless won his victory in the end i dont blame you i dont distrust you i only notice what has happened to put you on your guard against yourself come come let your own better sense help you and you will agree with me that there is really no evidence to justify the suspicion that the woman whom i met in somersetshire and the woman who attempted suicide in london are one and the same need an old man like me remind a young man like you that there are thousands of women in england with beautiful figuresthousands of women who are quietly dressed in black silk gowns and red paisley shawls  midwinter caught eagerly at the suggestion too eagerly as it might have occurred to a harder critic on humanity than mr brock  you are quite right sir he said and i am quite wrong tens of thousands of women answer the description as you say i have been wasting time on my own idle fancies when i ought to have been carefully gathering up facts if this woman ever attempts to find her way to allan i must be prepared to stop her he began searching restlessly among the manuscript leaves scattered about the table paused over one of the pages and examined it attentively this helps me to something positive he went on this helps me to a knowledge of her age she was twelve at the time of mrs armadales marriage add a year and bring her to thirteen add allans age twentytwo and we make her a woman of fiveandthirty at the present time i know her age and i know that she has her own reasons for being silent about her married life this is something gained at the outset and it may lead in time to something more he looked up brightly again at mr brock am i in the right way now sir am i doing my best to profit by the caution which you have kindly given me  you are vindicating your own better sense answered the rector encouraging him to trample down his own imagination with an englishmans ready distrust of the noblest of the human faculties you are paving the way for your own happier life  am i said the other thoughtfully  he searched among the papers once more and stopped at another of the scattered pages  the ship he exclaimed suddenly his color changing again and his manner altering on the instant  what ship asked the rector  the ship in which the deed was done midwinter answered with the first signs of impatience that he had shown yet the ship in which my fathers murderous hand turned the lock of the cabin door  what of it said mr brock  he appeared not to hear the question his eyes remained fixed intently on the page that he was reading  a french vessel employed in the timber trade he said still speaking to himselfa french vessel named la grace de dieu if my fathers belief had been the right beliefif the fatality had been following me step by step from my fathers grave in one or other of my voyages i should have fallen in with that ship he looked up again at mr brock i am quite sure about it now he said those women are two and not one  mr brock shook his head  i am glad you have come to that conclusion he said but i wish you had reached it in some other way  midwinter started passionately to his feet and seizing on the pages of the manuscript with both hands flung them into the empty fireplace  for gods sake let me burn it he exclaimed as long as there is a page left i shall read it and as long as i read it my father gets the better of me in spite of myself  mr brock pointed to the matchbox in another moment the confession was in flames when the fire had consumed the last morsel of paper midwinter drew a deep breath of relief  i may say like macbeth why so being gone i am a man again he broke out with a feverish gayety you look fatigued sir and no wonder he added in a lower tone i have kept you too long from your resti will keep you no longer depend on my remembering what you have told me depend on my standing between allan and any enemy man or woman who comes near him thank you mr brock a thousand thousand times thank you i came into this room the most wretched of living men i can leave it now as happy as the birds that are singing outside  as he turned to the door the rays of the rising sun streamed through the window and touched the heap of ashes lying black in the black fireplace the sensitive imagination of midwinter kindled instantly at the sight  look he said joyously the promise of the future shining over the ashes of the past  an inexplicable pity for the man at the moment of his life when he needed pity least stole over the rectors heart when the door had closed and he was left by himself again  poor fellow he said with an uneasy surprise at his own compassionate impulse poor fellow     iii day and night  the morning hours had passed the noon had come and gone and mr brock had started on the first stage of his journey home  after parting from the rector in douglas harbor the two young men had returned to castletown and had there separated at the hotel door allan walking down to the waterside to look after his yacht and midwinter entering the house to get the rest that he needed after a sleepless night  he darkened his room he closed his eyes but no sleep came to him on this first day of the rectors absence his sensitive nature extravagantly exaggerated the responsibility which he now held in trust for mr brock a nervous dread of leaving allan by himself even for a few hours only kept him waking and doubting until it became a relief rather than a hardship to rise from the bed again and following in allans footsteps to take the way to the waterside which led to the yacht  the repairs of the little vessel were nearly completed it was a breezy cheerful day the land was bright the water was blue the quick waves leaped crisply in the sunshine the men were singing at their work descending to the cabin midwinter discovered his friend busily occupied in attempting to set the place to rights habitually the least systematic of mortals allan now and then awoke to an overwhelming sense of the advantages of order and on such occasions a perfect frenzy of tidiness possessed him he was down on his knees hotly and wildly at work when midwinter looked in on him and was fast reducing the neat little world of the cabin to its original elements of chaos with a misdirected energy wonderful to see  heres a mess said allan rising composedly on the horizon of his own accumulated litter do you know my dear fellow i begin to wish i had let well alone  midwinter smiled and came to his friends assistance with the natural neathandedness of a sailor  the first object that he encountered was allans dressingcase turned upside down with half the contents scattered on the floor and with a duster and a hearthbroom lying among them replacing the various objects which formed the furniture of the dressingcase one by one midwinter lighted unexpectedly on a miniature portrait of the oldfashioned oval form primly framed in a setting of small diamonds  you dont seem to set much value on this he said what is it  allan bent over him and looked at the miniature it belonged to my mother he answered and i set the greatest value on it it is a portrait of my father  midwinter put the miniature abruptly into allans hands and withdrew to the opposite side of the cabin  you know best where the things ought to be put in your own dressingcase he said keeping his back turned on allan ill make the place tidy on this side of the cabin and you shall make the place tidy on the other  he began setting in order the litter scattered about him on the cabin table and on the floor but it seemed as if fate had decided that his friends personal possessions should fall into his hands that morning employ them where he might one among the first objects which he took up was allans tobacco jar with the stopper missing and with a letter which appeared by the bulk of it to contain inclosures crumpled into the mouth of the jar in the stoppers place  did you know that you had put this here he asked is the letter of any importance  allan recognized it instantly it was the first of the little series of letters which had followed the cruising party to the isle of manthe letter which young armadale had briefly referred to as bringing him more worries from those everlasting lawyers and had then dismissed from further notice as recklessly as usual  this is what comes of being particularly careful said allan here is an instance of my extreme thoughtfulness you may not think it but i put the letter there on purpose every time i went to the jar you know i was sure to see the letter and every time i saw the letter i was sure to say to myself this must be answered theres nothing to laugh at it was a perfectly sensible arrangement if i could only have remembered where i put the jar suppose i tie a knot in my pockethandkerchief this time you have a wonderful memory my dear fellow perhaps youll remind me in the course of the day in case i forget the knot next  midwinter saw his first chance since mr brocks departure of usefully filling mr brocks place  here is your writingcase he said why not answer the letter at once if you put it away again you may forget it again  very true returned allan but the worst of it is i cant quite make up my mind what answer to write i want a word of advice come and sit down here and ill tell you all about it  with his loud boyish laughechoed by midwinter who caught the infection of his gayetyhe swept a heap of miscellaneous incumbrances off the cabin sofa and made room for his friend and himself to take their places in the high flow of youthful spirits the two sat down to their trifling consultation over a letter lost in a tobacco jar it was a memorable moment to both of them lightly as they thought of it at the time before they had risen again from their places they had taken the first irrevocable step together on the dark and tortuous road of their future lives  reduced to plain facts the question on which allan now required his friends advice may be stated as follows  while the various arrangements connected with the succession to thorpe ambrose were in progress of settlement and while the new possessor of the estate was still in london a question had necessarily arisen relating to the person who should be appointed to manage the property the steward employed by the blanchard family had written without loss of time to offer his services although a perfectly competent and trustworthy man he failed to find favor in the eyes of the new proprietor acting as usual on his first impulses and resolved at all hazards to install midwinter as a permanent inmate at thorpe ambrose allan had determined that the stewards place was the place exactly fitted for his friend for the simple reason that it would necessarily oblige his friend to live with him on the estate he had accordingly written to decline the proposal made to him without consulting mr brock whose disapproval he had good reason to fear and without telling midwinter who would probably if a chance were allowed him of choosing have declined taking a situation which his previous training had by no means fitted him to fill  further correspondence had followed this decision and had raised two new difficulties which looked a little embarrassing on the face of them but which allan with the assistance of his lawyer easily contrived to solve the first difficulty of examining the outgoing stewards books was settled by sending a professional accountant to thorpe ambrose and the second difficulty of putting the stewards empty cottage to some profitable use allans plans for his friend comprehending midwinters residence under his own roof was met by placing the cottage on the list of an active house agent in the neighboring county town in this state the arrangements had been left when allan quitted london he had heard and thought nothing more of the matter until a letter from his lawyers had followed him to the isle of man inclosing two proposals to occupy the cottage both received on the same day and requesting to hear at his earliest convenience which of the two he was prepared to accept  finding himself after having conveniently forgotten the subject for some days past placed face to face once more with the necessity for decision allan now put the two proposals into his friends hands and after a rambling explanation of the circumstances of the case requested to be favored with a word of advice instead of examining the proposals midwinter unceremoniously put them aside and asked the two very natural and very awkward questions of who the new steward was to be and why he was to live in allans house  ill tell you who and ill tell you why when we get to thorpe ambrose said allan in the meantime well call the steward x y z and well say he lives with me because im devilish sharp and i mean to keep him under my own eye you neednt look surprised i know the man thoroughly well he requires a good deal of management if i offered him the stewards place beforehand his modesty would get in his way and he would say no if i pitch him into it neck and crop without a word of warning and with nobody at hand to relieve him of the situation hell have nothing for it but to consult my interests and say yes x y z is not at all a bad fellow i can tell you youll see him when we go to thorpe ambrose and i rather think you and he will get on uncommonly well together  the humorous twinkle in allans eye the sly significance in allans voice would have betrayed his secret to a prosperous man midwinter was as far from suspecting it as the carpenters who were at work above them on the deck of the yacht  is there no steward now on the estate he asked his face showing plainly that he was far from feeling satisfied with allans answer is the business neglected all this time  nothing of the sort returned allan the business is going with a wet sheet and a flowing sea and a wind that follows free im not joking im only metaphorical a regular accountant has poked his nose into the books and a steadygoing lawyers clerk attends at the office once a week that doesnt look like neglect does it leave the new steward alone for the present and just tell me which of those two tenants you would take if you were in my place  midwinter opened the proposals and read them attentively  the first proposal was from no less a person than the solicitor at thorpe ambrose who had first informed allan at paris of the large fortune that had fallen into his hands this gentleman wrote personally to say that he had long admired the cottage which was charmingly situated within the limits of the thorpe ambrose grounds he was a bachelor of studious habits desirous of retiring to a country seclusion after the wear and tear of his business hours and he ventured to say that mr armadale in accepting him as a tenant might count on securing an unobtrusive neighbor and on putting the cottage into responsible and careful hands  the second proposal came through the house agent and proceeded from a total stranger the tenant who offered for the cottage in this case was a retired officer in the armyone major milroy his family merely consisted of an invalid wife and an only childa young lady his references were unexceptionable and he too was especially anxious to secure the cottage as the perfect quiet of the situation was exactly what was required by mrs milroy in her feeble state of health  well which profession shall i favor asked allan the army or the law  there seems to me to be no doubt about it said midwinter the lawyer has been already in correspondence with you and the lawyers claim is therefore the claim to be preferred  i knew you would say that in all the thousands of times i have asked other people for advice i never yet got the advice i wanted heres this business of letting the cottage as an instance im all on the other side myself i want to have the major  why  young armadale laid his forefinger on that part of the agents letter which enumerated major milroys family and which contained the three wordsa young lady  a bachelor of studious habits walking about my grounds said allan is not an interesting object a young lady is i have not the least doubt miss milroy is a charming girl ozias midwinter of the serious countenance think of her pretty muslin dress flitting about among your trees and committing trespasses on your property think of her adorable feet trotting into your fruitgarden and her delicious fresh lips kissing your ripe peaches think of her dimpled hands among your early violets and her little creamcolored nose buried in your blushroses what does the studious bachelor offer me in exchange for the loss of all this he offers me a rheumatic brown object in gaiters and a wig no no justice is good my dear friend but believe me miss milroy is better  can you be serious about any mortal thing allan  ill try to be if you like i know i ought to take the lawyer but what can i do if the majors daughter keeps running in my head  midwinter returned resolutely to the just and sensible view of the matter and pressed it on his friends attention with all the persuasion of which he was master after listening with exemplary patience until he had done allan swept a supplementary accumulation of litter off the cabin table and produced from his waistcoat pocket a halfcrown coin  ive got an entirely new idea he said lets leave it to chance  the absurdity of the proposalas coming from a landlordwas irresistible midwinters gravity deserted him  ill spin continued allan and you shall call we must give precedence to the army of course so well say heads the major tails the lawyer one spin to decide now then look out  he spun the halfcrown on the cabin table  tails cried midwinter humoring what he believed to be one of allans boyish jokes  the coin fell on the table with the head uppermost  you dont mean to say you are really in earnest said midwinter as the other opened his writingcase and dipped his pen in the ink  oh but i am though replied allan chance is on my side and miss milroys and youre outvoted two to one its no use arguing the major has fallen uppermost and the major shall have the cottage i wont leave it to the lawyers theyll only be worrying me with more letters ill write myself  he wrote his answers to the two proposals literally in two minutes one to the house agent dear sir i accept major milroys offer let him come in when he pleases yours truly allan armadale and one to the lawyer dear sir i regret that circumstances prevent me from accepting your proposal yours truly etc people make a fuss about letterwriting allan remarked when he had done i find it easy enough  he wrote the addresses on his two notes and stamped them for the post whistling gayly while he had been writing he had not noticed how his friend was occupied when he had done it struck him that a sudden silence had fallen on the cabin and looking up he observed that midwinters whole attention was strangely concentrated on the half crown as it lay head uppermost on the table allan suspended his whistling in astonishment  what on earth are you doing he asked  i was only wondering replied midwinter  what about persisted allan  i was wondering said the other handing him back the halfcrown whether there is such a thing as chance  half an hour later the two notes were posted and allan whose close superintendence of the repairs of the yacht had hitherto allowed him but little leisure time on shore had proposed to while away the idle hours by taking a walk in castletown even midwinters nervous anxiety to deserve mr brocks confidence in him could detect nothing objectionable in this harmless proposal and the young men set forth together to see what they could make of the metropolis of the isle of man  it is doubtful if there is a place on the habitable globe which regarded as a sightseeing investment offering itself to the spare attention of strangers yields so small a percentage of interest in return as castletown beginning with the waterside there was an inner harbor to see with a drawbridge to let vessels through an outer harbor ending in a dwarf lighthouse a view of a flat coast to the right and a view of a flat coast to the left in the central solitudes of the city there was a squat gray building called the castle also a memorial pillar dedicated to one governor smelt with a flat top for a statue and no statue standing on it also a barrack holding the halfcompany of soldiers allotted to the island and exhibiting one spiritbroken sentry at its lonely door the prevalent color of the town was faint gray the few shops open were parted at frequent intervals by other shops closed and deserted in despair the weary lounging of boatmen on shore was trebly weary here the youth of the district smoked together in speechless depression under the lee of a dead wall the ragged children said mechanically give us a penny and before the charitable hand could search the merciful pocket lapsed away again in misanthropic doubt of the human nature they addressed the silence of the grave overflowed the churchyard and filled this miserable town but one edifice prosperous to look at rose consolatory in the desolation of these dreadful streets frequented by the students of the neighboring college of king william this building was naturally dedicated to the uses of a pastrycooks shop here at least viewed through the friendly medium of the window there was something going on for a stranger to see for here on high stools the pupils of the college sat with swinging legs and slowly moving jaws and hushed in the horrid stillness of castletown gorged their pastry gravely in an atmosphere of awful silence  hang me if i can look any longer at the boys and the tarts said allan dragging his friend away from the pastrycooks shop lets try if we cant find something else to amuse us in the next street  the first amusing object which the next street presented was a carverandgilders shop expiring feebly in the last stage of commercial decay the counter inside displayed nothing to view but the recumbent head of a boy peacefully asleep in the unbroken solitude of the place in the window were exhibited to the passing stranger three forlorn little flyspotted frames a small postingbill dusty with longcontinued neglect announcing that the premises were to let and one colored print the last of a series illustrating the horrors of drunkenness on the fiercest temperance principles the compositionrepresenting an empty bottle of gin an immensely spacious garret a perpendicular scripture reader and a horizontal expiring familyappealed to public favor under the entirely unobjectionable title of the hand of death allans resolution to extract amusement from castletown by main force had resisted a great deal but it failed him at this stage of the investigations he suggested trying an excursion to some other place midwinter readily agreeing they went back to the hotel to make inquiries  thanks to the mixed influence of allans ready gift of familiarity and total want of method in putting his questions a perfect deluge of information flowed in on the two strangers relating to every subject but the subject which had actually brought them to the hotel they made various interesting discoveries in connection with the laws and constitution of the isle of man and the manners and customs of the natives to allans delight the manxmen spoke of england as of a wellknown adjacent island situated at a certain distance from the central empire of the isle of man it was further revealed to the two englishmen that this happy little nation rejoiced in laws of its own publicly proclaimed once a year by the governor and the two head judges grouped together on the top of an ancient mound in fancy costumes appropriate to the occasion possessing this enviable institution the island added to it the inestimable blessing of a local parliament called the house of keys an assembly far in advance of the other parliament belonging to the neighboring island in this respectthat the members dispensed with the people and solemnly elected each other with these and many more local particulars extracted from all sorts and conditions of men in and about the hotel allan whiled away the weary time in his own essentially desultory manner until the gossip died out of itself and midwinter who had been speaking apart with the landlord quietly recalled him to the matter in hand the finest coast scenery in the island was said to be to the westward and the southward and there was a fishing town in those regions called port st mary with a hotel at which travelers could sleep if allans impressions of castletown still inclined him to try an excursion to some other place he had only to say so and a carriage would be produced immediately allan jumped at the proposal and in ten minutes more he and midwinter were on their way to the western wilds of the island  with trifling incidents the day of mr brocks departure had worn on thus far with trifling incidents in which not even midwinters nervous watchfulness could see anything to distrust it was still to proceed until the night camea night which one at least of the two companions was destined to remember to the end of his life  before the travelers had advanced two miles on their road an accident happened the horse fell and the driver reported that the animal had seriously injured himself there was no alternative but to send for another carriage to castletown or to get on to port st mary on foot  deciding to walk midwinter and allan had not gone far before they were overtaken by a gentleman driving alone in an open chaise he civilly introduced himself as a medical man living close to port st mary and offered seats in his carriage always ready to make new acquaintances allan at once accepted the proposal he and the doctor whose name was ascertained to be hawbury became friendly and familiar before they had been five minutes in the chaise together midwinter sitting behind them reserved and silent on the back seat they separated just outside port st mary before mr hawburys house allan boisterously admiring the doctors neat french windows and pretty flowergarden and lawn and wringing his hand at parting as if they had known each other from boyhood upward arrived in port st mary the two friends found themselves in a second castletown on a smaller scale but the country round wild open and hilly deserved its reputation a walk brought them well enough on with the daystill the harmless idle day that it had been from the firstto see the evening near at hand after waiting a little to admire the sun setting grandly over hill and heath and crag and talking while they waited of mr brock and his long journey home they returned to the hotel to order their early supper nearer and nearer the night and the adventure which the night was to bring with it came to the two friends and still the only incidents that happened were incidents to be laughed at if they were noticed at all the supper was badly cooked the waitingmaid was impenetrably stupid the oldfashioned bellrope in the coffeeroom had come down in allans hands and striking in its descent a painted china shepherdess on the chimneypiece had laid the figure in fragments on the floor events as trifling as these were still the only events that had happened when the twilight faded and the lighted candles were brought into the room  finding midwinter after the double fatigue of a sleepless night and a restless day but little inclined for conversation allan left him resting on the sofa and lounged into the passage of the hotel on the chance of discovering somebody to talk to here another of the trivial incidents of the day brought allan and mr hawbury together again and helpedwhether happily or not yet remained to be seento strengthen the acquaintance between them on either side  the bar of the hotel was situated at one end of the passage and the landlady was in attendance there mixing a glass of liquor for the doctor who had just looked in for a little gossip on allans asking permission to make a third in the drinking and the gossiping mr hawbury civilly handed him the glass which the landlady had just filled it contained cold brandyandwater a marked change in allans face as he suddenly drew back and asked for whisky instead caught the doctors medical eye a case of nervous antipathy said mr hawbury quietly taking the glass away again the remark obliged allan to acknowledge that he had an insurmountable loathing which he was foolish enough to be a little ashamed of mentioning to the smell and taste of brandy no matter with what diluting liquid the spirit was mixed the presence of it instantly detected by his organs of taste and smell turned him sick and faint if the drink touched his lips starting from this personal confession the talk turned on antipathies in general and the doctor acknowledged on his side that he took a professional interest in the subject and that he possessed a collection of curious cases at home which his new acquaintance was welcome to look at if allan had nothing else to do that evening and if he would call when the medical work of the day was over in an hours time  cordially accepting the invitation which was extended to midwinter also if he cared to profit by it allan returned to the coffeeroom to look after his friend half asleep and half awake midwinter was still stretched on the sofa with the local newspaper just dropping out of his languid hand  i heard your voice in the passage he said drowsily whom were you talking to  the doctor replied allan i am going to smoke a cigar with him in an hours time will you come too  midwinter assented with a weary sigh always shyly unwilling to make new acquaintances fatigue increased the reluctance he now felt to become mr hawburys guest as matters stood however there was no alternative but to go for with allans constitutional imprudence there was no safely trusting him alone anywhere and more especially in a strangers house mr brock would certainly not have left his pupil to visit the doctor alone and midwinter was still nervously conscious that he occupied mr brocks place  what shall we do till its time to go asked allan looking about him anything in this he added observing the fallen newspaper and picking it up from the floor  im too tired to look if you find anything interesting read it out said midwinter thinking that the reading might help to keep him awake  part of the newspaper and no small part of it was devoted to extracts from books recently published in london one of the works most largely laid under contribution in this manner was of the sort to interest allan it was a highly spiced narrative of traveling adventures in the wilds of australia pouncing on an extract which described the sufferings of the travelingparty lost in a trackless wilderness and in danger of dying by thirst allan announced that he had found something to make his friends flesh creep and began eagerly to read the passage aloud  resolute not to sleep midwinter followed the progress of the adventure sentence by sentence without missing a word the consultation of the lost travelers with death by thirst staring them in the face the resolution to press on while their strength lasted the fall of a heavy shower the vain efforts made to catch the rainwater the transient relief experienced by sucking their wet clothes the sufferings renewed a few hours after the night advance of the strongest of the party leaving the weakest behind the following a flight of birds when morning dawned the discovery by the lost men of the broad pool of water that saved their livesall this midwinters fastfailing attention mastered painfully allans voice growing fainter and fainter on his ear with every sentence that was read soon the next words seemed to drop away gently and nothing but the slowly sinking sound of the voice was left then the light in the room darkened gradually the sound dwindled into delicious silence and the last waking impressions of the weary midwinter came peacefully to an end  the next event of which he was conscious was a sharp ringing at the closed door of the hotel he started to his feet with the ready alacrity of a man whose life has accustomed him to wake at the shortest notice an instants look round showed him that the room was empty and a glance at his watch told him that it was close on midnight the noise made by the sleepy servant in opening the door and the tread the next moment of quick footsteps in the passage filled him with a sudden foreboding of something wrong as he hurriedly stepped forward to go out and make inquiry the door of the coffeeroom opened and the doctor stood before him  i am sorry to disturb you said mr hawbury dont be alarmed theres nothing wrong  where is my friend asked midwinter  at the pier head answered the doctor i am to a certain extent responsible for what he is doing now and i think some careful person like yourself ought to be with him  the hint was enough for midwinter he and the doctor set out for the pier immediately mr hawbury mentioning on the way the circumstances under which he had come to the hotel  punctual to the appointed hour allan had made his appearance at the doctors house explaining that he had left his weary friend so fast asleep on the sofa that he had not had the heart to wake him the evening had passed pleasantly and the conversation had turned on many subjects until in an evil hour mr hawbury had dropped a hint which showed that he was fond of sailing and that he possessed a pleasureboat of his own in the harbor excited on the instant by his favorite topic allan had left his host no hospitable alternative but to take him to the pier head and show him the boat the beauty of the night and the softness of the breeze had done the rest of the mischief they had filled allan with irresistible longings for a sail by moonlight prevented from accompanying his guest by professional hindrances which obliged him to remain on shore the doctor not knowing what else to do had ventured on disturbing midwinter rather than take the responsibility of allowing mr armadale no matter how well he might be accustomed to the sea to set off on a sailing trip at midnight entirely by himself  the time taken to make this explanation brought midwinter and the doctor to the pier head there sure enough was young armadale in the boat hoisting the sail and singing the sailors yoheaveho at the top of his voice  come along old boy cried allan youre just in time for a frolic by moonlight  midwinter suggested a frolic by daylight and an adjournment to bed in the meantime  bed cried allan on whose harumscarum high spirits mr hawburys hospitality had certainly not produced a sedative effect hear him doctor one would think he was ninety bed you drowsy old dormouse look at that and think of bed if you can  he pointed to the sea the moon was shining in the cloudless heaven the nightbreeze blew soft and steady from the land the peaceful waters rippled joyfully in the silence and the glory of the night midwinter turned to the doctor with a wise resignation to circumstances he had seen enough to satisfy him that all words of remonstrance would be words simply thrown away  how is the tide he asked  mr hawbury told him  are there oars in the boat  yes  i am well used to the sea said midwinter descending the pier steps you may trust me to take care of my friend and to take care of the boat  goodnight doctor shouted allan your whiskyandwater is deliciousyour boats a little beautyand youre the best fellow i ever met in my life  the doctor laughed and waved his hand and the boat glided out from the harbor with midwinter at the helm  as the breeze then blew they were soon abreast of the westward headland bounding the bay of poolvash and the question was started whether they should run out to sea or keep along the shore the wisest proceeding in the event of the wind failing them was to keep by the land midwinter altered the course of the boat and they sailed on smoothly in a southwesterly direction abreast of the coast  little by little the cliffs rose in height and the rocks massed wild and jagged showed rifted black chasms yawning deep in their seaward sides off the bold promontory called spanish head midwinter looked ominously at his watch but allan pleaded hard for half an hour more and for a glance at the famous channel of the sound which they were now fast nearing and of which he had heard some startling stories from the workmen employed on his yacht the new change which midwinters compliance with this request rendered it necessary to make in the course of the boat brought her close to the wind and revealed on one side the grand view of the southernmost shores of the isle of man and on the other the black precipices of the islet called the calf separated from the mainland by the dark and dangerous channel of the sound  once more midwinter looked at his watch we have gone far enough he said stand by the sheet  stop cried allan from the bows of the boat good god heres a wrecked ship right ahead of us  midwinter let the boat fall off a little and looked where the other pointed  there stranded midway between the rocky boundaries on either side of the soundthere never again to rise on the living waters from her grave on the sunken rock lost and lonely in the quiet night high and dark and ghostly in the yellow moonshine lay the wrecked ship  i know the vessel said allan in great excitement i heard my workmen talking of her yesterday she drifted in here on a pitchdark night when they couldnt see the lights a poor old wornout merchantman midwinter that the shipbrokers have bought to break up lets run in and have a look at her  midwinter hesitated all the old sympathies of his sealife strongly inclined him to follow allans suggestion but the wind was falling light and he distrusted the broken water and the swirling currents of the channel ahead this is an ugly place to take a boat into when you know nothing about it he said  nonsense returned allan its as light as day and we float in two feet of water  before midwinter could answer the current caught the boat and swept them onward through the channel straight toward the wreck  lower the sail said midwinter quietly and ship the oars we are running down on her fast enough now whether we like it or not  both well accustomed to the use of the oar they brought the course of the boat under sufficient control to keep her on the smoothest side of the channelthe side which was nearest to the islet of the calf as they came swiftly up with the wreck midwinter resigned his oar to allan and watching his opportunity caught a hold with the boathook on the forechains of the vessel the next moment they had the boat safely in hand under the lee of the wreck  the ships ladder used by the workmen hung over the forechains mounting it with the boats rope in his teeth midwinter secured one end and lowered the other to allan in the boat make that fast he said and wait till i see if its all safe on board with those words he disappeared behind the bulwark  wait repeated allan in the blankest astonishment at his friends excessive caution what on earth does he mean ill be hanged if i wait where one of us goes the other goes too  he hitched the loose end of the rope round the forward thwart of the boat and swinging himself up the ladder stood the next moment on the deck anything very dreadful on board he inquired sarcastically as he and his friend met  midwinter smiled nothing whatever he replied but i couldnt be sure that we were to have the whole ship to ourselves till i got over the bulwark and looked about me  allan took a turn on the deck and surveyed the wreck critically from stem to stern  not much of a vessel he said the frenchmen generally build better ships than this  midwinter crossed the deck and eyed allan in a momentary silence  frenchmen he repeated after an interval is this vessel french  yes  how do you know  the men i have got at work on the yacht told me they know all about her  midwinter came a little nearer his swarthy face began to look to allans eyes unaccountably pale in the moonlight  did they mention what trade she was engaged in  yes the timber trade  as allan gave that answer midwinters lean brown hand clutched him fast by the shoulder and midwinters teeth chattered in his head like the teeth of a man struck by a sudden chill  did they tell you her name he asked in a voice that dropped suddenly to a whisper  they did i think but it has slipped my memorygently old fellow these long claws of yours are rather tight on my shoulder  was the name he stopped removed his hand and dashed away the great drops that were gathering on his forehead was the name la grace de dieu  how the deuce did you come to know it thats the name sure enough la grace de dieu  at one bound midwinter leaped on the bulwark of the wreck  the boat he cried with a scream of horror that rang far and wide through the stillness of the night and brought allan instantly to his side  the lower end of the carelessly hitched rope was loose on the water and ahead in the track of the moonlight a small black object was floating out of view the boat was adrift     iv the shadow of the past  one stepping back under the dark shelter of the bulwark and one standing out boldly in the yellow light of the moon the two friends turned face to face on the deck of the timbership and looked at each other in silence the next moment allans inveterate recklessness seized on the grotesque side of the situation by main force he seated himself astride on the bulwark and burst out boisterously into his loudest and heartiest laugh  all my fault he said but theres no help for it now here we are hard and fast in a trap of our own setting and there goes the last of the doctors boat come out of the dark midwinter i cant half see you there and i want to know whats to be done next  midwinter neither answered nor moved allan left the bulwark and mounting the forecastle looked down attentively at the waters of the sound  one thing is pretty certain he said with the current on that side and the sunken rocks on this we cant find our way out of the scrape by swimming at any rate so much for the prospect at this end of the wreck lets try how things look at the other rouse up messmate he called out cheerfully as he passed midwinter come and see what the old tub of a timbership has got to show us astern he sauntered on with his hands in his pockets humming the chorus of a comic song  his voice had produced no apparent effect on his friend but at the light touch of his hand in passing midwinter started and moved out slowly from the shadow of the bulwark come along cried allan suspending his singing for a moment and glancing back still without a word of answer the other followed thrice he stopped before he reached the stern end of the wreck the first time to throw aside his hat and push back his hair from his forehead and temples the second time reeling giddy to hold for a moment by a ringbolt close at hand the last time though allan was plainly visible a few yards ahead to look stealthily behind him with the furtive scrutiny of a man who believes that other footsteps are following him in the dark not yet he whispered to himself with eyes that searched the empty air i shall see him astern with his hand on the lock of the cabin door  the stern end of the wreck was clear of the shipbreakers lumber accumulated in the other parts of the vessel here the one object that rose visible on the smooth surface of the deck was the low wooden structure which held the cabin door and roofed in the cabin stairs the wheelhouse had been removed the binnacle had been removed but the cabin entrance and all that had belonged to it had been left untouched the scuttle was on and the door was closed  on gaining the afterpart of the vessel allan walked straight to the stern and looked out to sea over the taffrail no such thing as a boat was in view anywhere on the quiet moonbrightened waters knowing midwinters sight to be better than his own he called out come up here and see if theres a fisherman within hail of us hearing no reply he looked back midwinter had followed him as far as the cabin and had stopped there he called again in a louder voice and beckoned impatiently midwinter had heard the call for he looked up but still he never stirred from his place there he stood as if he had reached the utmost limits of the ship and could go no further  allan went back and joined him it was not easy to discover what he was looking at for he kept his face turned away from the moonlight but it seemed as if his eyes were fixed with a strange expression of inquiry on the cabin door what is there to look at there allan asked lets see if its locked as he took a step forward to open the door midwinters hand seized him suddenly by the coat collar and forced him back the moment after the hand relaxed without losing its grasp and trembled violently like the hand of a man completely unnerved  am i to consider myself in custody asked allan half astonished and half amused why in the name of wonder do you keep staring at the cabin door any suspicious noises below its no use disturbing the ratsif thats what you meanwe havent got a dog with us men living men they cant be for they would have heard us and come on deck dead men quite impossible no ships crew could be drowned in a landlocked place like this unless the vessel broke up under themand heres the vessel as steady as a church to speak for herself man alive how your hand trembles what is there to scare you in that rotten old cabin what are you shaking and shivering about any company of the supernatural sort on board mercy preserve us as the old women say do you see a ghost  i see two answered the other driven headlong into speech and action by a maddening temptation to reveal the truth two he repeated his breath bursting from him in deep heavy gasps as he tried vainly to force back the horrible words the ghost of a man like you drowning in the cabin and the ghost of a man like me turning the lock of the door on him  once more young armadales hearty laughter rang out loud and long through the stillness of the night  turning the lock of the door is he said allan as soon as his merriment left him breath enough to speak thats a devilish unhandsome action master midwinter on the part of your ghost the least i can do after that is to let mine out of the cabin and give him the run of the ship  with no more than a momentary exertion of his superior strength he freed himself easily from midwinters hold below there he called out gayly as he laid his strong hand on the crazy lock and tore open the cabin door ghost of allan armadale come on deck in his terrible ignorance of the truth he put his head into the doorway and looked down laughing at the place where his murdered father had died pah he exclaimed stepping back suddenly with a shudder of disgust the air is foul already and the cabin is full of water  it was true the sunken rocks on which the vessel lay wrecked had burst their way through her lower timbers astern and the water had welled up through the rifted wood here where the deed had been done the fatal parallel between past and present was complete what the cabin had been in the time of the fathers that the cabin was now in the time of the sons  allan pushed the door to again with his foot a little surprised at the sudden silence which appeared to have fallen on his friend from the moment when he had laid his hand on the cabin lock when he turned to look the reason of the silence was instantly revealed midwinter had dropped on the deck he lay senseless before the cabin door his face turned up white and still to the moonlight like the face of a dead man  in a moment allan was at his side he looked uselessly round the lonely limits of the wreck as he lifted midwinters head on his knee for a chance of help where all chance was ruthlessly cut off what am i to do he said to himself in the first impulse of alarm not a drop of water near but the foul water in the cabin a sudden recollection crossed his memory the florid color rushed back over his face and he drew from his pocket a wickercovered flask god bless the doctor for giving me this before we sailed he broke out fervently as he poured down midwinters throat some drops of the raw whisky which the flask contained the stimulant acted instantly on the sensitive system of the swooning man he sighed faintly and slowly opened his eyes have i been dreaming he asked looking up vacantly in allans face his eyes wandered higher and encountered the dismantled masts of the wreck rising weird and black against the night sky he shuddered at the sight of them and hid his face on allans knee no dream he murmured to himself mournfully oh me no dream  you have been overtired all day said allan and this infernal adventure of ours has upset you take some more whisky its sure to do you good can you sit by yourself if i put you against the bulwark so  why by myself why do you leave me asked midwinter  allan pointed to the mizzen shrouds of the wreck which were still left standing you are not well enough to rough it here till the workmen come off in the morning he said we must find our way on shore at once if we can i am going up to get a good view all round and see if theres a house within hail of us  even in the moment that passed while those few words were spoken midwinters eyes wandered back distrustfully to the fatal cabin door dont go near it he whispered dont try to open it for gods sake  no no returned allan humoring him when i come down from the rigging ill come back here he said the words a little constrainedly noticing for the first time while he now spoke an underlying distress in midwinters face which grieved and perplexed him youre not angry with me he said in his simple sweettempered way all this is my fault i know and i was a brute and a fool to laugh at you when i ought to have seen you were ill i am so sorry midwinter dont be angry with me  midwinter slowly raised his head his eyes rested with a mournful interest long and tender on allans anxious face  angry he repeated in his lowest gentlest tones angry with youoh my poor boy were you to blame for being kind to me when i was ill in the old westcountry inn and was i to blame for feeling your kindness thankfully was it our fault that we never doubted each other and never knew that we were traveling together blindfold on the way that was to lead us here the cruel time is coming allan when we shall rue the day we ever met shake hands brother on the edge of the precipiceshake hands while we are brothers still  allan turned away quickly convinced that his mind had not yet recovered the shock of the fainting fit dont forget the whisky he said cheerfully as he sprang into the rigging and mounted to the mizzentop  it was past two the moon was waning and the darkness that comes before dawn was beginning to gather round the wreck behind allan as he now stood looking out from the elevation of the mizzentop spread the broad and lonely sea before him were the low black lurking rocks and the broken waters of the channel pouring white and angry into the vast calm of the westward ocean beyond on the right hand heaved back grandly from the waterside were the rocks and precipices with their little tablelands of grass between the sloping downs and upwardrolling heath solitudes of the isle of man on the left hand rose the craggy sides of the islet of the calf here rent wildly into deep black chasms there lying low under long sweeping acclivities of grass and heath no sound rose no light was visible on either shore the black lines of the topmost masts of the wreck looked shadowy and faint in the darkening mystery of the sky the land breeze had dropped the small shoreward waves fell noiseless far or near no sound was audible but the cheerless bubbling of the broken water ahead pouring through the awful hush of silence in which earth and ocean waited for the coming day  even allans careless nature felt the solemn influence of the time the sound of his own voice startled him when he looked down and hailed his friend on deck  i think i see one house he said hereaway on the mainland to the right he looked again to make sure at a dim little patch of white with faint white lines behind it nestling low in a grassy hollow on the main island it looks like a stone house and inclosure he resumed ill hail it on the chance he passed his arm round a rope to steady himself made a speakingtrumpet of his hands and suddenly dropped them again without uttering a sound its so awfully quiet he whispered to himself im half afraid to call out he looked down again on deck i shant startle you midwinter shall i he said with an uneasy laugh he looked once more at the faint white object in the grassy hollow it wont do to have come up here for nothing he thought and made a speakingtrumpet of his hands again this time he gave the hail with the whole power of his lungs on shore there he shouted turning his face to the main island ahoyhoyhoy  the last echoes of his voice died away and were lost no sound answered him but the cheerless bubbling of the broken water ahead  he looked down again at his friend and saw the dark figure of midwinter rise erect and pace the deck backward and forward never disappearing out of sight of the cabin when it retired toward the bows of the wreck and never passing beyond the cabin when it returned toward the stern he is impatient to get away thought allan ill try again he hailed the land once more and taught by previous experience pitched his voice in its highest key  this time another sound than the sound of the bubbling water answered him the lowing of frightened cattle rose from the building in the grassy hollow and traveled far and drearily through the stillness of the morning air allan waited and listened if the building was a farmhouse the disturbance among the beasts would rouse the men if it was only a cattlestable nothing more would happen the lowing of the frightened brutes rose and fell drearily the minutes passed and nothing happened  once more said allan looking down at the restless figure pacing beneath him for the third time he hailed the land for the third time he waited and listened  in a pause of silence among the cattle he heard behind him on the opposite shore of the channel faint and far among the solitudes of the islet of the calf a sharp sudden sound like the distant clash of a heavy doorbolt drawn back turning at once in the new direction he strained his eyes to look for a house the last faint rays of the waning moonlight trembled here and there on the higher rocks and on the steeper pinnacles of ground but great strips of darkness lay dense and black over all the land between and in that darkness the house if house there were was lost to view  i have roused somebody at last allan called out encouragingly to midwinter still walking to and fro on the deck strangely indifferent to all that was passing above and beyond him look out for the answering hail and with his face set toward the islet allan shouted for help  the shout was not answered but mimicked with a shrill shrieking derision with wilder and wilder cries rising out of the deep distant darkness and mingling horribly the expression of a human voice with the sound of a brutes a sudden suspicion crossed allans mind which made his head swim and turned his hand cold as it held the rigging in breathless silence he looked toward the quarter from which the first mimicry of his cry for help had come after a moments pause the shrieks were renewed and the sound of them came nearer suddenly a figure which seemed the figure of a man leaped up black on a pinnacle of rock and capered and shrieked in the waning gleam of the moonlight the screams of a terrified woman mingled with the cries of the capering creature on the rock a red spark flashed out in the darkness from a light kindled in an invisible window the hoarse shouting of a mans voice in anger was heard through the noise a second black figure leaped up on the rock struggled with the first figure and disappeared with it in the darkness the cries grew fainter and fainter the screams of the woman were stilled the hoarse voice of the man was heard again for a moment hailing the wreck in words made unintelligible by the distance but in tones plainly expressive of rage and fear combined another moment and the clang of the doorbolt was heard again the red spark of light was quenched in darkness and all the islet lay quiet in the shadows once more the lowing of the cattle on the mainland ceased rose again stopped then cold and cheerless as ever the eternal bubbling of the broken water welled up through the great gap of silencethe one sound left as the mysterious stillness of the hour fell like a mantle from the heavens and closed over the wreck  allan descended from his place in the mizzentop and joined his friend again on deck  we must wait till the shipbreakers come off to their work he said meeting midwinter halfway in the course of his restless walk after what has happened i dont mind confessing that ive had enough of hailing the land only think of there being a madman in that house ashore and of my waking him horrible wasnt it  midwinter stood still for a moment and looked at allan with the perplexed air of a man who hears circumstances familiarly mentioned to which he is himself a total stranger he appeared if such a thing had been possible to have passed over entirely without notice all that had just happened on the islet of the calf  nothing is horrible out of this ship he said everything is horrible in it  answering in those strange words he turned away again and went on with his walk  allan picked up the flask of whisky lying on the deck near him and revived his spirits with a dram heres one thing on board that isnt horrible he retorted briskly as he screwed on the stopper of the flask and heres another he added as he took a cigar from his case and lit it three oclock he went on looking at his watch and settling himself comfortably on deck with his back against the bulwark daybreak isnt far off we shall have the piping of the birds to cheer us up before long i say midwinter you seem to have quite got over that unlucky fainting fit how you do keep walking come here and have a cigar and make yourself comfortable whats the good of tramping backward and forward in that restless way  i am waiting said midwinter  waiting what for  for what is to happen to you or to meor to both of usbefore we are out of this ship  with submission to your superior judgment my dear fellow i think quite enough has happened already the adventure will do very well as it stands now more of it is more than i want he took another dram of whisky and rambled on between the puffs of his cigar in his usual easy way ive not got your fine imagination old boy and i hope the next thing that happens will be the appearance of the workmens boat i suspect that queer fancy of yours has been running away with you while you were down here all by yourself come now what were you thinking of while i was up in the mizzentop frightening the cows  midwinter suddenly stopped suppose i tell you he said  suppose you do  the torturing temptation to reveal the truth roused once already by his companions merciless gayety of spirit possessed itself of midwinter for the second time he leaned back in the dark against the high side of the ship and looked down in silence at allans figure stretched comfortably on the deck rouse him the fiend whispered subtly from that ignorant selfpossession and that pitiless repose show him the place where the deed was done let him know it with your knowledge and fear it with your dread tell him of the letter you burned and of the words no fire can destroy which are living in your memory now let him see your mind as it was yesterday when it roused your sinking faith in your own convictions to look back on your life at sea and to cherish the comforting remembrance that in all your voyages you had never fallen in with this ship let him see your mind as it is now when the ship has got you at the turningpoint of your new life at the outset of your friendship with the one man of all men whom your father warned you to avoid think of those deathbed words and whisper them in his ear that he may think of them too hide yourself from him under an assumed name put the mountains and the seas between you be ungrateful be unforgiving be all that is most repellent to your own gentler nature rather than live under the same roof and breathe the same air with that man so the tempter counseled so like a noisome exhalation from the fathers grave the fathers influence rose and poisoned the mind of the son  the sudden silence surprised allan he looked back drowsily over his shoulder thinking again he exclaimed with a weary yawn  midwinter stepped out from the shadow and came nearer to allan than he had come yet yes he said thinking of the past and the future  the past and the future repeated allan shifting himself comfortably into a new position for my part im dumb about the past its a sore subject with me the past means the loss of the doctors boat lets talk about the future have you been taking a practical view as dear old brock calls it have you been considering the next serious question that concerns us both when we get back to the hotelthe question of breakfast  after an instants hesitation midwinter took a step nearer i have been thinking of your future and mine he said i have been thinking of the time when your way in life and my way in life will be two ways instead of one  heres the daybreak cried allan look up at the masts theyre beginning to get clear again already i beg your pardon what were you saying  midwinter made no reply the struggle between the hereditary superstition that was driving him on and the unconquerable affection for allan that was holding him back suspended the next words on his lips he turned aside his face in speechless suffering oh my father he thought better have killed me on that day when i lay on your bosom than have let me live for this  whats that about the future persisted allan i was looking for the daylight i didnt hear  midwinter controlled himself and answered you have treated me with your usual kindness he said in planning to take me with you to thorpe ambrose i think on reflection i had better not intrude myself where i am not known and not expected his voice faltered and he stopped again the more he shrank from it the clearer the picture of the happy life that he was resigning rose on his mind  allans thoughts instantly reverted to the mystification about the new steward which he had practiced on his friend when they were consulting together in the cabin of the yacht has he been turning it over in his mind wondered allan and is he beginning at last to suspect the truth ill try himtalk as much nonsense my dear fellow as you like he rejoined but dont forget that you are engaged to see me established at thorpe ambrose and to give me your opinion of the new steward  midwinter suddenly stepped forward again close to allan  i am not talking about your steward or your estate he burst out passionately i am talking about myself do you hear myself i am not a fit companion for you you dont know who i am he drew back into the shadowy shelter of the bulwark as suddenly as he had come out from it o god i cant tell him he said to himself in a whisper  for a moment and for a moment only allan was surprised not know who you are even as he repeated the words his easy goodhumor got the upperhand again he took up the whisky flask and shook it significantly i say he resumed how much of the doctors medicine did you take while i was up in the mizzentop  the light tone which he persisted in adopting stung midwinter to the last pitch of exasperation he came out again into the light and stamped his foot angrily on the deck listen to me he said you dont know half the low things i have done in my lifetime i have been a tradesmans drudge i have swept out the shop and put up the shutters i have carried parcels through the street and waited for my masters money at his customers doors  i have never done anything half as useful returned allan composedly dear old boy what an industrious fellow you have been in your time  ive been a vagabond and a blackguard in my time returned the other fiercely ive been a street tumbler a tramp a gypsys boy ive sung for halfpence with dancing dogs on the highroad ive worn a footboys livery and waited at table ive been a common sailors cook and a starving fishermans jackofalltrades what has a gentleman in your position in common with a man in mine can you take me into the society at thorpe ambrose why my very name would be a reproach to you fancy the faces of your new neighbors when their footmen announce ozias midwinter and allan armadale in the same breath he burst into a harsh laugh and repeated the two names again with a scornful bitterness of emphasis which insisted pitilessly on the marked contrast between them  something in the sound of his laughter jarred painfully even on allans easy nature he raised himself on the deck and spoke seriously for the first time a jokes a joke midwinter he said as long as you dont carry it too far i remember your saying something of the same sort to me once before when i was nursing you in somersetshire you forced me to ask you if i deserved to be kept at armslength by you of all the people in the world dont force me to say so again make as much fun of me as you please old fellow in any other way that way hurts me  simple as the words were and simply as they had been spoken they appeared to work an instant revolution in midwinters mind his impressible nature recoiled as from some sudden shock without a word of reply he walked away by himself to the forward part of the ship he sat down on some piled planks between the masts and passed his hand over his head in a vacant bewildered way though his fathers belief in fatality was his own belief once morethough there was no longer the shadow of a doubt in his mind that the woman whom mr brock had met in somersetshire and the woman who had tried to destroy herself in london were one and the samethough all the horror that mastered him when he first read the letter from wildbad had now mastered him again allans appeal to their past experience of each other had come home to his heart with a force more irresistible than the force of his superstition itself in the strength of that very superstition he now sought the pretext which might encourage him to sacrifice every less generous feeling to the one predominant dread of wounding the sympathies of his friend why distress him he whispered to himself we are not the end here there is the woman behind us in the dark why resist him when the mischiefs done and the caution comes too late what is to be will be what have i to do with the future and what has he  he went back to allan sat down by his side and took his hand forgive me he said gently i have hurt you for the last time before it was possible to reply he snatched up the whisky flask from the deck come he exclaimed with a sudden effort to match his friends cheerfulness you have been trying the doctors medicine why shouldnt i  allan was delighted this is something like a change for the better he said midwinter is himself again hark there are the birds hail smiling morn smiling morn he sang the words of the glee in his old cheerful voice and clapped midwinter on the shoulder in his old hearty way how did you manage to clear your head of those confounded megrims do you know you were quite alarming about something happening to one or other of us before we were out of this ship  sheer nonsense returned midwinter contemptuously i dont think my head has ever been quite right since that fever ive got a bee in my bonnet as they say in the north lets talk of something else about those people you have let the cottage to i wonder whether the agents account of major milroys family is to be depended on there might be another lady in the household besides his wife and his daughter  oho cried allan youre beginning to think of nymphs among the trees and flirtations in the fruitgarden are you another lady eh suppose the majors family circle wont supply another we shall have to spin that halfcrown again and toss up for which is to have the first chance with miss milroy  for once midwinter spoke as lightly and carelessly as allan himself no no he said the majors landlord has the first claim to the notice of the majors daughter ill retire into the background and wait for the next lady who makes her appearance at thorpe ambrose  very good ill have an address to the women of norfolk posted in the park to that effect said allan are you particular to a shade about size or complexion whats your favorite age  midwinter trifled with his own superstition as a man trifles with the loaded gun that may kill him or with the savage animal that may maim him for life he mentioned the age as he had reckoned it himself of the woman in the black gown and the red paisley shawl  fiveandthirty he said  as the words passed his lips his factitious spirits deserted him he left his seat impenetrably deaf to all allans efforts at rallying him on his extraordinary answer and resumed his restless pacing of the deck in dead silence once more the haunting thought which had gone to and fro with him in the hour of darkness went to and fro with him now in the hour of daylight  once more the conviction possessed itself of his mind that something was to happen to allan or to himself before they left the wreck  minute by minute the light strengthened in the eastern sky and the shadowy places on the deck of the timbership revealed their barren emptiness under the eye of day as the breeze rose again the sea began to murmur wakefully in the morning light even the cold bubbling of the broken water changed its cheerless note and softened on the ear as the mellowing flood of daylight poured warm over it from the rising sun midwinter paused near the forward part of the ship and recalled his wandering attention to the passing time the cheering influences of the hour were round him look where he might the happy morning smile of the summer sky so brightly merciful to the old and weary earth lavished its allembracing beauty even on the wreck the dew that lay glittering on the inland fields lay glittering on the deck and the worn and rusted rigging was gemmed as brightly as the fresh green leaves on shore insensibly as he looked round midwinters thoughts reverted to the comrade who had shared with him the adventure of the night he returned to the afterpart of the ship spoke to allan as he advanced receiving no answer he approached the recumbent figure and looked closer at it left to his own resources allan had let the fatigues of the night take their own way with him his head had sunk back his hat had fallen off he lay stretched at full length on the deck of the timbership deeply and peacefully asleep  midwinter resumed his walk his mind lost in doubt his own past thoughts seeming suddenly to have grown strange to him how darkly his forebodings had distrusted the coming time and how harmlessly that time had come the sun was mounting in the heavens the hour of release was drawing nearer and nearer and of the two armadales imprisoned in the fatal ship one was sleeping away the weary time and the other was quietly watching the growth of the new day  the sun climbed higher the hour wore on with the latent distrust of the wreck which still clung to him midwinter looked inquiringly on either shore for signs of awakening human life the land was still lonely the smoke wreaths that were soon to rise from cottage chimneys had not risen yet  after a moments thought he went back again to the afterpart of the vessel to see if there might be a fishermans boat within hail astern of them absorbed for the moment by the new idea he passed allan hastily after barely noticing that he still lay asleep one step more would have brought him to the taffrail when that step was suspended by a sound behind him a sound like a faint groan he turned and looked at the sleeper on the deck he knelt softly and looked closer  it has come he whispered to himself not to mebut to him  it had come in the bright freshness of the morning it had come in the mystery and terror of a dream the face which midwinter had last seen in perfect repose was now the distorted face of a suffering man the perspiration stood thick on allans forehead and matted his curling hair his partially opened eyes showed nothing but the white of the eyeball gleaming blindly his outstretched hands scratched and struggled on the deck from moment to moment he moaned and muttered helplessly but the words that escaped him were lost in the grinding and gnashing of his teeth there he layso near in the body to the friend who bent over him so far away in the spirit that the two might have been in different worldsthere he lay with the morning sunshine on his face in the torture of his dream  one question and one only rose in the mind of the man who was looking at him what had the fatality which had imprisoned him in the wreck decreed that he should see  had the treachery of sleep opened the gates of the grave to that one of the two armadales whom the other had kept in ignorance of the truth was the murder of the father revealing itself to the sonthere on the very spot where the crime had been committedin the vision of a dream  with that question overshadowing all else in his mind the son of the homicide knelt on the deck and looked at the son of the man whom his fathers hand had slain  the conflict between the sleeping body and the waking mind was strengthening every moment the dreamers helpless groaning for deliverance grew louder his hands raised themselves and clutched at the empty air struggling with the allmastering dread that still held him midwinter laid his hand gently on allans forehead light as the touch was there were mysterious sympathies in the dreaming man that answered it his groaning ceased and his hands dropped slowly there was an instant of suspense and midwinter looked closer his breath just fluttered over the sleepers face before the next breath had risen to his lips allan suddenly sprang up on his kneessprang up as if the call of a trumpet had rung on his ear awake in an instant  you have been dreaming said midwinter as the other looked at him wildly in the first bewilderment of waking  allans eyes began to wander about the wreck at first vacantly then with a look of angry surprise are we here still he said as midwinter helped him to his feet whatever else i do on board this infernal ship he added after a moment i wont go to sleep again  as he said those words his friends eyes searched his face in silent inquiry they took a turn together on the deck  tell me your dream said midwinter with a strange tone of suspicion in his voice and a strange appearance of abruptness in his manner  i cant tell it yet returned allan wait a little till im my own man again  they took another turn on the deck midwinter stopped and spoke once more  look at me for a moment allan he said  there was something of the trouble left by the dream and something of natural surprise at the strange request just addressed to him in allans face as he turned it full on the speaker but no shadow of illwill no lurking lines of distrust anywhere midwinter turned aside quickly and hid as he best might an irrepressible outburst of relief  do i look a little upset asked allan taking his arm and leading him on again dont make yourself nervous about me if i do my head feels wild and giddy but i shall soon get over it  for the next few minutes they walked backward and forward in silence the one bent on dismissing the terror of the dream from his thoughts the other bent on discovering what the terror of the dream might be relieved of the dread that had oppressed it the superstitious nature of midwinter had leaped to its next conclusion at a bound what if the sleeper had been visited by another revelation than the revelation of the past what if the dream had opened those unturned pages in the book of the future which told the story of his life to come the bare doubt that it might be so strengthened tenfold midwinters longing to penetrate the mystery which allans silence still kept a secret from him  is your head more composed he asked can you tell me your dream now  while he put the question a last memorable moment in the adventure of the wreck was at hand  they had reached the stern and were just turning again when midwinter spoke as allan opened his lips to answer he looked out mechanically to sea instead of replying he suddenly ran to the taffrail and waved his hat over his head with a shout of exultation  midwinter joined him and saw a large sixoared boat pulling straight for the channel of the sound a figure which they both thought they recognized rose eagerly in the sternsheets and returned the waving of allans hat the boat came nearer the steersman called to them cheerfully and they recognized the doctors voice  thank god youre both above water said mr hawbury as they met him on the deck of the timbership of all the winds of heaven which wind blew you here  he looked at midwinter as he made the inquiry but it was allan who told him the story of the night and allan who asked the doctor for information in return the one absorbing interest in midwinters mindthe interest of penetrating the mystery of the dreamkept him silent throughout heedless of all that was said or done about him he watched allan and followed allan like a dog until the time came for getting down into the boat mr hawburys professional eye rested on him curiously noting his varying color and the incessant restlessness of his hands i wouldnt change nervous systems with that man for the largest fortune that could be offered me thought the doctor as he took the boats tiller and gave the oarsmen their order to push off from the wreck  having reserved all explanations on his side until they were on their way back to port st mary mr hawbury next addressed himself to the gratification of allans curiosity the circumstances which had brought him to the rescue of his two guests of the previous evening were simple enough the lost boat had been met with at sea by some fishermen of port erin on the western side of the island who at once recognized it as the doctors property and at once sent a messenger to make inquiry at the doctors house the mans statement of what had happened had naturally alarmed mr hawbury for the safety of allan and his friend he had immediately secured assistance and guided by the boatmans advice had made first for the most dangerous place on the coastthe only place in that calm weather in which an accident could have happened to a boat sailed by experienced menthe channel of the sound after thus accounting for his welcome appearance on the scene the doctor hospitably insisted that his guests of the evening should be his guests of the morning as well it would still be too early when they got back for the people at the hotel to receive them and they would find bed and breakfast at mr hawburys house  at the first pause in the conversation between allan and the doctor midwinter who had neither joined in the talk nor listened to the talk touched his friend on the arm are you better he asked in a whisper shall you soon be composed enough to tell me what i want to know  allans eyebrows contracted impatiently the subject of the dream and midwinters obstinacy in returning to it seemed to be alike distasteful to him he hardly answered with his usual good humor i suppose i shall have no peace till i tell you he said so i may as well get it over at once  no returned midwinter with a look at the doctor and his oarsmen not where other people can hear itnot till you and i are alone  if you wish to see the last gentlemen of your quarters for the night interposed the doctor now is your time the coast will shut the vessel out in a minute more  in silence on the one side and on the other the two armadales looked their last at the fatal ship lonely and lost they had found the wreck in the mystery of the summer night lonely and lost they left the wreck in the radiant beauty of the summer morning  an hour later the doctor had seen his guests established in their bedrooms and had left them to take their rest until the breakfast hour arrived  almost as soon as his back was turned the doors of both rooms opened softly and allan and midwinter met in the passage  can you sleep after what has happened asked allan  midwinter shook his head you were coming to my room were you not he said what for  to ask you to keep me company what were you coming to my room for  to ask you to tell me your dream  damn the dream i want to forget all about it  and i want to know all about it  both paused both refrained instinctively from saying more for the first time since the beginning of their friendship they were on the verge of a disagreement and that on the subject of the dream allans good temper just stopped them on the brink  you are the most obstinate fellow alive he said but if you will know all about it you must know all about it i suppose come into my room and ill tell you  he led the way and midwinter followed the door closed and shut them in together     v the shadow of the future  when mr hawbury joined his guests in the breakfastroom the strange contrast of character between them which he had noticed already was impressed on his mind more strongly than ever one of them sat at the wellspread table hungry and happy ranging from dish to dish and declaring that he had never made such a breakfast in his life the other sat apart at the window his cup thanklessly deserted before it was empty his meat left ungraciously halfeaten on his plate the doctors morning greeting to the two accurately expressed the differing impressions which they had produced on his mind  he clapped allan on the shoulder and saluted him with a joke he bowed constrainedly to midwinter and said i am afraid you have not recovered the fatigues of the night  its not the night doctor that has damped his spirits said allan its something i have been telling him it is not my fault mind if i had only known beforehand that he believed in dreams i wouldnt have opened my lips  dreams repeated the doctor looking at midwinter directly and addressing him under a mistaken impression of the meaning of allans words with your constitution you ought to be well used to dreaming by this time  this way doctor you have taken the wrong turning cried allan im the dreamer not he dont look astonished it wasnt in this comfortable house it was on board that confounded timbership the fact is i fell asleep just before you took us off the wreck and its not to be denied that i had a very ugly dream well when we got back here  why do you trouble mr hawbury about a matter that cannot possibly interest him asked midwinter speaking for the first time and speaking very impatiently  i beg your pardon returned the doctor rather sharply so far as i have heard the matter does interest me  thats right doctor said allan be interested i beg and pray i want you to clear his head of the nonsense he has got in it now what do you think he will have it that my dream is a warning to me to avoid certain people and he actually persists in saying that one of those people ishimself did you ever hear the like of it i took great pains i explained the whole thing to him i said warning be hanged its all indigestion you dont know what i ate and drank at the doctors suppertable i do do you think he would listen to me not he you try him next youre a professional man and he must listen to you be a good fellow doctor and give me a certificate of indigestion ill show you my tongue with pleasure  the sight of your face is quite enough said mr hawbury i certify on the spot that you never had such a thing as an indigestion in your life lets hear about the dream and see what we can make of it if you have no objection that is to say  allan pointed at midwinter with his fork  apply to my friend there he said he has got a much better account of it than i can give you if youll believe me he took it all down in writing from my own lips and he made me sign it at the end as if it was my last dying speech and confession before i went to the gallows out with it old boyi saw you put it in your pocketbookout with it  are you really in earnest asked midwinter producing his pocketbook with a reluctance which was almost offensive under the circumstances for it implied distrust of the doctor in the doctors own house  mr hawburys color rose pray dont show it to me if you feel the least unwillingness he said with the elaborate politeness of an offended man  stuff and nonsense cried allan throw it over here  instead of complying with that characteristic request midwinter took the paper from the pocketbook and leaving his place approached mr hawbury i beg your pardon he said as he offered the doctor the manuscript with his own hand his eyes dropped to the ground and his face darkened while he made the apology a secret sullen fellow thought the doctor thanking him with formal civility his friend is worth ten thousand of him midwinter went back to the window and sat down again in silence with the old impenetrable resignation which had once puzzled mr brock  read that doctor said allan as mr hawbury opened the written paper its not told in my roundabout way but theres nothing added to it and nothing taken away its exactly what i dreamed and exactly what i should have written myself if i had thought the thing worth putting down on paper and if i had had the knack of writingwhich concluded allan composedly stirring his coffee i havent except its letters and i rattle them off in no time  mr hawbury spread the manuscript before him on the breakfasttable and read these lines    allan armadales dream  early on the morning of june the first eighteen hundred and fiftyone i found myself through circumstances which it is not important to mention in this place left alone with a friend of minea young man about my own ageon board the french timbership named la grace de dieu which ship then lay wrecked in the channel of the sound between the mainland of the isle of man and the islet called the calf having not been in bed the previous night and feeling overcome by fatigue i fell asleep on the deck of the vessel i was in my usual good health at the time and the morning was far enough advanced for the sun to have risen under these circumstances and at that period of the day i passed from sleeping to dreaming as clearly as i can recollect it after the lapse of a few hours this was the succession of events presented to me by the dream  1 the first event of which i was conscious was the appearance of my father he took me silently by the hand and we found ourselves in the cabin of a ship  2 water rose slowly over us in the cabin and i and my father sank through the water together  3 an interval of oblivion followed and then the sense came to me of being left alone in the darkness  4 i waited  5 the darkness opened and showed me the visionas in a pictureof a broad lonely pool surrounded by open ground above the farther margin of the pool i saw the cloudless western sky red with the light of sunset  6 on the near margin of the pool there stood the shadow of a woman  7 it was the shadow only no indication was visible to me by which i could identify it or compare it with any living creature the long robe showed me that it was the shadow of a woman and showed me nothing more  8 the darkness closed againremained with me for an intervaland opened for the second time  9 i found myself in a room standing before a long window the only object of furniture or of ornament that i saw or that i can now remember having seen was a little statue placed near me the window opened on a lawn and flowergarden and the rain was pattering heavily against the glass  10 i was not alone in the room standing opposite to me at the window was the shadow of a man  11 i saw no more of it i knew no more of it than i saw and knew of the shadow of the woman but the shadow of the man moved it stretched out its arm toward the statue and the statue fell in fragments on the floor  12 with a confused sensation in me which was partly anger and partly distress i stooped to look at the fragments when i rose again the shadow had vanished and i saw no more  13 the darkness opened for the third time and showed me the shadow of the woman and the shadow of the man together  14 no surrounding scene or none that i can now call to mind was visible to me  15 the manshadow was the nearest the womanshadow stood back from where she stood there came a sound as of the pouring of a liquid softly i saw her touch the shadow of the man with one hand and with the other give him a glass he took the glass and gave it to me in the moment when i put it to my lips a deadly faintness mastered me from head to foot when i came to my senses again the shadows had vanished and the third vision was at an end  16 the darkness closed over me again and the interval of oblivion followed  17 i was conscious of nothing more till i felt the morning sun shine on my face and heard my friend tell me that i had awakened from a dream   after reading the narrative attentively to the last line under which appeared allans signature the doctor looked across the breakfasttable at midwinter and tapped his fingers on the manuscript with a satirical smile  many men many opinions he said i dont agree with either of you about this dream your theory he added looking at allan with a smile we have disposed of already the supper that you cant digest is a supper which has yet to be discovered my theory we will come to presently your friends theory claims attention first he turned again to midwinter with his anticipated triumph over a man whom he disliked a little too plainly visible in his face and manner if i understand rightly he went on you believe that this dream is a warning supernaturally addressed to mr armadale of dangerous events that are threatening him and of dangerous people connected with those events whom he would do wisely to avoid may i inquire whether you have arrived at this conclusion as an habitual believer in dreams or as having reasons of your own for attaching especial importance to this one dream in particular  you have stated what my conviction is quite accurately returned midwinter chafing under the doctors looks and tones excuse me if i ask you to be satisfied with that admission and to let me keep my reasons to myself  thats exactly what he said to me interposed allan i dont believe he has got any reasons at all  gently gently said mr hawbury we can discuss the subject without intruding ourselves into anybodys secrets let us come to my own method of dealing with the dream next mr midwinter will probably not be surprised to hear that i look at this matter from an essentially practical point of view  i shall not be at all surprised retorted midwinter the view of a medical man when he has a problem in humanity to solve seldom ranges beyond the point of his dissectingknife  the doctor was a little nettled on his side our limits are not quite so narrow as that he said but i willingly grant you that there are some articles of your faith in which we doctors dont believe for example we dont believe that a reasonable man is justified in attaching a supernatural interpretation to any phenomenon which comes within the range of his senses until he has certainly ascertained that there is no such thing as a natural explanation of it to be found in the first instance  come thats fair enough im sure exclaimed allan he hit you hard with the dissectingknife doctor and now you have hit him back again with your natural explanation lets have it  by all means said mr hawbury here it is there is nothing at all extraordinary in my theory of dreams it is the theory accepted by the great mass of my profession a dream is the reproduction in the sleeping state of the brain of images and impressions produced on it in the waking state and this reproduction is more or less involved imperfect or contradictory as the action of certain faculties in the dreamer is controlled more or less completely by the influence of sleep without inquiring further into this latter part of the subjecta very curious and interesting part of itlet us take the theory roughly and generally as i have just stated it and apply it at once to the dream now under consideration he took up the written paper from the table and dropped the formal tone as of a lecturer addressing an audience into which he had insensibly fallen i see one event already in this dream he resumed which i know to be the reproduction of a waking impression produced on mr armadale in my own presence if he will only help me by exerting his memory i dont despair of tracing back the whole succession of events set down here to something that he has said or thought or seen or done in the fourandtwenty hours or less which preceded his falling asleep on the deck of the timbership  ill exert my memory with the greatest pleasure said allan where shall we start from  start by telling me what you did yesterday before i met you and your friend on the road to this place replied mr hawbury we will say you got up and had your breakfast what next  we took a carriage next said allan and drove from castletown to douglas to see my old friend mr brock off by the steamer to liverpool we came back to castletown and separated at the hotel door midwinter went into the house and i went on to my yacht in the harbor bythebye doctor remember you have promised to go cruising with us before we leave the isle of man  many thanks but suppose we keep to the matter in hand what next  allan hesitated in both senses of the word his mind was at sea already  what did you do on board the yacht  oh i know i put the cabin to rightsthoroughly to rights i give you my word of honor i turned every blessed thing topsyturvy and my friend there came off in a shoreboat and helped me talking of boats i have never asked you yet whether your boat came to any harm last night if theres any damage done i insist on being allowed to repair it  the doctor abandoned all further attempts at the cultivation of allans memory in despair  i doubt if we shall be able to reach our object conveniently in this way he said it will be better to take the events of the dream in their regular order and to ask the questions that naturally suggest themselves as we go on here are the first two events to begin with you dream that your father appears to youthat you and he find yourselves in the cabin of a shipthat the water rises over you and that you sink in it together were you down in the cabin of the wreck may i ask  i couldnt be down there replied allan as the cabin was full of water i looked in and saw it and shut the door again  very good said mr hawbury here are the waking impressions clear enough so far you have had the cabin in your mind and you have had the water in your mind and the sound of the channel current as i well know without asking was the last sound in your ears when you went to sleep the idea of drowning comes too naturally out of such impressions as these to need dwelling on is there anything else before we go on yes there is one more circumstance left to account for  the most important circumstance of all remarked midwinter joining in the conversation without stirring from his place at the window  you mean the appearance of mr armadales father i was just coming to that answered mr hawbury is your father alive he added addressing himself to allan once more  my father died before i was born  the doctor started this complicates it a little he said how did you know that the figure appearing to you in the dream was the figure of your father  allan hesitated again midwinter drew his chair a little away from the window and looked at the doctor attentively for the first time  was your father in your thoughts before you went to sleep pursued mr hawbury was there any description of himany portrait of him at homein your mind  of course there was cried allan suddenly seizing the lost recollection midwinter you remember the miniature you found on the floor of the cabin when we were putting the yacht to rights you said i didnt seem to value it and i told you i did because it was a portrait of my father  and was the face in the dream like the face in the miniature asked mr hawbury  exactly like i say doctor this is beginning to get interesting  what do you say now asked mr hawbury turning toward the window again  midwinter hurriedly left his chair and placed himself at the table with allan just as he had once already taken refuge from the tyranny of his own superstition in the comfortable common sense of mr brock so with the same headlong eagerness with the same straightforward sincerity of purpose he now took refuge in the doctors theory of dreams i say what my friend says he answered flushing with a sudden enthusiasm this is beginning to get interesting go on pray go on  the doctor looked at his strange guest more indulgently than he had looked yet you are the only mystic i have met with he said who is willing to give fair evidence fair play i dont despair of converting you before our inquiry comes to an end let us get on to the next set of events he resumed after referring for a moment to the manuscript the interval of oblivion which is described as succeeding the first of the appearances in the dream may be easily disposed of it means in plain english the momentary cessation of the brains intellectual action while a deeper wave of sleep flows over it just as the sense of being alone in the darkness which follows indicates the renewal of that action previous to the reproduction of another set of impressions let us see what they are a lonely pool surrounded by an open country a sunset sky on the further side of the pool and the shadow of a woman on the near side very good now for it mr armadale how did that pool get into your head the open country you saw on your way from castletown to this place but we have no pools or lakes hereabouts and you can have seen none recently elsewhere for you came here after a cruise at sea must we fall back on a picture or a book or a conversation with your friend  allan looked at midwinter i dont remember talking about pools or lakes he said do you  instead of answering the question midwinter suddenly appealed to the doctor  have you got the last number of the manx newspaper he asked  the doctor produced it from the sideboard midwinter turned to the page containing those extracts from the recently published travels in australia which had roused allans interest on the previous evening and the reading of which had ended by sending his friend to sleep therein the passage describing the sufferings of the travelers from thirst and the subsequent discovery which saved their livesthere appearing at the climax of the narrative was the broad pool of water which had figured in allans dream  dont put away the paper said the doctor when midwinter had shown it to him with the necessary explanation before we are at the end of the inquiry it is quite possible we may want that extract again we have got at the pool how about the sunset nothing of that sort is referred to in the newspaper extract search your memory again mr armadale we want your waking impression of a sunset if you please  once more allan was at a loss for an answer and once more midwinters ready memory helped him through the difficulty  i think i can trace our way back to this impression as i traced our way back to the other he said addressing the doctor after we got here yesterday afternoon my friend and i took a long walk over the hills  thats it interposed allan i remember the sun was setting as we came back to the hotel for supper and it was such a splendid red sky we both stopped to look at it and then we talked about mr brock and wondered how far he had got on his journey home my memory may be a slow one at starting doctor but when its once set going stop it if you can i havent half done yet  wait one minute in mercy to mr midwinters memory and mine said the doctor we have traced back to your waking impressions the vision of the open country the pool and the sunset but the shadow of the woman has not been accounted for yet can you find us the original of this mysterious figure in the dream landscape  allan relapsed into his former perplexity and midwinter waited for what was to come with his eyes fixed in breathless interest on the doctors face for the first time there was unbroken silence in the room mr hawbury looked interrogatively from allan to allans friend neither of them answered him between the shadow and the shadows substance there was a great gulf of mystery impenetrable alike to all three of them  patience said the doctor composedly let us leave the figure by the pool for the present and try if we cant pick her up again as we go on allow me to observe mr midwinter that it is not very easy to identify a shadow but we wont despair this impalpable lady of the lake may take some consistency when we next meet with her  midwinter made no reply from that moment his interest in the inquiry began to flag  what is the next scene in the dream pursued mr hawbury referring to the manuscript mr armadale finds himself in a room he is standing before a long window opening on a lawn and flowergarden and the rain is pattering against the glass the only thing he sees in the room is a little statue and the only company he has is the shadow of a man standing opposite to him the shadow stretches out its arm and the statue falls in fragments on the floor and the dreamer in anger and distress at the catastrophe observe gentlemen that here the sleepers reasoning faculty wakes up a little and the dream passes rationally for a moment from cause to effect stoops to look at the broken pieces when he looks up again the scene has vanished that is to say in the ebb and flow of sleep it is the turn of the flow now and the brain rests a little whats the matter mr armadale has that restive memory of yours run away with you again  yes said allan im off at full gallop ive run the broken statue to earth its nothing more nor less than a china shepherdess i knocked off the mantelpiece in the hotel coffeeroom when i rang the bell for supper last night i say how well we get on dont we its like guessing a riddle now then midwinter your turn next  no said the doctor my turn if you please i claim the long window the garden and the lawn as my property you will find the long window mr armadale in the next room if you look out youll see the garden and lawn in front of it and if youll exert that wonderful memory of yours you will recollect that you were good enough to take special and complimentary notice of my smart french window and my neat garden when i drove you and your friend to port st mary yesterday  quite right rejoined allan so i did but what about the rain that fell in the dream i havent seen a drop of rain for the last week  mr hawbury hesitated the manx newspaper which had been left on the table caught his eye if we can think of nothing else he said let us try if we cant find the idea of the rain where we found the idea of the pool he looked through the extract carefully i have got it he exclaimed here is rain described as having fallen on these thirsty australian travelers before they discovered the pool behold the shower mr armadale which got into your mind when you read the extract to your friend last night and behold the dream mr midwinter mixing up separate waking impressions just as usual  can you find the waking impression which accounts for the human figure at the window asked midwinter or are we to pass over the shadow of the man as we have passed over the shadow of the woman already  he put the question with scrupulous courtesy of manner but with a tone of sarcasm in his voice which caught the doctors ear and set up the doctors controversial bristles on the instant  when you are picking up shells on the beach mr midwinter you usually begin with the shells that lie nearest at hand he rejoined we are picking up facts now and those that are easiest to get at are the facts we will take first let the shadow of the man and the shadow of the woman pair off together for the present we wont lose sight of them i promise you all in good time my dear sir all in good time  he too was polite and he too was sarcastic the short truce between the opponents was at an end already midwinter returned significantly to his former place by the window the doctor instantly turned his back on the window more significantly still allan who never quarreled with anybodys opinion and never looked below the surface of anybodys conduct drummed cheerfully on the table with the handle of his knife go on doctor he called out my wonderful memory is as fresh as ever  is it said mr hawbury referring again to the narrative of the dream do you remember what happened when you and i were gossiping with the landlady at the bar of the hotel last night  of course i do you were kind enough to hand me a glass of brandyandwater which the landlady had just mixed for your own drinking and i was obliged to refuse it because as i told you the taste of brandy always turns me sick and faint mix it how you please  exactly so returned the doctor and here is the incident reproduced in the dream you see the mans shadow and the womans shadow together this time you hear the pouring out of liquid brandy from the hotel bottle and water from the hotel jug the glass is handed by the womanshadow the landlady to the manshadow myself the manshadow hands it to you exactly what i did and the faintness which you had previously described to me follows in due course i am shocked to identify these mysterious appearances mr midwinter with such miserably unromantic originals as a woman who keeps a hotel and a man who physics a country district but your friend himself will tell you that the glass of brandyandwater was prepared by the landlady and that it reached him by passing from her hand to mine we have picked up the shadows exactly as i anticipated and we have only to account nowwhich may be done in two wordsfor the manner of their appearance in the dream after having tried to introduce the waking impression of the doctor and the landlady separately in connection with the wrong set of circumstances the dreaming mind comes right at the third trial and introduces the doctor and the landlady together in connection with the right set of circumstances there it is in a nutshellpermit me to hand you back the manuscript with my best thanks for your very complete and striking confirmation of the rational theory of dreams saying those words mr hawbury returned the written paper to midwinter with the pitiless politeness of a conquering man  wonderful not a point missed anywhere from beginning to end by jupiter cried allan with the ready reverence of intense ignorance what a thing science is  not a point missed as you say remarked the doctor complacently and yet i doubt if we have succeeded in convincing your friend  you have not convinced me said midwinter but i dont presume on that account to say that you are wrong  he spoke quietly almost sadly the terrible conviction of the supernatural origin of the dream from which he had tried to escape had possessed itself of him again all his interest in the argument was at an end all his sensitiveness to its irritating influences was gone in the case of any other man mr hawbury would have been mollified by such a concession as his adversary had now made to him but he disliked midwinter too cordially to leave him in the peaceable enjoyment of an opinion of his own  do you admit asked the doctor more pugnaciously than ever that i have traced back every event of the dream to a waking impression which preceded it in mr armadales mind  i have no wish to deny that you have done so said midwinter resignedly  have i identified the shadows with their living originals  you have identified them to your own satisfaction and to my friends satisfaction not to mine  not to yours can you identify them  no i can only wait till the living originals stand revealed in the future  spoken like an oracle mr midwinter have you any idea at present of who those living originals may be  i have i believe that coming events will identify the shadow of the woman with a person whom my friend has not met with yet and the shadow of the man with myself  allan attempted to speak the doctor stopped him let us clearly understand this he said to midwinter leaving your own case out of the question for the moment may i ask how a shadow which has no distinguishing mark about it is to be identified with a living woman whom your friend doesnt know  midwinters color rose a little he began to feel the lash of the doctors logic  the landscape picture of the dream has its distinguishing marks he replied and in that landscape the living woman will appear when the living woman is first seen  the same thing will happen i suppose pursued the doctor with the manshadow which you persist in identifying with yourself you will be associated in the future with a statue broken in your friends presence with a long window looking out on a garden and with a shower of rain pattering against the glass do you say that  i say that  and so again i presume with the next vision you and the mysterious woman will be brought together in some place now unknown and will present to mr armadale some liquid yet unnamed which will turn him faintdo you seriously tell me you believe this  i seriously tell you i believe it  and according to your view these fulfillments of the dream will mark the progress of certain coming events in which mr armadales happiness or mr armadales safety will be dangerously involved  that is my firm conviction  the doctor rose laid aside his moral dissectingknife considered for a moment and took it up again  one last question he said have you any reason to give for going out of your way to adopt such a mystical view as this when an unanswerably rational explanation of the dream lies straight before you  no reason replied midwinter that i can give either to you or to my friend  the doctor looked at his watch with the air of a man who is suddenly reminded that he has been wasting his time  we have no common ground to start from he said and if we talk till doomsday we should not agree excuse my leaving you rather abruptly it is later than i thought and my mornings batch of sick people are waiting for me in the surgery i have convinced your mind mr armadale at any rate so the time we have given to this discussion has not been altogether lost pray stop here and smoke your cigar i shall be at your service again in less than an hour he nodded cordially to allan bowed formally to midwinter and quitted the room  as soon as the doctors back was turned allan left his place at the table and appealed to his friend with that irresistible heartiness of manner which had always found its way to midwinters sympathies from the first day when they met at the somersetshire inn  now the sparringmatch between you and the doctor is over said allan i have got two words to say on my side will you do something for my sake which you wont do for your own  midwinters face brightened instantly i will do anything you ask me he said  very well will you let the subject of the dream drop out of our talk altogether from this time forth  yes if you wish it  will you go a step further will you leave off thinking about the dream  its hard to leave off thinking about it allan but i will try  thats a good fellow now give me that trumpery bit of paper and lets tear it up and have done with it  he tried to snatch the manuscript out of his friends hand but midwinter was too quick for him and kept it beyond his reach  come come pleaded allan ive set my heart on lighting my cigar with it  midwinter hesitated painfully it was hard to resist allan but he did resist him ill wait a little he said before you light your cigar with it  how long till tomorrow  longer  till we leave the isle of man  longer  hang itgive me a plain answer to a plain question how long will you wait  midwinter carefully restored the paper to its place in his pocketbook  ill wait he said till we get to thorpe ambrose   the end of the first book        book the second     i lurking mischief  1 from ozias midwinter to mr brock  thorpe ambrose june 15 1851  dear mr brockonly an hour since we reached this house just as the servants were locking up for the night allan has gone to bed worn out by our long days journey and has left me in the room they call the library to tell you the story of our journey to norfolk being better seasoned than he is to fatigues of all kinds my eyes are quite wakeful enough for writing a letter though the clock on the chimneypiece points to midnight and we have been traveling since ten in the morning  the last news you had of us was news sent by allan from the isle of man if i am not mistaken he wrote to tell you of the night we passed on board the wrecked ship forgive me dear mr brock if i say nothing on that subject until time has helped me to think of it with a quieter mind the hard fight against myself must all be fought over again but i will win it yet please god i will indeed  there is no need to trouble you with any account of our journeyings about the northern and western districts of the island or of the short cruises we took when the repairs of the yacht were at last complete it will be better if i get on at once to the morning of yesterday the fourteenth we had come in with the nighttide to douglas harbor and as soon as the postoffice was open allan by my advice sent on shore for letters the messenger returned with one letter only and the writer of it proved to be the former mistress of thorpe ambrosemrs blanchard  you ought to be informed i think of the contents of this letter for it has seriously influenced allans plans he loses everything sooner or later as you know and he has lost the letter already so i must give you the substance of what mrs blanchard wrote to him as plainly as i can  the first page announced the departure of the ladies from thorpe ambrose they left on the day before yesterday the thirteenth having after much hesitation finally decided on going abroad to visit some old friends settled in italy in the neighborhood of florence it appears to be quite possible that mrs blanchard and her niece may settle there too if they can find a suitable house and grounds to let they both like the italian country and the italian people and they are well enough off to please themselves the elder lady has her jointure and the younger is in possession of all her fathers fortune  the next page of the letter was in allans opinion far from a pleasant page to read  after referring in the most grateful terms to the kindness which had left her niece and herself free to leave their old home at their own time mrs blanchard added that allans considerate conduct had produced such a strongly favorable impression among the friends and dependents of the family that they were desirous of giving him a public reception on his arrival among them a preliminary meeting of the tenants on the estate and the principal persons in the neighboring town had already been held to discuss the arrangements and a letter might be expected shortly from the clergyman inquiring when it would suit mr armadales convenience to take possession personally and publicly of his estates in norfolk  you will now be able to guess the cause of our sudden departure from the isle of man the first and foremost idea in your old pupils mind as soon as he had read mrs blanchards account of the proceedings at the meeting was the idea of escaping the public reception and the one certain way he could see of avoiding it was to start for thorpe ambrose before the clergymans letter could reach him  i tried hard to make him think a little before he acted on his first impulse in this matter but he only went on packing his portmanteau in his own impenetrably goodhumored way in ten minutes his luggage was ready and in five minutes more he had given the crew their directions for taking the yacht back to somersetshire the steamer to liverpool was alongside of us in the harbor and i had really no choice but to go on board with him or to let him go by himself i spare you the account of our stormy voyage of our detention at liverpool and of the trains we missed on our journey across the country you know that we have got here safely and that is enough what the servants think of the new squires sudden appearance among them without a word of warning is of no great consequence what the committee for arranging the public reception may think of it when the news flies abroad tomorrow is i am afraid a more serious matter  having already mentioned the servants i may proceed to tell you that the latter part of mrs blanchards letter was entirely devoted to instructing allan on the subject of the domestic establishment which she has left behind her it seems that all the servants indoors and out with three exceptions are waiting here on the chance that allan will continue them in their places two of these exceptions are readily accounted for mrs blanchards maid and miss blanchards maid go abroad with their mistresses the third exceptional case is the case of the upper housemaid and here there is a little hitch in plain words the housemaid has been sent away at a moments notice for what mrs blanchard rather mysteriously describes as levity of conduct with a stranger  i am afraid you will laugh at me but i must confess the truth i have been made so distrustful after what happened to us in the isle of man of even the most trifling misadventures which connect themselves in any way with allans introduction to his new life and prospects that i have already questioned one of the menservants here about this apparently unimportant matter of the housemaids going away in disgrace  all i can learn is that a strange man had been noticed hanging suspiciously about the grounds that the housemaid was so ugly a woman as to render it next to a certainty that he had some underhand purpose to serve in making himself agreeable to her and that he has not as yet been seen again in the neighborhood since the day of her dismissal so much for the one servant who has been turned out at thorpe ambrose i can only hope there is no trouble for allan brewing in that quarter as for the other servants who remain mrs blanchard describes them both men and women as perfectly trustworthy and they will all no doubt continue to occupy their present places  having now done with mrs blanchards letter my next duty is to beg you in allans name and with allans love to come here and stay with him at the earliest moment when you can leave somersetshire although i cannot presume to think that my own wishes will have any special influence in determining you to accept this invitation i must nevertheless acknowledge that i have a reason of my own for earnestly desiring to see you here allan has innocently caused me a new anxiety about my future relations with him and i sorely need your advice to show me the right way of setting that anxiety at rest  the difficulty which now perplexes me relates to the stewards place at thorpe ambrose before today i only knew that allan had hit on some plan of his own for dealing with this matter rather strangely involving among other results the letting of the cottage which was the old stewards place of abode in consequence of the new stewards contemplated residence in the great house a chance word in our conversation on the journey here led allan into speaking out more plainly than he had spoken yet and i heard to my unutterable astonishment that the person who was at the bottom of the whole arrangement about the steward was no other than myself  it is needless to tell you how i felt this new instance of allans kindness the first pleasure of hearing from his own lips that i had deserved the strongest proof he could give of his confidence in me was soon dashed by the pain which mixes itself with all pleasureat least with all that i have ever known never has my past life seemed so dreary to look back on as it seems now when i feel how entirely it has unfitted me to take the place of all others that i should have liked to occupy in my friends service i mustered courage to tell him that i had none of the business knowledge and business experience which his steward ought to possess he generously met the objection by telling me that i could learn and he has promised to send to london for the person who has already been employed for the time being in the stewards office and who will therefore be perfectly competent to teach me  do you too think i can learn if you do i will work day and night to instruct myself but if as i am afraid the stewards duties are of far too serious a kind to be learned offhand by a man so young and so inexperienced as i am then pray hasten your journey to thorpe ambrose and exert your influence over allan personally nothing less will induce him to pass me over and to employ a steward who is really fit to take the place pray pray act in this matter as you think best for allans interests whatever disappointment i may feel he shall not see it  believe me dear mr brock  gratefuly yours  ozias midwinter  psi open the envelope again to add one word more if you have heard or seen anything since your return to somersetshire of the woman in the black dress and the red shawl i hope you will not forget when you write to let me know it  o m   2 from mrs oldershaw to miss gwilt  ladies toilet repository diana street pimlico  wednesday  my dear lydiato save the post i write to you after a long days worry at my place of business on the business letterpaper having news since we last met which it seems advisable to send you at the earliest opportunity  to begin at the beginning after carefully considering the thing i am quite sure you will do wisely with young armadale if you hold your tongue about madeira and all that happened there your position was no doubt a very strong one with his mother you had privately helped her in playing a trick on her own father you had been ungratefully dismissed at a pitiably tender age as soon as you had served her purpose and when you came upon her suddenly after a separation of more than twenty years you found her in failing health with a grownup son whom she had kept in total ignorance of the true story of her marriage  have you any such advantages as these with the young gentleman who has survived her if he is not a born idiot he will decline to believe your shocking aspersions on the memory of his mother andseeing that you have no proofs at this distance of time to meet him withthere is an end of your moneygrubbing in the golden armadale diggings mind i dont dispute that the old ladys heavy debt of obligation after what you did for her in madeira is not paid yet and that the son is the next person to settle with you now the mother has slipped through your fingers only squeeze him the right way my dear thats what i venture to suggestsqueeze him the right way  and which is the right way that question brings me to my news  have you thought again of that other notion of yours of trying your hand on this lucky young gentleman with nothing but your own good looks and your own quick wits to help you the idea hung on my mind so strangely after you were gone that it ended in my sending a little note to my lawyer to have the will under which young armadale has got his fortune examined at doctors commons the result turns out to be something infinitely more encouraging than either you or i could possibly have hoped for after the lawyers report to me there cannot be a moments doubt of what you ought to do in two words lydia take the bull by the hornsand marry him  i am quite serious he is much better worth the venture than you suppose only persuade him to make you mrs armadale and you may set all afterdiscoveries at flat defiance as long as he lives you can make your own terms with him and if he dies the will entitles you in spite of anything he can say or dowith children or without themto an income chargeable on his estate of twelve hundred a year for life there is no doubt about this the lawyer himself has looked at the will of course mr blanchard had his son and his sons widow in his eye when he made the provision but as it is not limited to any one heir by name and not revoked anywhere it now holds as good with young armadale as it would have held under other circumstances with mr blanchards son what a chance for you after all the miseries and the dangers you have gone through to be mistress of thorpe ambrose if he lives to have an income for life if he dies hook him my poor dear hook him at any sacrifice  i dare say you will make the same objection when you read this which you made when we were talking about it the other day i mean the objection of your age  now my good creature just listen to me the question isnot whether you were fiveandthirty last birthday we will own the dreadful truth and say you werebut whether you do look or dont look your real age my opinion on this matter ought to be and is one of the best opinions in london i have had twenty years experience among our charming sex in making up battered old faces and wornout old figures to look like new and i say positively you dont look a day over thirty if as much if you will follow my advice about dressing and use one or two of my applications privately i guarantee to put you back three years more i will forfeit all the money i shall have to advance for you in this matter if when i have ground you young again in my wonderful mill you look more than sevenandtwenty in any mans eyes livingexcept of course when you wake anxious in the small hours of the morning and then my dear you will be old and ugly in the retirement of your own room and it wont matter  but you may say supposing all this here i am even with your art to help me looking a good six years older than he is and that is against me at starting is it just think again surely your own experience must have shown you that the commonest of all common weaknesses in young fellows of this armadales age is to fall in love with women older than themselves who are the men who really appreciate us in the bloom of our youth im sure i have cause to speak well of the bloom of youth i made fifty guineas today by putting it on the spotted shoulders of a woman old enough to be your motherwho are the men i say who are ready to worship us when we are mere babies of seventeen the gay young gentlemen in the bloom of their own youth no the cunning old wretches who are on the wrong side of forty  and what is the moral of this as the storybooks say  the moral is that the chances with such a head as you have got on your shoulders are all in your favor if you feel your present forlorn position as i believe you do if you know what a charming woman in the mens eyes you can still be when you please and if all your resolution has really come back after that shocking outbreak of desperation on board the steamer natural enough i own under the dreadful provocation laid on you you will want no further persuasion from me to try this experiment only to think of how things turn out if the other young booby had not jumped into the river after you this young booby would never have had the estate it really looks as if fate had determined that you were to be mrs armadale of thorpe ambrose and who can control his fate as the poet says  send me one line to say yes or no and believe me your attached old friend  maria oldershaw   3 from miss gwilt to mrs oldershaw  richmond thursday  you old wretchi wont say yes or no till i have had a long long look at my glass first if you had any real regard for anybody but your wicked old self you would know that the bare idea of marrying again after what i have gone through is an idea that makes my flesh creep  but there can be no harm in your sending me a little more information while i am making up my mind you have got twenty pounds of mine still left out of those things you sold for me send ten pounds here for my expenses in a postoffice order and use the other ten for making private inquiries at thorpe ambrose i want to know when the two blanchard women go away and when young armadale stirs up the dead ashes in the family fireplace are you quite sure he will turn out as easy to manage as you think if he takes after his hypocrite of a mother i can tell you this judas iscariot has come to life again  i am very comfortable in this lodging there are lovely flowers in the garden and the birds wake me in the morning delightfully i have hired a reasonably good piano the only man i care two straws aboutdont be alarmed he was laid in his grave many a long year ago under the name of beethovenkeeps me company in my lonely hours the landlady would keep me company too if i would only let her i hate women the new curate paid a visit to the other lodger yesterday and passed me on the lawn as he came out my eyes have lost nothing yet at any rate though i am fiveandthirty the poor man actually blushed when i looked at him what sort of color do you think he would have turned if one of the little birds in the garden had whispered in his ear and told him the true story of the charming miss gwilt  goodby mother oldershaw i rather doubt whether i am yours or anybodys affectionately but we all tell lies at the bottoms of our letters dont we if you are my attached old friend i must of course be yours affectionately  lydia gwilt  pskeep your odious powders and paints and washes for the spotted shoulders of your customers not one of them shall touch my skin i promise you if you really want to be useful try and find out some quieting draught to keep me from grinding my teeth in my sleep i shall break them one of these nights and then what will become of my beauty i wonder  4 from mrs oldershaw to miss gwilt  ladies toilet repository tuesday  my dear lydiait is a thousand pities your letter was not addressed to mr armadale your graceful audacity would have charmed him it doesnt affect me i am so well used to audacity in my way of life you know why waste your sparkling wit my love on your own impenetrable oldershaw it only splutters and goes out will you try and be serious this next time i have news for you from thorpe ambrose which is beyond a joke and which must not be trifled with  an hour after i got your letter i set the inquiries on foot not knowing what consequences they might lead to i thought it safest to begin in the dark instead of employing any of the people whom i have at my own disposal who know you and know me i went to the private inquiry office in shadyside place and put the matter in the inspectors hands in the character of a perfect stranger and without mentioning you at all this was not the cheapest way of going to work i own but it was the safest way which is of much greater consequence  the inspector and i understood each other in ten minutes and the right person for the purposethe most harmless looking young man you ever saw in your lifewas produced immediately he left for thorpe ambrose an hour after i saw him i arranged to call at the office on the afternoons of saturday monday and today for news there was no news till today and there i found our confidential agent just returned to town and waiting to favor me with a full account of his trip to norfolk  first of all let me quiet your mind about those two questions of yours i have got answers to both the one and the other the blanchard women go away to foreign parts on the thirteenth and young armadale is at this moment cruising somewhere at sea in his yacht there is talk at thorpe ambrose of giving him a public reception and of calling a meeting of the local grandees to settle it all the speechifying and fuss on these occasions generally wastes plenty of time and the public reception is not thought likely to meet the new squire much before the end of the month  if our messenger had done no more for us than this i think he would have earned his money but the harmless young man is a regular jesuit at a private inquiry with this great advantage over all the popish priests i have ever seen that he has not got his slyness written in his face  having to get his information through the female servants in the usual way he addressed himself with admirable discretion to the ugliest woman in the house when they are nicelooking and can pick and choose as he neatly expressed it to me they waste a great deal of valuable time in deciding on a sweetheart when they are ugly and havent got the ghost of a chance of choosing they snap at a sweetheart if he comes their way like a starved dog at a bone acting on these excellent principles our confidential agent succeeded after certain unavoidable delays in addressing himself to the upper housemaid at thorpe ambrose and took full possession of her confidence at the first interview bearing his instructions carefully in mind he encouraged the woman to chatter and was favored of course with all the gossip of the servants hall the greater part of it as repeated to me was of no earthly importance but i listened patiently and was rewarded by a valuable discovery at last here it is  it seems there is an ornamental cottage in the grounds at thorpe ambrose for some reason unknown young armadale has chosen to let it and a tenant has come in already he is a poor halfpay major in the army named milroy a meek sort of man by all accounts with a turn for occupying himself in mechanical pursuits and with a domestic incumbrance in the shape of a bedridden wife who has not been seen by anybody well and what of all this you will ask with that sparkling impatience which becomes you so well my dear lydia dont sparkle the mans family affairs seriously concern us both for as ill luck will have it the man has got a daughter  you may imagine how i questioned our agent and how our agent ransacked his memory when i stumbled in due course on such a discovery as this if heaven is responsible for womens chattering tongues heaven be praised from miss blanchard to miss blanchards maid from miss blanchards maid to miss blanchards aunts maid from miss blanchards aunts maid to the ugly housemaid from the ugly housemaid to the harmlesslooking young manso the stream of gossip trickled into the right reservoir at last and thirsty mother oldershaw has drunk it all up  in plain english my dear this is how it stands the majors daughter is a minx just turned sixteen lively and nicelooking hateful little wretch dowdy in her dress thank heaven and deficient in her manners thank heaven again she has been brought up at home the governess who last had charge of her left before her father moved to thorpe ambrose her education stands woefully in want of a finishing touch and the major doesnt quite know what to do next none of his friends can recommend him a new governess and he doesnt like the notion of sending the girl to school so matters rest at present on the majors own showing for so the major expressed himself at a morning call which the father and daughter paid to the ladies at the great house  you have now got my promised news and you will have little difficulty i think in agreeing with me that the armadale business must be settled at once one way or the other if with your hopeless prospects and with what i may call your family claim on this young fellow you decide on giving him up i shall have the pleasure of sending you the balance of your account with me sevenandtwenty shillings and shall then be free to devote myself entirely to my own proper business if on the contrary you decide to try your luck at thorpe ambrose then there being no kind of doubt that the majors minx will set her cap at the young squire i should be glad to hear how you mean to meet the double difficulty of inflaming mr armadale and extinguishing miss milroy  affectionately yours  maria oldershaw  5 from miss gwilt to mrs oldershaw  first answer  richmond wednesday morning  mrs oldershawsend me my sevenandtwenty shillings and devote yourself to your own proper business yours l g  6 from miss gwilt to mrs oldershaw  second answer  richmond wednesday night  dear old lovekeep the sevenandtwenty shillings and burn my other letter i have changed my mind  i wrote the first time after a horrible night i write this time after a ride on horseback a tumbler of claret and the breast of a chicken is that explanation enough please say yes for i want to go back to my piano  no i cant go back yet i must answer your question first but are you really so very simple as to suppose that i dont see straight through you and your letter you know that the majors difficulty is our opportunity as well as i do but you want me to take the responsibility of making the first proposal dont you suppose i take it in your own roundabout way suppose i say pray dont ask me how i propose inflaming mr armadale and extinguishing miss milroy the question is so shockingly abrupt i really cant answer it ask me instead if it is the modest ambition of my life to become miss milroys governess yes if you please mrs oldershaw and if you will assist me by becoming my reference  there it is for you if some serious disaster happens which is quite possible what a comfort it will be to remember that it was all my fault  now i have done this for you will you do something for me i want to dream away the little time i am likely to have left here in my own way be a merciful mother oldershaw and spare me the worry of looking at the ins and outs and adding up the chances for and against in this new venture of mine think for me in short until i am obliged to think for myself  i had better not write any more or i shall say something savage that you wont like i am in one of my tempers tonight i want a husband to vex or a child to beat or something of that sort do you ever like to see the summer insects kill themselves in the candle i do sometimes goodnight mrs jezebel the longer you can leave me here the better the air agrees with me and i am looking charmingly  l g  7 from mrs oldershaw to miss gwilt  thursday  my dear lydiasome persons in my situation might be a little offended at the tone of your last letter but i am so fondly attached to you and when i love a person it is so very hard my dear for that person to offend me dont ride quite so far and only drink half a tumblerful of claret next time i say no more  shall we leave off our fencingmatch and come to serious matters now how curiously hard it always seems to be for women to understand each other especially when they have got their pens in their hands but suppose we try  well then to begin with i gather from your letter that you have wisely decided to try the thorpe ambrose experiment and to secure if you can an excellent position at starting by becoming a member of major milroys household if the circumstances turn against you and some other woman gets the governesss place about which i shall have something more to say presently you will then have no choice but to make mr armadales acquaintance in some other character in any case you will want my assistance and the first question therefore to set at rest between us is the question of what i am willing to do and what i can do to help you  a woman my dear lydia with your appearance your manners your abilities and your education can make almost any excursions into society that she pleases if she only has money in her pocket and a respectable reference to appeal to in cases of emergency as to the money in the first place i will engage to find it on condition of your remembering my assistance with adequate pecuniary gratitude if you win the armadale prize your promise so to remember me embodying the terms in plain figures shall be drawn out on paper by my own lawyer so that we can sign and settle at once when i see you in london  next as to the reference  here again my services are at your disposal on another condition it is this that you present yourself at thorpe ambrose under the name to which you have returned ever since that dreadful business of your marriage i mean your own maiden name of gwilt i have only one motive in insisting on this i wish to run no needless risks my experience as confidential adviser of my customers in various romantic cases of private embarrassment has shown me that an assumed name is nine times out of ten a very unnecessary and a very dangerous form of deception nothing could justify your assuming a name but the fear of young armadales detecting youa fear from which we are fortunately relieved by his mothers own conduct in keeping your early connection with her a profound secret from her son and from everybody  the next and last perplexity to settle relates my dear to the chances for and against your finding your way in the capacity of governess into major milroys house once inside the door with your knowledge of music and languages if you can keep your temper you may be sure of keeping the place the only doubt as things are now is whether you can get it  in the majors present difficulty about his daughters education the chances are i think in favor of his advertising for a governess say he does advertise what address will he give for applicants to write to  if he gives an address in london goodby to all chances in your favor at once for this plain reason that we shall not be able to pick out his advertisement from the advertisements of other people who want governesses and who will give them addresses in london as well if on the other hand our luck helps us and he refers his correspondents to a shop postoffice or what not at thorpe ambrose there we have our advertiser as plainly picked out for us as we can wish in this last case i have little or no doubtwith me for your referenceof your finding your way into the majors family circle we have one great advantage over the other women who will answer the advertisement thanks to my inquiries on the spot i know major milroy to be a poor man and we will fix the salary you ask at a figure that is sure to tempt him as for the style of the letter if you and i together cant write a modest and interesting application for the vacant place i should like to know who can  all this however is still in the future for the present my advice is stay where you are and dream to your hearts content till you hear from me again i take in the times regularly and you may trust my wary eye not to miss the right advertisement we can luckily give the major time without doing any injury to our own interests for there is no fear just yet of the girls getting the start of you the public reception as we know wont be ready till near the end of the month and we may safely trust young armadales vanity to keep him out of his new house until his flatterers are all assembled to welcome him  its odd isnt it to think how much depends on this halfpay officers decision for my part i shall wake every morning now with the same question in my mind if the majors advertisment appears which will the major saythorpe ambrose or london  ever my dear lydia affectionately yours  maria oldershaw     ii allan as a landed gentleman  early on the morning after his first nights rest at thorpe ambrose allan rose and surveyed the prospect from his bedroom window lost in the dense mental bewilderment of feeling himself to be a stranger in his own house  the bedroom looked out over the great front door with its portico its terrace and flight of steps beyond and further still the broad sweep of the welltimbered park to close the view the morning mist nestled lightly about the distant trees and the cows were feeding sociably close to the iron fence which railed off the park from the drive in front of the house all mine thought allan staring in blank amazement at the prospect of his own possessions hang me if i can beat it into my head yet all mine  he dressed left his room and walked along the corridor which led to the staircase and hall opening the doors in succession as he passed them  the rooms in this part of the house were bedrooms and dressingrooms light spacious perfectly furnished and all empty except the one bedchamber next to allans which had been appropriated to midwinter he was still sleeping when his friend looked in on him having sat late into the night writing his letter to mr brock allan went on to the end of the first corridor turned at right angles into a second and that passed gained the head of the great staircase no romance here he said to himself looking down the handsomely carpeted stone stairs into the bright modern hall nothing to startle midwinters fidgety nerves in this house there was nothing indeed allans essentially superficial observation had not misled him for once the mansion of thorpe ambrose built after the pulling down of the dilapidated old manorhouse was barely fifty years old nothing picturesque nothing in the slightest degree suggestive of mystery and romance appeared in any part of it it was a purely conventional country housethe product of the classical idea filtered judiciously through the commercial english mind viewed on the outer side it presented the spectacle of a modern manufactory trying to look like an ancient temple viewed on the inner side it was a marvel of luxurious comfort in every part of it from basement to roof and quite right too thought allan sauntering contentedly down the broad gently graduated stairs deuce take all mystery and romance lets be clean and comfortable thats what i say  arrived in the hall the new master of thorpe ambrose hesitated and looked about him uncertain which way to turn next  the four receptionrooms on the groundfloor opened into the hall two on either side allan tried the nearest door on his right hand at a venture and found himself in the drawingroom here the first sign of life appeared under lifes most attractive form a young girl was in solitary possession of the drawingroom the duster in her hand appeared to associate her with the domestic duties of the house but at that particular moment she was occupied in asserting the rights of nature over the obligations of service in other words she was attentively contemplating her own face in the glass over the mantelpiece  there there dont let me frighten you said allan as the girl started away from the glass and stared at him in unutterable confusion i quite agree with you my dear your face is well worth looking at who are you oh the housemaid and whats your name susan eh come

and youll be a good girl susan and wear smart little caps and aprons and bright ribbons and youll look nice and pretty and dust the furniture wont you with this summary of a housemaids duties allan sauntered back into the hall and found more signs of life in that quarter a manservant appeared on this occasion and bowed as became a vassal in a linen jacket before his liege lord in a wideawake hat  and who may you be asked allan not the man who let us in last night ah i thought not the second footman eh character oh yes capital character stop here of course you can valet me can you bother valeting me i like to put on my own clothes and brush them too when they are on and if i only knew how to black my own boots by george i should like to do it what rooms this morningroom eh and heres

me where are we now whats this door at the back billiardroom and smokingroom eh jolly another door and more stairs where do they go to and whos this coming up take your time maam youre not quite so young as you were oncetake your time  the object of allans humane caution was a corpulent elderly woman of the type called motherly fourteen stairs were all that separated her from the master of the house she ascended them with fourteen stoppages and fourteen sighs nature various in all things is infinitely various in the female sex there are some women whose personal qualities reveal the loves and the graces and there are other women whose personal qualities suggest the perquisites and the grease pot this was one of the other women  glad to see you looking so well maam said allan when the cook in the majesty of her office stood proclaimed before him your name is gripper is it i consider you mrs gripper the most valuable person in the house for this reason that nobody in the house eats a heartier dinner every day than i do directions oh no ive no directions to give i leave all that to you lots of strong soup and joints done with the gravy in themtheres my notion of good feeding in two words steady heres somebody else oh to be surethe butler another valuable person well go right through all the wine in the cellar mr butler and if i cant give you a sound opinion after that well persevere boldly and go right through it again talking of winehalloo here are more of them coming up stairs there there dont trouble yourselves youve all got capital characters and you shall all stop here along with me what was i saying just now something about wine so it was ill tell you what mr butler it isnt every day that a new master comes to thorpe ambrose and its my wish that we should all start together on the best possible terms let the servants have a grand jollification downstairs to celebrate my arrival and give them what they like to drink my health in its a poor heart mrs gripper that never rejoices isnt it no i wont look at the cellar now i want to go out and get a breath of fresh air before breakfast wheres richard i say have i got a garden here which side of the house is it that side eh you neednt show me round ill go alone richard and lose myself if i can in my own property  with those words allan descended the terrace steps in front of the house whistling cheerfully he had met the serious responsibility of settling his domestic establishment to his own entire satisfaction people talk of the difficulty of managing their servants thought allan what on earth do they mean i dont see any difficulty at all he opened an ornamental gate leading out of the drive at the side of the house and following the footmans directions entered the shrubbery that sheltered the thorpe ambrose gardens nice shady sort of place for a cigar said allan as he sauntered along with his hands in his pockets i wish i could beat it into my head that it really belongs to me  the shrubbery opened on the broad expanse of a flower garden flooded bright in its summer glory by the light of the morning sun  on one side an archway broken through a wall led into the fruit garden on the other a terrace of turf led to ground on a lower level laid out as an italian garden wandering past the fountains and statues allan reached another shrubbery winding its way apparently to some remote part of the grounds thus far not a human creature had been visible or audible anywhere but as he approached the end of the second shrubbery it struck him that he heard something on the other side of the foliage he stopped and listened there were two voices speaking distinctlyan old voice that sounded very obstinate and a young voice that sounded very angry  its no use miss said the old voice i mustnt allow it and i wont allow it what would mr armadale say  if mr armadale is the gentleman i take him for you old brute replied the young voice he would say come into my garden miss milroy as often as you like and take as many nosegays as you please allans bright blue eyes twinkled mischievously inspired by a sudden idea he stole softly to the end of the shrubbery darted round the corner of it and vaulting over a low ring fence found himself in a trim little paddock crossed by a gravel walk at a short distance down the wall stood a young lady with her back toward him trying to force her way past an impenetrable old man with a rake in his hand who stood obstinately in front of her shaking his head  come into my garden miss milroy as often as you like and take as many nosegays as you please cried allan remorselessly repeating her own words  the young lady turned round with a scream her muslin dress which she was holding up in front dropped from her hand and a prodigious lapful of flowers rolled out on the gravel walk  before another word could be said the impenetrable old man stepped forward with the utmost composure and entered on the question of his own personal interests as if nothing whatever had happened and nobody was present but his new master and himself  i bid you humbly welcome to thorpe ambrose sir said this ancient of the gardens my name is abraham sage ive been employed in the grounds for more than forty years and i hope youll be pleased to continue me in my place  so with vision inexorably limited to the horizon of his own prospects spoke the gardener and spoke in vain allan was down on his knees on the gravel walk collecting the fallen flowers and forming his first impressions of miss milroy from the feet upward  she was pretty she was not pretty she charmed she disappointed she charmed again tried by recognized line and rule she was too short and too well developed for her age and yet few mens eyes would have wished her figure other than it was her hands were so prettily plump and dimpled that it was hard to see how red they were with the blessed exuberance of youth and health her feet apologized gracefully for her old and ill fitting shoes and her shoulders made ample amends for the misdemeanor in muslin which covered them in the shape of a dress her darkgray eyes were lovely in their clear softness of color in their spirit tenderness and sweet good humor of expression and her hair where a shabby old garden hat allowed it to be seen was of just that lighter shade of brown which gave value by contrast to the darker beauty of her eyes but these attractions passed the little attendant blemishes and imperfections of this selfcontradictory girl began again her nose was too short her mouth was too large her face was too round and too rosy the dreadful justice of photography would have had no mercy on her and the sculptors of classical greece would have bowed her regretfully out of their studios admitting all this and more the girdle round miss milroys waist was the girdle of venus nevertheless and the passkey that opens the general heart was the key she carried if ever a girl possessed it yet before allan had picked up his second handful of flowers allan was in love with her  dont pray dont mr armadale she said receiving the flowers under protest as allan vigorously showered them back into the lap of her dress i am so ashamed i didnt mean to invite myself in that bold way into your garden my tongue ran away with meit did indeed what can i say to excuse myself oh mr armadale what must you think of me  allan suddenly saw his way to a compliment and tossed it up to her forthwith with the third handful of flowers  ill tell you what i think miss milroy he said in his blunt boyish way i think the luckiest walk i ever took in my life was the walk this morning that brought me here  he looked eager and handsome he was not addressing a woman worn out with admiration but a girl just beginning a womans life and it did him no harm at any rate to speak in the character of master of thorpe ambrose the penitential expression on miss milroys face gently melted away she looked down demure and smiling at the flowers in her lap  i deserve a good scolding she said i dont deserve compliments mr armadaleleast of all from you  oh yes you do cried the headlong allan getting briskly on his legs besides it isnt a compliment its true you are the prettiesti beg your pardon miss milroy my tongue ran away with me that time  among the heavy burdens that are laid on female human nature perhaps the heaviest at the age of sixteen is the burden of gravity miss milroy struggled tittered struggled again and composed herself for the time being  the gardener who still stood where he had stood from the first immovably waiting for his next opportunity saw it now and gently pushed his personal interests into the first gap of silence that had opened within his reach since allans appearance on the scene  i humbly bid you welcome to thorpe ambrose sir said abraham sage beginning obstinately with his little introductory speech for the second time my name  before he could deliver himself of his name miss milroy looked accidentally in the horticulturists pertinacious face and instantly lost her hold on her gravity beyond recall allan never backward in following a boisterous example of any sort joined in her laughter with right goodwill the wise man of the gardens showed no surprise and took no offense he waited for another gap of silence and walked in again gently with his personal interests the moment the two young people stopped to take breath  i have been employed in the grounds proceeded abraham sage irrepressibly for more than forty years  you shall be employed in the grounds for forty more if youll only hold your tongue and take yourself off cried allan as soon as he could speak  thank you kindly sir said the gardener with the utmost politeness but with no present signs either of holding his tongue or of taking himself off  well said allan  abraham sage carefully cleared his throat and shifted his rake from one hand to the other he looked down the length of his own invaluable implement with a grave interest and attention seeing apparently not the long handle of a rake but the long perspective of a vista with a supplementary personal interest established at the end of it when more convenient sir resumed this immovable man i should wish respectfully to speak to you about my son perhaps it may be more convenient in the course of the day my humble duty sir and my best thanks my son is strictly sober he is accustomed to the stables and he belongs to the church of englandwithout incumbrances having thus planted his offspring provisionally in his masters estimation abraham sage shouldered his invaluable rake and hobbled slowly out of view  if thats a specimen of a trustworthy old servant said allan i think id rather take my chance of being cheated by a new one you shall not be troubled with him again miss milroy at any rate all the flowerbeds in the garden are at your disposal and all the fruit in the fruit season if youll only come here and eat it  oh mr armadale how very very kind you are how can i thank you  allan saw his way to another complimentan elaborate compliment in the shape of a trap this time  you can do me the greatest possible favor he said you can assist me in forming an agreeable impression of my own grounds  dear me how asked miss milroy innocently  allan judiciously closed the trap on the spot in these words by taking me with you miss milroy on your morning walk he spoke smiled and offered his arm  she saw the way on her side to a little flirtation she rested her hand on his arm blushed hesitated and suddenly took it away again  i dont think its quite right mr armadale she said devoting herself with the deepest attention to her collection of flowers oughtnt we to have some old lady here isnt it improper to take your arm until i know you a little better than i do now i am obliged to ask i have had so little instruction i have seen so little of society and one of papas friends once said my manners were too bold for my age what do you think  i think its a very good thing your papas friend is not here now answered the outspoken allan i should quarrel with him to a dead certainty as for society miss milroy nobody knows less about it than i do but if we had an old lady here i must say myself i think she would be uncommonly in the way wont you concluded allan imploringly offering his arm for the second time do  miss milroy looked up at him sidelong from her flowers you are as bad as the gardener mr armadale she looked down again in a flutter of indecision im sure its wrong she said and took his arm the instant afterward without the slightest hesitation  they moved away together over the daisied turf of the paddock young and bright and happy with the sunlight of the summer morning shining cloudless over their flowery path  and where are we going to now asked allan into another garden  she laughed gayly how very odd of you mr armadale not to know when it all belongs to you are you really seeing thorpe ambrose this morning for the first time how indescribably strange it must feel no no dont say any more complimentary things to me just yet you may turn my head if you do we havent got the old lady with us and i really must take care of myself let me be useful let me tell you all about your own grounds we are going out at that little gate across one of the drives in the park and then over the rustic bridge and then round the corner of the plantationwhere do you think to where i live mr armadale to the lovely little cottage that you have let to papa oh if you only knew how lucky we thought ourselves to get it  she paused looked up at her companion and stopped another compliment on the incorrigible allans lips  ill drop your arm she said coquettishly if you do we were lucky to get the cottage mr armadale papa said he felt under an obligation to you for letting it the day we got in and i said i felt under an obligation no longer ago than last week  you miss milroy exclaimed allan  yes it may surprise you to hear it but if you hadnt let the cottage to papa i believe i should have suffered the indignity and misery of being sent to school  allans memory reverted to the halfcrown that he had spun on the cabintable of the yacht at castletown if she only knew that i had tossed up for it he thought guiltily  i dare say you dont understand why i should feel such a horror of going to school pursued miss milroy misinterpreting the momentary silence on her companions side if i had gone to school in early lifei mean at the age when other girls goi shouldnt have minded it now but i had no such chance at the time it was the time of mammas illness and of papas unfortunate speculation and as papa had nobody to comfort him but me of course i stayed at home you neednt laugh i was of some use i can tell you i helped papa over his trouble by sitting on his knee after dinner and asking him to tell me stories of all the remarkable people he had known when he was about in the great world at home and abroad without me to amuse him in the evening and his clock to occupy him in the daytime  his clock repeated allan  oh yes i ought to have told you papa is an extraordinary mechanical genius you will say so too when you see his clock its nothing like so large of course but its on the model of the famous clock at strasbourg only think he began it when i was eight years old and though i was sixteen last birthday it isnt finished yet some of our friends were quite surprised he should take to such a thing when his troubles began but papa himself set that right in no time he reminded them that louis the sixteenth took to lockmaking when his troubles began and then everybody was perfectly satisfied she stopped and changed color confusedly oh mr armadale she said in genuine embarrassment this time here is my unlucky tongue running away with me again i am talking to you already as if i had known you for years this is what papas friend meant when he said my manners were too bold its quite true i have a dreadful way of getting familiar with people if she checked herself suddenly on the brink of ending the sentence by saying if i like them  no no do go on pleaded allan its a fault of mine to be familiar too besides we must be familiar we are such near neighbors im rather an uncultivated sort of fellow and i dont know quite how to say it but i want your cottage to be jolly and friendly with my house and my house to be jolly and friendly with your cottage theres my meaning all in the wrong words do go on miss milroy pray go on  she smiled and hesitated i dont exactly remember where i was she replied i only remember i had something i wanted to tell you this comes mr armadale of my taking your arm i should get on so much better if you would only consent to walk separately you wont well then will you tell me what it was i wanted to say where was i before i went wandering off to papas troubles and papas clock  at school replied allan with a prodigious effort of memory  not at school you mean said miss milroy and all through you now i can go on again which is a great comfort i am quite serious mr armadale in saying that i should have been sent to school if you had said no when papa proposed for the cottage this is how it happened when we began moving in mrs blanchard sent us a most kind message from the great house to say that her servants were at our disposal if we wanted any assistance the least papa and i could do after that was to call and thank her we saw mrs blanchard and miss blanchard mistress was charming and miss looked perfectly lovely in her mourning im sure you admire her shes tall and pale and gracefulquite your idea of beauty i should think  nothing like it began allan my idea of beauty at the present moment  miss milroy felt it coming and instantly took her hand off his arm  i mean i have never seen either mrs blanchard or her niece added allan precipitately correcting himself  miss milroy tempered justice with mercy and put her hand back again  how extraordinary that you should never have seen them she went on why you are a perfect stranger to everything and everybody at thorpe ambrose well after miss blanchard and i had sat and talked a little while i heard my name on mrs blanchards lips and instantly held my breath she was asking papa if i had finished my education out came papas great grievance directly my old governess you must know left us to be married just before we came here and none of our friends could produce a new one whose terms were reasonable im told mrs blanchard by people who understand it better than i do says papa that advertising is a risk it all falls on me in mrs milroys state of health and i suppose i must end in sending my little girl to school do you happen to know of a school within the means of a poor man mrs blanchard shook her head i could have kissed her on the spot for doing it all my experience major milroy says this perfect angel of a woman is in favor of advertising my nieces governess was originally obtained by an advertisement and you may imagine her value to us when i tell you she lived in our family for more than ten years i could have gone down on both my knees and worshipped mrs blanchard then and there and i only wonder i didnt papa was struck at the timei could see thatand he referred to it again on the way home though i have been long out of the world my dear says papa i know a highlybred woman and a sensible woman when i see her mrs blanchards experience puts advertising in a new light i must think about it he has thought about it and though he hasnt openly confessed it to me i know that he decided to advertise no later than last night so if papa thanks you for letting the cottage mr armadale i thank you too but for you we should never have known darling mrs blanchard and but for darling mrs blanchard i should have been sent to school  before allan could reply they turned the corner of the plantation and came in sight of the cottage description of it is needless the civilized universe knows it already it was the typical cottage of the drawingmasters early lessons in neat shading and the broad pencil touchwith the trim thatch the luxuriant creepers the modest latticewindows the rustic porch and the wicker birdcage all complete  isnt it lovely said miss milroy do come in  may i asked allan wont the major think it too early  early or late i am sure papa will be only too glad to see you  she led the way briskly up the garden path and opened the parlor door as allan followed her into the little room he saw at the further end of it a gentleman sitting alone at an oldfashioned writingtable with his back turned to his visitor  papa a surprise for you said miss milroy rousing him from his occupation mr armadale has come to thorpe ambrose and i have brought him here to see you  the major started rose bewildered for the moment recovered himself immediately and advanced to welcome his young landlord with hospitable outstretched hand  a man with a larger experience of the world and a finer observation of humanity than allan possessed would have seen the story of major milroys life written in major milroys face the home troubles that had struck him were plainly betrayed in his stooping figure and his wan deeply wrinkled cheeks when he first showed himself on rising from his chair the changeless influence of one monotonous pursuit and one monotonous habit of thought was next expressed in the dull dreamy selfabsorption of his manner and his look while his daughter was speaking to him the moment after when he had roused himself to welcome his guest was the moment which made the selfrevelation complete then there flickered in the majors weary eyes a faint reflection of the spirit of his happier youth then there passed over the majors dull and dreamy manner a change which told unmistakably of social graces and accomplishments learned at some past time in no ignoble social school a man who had long since taken his patient refuge from trouble in his own mechanical pursuit a man only roused at intervals to know himself again for what he once had been so revealed to all eyes that could read him aright major milroy now stood before allan on the first morning of an acquaintance which was destined to be an event in allans life  i am heartily glad to see you mr armadale he said speaking in the changeless quiet subdued tone peculiar to most men whose occupations are of the solitary and monotonous kind you have done me one favor already by taking me as your tenant and you now do me another by paying this friendly visit if you have not breakfasted already let me waive all ceremony on my side and ask you to take your place at our little table  with the greatest pleasure major milroy if i am not in the way replied allan delighted at his reception i was sorry to hear from miss milroy that mrs milroy is an invalid perhaps my being here unexpectedly perhaps the sight of a strange face  i understand your hesitation mr armadale said the major but it is quite unnecessary mrs milroys illness keeps her entirely confined to her own room have we got everything we want on the table my love he went on changing the subject so abruptly that a closer observer than allan might have suspected it was distasteful to him will you come and make tea  miss milroys attention appeared to be already preengaged she made no reply while her father and allan had been exchanging civilities she had been putting the writingtable in order and examining the various objects scattered on it with the unrestrained curiosity of a spoiled child the moment after the major had spoken to her she discovered a morsel of paper hidden between the leaves of the blottingbook snatched it up looked at it and turned round instantly with an exclamation of surprise  do my eyes deceive me papa she asked or were you really and truly writing the advertisement when i came in  i had just finished it replied her father but my dear mr armadale is herewe are waiting for breakfast  mr armadale knows all about it rejoined miss milroy i told him in the garden  oh yes said allan pray dont make a stranger of me major if its about the governess ive got something in an indirect sort of way to do with it too  major milroy smiled before he could answer his daughter who had been reading the advertisement appealed to him eagerly for the second time  oh papa she said theres one thing here i dont like at all why do you put grandmammas initials at the end why do you tell them to write to grandmammas house in london  my dear your mother can do nothing in this matter as you know and as for me even if i went to london questioning strange ladies about their characters and accomplishments is the last thing in the world that i am fit to do your grandmamma is on the spot and your grandmamma is the proper person to receive the letters and to make all the necessary inquires  but i want to see the letters myself persisted the spoiled child some of them are sure to be amusing  i dont apologize for this very unceremonious reception of you mr armadale said the major turning to allan with a quaint and quiet humor it may be useful as a warning if you ever chance to marry and have a daughter not to begin as i have done by letting her have her own way  allan laughed and miss milroy persisted  besides she went on i should like to help in choosing which letters we answer and which we dont i think i ought to have some voice in the selection of my own governess why not tell them papa to send their letters down hereto the postoffice or the stationers or anywhere you like when you and i have read them we can send up the letters we prefer to grandmamma and she can ask all the questions and pick out the best governess just as you have arranged already without leaving me entirely in the dark which i consider dont you mr armadale to be quite inhuman let me alter the address papa do theres a darling  we shall get no breakfast mr armadale if i dont say yes said the major goodhumoredly do as you like my dear he added turning to his daughter as long as it ends in your grandmammas managing the matter for us the rest is of very little consequence  miss milroy took up her fathers pen drew it through the last line of the advertisement and wrote the altered address with her own hand as follows  apply by letter to m postoffice thorpe ambrose norfolk  there she said bustling to her place at the breakfasttable the advertisement may go to london now and if a governess does come of it oh papa who in the name of wonder will she be tea or coffee mr armadale im really ashamed of having kept you waiting but it is such a comfort she added saucily to get all ones business off ones mind before breakfast  father daughter and guest sat down together sociably at the little round table the best of good neighbors and good friends already   three days later one of the london newsboys got his business off his mind before breakfast his district was diana street pimlico and the last of the mornings newspapers which he disposed of was the newspaper he left at mrs oldershaws door     iii the claims of society  more than an hour after allan had set forth on his exploring expedition through his own grounds midwinter rose and enjoyed in his turn a full view by daylight of the magnificence of the new house  refreshed by his long nights rest he descended the great staircase as cheerfully as allan himself one after another he too looked into the spacious rooms on the ground floor in breathless astonishment at the beauty and the luxury which surrounded him the house where i lived in service when i was a boy was a fine one he thought gayly but it was nothing to this i wonder if allan is as surprised and delighted as i am the beauty of the summer morning drew him out through the open hall door as it had drawn his friend out before him he ran briskly down the steps humming the burden of one of the old vagabond tunes which he had danced to long since in the old vagabond time even the memories of his wretched childhood took their color on that happy morning from the bright medium through which he looked back at them if i was not out of practice he thought to himself as he leaned on the fence and looked over at the park i could try some of my old tumbling tricks on that delicious grass he turned noticed two of the servants talking together near the shrubbery and asked for news of the master of the house  the men pointed with a smile in the direction of the gardens mr armadale had gone that way more than an hour since and had met as had been reported with miss milroy in the grounds midwinter followed the path through the shrubbery but on reaching the flower garden stopped considered a little and retraced his steps if allan has met with the young lady he said to himself allan doesnt want me he laughed as he drew that inevitable inference and turned considerately to explore the beauties of thorpe ambrose on the other side of the house  passing the angle of the front wall of the building he descended some steps advanced along a paved walk turned another angle and found himself in a strip of garden ground at the back of the house  behind him was a row of small rooms situated on the level of the servants offices in front of him on the further side of the little garden rose a wall screened by a laurel hedge and having a door at one end of it leading past the stables to a gate that opened on the highroad perceiving that he had only discovered thus far the shorter way to the house used by the servants and tradespeople midwinter turned back again and looked in at the window of one of the rooms on the basement story as he passed it were these the servants offices no the offices were apparently in some other part of the groundfloor the window he had looked in at was the window of a lumberroom the next two rooms in the row were both empty the fourth window when he approached it presented a little variety it served also as a door and it stood open to the garden at that moment  attracted by the bookshelves which he noticed on one of the walls midwinter stepped into the room  the books few in number did not detain him long a glance at their backs was enough without taking them down the waverley novels tales by miss edgeworth and by miss edgeworths many followers the poems of mrs hemans with a few odd volumes of the illustrated giftbooks of the period composed the bulk of the little library midwinter turned to leave the room when an object on one side of the window which he had not previously noticed caught his attention and stopped him it was a statuette standing on a bracketa reduced copy of the famous niobe of the florence museum he glanced from the statuette to the window with a sudden doubt which set his heart throbbing fast it was a french window he looked out with a suspicion which he had not felt yet the view before him was the view of a lawn and garden for a moment his mind struggled blindly to escape the conclusion which had seized it and struggled in vain here close round him and close before himhere forcing him mercilessly back from the happy present to the horrible past was the room that allan had seen in the second vision of the dream  he waited thinking and looking round him while he thought there was wonderfully little disturbance in his face and manner he looked steadily from one to the other of the few objects in the room as if the discovery of it had saddened rather than surprised him matting of some foreign sort covered the floor two cane chairs and a plain table comprised the whole of the furniture the walls were plainly papered and barebroken to the eye in one place by a door leading into the interior of the house in another by a small stove in a third by the bookshelves which midwinter had already noticed he returned to the books and this time he took some of them down from the shelves  the first that he opened contained lines in a womans handwriting traced in ink that had faded with time he read the inscriptionjane armadale from her beloved father thorpe ambrose october 1828 in the second third and fourth volumes that he opened the same inscription reappeared his previous knowledge of dates and persons helped him to draw the true inference from what he saw the books must have belonged to allans mother and she must have inscribed them with her name in the interval of time between her return to thorpe ambrose from madeira and the birth of her son midwinter passed on to a volume on another shelfone of a series containing the writings of mrs hemans in this case the blank leaf at the beginning of the book was filled on both sides with a copy of verses the writing being still in mrs armadales hand the verses were headed farewell to thorpe ambrose and were dated march 1829two months only after allan had been born  entirely without merit in itself the only interest of the little poem was in the domestic story that it told  the very room in which midwinter then stood was describedwith the view on the garden the window made to open on it the bookshelves the niobe and other more perishable ornaments which time had destroyed here at variance with her brothers shrinking from her friends the widow of the murdered man had on her own acknowledgment secluded herself without other comfort than the love and forgiveness of her father until her child was born the fathers mercy and the fathers recent death filled many verses happily too vague in their commonplace expression of penitence and despair to give any hint of the marriage story in madeira to any reader who looked at them ignorant of the truth a passing reference to the writers estrangement from her surviving relatives and to her approaching departure from thorpe ambrose followed last came the assertion of the mothers resolution to separate herself from all her old associations to leave behind her every possession even to the most trifling thing she had that could remind her of the miserable past and to date her new life in the future from the birthday of the child who had been spared to console herwho was now the one earthly object that could still speak to her of love and hope so the old story of passionate feeling that finds comfort in phrases rather than not find comfort at all was told once again so the poem in the faded ink faded away to its end  midwinter put the book back with a heavy sigh and opened no other volume on the shelves here in the country house or there on board the wreck he said bitterly the traces of my fathers crime follow me go where i may he advanced toward the window stopped and looked back into the lonely neglected little room is this chance he asked himself the place where his mother suffered is the place he sees in the dream and the first morning in the new house is the morning that reveals it not to him but to me oh allan allan how will it end   the thought had barely passed through his mind before he heard allans voice from the paved walk at the side of the house calling to him by his name he hastily stepped out into the garden at the same moment allan came running round the corner full of voluble apologies for having forgotten in the society of his new neighbors what was due to the laws of hospitality and the claims of his friend  i really havent missed you said midwinter and i am very very glad to hear that the new neighbors have produced such a pleasant impression on you already  he tried as he spoke to lead the way back by the outside of the house but allans flighty attention had been caught by the open window and the lonely little room he stepped in immediately midwinter followed and watched him in breathless anxiety as he looked round not the slightest recollection of the dream troubled allans easy mind not the slightest reference to it fell from the silent lips of his friend  exactly the sort of place i should have expected you to hit on exclaimed allan gayly small and snug and unpretending i know you master midwinter youll be slipping off here when the county families come visiting and i rather think on those dreadful occasions you wont find me far behind you whats the matter you look ill and out of spirits hungry of course you are unpardonable of me to have kept you waiting this door leads somewhere i suppose lets try a short cut into the house dont be afraid of my not keeping you company at breakfast i didnt eat much at the cottage i feasted my eyes on miss milroy as the poets say oh the darling the darling she turns you topsyturvy the moment you look at her as for her father wait till you see his wonderful clock its twice the size of the famous clock at strasbourg and the most tremendous striker ever heard yet in the memory of man  singing the praises of his new friends in this strain at the top of his voice allan hurried midwinter along the stone passages on the basement floor which led as he had rightly guessed to a staircase communicating with the hall they passed the servants offices on the way at the sight of the cook and the roaring fire disclosed through the open kitchen door allans mind went off at a tangent and allans dignity scattered itself to the four winds of heaven as usual  aha mrs gripper there you are with your pots and pans and your burning fiery furnace one had need be shadrach meshach and the other fellow to stand over that breakfast as soon as ever you like eggs sausages bacon kidneys marmalade watercresses coffee and so forth my friend and i belong to the select few whom its a perfect privilege to cook for voluptuaries mrs gripper voluptuaries both of us youll see continued allan as they went on toward the stairs i shall make that worthy creature young again im better than a doctor for mrs gripper when she laughs she shakes her fat sides and when she shakes her fat sides she exerts her muscular system and when she exerts her muscular systemha heres susan again dont squeeze yourself flat against the banisters my dear if you dont mind hustling me on the stairs i rather like hustling you she looks like a fullblown rose when she blushes doesnt she stop susan ive orders to give be very particular with mr midwinters room shake up his bed like mad and dust his furniture till those nice round arms of yours ache again nonsense my dear fellow im not too familiar with them im only keeping them up to their work now then richard where do we breakfast oh here between ourselves midwinter these splendid rooms of mine are a size too large for me i dont feel as if i should ever be on intimate terms with my own furniture my views in life are of the snug and slovenly sorta kitchen chair you know and a low ceiling man wants but little here below and wants that little long thats not exactly the right quotation but it expresses my meaning and well let alone correcting it till the next opportunity  i beg your pardon interposed midwinter here is something waiting for you which you have not noticed yet  as he spoke he pointed a little impatiently to a letter lying on the breakfasttable he could conceal the ominous discovery which he had made that morning from allans knowledge but he could not conquer the latent distrust of circumstances which was now raised again in his superstitious naturethe instinctive suspicion of everything that happened no matter how common or how trifling the event on the first memorable day when the new life began in the new house  allan ran his eye over the letter and tossed it across the table to his friend i cant make head or tail of it he said can you  midwinter read the letter slowly aloud siri trust you will pardon the liberty i take in sending these few lines to wait your arrival at thorpe ambrose in the event of circumstances not disposing you to place your law business in the hands of mr darch he suddenly stopped at that point and considered a little  darch is our friend the lawyer said allan supposing midwinter had forgotten the name dont you remember our spinning the halfcrown on the cabin table when i got the two offers for the cottage heads the major tails the lawyer this is the lawyer  without making any reply midwinter resumed reading the letter in the event of circumstances not disposing you to place your law business in the hands of mr darch i beg to say that i shall be happy to take charge of your interests if you feel willing to honor me with your confidence inclosing a reference should you desire it to my agents in london and again apologizing for this intrusion i beg to remain sir respectfully yours a pedgift sen  circumstances repeated midwinter as he laid the letter down what circumstances can possibly indispose you to give your law business to mr darch  nothing can indispose me said allan besides being the family lawyer here darch was the first to write me word at paris of my coming in for my fortune and if i have got any business to give of course he ought to have it  midwinter still looked distrustfully at the open letter on the table i am sadly afraid allan there is something wrong already he said this man would never have ventured on the application he has made to you unless he had some good reason for believing he would succeed if you wish to put yourself right at starting you will send to mr darch this morning to tell him you are here and you will take no notice for the present of mr pedgifts letter  before more could be said on either side the footman made his appearance with the breakfast tray he was followed after an interval by the butler a man of the essentially confidential kind with a modulated voice a courtly manner and a bulbous nose anybody but allan would have seen in his face that he had come into the room having a special communication to make to his master allan who saw nothing under the surface and whose head was running on the lawyers letter stopped him bluntly with the pointblank question whos mr pedgift  the butlers sources of local knowledge opened confidentially on the instant mr pedgift was the second of the two lawyers in the town not so long established not so wealthy not so universally looked up to as old mr darch not doing the business of the highest people in the county and not mixing freely with the best society like old mr darch a very sufficient man in his way nevertheless known as a perfectly competent and respectable practitioner all round the neighborhood in short professionally next best to mr darch and personally superior to him if the expression might be permitted in this respectthat darch was a crusty one and pedgift wasnt  having imparted this information the butler taking a wise advantage of his position glided without a moments stoppage from mr pedgifts character to the business that had brought him into the breakfastroom the midsummer audit was near at hand and the tenants were accustomed to have a weeks notice of the rentday dinner with this necessity pressing and with no orders given as yet and no steward in office at thorpe ambrose it appeared desirable that some confidential person should bring the matter forward the butler was that confidential person and he now ventured accordingly to trouble his master on the subject  at this point allan opened his lips to interrupt and was himself interrupted before he could utter a word  wait interposed midwinter seeing in allans face that he was in danger of being publicly announced in the capacity of steward wait he repeated eagerly till i can speak to you first  the butlers courtly manner remained alike unruffled by midwinters sudden interference and by his own dismissal from the scene nothing but the mounting color in his bulbous nose betrayed the sense of injury that animated him as he withdrew mr armadales chance of regaling his friend and himself that day with the best wine in the cellar trembled in the balance as the butler took his way back to the basement story  this is beyond a joke allan said midwinter when they were alone somebody must meet your tenants on the rentday who is really fit to take the stewards place with the best will in the world to learn it is impossible for me to master the business at a weeks notice dont pray dont let your anxiety for my welfare put you in a false position with other people i should never forgive myself if i was the unlucky cause  gently gently cried allan amazed at his friends extraordinary earnestness if i write to london by tonights post for the man who came down here before will that satisfy you  midwinter shook his head our time is short he said and the man may not be at liberty why not try in the neighborhood first you were going to write to mr darch send at once and see if he cant help us between this and posttime  allan withdrew to a sidetable on which writing materials were placed you shall breakfast in peace you old fidget he replied and addressed himself forthwith to mr darch with his usual spartan brevity of epistolary expression dear sirhere i am bag and baggage will you kindly oblige me by being my lawyer i ask this because i want to consult you at once please look in in the course of the day and stop to dinner if you possibly can yours truly allan armadale having read this composition aloud with unconcealed admiration of his own rapidity of literary execution allan addressed the letter to mr darch and rang the bell here richard take this at once and wait for an answer and i say if theres any news stirring in the town pick it up and bring it back with you see how i manage my servants continued allan joining his friend at the breakfasttable see how i adapt myself to my new duties i havent been down here one clear day yet and im taking an interest in the neighborhood already  breakfast over the two friends went out to idle away the morning under the shade of a tree in the park noon came and richard never appeared one oclock struck and still there were no signs of an answer from mr darch midwinters patience was not proof against the delay he left allan dozing on the grass and went to the house to make inquiries the town was described as little more than two miles distant but the day of the week happened to be market day and richard was being detained no doubt by some of the many acquaintances whom he would be sure to meet with on that occasion  half an hour later the truant messenger returned and was sent out to report himself to his master under the tree in the park  any answer from mr darch asked midwinter seeing that allan was too lazy to put the question for himself  mr darch was engaged sir i was desired to say that he would send an answer  any news in the town inquired allan drowsily without troubling himself to open his eyes  no sir nothing in particular  observing the man suspiciously as he made that reply midwinter detected in his face that he was not speaking the truth he was plainly embarrassed and plainly relieved when his masters silence allowed him to withdraw after a little consideration midwinter followed and overtook the retreating servant on the drive before the house  richard he said quietly if i was to guess that there is some news in the town and that you dont like telling it to your master should i be guessing the truth  the man started and changed color i dont know how you have found it out he said but i cant deny you have guessed right  if you let me hear what the news is i will take the responsibility on myself of telling mr armadale  after some little hesitation and some distrustful consideration on his side of midwinters face richard at last prevailed on himself to repeat what he had heard that day in the town  the news of allans sudden appearance at thorpe ambrose had preceded the servants arrival at his destination by some hours wherever he went he found his master the subject of public discussion the opinion of allans conduct among the leading townspeople the resident gentry of the neighborhood and the principal tenants on the estate was unanimously unfavorable only the day before the committee for managing the public reception of the new squire had sketched the progress of the procession had settled the serious question of the triumphal arches and had appointed a competent person to solicit subscriptions for the flags the flowers the feasting the fireworks and the band in less than a week more the money could have been collected and the rector would have written to mr armadale to fix the day and now by allans own act the public welcome waiting to honor him had been cast back contemptuously in the public teeth everybody took for granted what was unfortunately true that he had received private information of the contemplated proceedings everybody declared that he had purposely stolen into his own house like a thief in the night so the phrase ran to escape accepting the offered civilities of his neighbors in brief the sensitive selfimportance of the little town was wounded to the quick and of allans once enviable position in the estimation of the neighborhood not a vestige remained  for a moment midwinter faced the messenger of evil tidings in silent distress that moment past the sense of allans critical position roused him now the evil was known to seek the remedy  has the little you have seen of your master richard inclined you to like him he asked  this time the man answered without hesitation a pleasanter and kinder gentleman than mr armadale no one could wish to serve  if you think that pursued midwinter you wont object to give me some information which will help your master to set himself right with his neighbors come into the house  he led the way into the library and after asking the necessary questions took down in writing a list of the names and addresses of the most influential persons living in the town and its neighborhood this done he rang the bell for the head footman having previously sent richard with a message to the stables directing an open carriage to be ready in an hours time  when the late mr blanchard went out to make calls in the neighborhood it was your place to go with him was it not he asked when the upper servant appeared very well be ready in an hours time if you please to go out with mr armadale having given that order he left the house again on his way back to allan with the visiting list in his hand he smiled a little sadly as he descended the steps who would have imagined he thought that my footboys experience of the ways of gentlefolks would be worth looking back at one day for allans sake  the object of the popular odium lay innocently slumbering on the grass with his garden hat over his nose his waistcoat unbuttoned and his trousers wrinkled half way up his outstretched legs midwinter roused him without hesitation and remorselessly repeated the servants news  allan accepted the disclosure thus forced on him without the slightest disturbance of temper oh hang em was all he said lets have another cigar midwinter took the cigar out of his hand and insisting on his treating the matter seriously told him in plain words that he must set himself right with his offended neighbors by calling on them personally to make his apologies allan sat up on the grass in astonishment his eyes opened wide in incredulous dismay did midwinter positively meditate forcing him into a chimneypot hat a nicely brushed frockcoat and a clean pair of gloves was it actually in contemplation to shut him up in a carriage with his footman on the box and his cardcase in his hand and send him round from house to house to tell a pack of fools that he begged their pardon for not letting them make a public show of him if anything so outrageously absurd as this was really to be done it could not be done that day at any rate he had promised to go back to the charming milroy at the cottage and to take midwinter with him what earthly need had he of the good opinion of the resident gentry the only friends he wanted were the friends he had got already let the whole neighborhood turn its back on him if it liked back or face the squire of thorpe ambrose didnt care two straws about it  after allowing him to run on in this way until his whole stock of objections was exhausted midwinter wisely tried his personal influence next he took allan affectionately by the hand i am going to ask a great favor he said if you wont call on these people for your own sake will you call on them to please me  allan delivered himself of a groan of despair stared in mute surprise at the anxious face of his friend and goodhumoredly gave way as midwinter took his arm and led him back to the house he looked round with rueful eyes at the cattle hard by placidly whisking their tails in the pleasant shade dont mention it in the neighborhood he said i should like to change places with one of my own cows  midwinter left him to dress engaging to return when the carriage was at the door allans toilet did not promise to be a speedy one he began it by reading his own visiting cards and he advanced it a second stage by looking into his wardrobe and devoting the resident gentry to the infernal regions before he could discover any third means of delaying his own proceedings the necessary pretext was unexpectedly supplied by richards appearance with a note in his hand the messenger had just called with mr darchs answer allan briskly shut up the wardrobe and gave his whole attention to the lawyers letter the lawyers letter rewarded him by the following lines   siri beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of todays date honoring me with two proposals namely one inviting me to act as your legal adviser and one inviting me to pay you a visit at your house in reference to the first proposal i beg permission to decline it with thanks with regard to the second proposal i have to inform you that circumstances have come to my knowledge relating to the letting of the cottage at thorpe ambrose which render it impossible for me in justice to myself to accept your invitation i have ascertained sir that my offer reached you at the same time as major milroys and that with both proposals thus before you you gave the preference to a total stranger who addressed you through a house agent over a man who had faithfully served your relatives for two generations and who had been the first person to inform you of the most important event in your life after this specimen of your estimate of what is due to the claims of common courtesy and common justice i cannot flatter myself that i possess any of the qualities which would fit me to take my place on the list of your friends  i remain sir your obedient servant  james darch   stop the messenger cried allan leaping to his feet his ruddy face aflame with indignation give me pen ink and paper by the lord harry theyre a nice set of people in these parts the whole neighborhood is in a conspiracy to bully me he snatched up the pen in a fine frenzy of epistolary inspiration siri despise you and your letter at that point the pen made a blot and the writer was seized with a momentary hesitation too strong he thought ill give it to the lawyer in his own cool and cutting style he began again on a clean sheet of paper siryou remind me of an irish bull i mean that story in joe miller where pat remarked in the hearing of a wag hard by that the reciprocity was all on one side your reciprocity is all on one side you take the privilege of refusing to be my lawyer and then you complain of my taking the privilege of refusing to be your landlord he paused fondly over those last words neat he thought argument and hard hitting both in one i wonder where my knack of writing comes from he went on and finished the letter in two more sentences as for your casting my invitation back in my teeth i beg to inform you my teeth are none the worse for it i am equally glad to have nothing to say to you either in the capacity of a friend or a tenantallan armadale he nodded exultantly at his own composition as he addressed it and sent it down to the messenger darchs hide must be a thick one he said if he doesnt feel that  the sound of the wheels outside suddenly recalled him to the business of the day there was the carriage waiting to take him on his round of visits and there was midwinter at his post pacing to and fro on the drive  read that cried allan throwing out the lawyers letter ive written him back a smasher  he bustled away to the wardrobe to get his coat there was a wonderful change in him he felt little or no reluctance to pay the visits now the pleasurable excitement of answering mr darth had put him in a fine aggressive frame of mind for asserting himself in the neighborhood whatever else they may say of me they shant say i was afraid to face them heated redhot with that idea he seized his hat and gloves and hurrying out of the room met midwinter in the corridor with the lawyers letter in his hand  keep up your spirits cried allan seeing the anxiety in his friends face and misinterpreting the motive of it immediately if darch cant be counted on to send us a helping hand into the stewards office pedgift can  my dear allan i was not thinking of that i was thinking of mr darchs letter i dont defend this sourtempered man but i am afraid we must admit he has some cause for complaint pray dont give him another chance of putting you in the wrong where is your answer to his letter  gone replied allan i always strike while the irons hota word and a blow and the blow first thats my way dont theres a good fellow dont fidget about the stewards books and the rentday here heres a bunch of keys they gave me last night one of them opens the room where the stewards books are go in and read them till i come back i give you my sacred word of honor ill settle it all with pedgift before you see me again  one moment interposed midwinter stopping him resolutely on his way out to the carriage i say nothing against mr pedgifts fitness to possess your confidence for i know nothing to justify me in distrusting him but he has not introduced himself to your notice in a very delicate way and he has not acknowledged what is quite clear to my mind that he knew of mr darchs unfriendly feeling toward you when he wrote wait a little before you go to this stranger wait till we can talk it over together tonight  wait replied allan havent i told you that i always strike while the irons hot trust my eye for character old boy ill look pedgift through and through and act accordingly dont keep me any longer for heavens sake im in a fine humor for tackling the resident gentry and if i dont go at once im afraid it may wear off  with that excellent reason for being in a hurry allan boisterously broke away before it was possible to stop him again he had jumped into the carriage and had left the house     iv the march of events  midwinters face darkened when the last trace of the carriage had disappeared from view i have done my best he said as he turned back gloomily into the house if mr brock himself were here mr brock could do no more  he looked at the bunch of keys which allan had thrust into his hand and a sudden longing to put himself to the test over the stewards books took possession of his sensitive selftormenting nature inquiring his way to the room in which the various movables of the stewards office had been provisionally placed after the letting of the cottage he sat down at the desk and tried how his own unaided capacity would guide him through the business records of the thorpe ambrose estate the result exposed his own ignorance unanswerably before his own eyes the ledgers bewildered him the leases the plans and even the correspondence itself might have been written for all he could understand of them in an unknown tongue his memory reverted bitterly as he left the room again to his two years solitary selfinstruction in the shrewsbury booksellers shop if i could only have worked at a business he thought if i could only have known that the company of poets and philosophers was company too high for a vagabond like me  he sat down alone in the great hall the silence of it fell heavier and heavier on his sinking spirits the beauty of it exasperated him like an insult from a purseproud man curse the place he said snatching up his hat and stick i like the bleakest hillside i ever slept on better than i like this house  he impatiently descended the doorsteps and stopped on the drive considering by which direction he should leave the park for the country beyond if he followed the road taken by the carriage he might risk unsettling allan by accidentally meeting him in the town if he went out by the back gate he knew his own nature well enough to doubt his ability to pass the room of the dream without entering it again but one other way remained the way which he had taken and then abandoned again in the morning there was no fear of disturbing allan and the majors daughter now without further hesitation midwinter set forth through the gardens to explore the open country on that side of the estate  thrown off its balance by the events of the day his mind was full of that sourly savage resistance to the inevitable selfassertion of wealth so amiably deplored by the prosperous and the rich so bitterly familiar to the unfortunate and the poor the heatherbell costs nothing he thought looking contemptuously at the masses of rare and beautiful flowers that surrounded him and the buttercups and daisies are as bright as the best of you he followed the artfully contrived ovals and squares of the italian garden with a vagabond indifference to the symmetry of their construction and the ingenuity of their design how many pounds a foot did you cost he said looking back with scornful eyes at the last path as he left it wind away over high and low like the sheepwalk on the mountain side if you can  he entered the shrubbery which allan had entered before him crossed the paddock and the rustic bridge beyond and reached the majors cottage his ready mind seized the right conclusion at the first sight of it and he stopped before the garden gate to look at the trim little residence which would never have been empty and would never have been let but for allans illadvised resolution to force the stewards situation on his friend  the summer afternoon was warm the summer air was faint and still on the upper and the lower floor of the cottage the windows were all open from one of them on the upper story the sound of voices was startlingly audible in the quiet of the park as midwinter paused on the outer side of the garden inclosure the voice of a woman harsh high and angrily complaininga voice with all the freshness and the melody gone and with nothing but the hard power of it leftwas the discordantly predominant sound with it from moment to moment there mingled the deeper and quieter tones soothing and compassionate of the voice of a man although the distance was too great to allow midwinter to distinguish the words that were spoken he felt the impropriety of remaining within hearing of the voices and at once stepped forward to continue his walk  at the same moment the face of a young girl easily recognizable as the face of miss milroy from allans description of her appeared at the open window of the room in spite of himself midwinter paused to look at her the expression of the bright young face which had smiled so prettily on allan was weary and disheartened after looking out absently over the park she suddenly turned her head back into the room her attention having been apparently struck by something that had just been said in it oh mamma mamma she exclaimed indignantly how can you say such things the words were spoken close to the window they reached midwinters ears and hurried him away before he heard more but the selfdisclosure of major milroys domestic position had not reached its end yet as midwinter turned the corner of the garden fence a tradesmans boy was handing a parcel in at the wicket gate to the woman servant well said the boy with the irrepressible impudence of his class how is the missus the woman lifted her hand to box his ears how is the missus she repeated with an angry toss of her head as the boy ran off if it would only please god to take the missus it would be a blessing to everybody in the house  no such illomened shadow as this had passed over the bright domestic picture of the inhabitants of the cottage which allans enthusiasm had painted for the contemplation of his friend it was plain that the secret of the tenants had been kept from the landlord so far five minutes more of walking brought midwinter to the park gates am i fated to see nothing and hear nothing today which can give me heart and hope for the future he thought as he angrily swung back the lodge gate even the people allan has let the cottage to are people whose lives are imbittered by a household misery which it is my misfortune to have found out  he took the first road that lay before him and walked on noticing little immersed in his own thoughts  more than an hour passed before the necessity of turning back entered his mind as soon as the idea occurred to him he consulted his watch and determined to retrace his steps so as to be at the house in good time to meet allan on his return ten minutes of walking brought him back to a point at which three roads met and one moments observation of the place satisfied him that he had entirely failed to notice at the time by which of the three roads he had advanced no signpost was to be seen the country on either side was lonely and flat intersected by broad drains and ditches cattle were grazing here and there and a windmill rose in the distance above the pollard willows that fringed the low horizon but not a house was to be seen and not a human creature appeared on the visible perspective of any one of the three roads midwinter glanced back in the only direction left to look atthe direction of the road along which he had just been walking there to his relief was the figure of a man rapidly advancing toward him of whom he could ask his way  the figure came on clad from head to foot in dreary blacka moving blot on the brilliant white surface of the sunbrightened road he was a lean elderly miserably respectable man he wore a poor old black dresscoat and a cheap brown wig which made no pretense of being his own natural hair short black trousers clung like attached old servants round his wizen legs and rusty black gaiters hid all they could of his knobbed ungainly feet black crape added its mite to the decayed and dingy wretchedness of his old beaver hat black mohair in the obsolete form of a stock drearily encircled his neck and rose as high as his haggard jaws the one morsel of color he carried about him was a lawyers bag of blue serge as lean and limp as himself the one attractive feature in his cleanshaven weary old face was a neat set of teethteeth as honest as his wig which said plainly to all inquiring eyes we pass our nights on his lookingglass and our days in his mouth  all the little blood in the mans body faintly reddened his fleshless cheeks as midwinter advanced to meet him and asked the way to thorpe ambrose his weak watery eyes looked hither and thither in a bewilderment painful to see if he had met with a lion instead of a man and if the few words addressed to him had been words expressing a threat instead of a question he could hardly have looked more confused and alarmed than he looked now for the first time in his life midwinter saw his own shy uneasiness in the presence of strangers reflected with tenfold intensity of nervous suffering in the face of another manand that man old enough to be his father  which do you please to mean sirthe town or the house i beg your pardon for asking but they both go by the same name in these parts  he spoke with a timid gentleness of tone an ingratiatory smile and an anxious courtesy of manner all distressingly suggestive of his being accustomed to receive rough answers in exchange for his own politeness from the persons whom he habitually addressed  i was not aware that both the house and the town went by the same name said midwinter i meant the house he instinctively conquered his own shyness as he answered in those words speaking with a cordiality of manner which was very rare with him in his intercourse with strangers  the man of miserable respectability seemed to feel the warm return of his own politeness gratefully he brightened and took a little courage his lean forefinger pointed eagerly to the right road that way sir he said and when you come to two roads next please take the left one of the two i am sorry i have business the other way i mean in the town i should have been happy to go with you and show you fine summer weather sir for walking you cant miss your way if you keep to the left oh dont mention it im afraid i have detained you sir i wish you a pleasant walk back andgoodmorning  by the time he had made an end of speaking under an impression apparently that the more he talked the more polite he would be he had lost his courage again he darted away down his own road as if midwinters attempt to thank him involved a series of trials too terrible to confront in two minutes more his black retreating figure had lessened in the distance till it looked again what it had once looked already a moving blot on the brilliant white surface of the sunbrightened road  the man ran strangely in midwinters thoughts while he took his way back to the house he was at a loss to account for it it never occurred to him that he might have been insensibly reminded of himself when he saw the plain traces of past misfortune and present nervous suffering in the poor wretchs face he blindly resented his own perverse interest in this chance foot passenger on the highroad as he had resented all else that had happened to him since the beginning of the day have i made another unlucky discovery he asked himself impatiently shall i see this man again i wonder who can he be  time was to answer both those questions before many days more had passed over the inquirers head   allan had not returned when midwinter reached the house nothing had happened but the arrival of a message of apology from the cottage major milroys compliments and he was sorry that mrs milroys illness would prevent his receiving mr armadale that day it was plain that mrs milroys occasional fits of suffering or of ill temper created no mere transitory disturbance of the tranquillity of the household drawing this natural inference after what he had himself heard at the cottage nearly three hours since midwinter withdrew into the library to wait patiently among the books until his friend came back  it was past six oclock when the wellknown hearty voice was heard again in the hall allan burst into the library in a state of irrepressible excitement and pushed midwinter back unceremoniously into the chair from which he was just rising before he could utter a word  heres a riddle for you old boy cried allan why am i like the resident manager of the augean stable before hercules was called in to sweep the litter out because i have had my place to keep up and ive gone and made an infernal mess of it why dont you laugh by george he doesnt see the point lets try again why am i like the resident manager  for gods sake allan be serious for a moment interposed midwinter you dont know how anxious i am to hear if you have recovered the good opinion of your neighbors  thats just what the riddle was intended to tell you rejoined allan but if you will have it in so many words my own impression is that you would have done better not to disturb me under that tree in the park ive been calculating it to a nicety and i beg to inform you that i have sunk exactly three degrees lower in the estimation of the resident gentry since i had the pleasure of seeing you last  you will have your joke out said midwinter bitterly well if i cant laugh i can wait  my dear fellow im not joking i really mean what i say you shall hear what happened you shall have a report in full of my first visit it will do i can promise you as a sample for all the rest mind this in the first place ive gone wrong with the best possible intentions when i started for these visits i own i was angry with that old brute of a lawyer and i certainly had a notion of carrying things with a high hand but it wore off somehow on the road and the first family i called on i went in as i tell you with the best possible intentions oh dear dear there was the same spickandspan receptionroom for me to wait in with the neat conservatory beyond which i saw again and again and again at every other house i went to afterward there was the same choice selection of books for me to look ata religious book a book about the duke of wellington a book about sporting and a book about nothing in particular beautifully illustrated with pictures down came papa with his nice white hair and mamma with her nice lace cap down came young mister with the pink face and strawcolored whiskers and young miss with the plump cheeks and the large petticoats dont suppose there was the least unfriendliness on my side i always began with them in the same wayi insisted on shaking hands all round that staggered them to begin with when i came to the sore subject nextthe subject of the public receptioni give you my word of honor i took the greatest possible pains with my apologies it hadnt the slightest effect they let my apologies in at one ear and out at the other and then waited to hear more some men would have been disheartened i tried another way with them i addressed myself to the master of the house and put it pleasantly next the fact is i said i wanted to escape the speechifyingmy getting up you know and telling you to your face youre the best of men and i beg to propose your health and your getting up and telling me to my face im the best of men and you beg to thank me and so on man after man praising each other and pestering each other all round the table thats how i put it in an easy lighthanded convincing sort of way do you think any of them took it in the same friendly spirit not one its my belief they had got their speeches ready for the reception with the flags and the flowers and that theyre secretly angry with me for stopping their open mouths just as they were ready to begin anyway whenever we came to the matter of the speechifying whether they touched it first or i down i fell in their estimation the first of those three steps i told you of just now dont suppose i made no efforts to get up again i made desperate efforts i found they were all anxious to know what sort of life i had led before i came in for the thorpe ambrose property and i did my best to satisfy them and what came of that do you think hang me if i didnt disappoint them for the second time when they found out that i had actually never been to eton or harrow or oxford or cambridge they were quite dumb with astonishment i fancy they thought me a sort of outlaw at any rate they all froze up again and down i fell the second step in their estimation never mind i wasnt to be beaten i had promised you to do my best and i did it i tried cheerful smalltalk about the neighborhood next the women said nothing in particular the men to my unutterable astonishment all began to condole with me i shouldnt be able to find a pack of hounds they said within twenty miles of my house and they thought it only right to prepare me for the disgracefully careless manner in which the thorpe ambrose covers had been preserved i let them go on condoling with me and then what do you think i did i put my foot in it again oh dont take that to heart i said i dont care two straws about hunting or shooting either when i meet with a bird in my walk i cant for the life of me feel eager to kill it i rather like to see the bird flying about and enjoying itself you should have seen their faces they had thought me a sort of outlaw before now they evidently thought me mad dead silence fell upon them all and down i tumbled the third step in the general estimation it was just the same at the next house and the next and the next the devil possessed us all i think it would come out now in one way and now in another that i couldnt make speechesthat i had been brought up without a university educationand that i could enjoy a ride on horseback without galloping after a wretched stinking fox or a poor distracted little hare these three unlucky defects of mine are not excused it seems in a country gentleman especially when he has dodged a public reception to begin with i think i got on best upon the whole with the wives and daughters the women and i always fell sooner or later on the subject of mrs blanchard and her niece we invariably agreed that they had done wisely in going to florence and the only reason we had to give for our opinion was that we thought their minds would be benefited after their sad bereavement by the contemplation of the masterpieces of italian art every one of the ladiesi solemnly declare itat every house i went to came sooner or later to mrs and miss blanchards bereavement and the masterpieces of italian art what we should have done without that bright idea to help us i really dont know the one pleasant thing at any of the visits was when we all shook our heads together and declared that the masterpieces would console them as for the rest of it theres only one thing more to be said what i might be in other places i dont know im the wrong man in the wrong place here let me muddle on for the future in my own way with my own few friends and ask me anything else in the world as long as you dont ask me to make any more calls on my neighbors  with that characteristic request allans report of his exploring expedition among the resident gentry came to a close for a moment midwinter remained silent he had allowed allan to run on from first to last without uttering a word on his side the disastrous result of the visitscoming after what had happened earlier in the day and threatening allan as it did with exclusion from all local sympathies at the very outset of his local careerhad broken down midwinters power of resisting the stealthily depressing influence of his own superstition it was with an effort that he now looked up at allan it was with an effort that he roused himself to answer  it shall be as you wish he said quietly i am sorry for what has happened but i am not the less obliged to you allan for having done what i asked you  his head sank on his breast and the fatalist resignation which had once already quieted him on board the wreck now quieted him again what must be will be he thought once more what have i to do with the future and what has he  cheer up said allan your affairs are in a thriving condition at any rate i paid one pleasant visit in the town which i havent told you of yet ive seen pedgift and pedgifts son who helps him in the office theyre the two jolliest lawyers i ever met with in my life and whats more they can produce the very man you want to teach you the stewards business  midwinter looked up quickly distrust of allans discovery was plainly written in his face already but he said nothing  i thought of you allan proceeded as soon as the two pedgifts and i had had a glass of wine all round to drink to our friendly connection the finest sherry i ever tasted in my life ive ordered some of the samebut thats not the question just now in two words i told these worthy fellows your difficulty and in two seconds old pedgift understood all about it i have got the man in my office he said and before the auditday comes ill place him with the greatest pleasure at your friends disposal  at this last announcement midwinters distrust found its expression in words he questioned allan unsparingly  the mans name it appeared was bashwood he had been some time how long allan could not remember in mr pedgifts service he had been previously steward to a norfolk gentleman name forgotten in the westward district of the county he had lost the stewards place through some domestic trouble in connection with his son the precise nature of which allan was not able to specify pedgift vouched for him and pedgift would send him to thorpe ambrose two or three days before the rentday dinner he could not be spared for office reasons before that time there was no need to fidget about it pedgift laughed at the idea of there being any difficulty with the tenants two or three days work over the stewards books with a man to help midwinter who practically understood that sort of thing would put him all right for the audit and the other business would keep till afterward  have you seen this mr bashwood yourself allan asked midwinter still obstinately on his guard  no replied allan he was outout with the bag as young pedgift called it they tell me hes a decent elderly man a little broken by his troubles and a little apt to be nervous and confused in his manner with strangers but thoroughly competent and thoroughly to be depended onthose are pedgifts own words  midwinter paused and considered a little with a new interest in the subject the strange man whom he had just heard described and the strange man of whom he had asked his way where the three roads met were remarkably like each other was this another link in the fastlengthening chain of events midwinter grew doubly determined to be careful as the bare doubt that it might be so passed through his mind  when mr bashwood comes he said will you let me see him and speak to him before anything definite is done  of course i will rejoined allan he stopped and looked at his watch and ill tell you what ill do for you old boy in the meantime he added ill introduce you to the prettiest girl in norfolk theres just time to run over to the cottage before dinner come along and be introduced to miss milroy  you cant introduce me to miss milroy today replied midwinter and he repeated the message of apology which had been brought from the major that afternoon allan was surprised and disappointed but he was not to be foiled in his resolution to advance himself in the good graces of the inhabitants of the cottage after a little consideration he hit on a means of turning the present adverse circumstances to good account ill show a proper anxiety for mrs milroys recovery he said gravely ill send her a basket of strawberries with my best respects tomorrow morning  nothing more happened to mark the end of that first day in the new house   the one noticeable event of the next day was another disclosure of mrs milroys infirmity of temper half an hour after allans basket of strawberries had been delivered at the cottage it was returned to him intact by the hands of the invalid ladys nurse with a short and sharp message shortly and sharply delivered mrs milroys compliments and thanks strawberries invariably disagreed with her if this curiously petulant acknowledgment of an act of politeness was intended to irritate allan it failed entirely in accomplishing its object instead of being offended with the mother he sympathized with the daughter poor little thing was all he said she must have a hard life of it with such a mother as that  he called at the cottage himself later in the day but miss milroy was not to be seen she was engaged upstairs the major received his visitor in his working apronfar more deeply immersed in his wonderful clock and far less readily accessible to outer influences than allan had seen him at their first interview his manner was as kind as before but not a word more could be extracted from him on the subject of his wife than that mrs milroy had not improved since yesterday  the two next days passed quietly and uneventfully allan persisted in making his inquiries at the cottage but all he saw of the majors daughter was a glimpse of her on one occasion at a window on the bedroom floor nothing more was heard from mr pedgift and mr bashwoods appearance was still delayed midwinter declined to move in the matter until time enough had passed to allow of his first hearing from mr brock in answer to the letter which he had addressed to the rector on the night of his arrival at thorpe ambrose he was unusually silent and quiet and passed most of his hours in the library among the books the time wore on wearily the resident gentry acknowledged allans visit by formally leaving their cards nobody came near the house afterward the weather was monotonously fine allan grew a little restless and dissatisfied he began to resent mrs milroys illness he began to think regretfully of his deserted yacht  the next daythe twentiethbrought some news with it from the outer world a message was delivered from mr pedgift announcing that his clerk mr bashwood would personally present himself at thorpe ambrose on the following day and a letter in answer to midwinter was received from mr brock  the letter was dated the 18th and the news which it contained raised not allans spirits only but midwinters as well  on the day on which he wrote mr brock announced that he was about to journey to london having been summoned thither on business connected with the interests of a sick relative to whom he stood in the position of trustee the business completed he had good hope of finding one or other of his clerical friends in the metropolis who would be able and willing to do duty for him at the rectory and in that case he trusted to travel on from london to thorpe ambrose in a weeks time or less under these circumstances he would leave the majority of the subjects on which midwinter had written to him to be discussed when they met but as time might be of importance in relation to the stewardship of the thorpe ambrose estate he would say at once that he saw no reason why midwinter should not apply his mind to learning the stewards duties and should not succeed in rendering himself invaluably serviceable in that way to the interests of his friend  leaving midwinter reading and rereading the rectors cheering letter as if he was bent on getting every sentence in it by heart allan went out rather earlier than usual to make his daily inquiry at the cottageor in plainer words to make a fourth attempt at improving his acquaintance with miss milroy the day had begun encouragingly and encouragingly it seemed destined to go on when allan turned the corner of the second shrubbery and entered the little paddock where he and the majors daughter had first met there was miss milroy herself loitering to and fro on the grass to all appearance on the watch for somebody  she gave a little start when allan appeared and came forward without hesitation to meet him she was not in her best looks her rosy complexion had suffered under confinement to the house and a marked expression of embarrassment clouded her pretty face  i hardly know how to confess it mr armadale she said speaking eagerly before allan could utter a word but i certainly ventured here this morning in the hope of meeting with you i have been very much distressed i have only just heard by accident of the manner in which mamma received the present of fruit you so kindly sent to her will you try to excuse her she has been miserably ill for years and she is not always quite herself after your being so very very kind to me and to papa i really could not help stealing out here in the hope of seeing you and telling you how sorry i was pray forgive and forget mr armadalepray do her voice faltered over the last words and in her eagerness to make her mothers peace with him she laid her hand on his arm  allan was himself a little confused her earnestness took him by surprise and her evident conviction that he had been offended honestly distressed him not knowing what else to do he followed his instincts and possessed himself of her hand to begin with  my dear miss milroy if you say a word more you will distress me next he rejoined unconsciously pressing her hand closer and closer in the embarrassment of the moment i never was in the least offended i made allowancesupon my honor i didfor poor mrs milroys illness offended cried allan reverting energetically to the old complimentary strain i should like to have my basket of fruit sent back every dayif i could only be sure of its bringing you out into the paddock the first thing in the morning  some of miss milroys missing color began to appear again in her cheeks oh mr armadale there is really no end to your kindness she said you dont know how you relieve me she paused her spirits rallied with as happy a readiness of recovery as if they had been the spirits of a child and her native brightness of temper sparkled again in her eyes as she looked up shyly smiling in allans face dont you think she asked demurely that it is almost time now to let go of my hand  their eyes met allan followed his instincts for the second time instead of releasing her hand he lifted it to his lips and kissed it all the missing tints of the rosier sort returned to miss milroys complexion on the instant she snatched away her hand as if allan had burned it  im sure thats wrong mr armadale she said and turned her head aside quickly for she was smiling in spite of herself  i meant it as an apology forfor holding your hand too long stammered allan an apology cant be wrongcan it  there are occasions though not many when the female mind accurately appreciates an appeal to the force of pure reason this was one of the occasions an abstract proposition had been presented to miss milroy and miss milroy was convinced if it was meant as an apology that she admitted made all the difference i only hope said the little coquet looking at him slyly youre not misleading me not that it matters much now she added with a serious shake of her head if we have committed any improprieties mr armadale we are not likely to have the opportunity of committing many more  youre not going away exclaimed allan in great alarm  worse than that mr armadale my new governess is coming  coming repeated allan coming already  as good as coming i ought to have saidonly i didnt know you wished me to be so very particular we got the answers to the advertisements this morning papa and i opened them and read them together half an hour ago and we both picked out the same letter from all the rest i picked it out because it was so prettily expressed and papa picked it out because the terms were so reasonable he is going to send the letter up to grandmamma in london by todays post and if she finds everything satisfactory on inquiry the governess is to be engaged you dont know how dreadfully nervous i am getting about it already a strange governess is such an awful prospect but it is not quite so bad as going to school and i have great hopes of this new lady because she writes such a nice letter as i said to papa it almost reconciles me to her horrid unromantic name  what is her name asked allan brown grubb scraggs anything of that sort  hush hush nothing quite so horrible as that her name is gwilt dreadfully unpoetical isnt it her reference must be a respectable person though for she lives in the same part of london as grandmamma stop mr armadale we are going the wrong way no i cant wait to look at those lovely flowers of yours this morning and many thanks i cant accept your arm i have stayed here too long already papa is waiting for his breakfast and i must run back every step of the way thank you for making those kind allowances for mamma thank you again and again and goodby  wont you shake hands asked allan  she gave him her hand no more apologies if you please mr armadale she said saucily once more their eyes met and once more the plump dimpled little hand found its way to allans lips it isnt an apology this time cried allan precipitately defending himself itsits a mark of respect  she started back a few steps and burst out laughing you wont find me in our grounds again mr armadale she said merrily till i have got miss gwilt to take care of me with that farewell she gathered up her skirts and ran back across the paddock at the top of her speed  allan stood watching her in speechless admiration till she was out of sight his second interview with miss milroy had produced an extraordinary effect on him for the first time since he had become the master of thorpe ambrose he was absorbed in serious consideration of what he owed to his new position in life the question is pondered allan whether i hadnt better set myself right with my neighbors by becoming a married man ill take the day to consider and if i keep in the same mind about it ill consult midwinter tomorrow morning   when the morning came and when allan descended to the breakfastroom resolute to consult his friend on the obligations that he owed to his neighbors in general and to miss milroy in particular no midwinter was to be seen on making inquiry it appeared that he had been observed in the hall that he had taken from the table a letter which the mornings post had brought to him and that he had gone back immediately to his own room allan at once ascended the stairs again and knocked at his friends door  may i come in he asked  not just now was the answer  you have got a letter havent you persisted allan any bad news anything wrong  nothing im not very well this morning dont wait breakfast for me ill come down as soon as i can  no more was said on either side allan returned to the breakfastroom a little disappointed he had set his heart on rushing headlong into his consultation with midwinter and here was the consultation indefinitely delayed what an odd fellow he is thought allan what on earth can he be doing locked in there by himself  he was doing nothing he was sitting by the window with the letter which had reached him that morning open in his hand the handwriting was mr brocks and the words written were these   my dear midwinteri have literally only two minutes before post time to tell you that i have just met in kensington gardens with the woman whom we both only know thus far as the woman with the red paisley shawl i have traced her and her companion a respectablelooking elderly lady to their residenceafter having distinctly heard allans name mentioned between them depend on my not losing sight of the woman until i am satisfied that she means no mischief at thorpe ambrose and expect to hear from me again as soon as i know how this strange discovery is to end  very truly yours decimus brock   after reading the letter for the second time midwinter folded it up thoughtfully and placed it in his pocketbook side by side with the manuscript narrative of allans dream  your discovery will not end with you mr brock he said do what you will with the woman when the time comes the woman will be here     v mother oldershaw on her guard  1 from mrs oldershaw diana street pimlico to miss gwilt west place old brompton  ladies toilet repository june 20th  eight in the evening  my dear lydiaabout three hours have passed as well as i can remember since i pushed you unceremoniously inside my house in west place and merely telling you to wait till you saw me again banged the door to between us and left you alone in the hall i know your sensitive nature my dear and i am afraid you have made up your mind by this time that never yet was a guest treated so abominably by her hostess as i have treated you  the delay that has prevented me from explaining my strange conduct is believe me a delay for which i am not to blame one of the many delicate little difficulties which beset so essentially confidential a business as mine occurred here as i have since discovered while we were taking the air this afternoon in kensington gardens i see no chance of being able to get back to you for some hours to come and i have a word of very urgent caution for your private ear which has been too long delayed already so i must use the spare minutes as they come and write  here is caution the first on no account venture outside the door again this evening and be very careful while the daylight lasts not to show yourself at any of the front windows i have reason to fear that a certain charming person now staying with me may possibly be watched dont be alarmed and dont be impatient you shall know why  i can only explain myself by going back to our unlucky meeting in the gardens with that reverend gentleman who was so obliging as to follow us both back to my house  it crossed my mind just as we were close to the door that there might be a motive for the parsons anxiety to trace us home far less creditable to his taste and far more dangerous to both of us than the motive you supposed him to have in plainer words lydia i rather doubted whether you had met with another admirer and i strongly suspected that you had encountered another enemy instead there was no time to tell you this there was only time to see you safe into the house and to make sure of the parson in case my suspicions were right by treating him as he had treated us i mean by following him in his turn  i kept some little distance behind him at first to turn the thing over in my mind and to be satisfied that my doubts were not misleading me we have no concealments from each other and you shall know what my doubts were  i was not surprised at your recognizing him he is not at all a commonlooking old man and you had seen him twice in somersetshireonce when you asked your way of him to mrs armadales house and once when you saw him again on your way back to the railroad but i was a little puzzled considering that you had your veil down on both those occasions and your veil down also when we were in the gardens at his recognizing you i doubted his remembering your figure in a summer dress after he had only seen it in a winter dress and though we were talking when he met us and your voice is one among your many charms i doubted his remembering your voice either and yet i felt persuaded that he knew you how you will ask my dear as illluck would have it we were speaking at the time of young armadale i firmly believe that the name was the first thing that struck him and when he heard that your voice certainly and your figure perhaps came back to his memory and what if it did you may say think again lydia and tell me whether the parson of the place where mrs armadale lived was not likely to be mrs armadales friend if he was her friend the very first person to whom she would apply for advice after the manner in which you frightened her and after what you most injudiciously said on the subject of appealing to her son would be the clergyman of the parishand the magistrate too as the landlord at the inn himself told you  you will now understand why i left you in that extremely uncivil manner and i may go on to what happened next  i followed the old gentleman till he turned into a quiet street and then accosted him with respect for the church written i flatter myself in every line of my face  will you excuse me i said if i venture to inquire sir whether you recognized the lady who was walking with me when you happened to pass us in the gardens  will you excuse my asking maam why you put that question was all the answer i got  i will endeavor to tell you sir i said if my friend is not an absolute stranger to you i should wish to request your attention to a very delicate subject connected with a lady deceased and with her son who survives her  he was staggered i could see that but he was sly enough at the same time to hold his tongue and wait till i said something more  if i am wrong sir in thinking that you recognized my friend i went on i beg to apologize but i could hardly suppose it possible that a gentleman in your profession would follow a lady home who was a total stranger to him  there i had him he colored up fancy that at his age and owned the truth in defense of his own precious character  i have met with the lady once before and i acknowledge that i recognized her in the gardens he said you will excuse me if i decline entering into the question of whether i did or did not purposely follow her home if you wish to be assured that your friend is not an absolute stranger to me you now have that assurance and if you have anything particular to say to me i leave you to decide whether the time has come to say it  he waited and looked about i waited and looked about he said the street was hardly a fit place to speak of a delicate subject in i said the street was hardly a fit place to speak of a delicate subject in he didnt offer to take me to where he lived i didnt offer to take him to where i lived have you ever seen two strange cats my dear nose to nose on the tiles if you have you have seen the parson and me done to the life  well maam he said at last shall we go on with our conversation in spite of circumstances  yes sir i said we are both of us fortunately of an age to set circumstances at defiance i had seen the old wretch looking at my gray hair and satisfying himself that his character was safe if he was seen with me  after all this snapping and snarling we came to the point at last i began by telling him that i feared his interest in you was not of the friendly sort he admitted that muchof course in defense of his own character once more i next repeated to him everything you had told me about your proceedings in somersetshire when we first found that he was following us home dont be alarmed my deari was acting on principle if you want to make a dish of lies digestible always give it a garnish of truth well having appealed to the reverend gentlemans confidence in this matter i next declared that you had become an altered woman since he had seen you last i revived that dead wretch your husband without mentioning names of course established him the first place i thought of in business at the brazils and described a letter which he had written offering to forgive his erring wife if she would repent and go back to him i assured the parson that your husbands noble conduct had softened your obdurate nature and then thinking i had produced the right impression i came boldly to close quarters with him i said at the very time when you met us sir my unhappy friend was speaking in terms of touching selfreproach of her conduct to the late mrs armadale she confided to me her anxiety to make some atonement if possible to mrs armadales son and it is at her entreaty for she cannot prevail on herself to face you that i now beg to inquire whether mr armadale is still in somersetshire and whether he would consent to take back in small installments the sum of money which my friend acknowledges that she received by practicing on mrs armadales fears those were my very words a neater story accounting so nicely for everything was never told it was a story to melt a stone but this somersetshire parson is harder than stone itself i blush for him my dear when i assure you that he was evidently insensible enough to disbelieve every word i said about your reformed character your husband in the brazils and your penitent anxiety to pay the money back it is really a disgrace that such a man should be in the church such cunning as his is in the last degree unbecoming in a member of a sacred profession  does your friend propose to join her husband by the next steamer was all he condescended to say when i had done  i acknowledge i was angry i snapped at him i said yes she does  how am i to communicate with her he asked  i snapped at him again by letterthrough me  at what address maam  there i had him once more you have found my address out for yourself sir i said the directory will tell you my name if you wish to find that out for yourself also otherwise you are welcome to my card  many thanks maam if your friend wishes to communicate with mr armadale i will give you my card in return  thank you sir  thank you maam  goodafternoon sir  goodafternoon maam  so we parted i went my way to an appointment at my place of business and he went his in a hurry which is of itself suspicious what i cant get over is his heartlessness heaven help the people who send for him to comfort them on their deathbeds  the next consideration is what are we to do if we dont find out the right way to keep this old wretch in the dark he may be the ruin of us at thorpe ambrose just as we are within easy reach of our end in view wait up till i come to you with my mind free i hope from the other difficulty which is worrying me here was there ever such ill luck as ours only think of that man deserting his congregation and coming to london just at the very time when we have answered major milroys advertisement and may expect the inquiries to be made next week i have no patience with him his bishop ought to interfere  affectionately yours  maria oldershaw  2 from miss gwilt to mrs oldershaw  west place june 20th  my poor old dearhow very little you know of my sensitive nature as you call it instead of feeling offended when you left me i went to your piano and forgot all about you till your messenger came your letter is irresistible i have been laughing over it till i am quite out of breath of all the absurd stories i ever read the story you addressed to the somersetshire clergyman is the most ridiculous and as for your interview with him in the street it is a perfect sin to keep it to ourselves the public ought really to enjoy it in the form of a farce at one of the theaters  luckily for both of us to come to serious matters your messenger is a prudent person he sent upstairs to know if there was an answer in the midst of my merriment i had presence of mind enough to send downstairs and say yes  some brute of a man says in some book which i once read that no woman can keep two separate trains of ideas in her mind at the same time i declare you have almost satisfied me that the man is right what when you have escaped unnoticed to your place of business and when you suspect this house to be watched you propose to come back here and to put it in the parsons power to recover the lost trace of you what madness stop where you are and when you have got over your difficulty at pimlico it is some womans business of course what worries women are be so good as to read what i have got to say about our difficulty at brompton  in the first place the house as you supposed is watched  half an hour after you left me loud voices in the street interrupted me at the piano and i went to the window there was a cab at the house opposite where they let lodgings and an old man who looked like a respectable servant was wrangling with the driver about his fare an elderly gentleman came out of the house and stopped them an elderly gentleman returned into the house and appeared cautiously at the front drawingroom window you know him you worthy creature he had the bad taste some few hours since to doubt whether you were telling him the truth dont be afraid he didnt see me when he looked up after settling with the cab driver i was behind the curtain i have been behind the curtain once or twice since and i have seen enough to satisfy me that he and his servant will relieve each other at the window so as never to lose sight of your house here night or day that the parson suspects the real truth is of course impossible but that he firmly believes i mean some mischief to young armadale and that you have entirely confirmed him in that conviction is as plain as that two and two make four and this has happened as you helplessly remind me just when we have answered the advertisement and when we may expect the majors inquiries to be made in a few days time  surely here is a terrible situation for two women to find themselves in a fiddlesticks end for the situation we have got an easy way out of itthanks mother oldershaw to what i myself forced you to do not three hours before the somersetshire clergyman met with us  has that venomous little quarrel of ours this morningafter we had pounced on the majors advertisement in the newspaperquite slipped out of your memory have you forgotten how i persisted in my opinion that you were a great deal too well known in london to appear safely as my reference in your own name or to receive an inquiring lady or gentleman as you were rash enough to propose in your own house dont you remember what a passion you were in when i brought our dispute to an end by declining to stir a step in the matter unless i could conclude my application to major milroy by referring him to an address at which you were totally unknown and to a name which might be anything you pleased as long as it was not yours what a look you gave me when you found there was nothing for it but to drop the whole speculation or to let me have my own way how you fumed over the lodging hunting on the other side of the park and how you groaned when you came back possessed of furnished apartments in respectable bayswater over the useless expense i had put you to  what do you think of those furnished apartments now you obstinate old woman here we are with discovery threatening us at our very door and with no hope of escape unless we can contrive to disappear from the parson in the dark and there are the lodgings in bayswater to which no inquisitive strangers have traced either you or me ready and waiting to swallow us upthe lodgings in which we can escape all further molestation and answer the majors inquiries at our ease can you see at last a little further than your poor old nose is there anything in the world to prevent your safe disappearance from pimlico tonight and your safe establishment at the new lodgings in the character of my respectable reference half an hour afterward oh fie fie mother oldershaw go down on your wicked old knees and thank your stars that you had a shedevil like me to deal with this morning  suppose we come now to the only difficulty worth mentioningmy difficulty watched as i am in this house how am i to join you without bringing the parson or the parsons servant with me at my heels  being to all intents and purposes a prisoner here it seems to me that i have no choice but to try the old prison plan of escape a change of clothes i have been looking at your housemaid except that we are both light her face and hair and my face and hair are as unlike each other as possible but she is as nearly as can be my height and size and if she only knew how to dress herself and had smaller feet her figure is a very much better one than it ought to be for a person in her station in life  my idea is to dress her in the clothes i wore in the gardens today to send her out with our reverend enemy in full pursuit of her and as soon as the coast is clear to slip away myself and join you the thing would be quite impossible of course if i had been seen with my veil up but as events have turned out it is one advantage of the horrible exposure which followed my marriage that i seldom show myself in public and never of course in such a populous place as london without wearing a thick veil and keeping that veil down if the housemaid wears my dress i dont really see why the housemaid may not be counted on to represent me to the life  the one question is can the woman be trusted if she can send me a line telling her on your authority that she is to place herself at my disposal i wont say a word till i have heard from you first  let me have my answer tonight as long as we were only talking about my getting the governesss place i was careless enough how it ended but now that we have actually answered major milroys advertisement i am in earnest at last i mean to be mrs armadale of thorpe ambrose and woe to the man or woman who tries to stop me yours  lydia gwilt  psi open my letter again to say that you need have no fear of your messenger being followed on his return to pimlico he will drive to a publichouse where he is known will dismiss the cab at the door and will go out again by a back way which is only used by the landlord and his friendsl g  3 from mrs oldershaw to miss gwilt  diana street 10 oclock  my dear lydiayou have written me a heartless letter if you had been in my trying position harassed as i was when i wrote to you i should have made allowances for my friend when i found my friend not so sharp as usual but the vice of the present age is a want of consideration for persons in the decline of life morally speaking you are in a sad state my dear and you stand much in need of a good example you shall have a good examplei forgive you  having now relieved my mind by the performance of a good action suppose i show you next though i protest against the vulgarity of the expression that i can see a little further than my poor old nose  i will answer your question about the housemaid first you may trust her implicitly she has had her troubles and has learned discretion she also looks your age though it is only her due to say that in this particular she has some years the advantage of you i inclose the necessary directions which will place her entirely at your disposal  and what comes next  your plan for joining me at bayswater comes next it is very well as far as it goes but it stands sadly in need of a little judicious improvement there is a serious necessity you shall know why presently for deceiving the parson far more completely than you propose to deceive him i want him to see the housemaids face under circumstances which will persuade him that it is your face and then going a step further i want him to see the housemaid leave london under the impression that he has seen you start on the first stage of your journey to the brazils he didnt believe in that journey when i announced it to him this afternoon in the street he may believe in it yet if you follow the directions i am now going to give you  tomorrow is saturday send the housemaid out in your walking dress of today just as you propose but dont stir out yourself and dont go near the window desire the woman to keep her veil down to take half an hours walk quite unconscious of course of the parson or his servant at her heels and then to come back to you as soon as she appears send her instantly to the open window instructing her to lift her veil carelessly and look out let her go away again after a minute or two take off her bonnet and shawl and then appear once more at the window or better still in the balcony outside she may show herself again occasionally not too often later in the day and tomorrowas we have a professional gentleman to deal withby all means send her to church if these proceedings dont persuade the parson that the housemaids face is your face and if they dont make him readier to believe in your reformed character than he was when i spoke to him i have lived sixty years my love in this vale of tears to mighty little purpose  the next day is monday i have looked at the shipping advertisements and i find that a steamer leaves liverpool for the brazils on tuesday nothing could be more convenient we will start you on your voyage under the parsons own eyes you may manage it in this way  at one oclock send out the man who cleans the knives and forks to get a cab and when he has brought it up to the door let him go back and get a second cab which he is to wait in himself round the corner in the square let the housemaid still in your dress drive off with the necessary boxes in the first cab to the northwestern railway when she is gone slip out yourself to the cab waiting round the corner and come to me at bayswater they may be prepared to follow the housemaids cab because they have seen it at the door but they wont be prepared to follow your cab because it has been hidden round the corner when the housemaid has got to the station and has done her best to disappear in the crowd i have chosen the mixed train at 210 so as to give her every chance you will be safe with me and whether they do or do not find out that she does not really start for liverpool wont matter by that time they will have lost all trace of you and they may follow the housemaid half over london if they like she has my instructions inclosed to leave the empty boxes to find their way to the lost luggage office and to go to her friends in the city and stay there till i write word that i want her again  and what is the object of all this  my dear lydia the object is your future security and mine we may succeed or we may fail in persuading the parson that you have actually gone to the brazils if we succeed we are relieved of all fear of him if we fail he will warn young armadale to be careful of a woman like my housemaid and not of a woman like you this last gain is a very important one for we dont know that mrs armadale may not have told him your maiden name in that event the miss gwilt whom he will describe as having slipped through his fingers here will be so entirely unlike the miss gwilt established at thorpe ambrose as to satisfy everybody that it is not a case of similarity of persons but only a case of similarity of names  what do you say now to my improvement on your idea are my brains not quite so addled as you thought them when you wrote dont suppose im at all overboastful about my own ingenuity cleverer tricks than this trick of mine are played off on the public by swindlers and are recorded in the newspapers every week i only want to show you that my assistance is not less necessary to the success of the armadale speculation now than it was when i made our first important discoveries by means of the harmlesslooking young man and the private inquiry office in shadyside place  there is nothing more to say that i know of except that i am just going to start for the new lodging with a box directed in my new name the last expiring moments of mother oldershaw of the toilet repository are close at hand and the birth of miss gwilts respectable reference mrs mandeville will take place in a cab in five minutes time i fancy i must be still young at heart for i am quite in love already with my romantic name it sounds almost as pretty as mrs armadale of thorpe ambrose doesnt it  goodnight my dear and pleasant dreams if any accident happens between this and monday write to me instantly by post if no accident happens you will be with me in excellent time for the earliest inquiries that the major can possibly make my last words are dont go out and dont venture near the front windows till monday comes  affectionately yours  m o     vi midwinter in disguise  toward noon on the day of the twentyfirst miss milroy was loitering in the cottage gardenreleased from duty in the sickroom by an improvement in her mothers healthwhen her attention was attracted by the sound of voices in the park one of the voices she instantly recognized as allans the other was strange to her she put aside the branches of a shrub near the garden palings and peeping through saw allan approaching the cottage gate in company with a slim dark undersized man who was talking and laughing excitably at the top of his voice miss milroy ran indoors to warn her father of mr armadales arrival and to add that he was bringing with him a noisy stranger who was in all probability the friend generally reported to be staying with the squire at the great house  had the majors daughter guessed right was the squires loudtalking loudlaughing companion the shy sensitive midwinter of other times it was even so in allans presence that morning an extraordinary change had passed over the ordinarily quiet demeanor of allans friend  when midwinter had first appeared in the breakfastroom after putting aside mr brocks startling letter allan had been too much occupied to pay any special attention to him the undecided difficulty of choosing the day for the audit dinner had pressed for a settlement once more and had been fixed at last under the butlers advice for saturday the twentyeighth of the month it was only on turning round to remind midwinter of the ample space of time which the new arrangement allowed for mastering the stewards books that even allans flighty attention had been arrested by a marked change in the face that confronted him he had openly noticed the change in his usual blunt manner and had been instantly silenced by a fretful almost an angry reply the two had sat down together to breakfast without the usual cordiality and the meal had proceeded gloomily till midwinter himself broke the silence by bursting into the strange outbreak of gayety which had revealed in allans eyes a new side to the character of his friend  as usual with most of allans judgments here again the conclusion was wrong it was no new side to midwinters character that now presented itselfit was only a new aspect of the one everrecurring struggle of midwinters life  irritated by allans discovery of the change in him and dreading the next questions that allans curiosity might put midwinter had roused himself to efface by main force the impression which his own altered appearance had produced it was one of those efforts which no men compass so resolutely as the men of his quick temper and his sensitive feminine organization with his whole mind still possessed by the firm belief that the fatality had taken one great step nearer to allan and himself since the rectors adventure in kensington gardenswith his face still betraying what he had suffered under the renewed conviction that his fathers deathbed warning was now in event after event asserting its terrible claim to part him at any sacrifice from the one human creature whom he lovedwith the fear still busy at his heart that the first mysterious vision of allans dream might be a vision realized before the new day that now saw the two armadales together was a day that had passed over their headswith these triple bonds wrought by his own superstition fettering him at that moment as they had never fettered him yet he mercilessly spurred his resolution to the desperate effort of rivaling in allans presence the gayety and good spirits of allan himself  he talked and laughed and heaped his plate indiscriminately from every dish on the breakfasttable he made noisily merry with jests that had no humor and stories that had no point he first astonished allan then amused him then won his easily encouraged confidence on the subject of miss milroy he shouted with laughter over the sudden development of allans views on marriage until the servants downstairs began to think that their masters strange friend had gone mad lastly he had accepted allans proposal that he should be presented to the majors daughter and judge of her for himself as readily nay more readily than it would have been accepted by the least diffident man living there the two now stood at the cottage gatemidwinters voice rising louder and louder over allansmidwinters natural manner disguised how madly and miserably none but he knew in a coarse masquerade of boldnessthe outrageous the unendurable boldness of a shy man  they were received in the parlor by the majors daughter pending the arrival of the major himself  allan attempted to present his friend in the usual form to his astonishment midwinter took the words flippantly out of his lips and introduced himself to miss milroy with a confident look a hard laugh and a clumsy assumption of ease which presented him at his worst his artificial spirits lashed continuously into higher and higher effervescence since the morning were now mounting hysterically beyond his own control he looked and spoke with that terrible freedom of license which is the necessary consequence when a diffident man has thrown off his reserve of the very effort by which he has broken loose from his own restraints he involved himself in a confused medley of apologies that were not wanted and of compliments that might have overflattered the vanity of a savage he looked backward and forward from miss milroy to allan and declared jocosely that he understood now why his friends morning walks were always taken in the same direction he asked her questions about her mother and cut short the answers she gave him by remarks on the weather in one breath he said she must feel the day insufferably hot and in another he protested that he quite envied her in her cool muslin dress  the major came in  before he could say two words midwinter overwhelmed him with the same frenzy of familiarity and the same feverish fluency of speech he expressed his interest in mrs milroys health in terms which would have been exaggerated on the lips of a friend of the family he overflowed into a perfect flood of apologies for disturbing the major at his mechanical pursuits he quoted allans extravagant account of the clock and expressed his own anxiety to see it in terms more extravagant still he paraded his superficial book knowledge of the great clock at strasbourg with farfetched jests on the extraordinary automaton figures which that clock puts in motionon the procession of the twelve apostles which walks out under the dial at noon and on the toy cock which crows at st peters appearanceand this before a man who had studied every wheel in that complex machinery and who had passed whole years of his life in trying to imitate it i hear you have outnumbered the strasbourg apostles and outcrowed the strasbourg cock he exclaimed with the tone and manner of a friend habitually privileged to waive all ceremony and i am dying absolutely dying major to see your wonderful clock  major milroy had entered the room with his mind absorbed in his own mechanical contrivances as usual but the sudden shock of midwinters familiarity was violent enough to recall him instantly to himself and to make him master again for the time of his social resources as a man of the world  excuse me for interrupting you he said stopping midwinter for the moment by a look of steady surprise i happen to have seen the clock at strasbourg and it sounds almost absurd in my ears if you will pardon me for saying so to put my little experiment in any light of comparison with that wonderful achievement there is nothing else of the kind like it in the world he paused to control his own mounting enthusiasm the clock at strasbourg was to major milroy what the name of michael angelo was to sir joshua reynolds mr armadales kindness has led him to exaggerate a little pursued the major smiling at allan and passing over another attempt of midwinters to seize on the talk as if no such attempt had been made but as there does happen to be this one point of resemblance between the great clock abroad and the little clock at home that they both show what they can do on the stroke of noon and as it is close on twelve now if you still wish to visit my workshop mr midwinter the sooner i show you the way to it the better he opened the door and apologized to midwinter with marked ceremony for preceding him out of the room  what do you think of my friend whispered allan as he and miss milroy followed  must i tell you the truth mr armadale she whispered back  of course  then i dont like him at all  hes the best and dearest fellow in the world rejoined the outspoken allan youll like him better when you know him betterim sure you will  miss milroy made a little grimace implying supreme indifference to midwinter and saucy surprise at allans earnest advocacy of the merits of his friend has he got nothing more interesting to say to me than that she wondered privately after kissing my hand twice yesterday morning  they were all in the majors workroom before allan had the chance of trying a more attractive subject there on the top of a rough wooden case which evidently contained the machinery was the wonderful clock the dial was crowned by a glass pedestal placed on rockwork in carved ebony and on the top of the pedestal sat the inevitable figure of time with his everlasting scythe in his hand below the dial was a little platform and at either end of it rose two miniature sentryboxes with closed doors externally this was all that appeared until the magic moment came when the clock struck twelve noon  it wanted then about three minutes to twelve and major milroy seized the opportunity of explaining what the exhibition was to be before the exhibition began  at the first words his mind fell back again into its old absorption over the one employment of his life he turned to midwinter who had persisted in talking all the way from the parlor and who was talking still without a trace left in his manner of the cool and cutting composure with which he had spoken but a few minutes before the noisy familiar man who had been an illbred intruder in the parlor became a privileged guest in the workshop for there he possessed the allatoning social advantage of being new to the performances of the wonderful clock  at the first stroke of twelve mr midwinter said the major quite eagerly keep your eye on the figure of time he will move his scythe and point it downward to the glass pedestal you will next see a little printed card appear behind the glass which will tell you the day of the month and the day of the week at the last stroke of the clock time will lift his scythe again into its former position and the chimes will ring a peal the peal will be succeeded by the playing of a tunethe favorite march of my old regimentand then the final performance of the clock will follow the sentryboxes which you may observe at each side will both open at the same moment in one of them you will see the sentinel appear and from the other a corporal and two privates will march across the platform to relieve the guard and will then disappear leaving the new sentinel at his post i must ask your kind allowances for this last part of the performance the machinery is a little complicated and there are defects in it which i am ashamed to say i have not yet succeeded in remedying as i could wish sometimes the figures go all wrong and sometimes they go all right i hope they may do their best on the occasion of your seeing them for the first time  as the major posted near his clock said the last words his little audience of three assembled at the opposite end of the room saw the hourhand and the minutehand on the dial point together to twelve the first stroke sounded and time true to the signal moved his scythe the day of the month and the day of the week announced themselves in print through the glass pedestal next midwinter applauding their appearance with a noisy exaggeration of surprise which miss milroy mistook for coarse sarcasm directed at her fathers pursuits and which allan seeing that she was offended attempted to moderate by touching the elbow of his friend meanwhile the performances of the clock went on at the last stroke of twelve time lifted his scythe again the chimes rang the march tune of the majors old regiment followed and the crowning exhibition of the relief of the guard announced itself in a preliminary trembling of the sentryboxes and a sudden disappearance of the major at the back of the clock  the performance began with the opening of the sentrybox on the righthand side of the platform as punctually as could be desired the door on the other side however was less tractableit remained obstinately closed unaware of this hitch in the proceedings the corporal and his two privates appeared in their places in a state of perfect discipline tottered out across the platform all three trembling in every limb dashed themselves headlong against the closed door on the other side and failed in producing the smallest impression on the immovable sentry presumed to be within an intermittent clicking as of the majors keys and tools at work was heard in the machinery the corporal and his two privates suddenly returned backward across the platform and shut themselves up with a bang inside their own door exactly at the same moment the other door opened for the first time and the provoking sentry appeared with the utmost deliberation at his post waiting to be relieved he was allowed to wait nothing happened in the other box but an occasional knocking inside the door as if the corporal and his privates were impatient to be let out the clicking of the majors tools was heard again among the machinery the corporal and his party suddenly restored to liberty appeared in a violent hurry and spun furiously across the platform quick as they were however the hitherto deliberate sentry on the other side now perversely showed himself to be quicker still he disappeared like lightning into his own premises the door closed smartly after him the corporal and his privates dashed themselves headlong against it for the second time and the major appearing again round the corner of the clock asked his audience innocently if they would be good enough to tell him whether anything had gone wrong  the fantastic absurdity of the exhibition heightened by major milroys grave inquiry at the end of it was so irresistibly ludicrous that the visitors shouted with laughter and even miss milroy with all her consideration for her fathers sensitive pride in his clock could not restrain herself from joining in the merriment which the catastrophe of the puppets had provoked but there are limits even to the license of laughter and these limits were ere long so outrageously overstepped by one of the little party as to have the effect of almost instantly silencing the other two the fever of midwinters false spirits flamed out into sheer delirium as the performance of the puppets came to an end his paroxysms of laughter followed each other with such convulsive violence that miss milroy started back from him in alarm and even the patient major turned on him with a look which said plainly leave the room allan wisely impulsive for once in his life seized midwinter by the arm and dragged him out by main force into the garden and thence into the park beyond  good heavens what has come to you he exclaimed shrinking back from the tortured face before him as he stopped and looked close at it for the first time  for the moment midwinter was incapable of answering the hysterical paroxysm was passing from one extreme to the other he leaned against a tree sobbing and gasping for breath and stretched out his hand in mute entreaty to allan to give him time  you had better not have nursed me through my fever he said faintly as soon as he could speak im mad and miserable allan i have never recovered it go back and ask them to forgive me i am ashamed to go and ask them myself i cant tell how it happened i can only ask your pardon and theirs he turned aside his head quickly so as to conceal his face dont stop here he said dont look at me i shall soon get over it allan still hesitated and begged hard to be allowed to take him back to the house it was useless you break my heart with your kindness he burst out passionately for gods sake leave me by my self  allan went back to the cottage and pleaded there for indulgence to midwinter with an earnestness and simplicity which raised him immensely in the majors estimation but which totally failed to produce the same favorable impression on miss milroy little as she herself suspected it she was fond enough of allan already to be jealous of allans friend  how excessively absurd she thought pettishly as if either papa or i considered such a person of the slightest consequence  you will kindly suspend your opinion wont you major milroy said allan in his hearty way at parting  with the greatest pleasure replied the major cordially shaking hands  and you too miss milroy added allan  miss milroy made a mercilessly formal bow my opinion mr armadale is not of the slightest consequence  allan left the cottage sorely puzzled to account for miss milroys sudden coolness toward him his grand idea of conciliating the whole neighborhood by becoming a married man underwent some modification as he closed the garden gate behind him the virtue called prudence and the squire of thorpe ambrose became personally acquainted with each other on this occasion for the first time and allan entering headlong as usual on the highroad to moral improvement actually decided on doing nothing in a hurry  a man who is entering on a course of reformation ought if virtue is its own reward to be a man engaged in an essentially inspiriting pursuit but virtue is not always its own reward and the way that leads to reformation is remarkably illlighted for so respectable a thoroughfare allan seemed to have caught the infection of his friends despondency as he walked home he too began to doubtin his widely different way and for his widely different reasonswhether the life at thorpe ambrose was promising quite as fairly for the future as it had promised at first     vii the plot thickens  two messages were waiting for allan when he returned to the house one had been left by midwinter he had gone out for a long walk and mr armadale was not to be alarmed if he did not get back till late in the day the other message had been left by a person from mr pedgifts office who had called according to appointment while the two gentlemen were away at the majors mr bashwoods respects and he would have the honor of waiting on mr armadale again in the course of the evening  toward five oclock midwinter returned pale and silent allan hastened to assure him that his peace was made at the cottage and then to change the subject mentioned mr bashwoods message midwinters mind was so preoccupied or so languid that he hardly seemed to remember the name allan was obliged to remind him that bashwood was the elderly clerk whom mr pedgift had sent to be his instructor in the duties of the stewards office he listened without making any remark and withdrew to his room to rest till dinnertime  left by himself allan went into the library to try if he could while away the time over a book  he took many volumes off the shelves and put a few of them back again and there he ended miss milroy contrived in some mysterious manner to get in this case between the reader and the books her formal bow and her merciless parting speech dwelt try how he might to forget them on allans mind he began to grow more and more anxious as the idle hour wore on to recover his lost place in her favor to call again that day at the cottage and ask if he had been so unfortunate as to offend her was impossible to put the question in writing with the needful nicety of expression proved on trying the experiment to be a task beyond his literary reach after a turn or two up and down the room with his pen in his mouth he decided on the more diplomatic course which happened in this case to be the easiest course too of writing to miss milroy as cordially as if nothing had happened and of testing his position in her good graces by the answer that she sent him back an invitation of some kind including her father of course but addressed directly to herself was plainly the right thing to oblige her to send a written reply but here the difficulty occurred of what the invitation was to be a ball was not to be thought of in his present position with the resident gentry a dinnerparty with no indispensable elderly lady on the premises to receive miss milroyexcept mrs gripper who could only receive her in the kitchenwas equally out of the question what was the invitation to be never backward when he wanted help in asking for it right and left in every available direction allan feeling himself at the end of his own resources coolly rang the bell and astonished the servant who answered it by inquiring how the late family at thorpe ambrose used to amuse themselves and what sort of invitations they were in the habit of sending to their friends  the family did what the rest of the gentry did sir said the man staring at his master in utter bewilderment they gave dinnerparties and balls and in fine summer weather sir like this they sometimes had lawnparties and picnics  thatll do shouted allan a picnics just the thing to please her richard youre an invaluable man you may go downstairs again  richard retired wondering and richards master seized his ready pen   dear miss milroysince i left you it has suddenly struck me that we might have a picnic a little change and amusement what i should call a good shakingup if i wasnt writing to a young lady is just the thing for you after being so long indoors lately in mrs milroys room a picnic is a change and when the wine is good amusement too will you ask the major if he will consent to the picnic and come and if you have got any friends in the neighborhood who like a picnic pray ask them too for i have got none it shall be your picnic but i will provide everything and take everybody you shall choose the day and we will picnic where you like i have set my heart on this picnic  believe me ever yours  allan armadale   on reading over his composition before sealing it up allan frankly acknowledged to himself this time that it was not quite faultless picnic comes in a little too often he said never mind if she likes the idea she wont quarrel with that he sent off the letter on the spot with strict instructions to the messenger to wait for a reply  in half an hour the answer came back on scented paper without an erasure anywhere fragrant to smell and beautiful to see  the presentation of the naked truth is one of those exhibitions from which the native delicacy of the female mind seems instinctively to revolt never were the tables turned more completely than they were now turned on allan by his fair correspondent machiavelli himself would never have suspected from miss milroys letter how heartily she had repented her petulance to the young squire as soon as his back was turned and how extravagantly delighted she was when his invitation was placed in her hands her letter was the composition of a model young lady whose emotions are all kept under parental lock and key and served out for her judiciously as occasion may require papa appeared quite as frequently in miss milroys reply as picnic had appeared in allans invitation papa had been as considerately kind as mr armadale in wishing to procure her a little change and amusement and had offered to forego his usual quiet habits and join the picnic with papas sanction therefore she accepted with much pleasure mr armadales proposal and at papas suggestion she would presume on mr armadales kindness to add two friends of theirs recently settled at thorpe ambrose to the picnic partya widow lady and her son the latter in holy orders and in delicate health if tuesday next would suit mr armadale tuesday next would suit papabeing the first day he could spare from repairs which were required by his clock the rest by papas advice she would beg to leave entirely in mr armadales hands and in the meantime she would remain with papas compliments mr armadales trulyeleanor milroy  who would ever have supposed that the writer of that letter had jumped for joy when allans invitation arrived who would ever have suspected that there was an entry already in miss milroys diary under that days date to this effect the sweetest dearest letter from iknowwho ill never behave unkindly to him again as long as i live as for allan he was charmed with the sweet success of his maneuver miss milroy had accepted his invitation consequently miss milroy was not offended with him it was on the tip of his tongue to mention the correspondence to his friend when they met at dinner but there was something in midwinters face and manner even plain enough for allan to see which warned him to wait a little before he said anything to revive the painful subject of their visit to the cottage by common consent they both avoided all topics connected with thorpe ambrose not even the visit from mr bashwood which was to come with the evening being referred to by either of them all through the dinner they drifted further and further back into the old endless talk of past times about ships and sailing when the butler withdrew from his attendance at table he came downstairs with a nautical problem on his mind and asked his fellowservants if they any of them knew the relative merits on a wind and off a wind of a schooner and a brig  the two young men had sat longer at table than usual that day when they went out into the garden with their cigars the summer twilight fell gray and dim on lawn and flower bed and narrowed round them by slow degrees the softly fading circle of the distant view the dew was heavy and after a few minutes in the garden they agreed to go back to the drier ground on the drive in front of the house  they were close to the turning which led into the shrubbery when there suddenly glided out on them from behind the foliage a softly stepping black figurea shadow moving darkly through the dim evening light midwinter started back at the sight of it and even the less finely strung nerves of his friend were shaken for the moment  who the devil are you cried allan  the figure bared its head in the gray light and came slowly a step nearer midwinter advanced a step on his side and looked closer it was the man of the timid manners and the mourning garments of whom he had asked the way to thorpe ambrose where the three roads met  who are you repeated allan  i humbly beg your pardon sir faltered the stranger stepping back again confusedly the servants told me i should find mr armadale  what are you mr bashwood  yes if you please sir  i beg your pardon for speaking to you so roughly said allan but the fact is you rather startled me my name is armadale put on your hat pray and this is my friend mr midwinter who wants your help in the stewards office  we hardly stand in need of an introduction said midwinter i met mr bashwood out walking a few days since and he was kind enough to direct me when i had lost my way  put on your hat reiterated allan as mr bashwood still bareheaded stood bowing speechlessly now to one of the young men and now to the other my good sir put on your hat and let me show you the way back to the house excuse me for noticing it added allan as the man in sheer nervous helplessness let his hat fall instead of putting it back on his head but you seem a little out of sorts a glass of good wine will do you no harm before you and my friend come to business whereabouts did you meet with mr bashwood midwinter when you lost your way  i am too ignorant of the neighborhood to know i must refer you to mr bashwood  come tell us where it was said allan trying a little too abruptly to set the man at his ease as they all three walked back to the house  the measure of mr bashwoods constitutional timidity seemed to be filled to the brim by the loudness of allans voice and the bluntness of allans request he ran over in the same feeble flow of words with which he had deluged midwinter on the occasion when they first met  it was on the road sir he began addressing himself alternately to allan whom he called sir and to midwinter whom he called by his name i mean if you please on the road to little gill beck a singular name mr midwinter and a singular place i dont mean the village i mean the neighborhoodi mean the broads beyond the neighborhood perhaps you may have heard of the norfolk broads sir what they call lakes in other parts of england they call broads here the broads are quite numerous i think they would repay a visit you would have seen the first of them mr midwinter if you had walked on a few miles from where i had the honor of meeting you remarkably numerous the broads sirsituated between this and the sea about three miles from the sea mr midwinterabout three miles mostly shallow sir with rivers running between them beautiful solitary quite a watery country mr midwinter quite separate as it were in itself parties sometimes visit them sirpleasure parties in boats its quite a little network of lakes or perhapsyes perhaps more correctly pools there is good sport in the cold weather the wild fowl are quite numerous yes the broads would repay a visit mr midwinter the next time you are walking that way the distance from here to little gill beck and then from little gill beck to girdler broad which is the first you come to is altogether not more in sheer nervous inability to leave off he would apparently have gone on talking of the norfolk broads for the rest of the evening if one of his two listeners had not unceremoniously cut him short before he could find his way into a new sentence  are the broads within an easy days drive there and back from this house asked allan feeling if they were that the place for the picnic was discovered already  oh yes sir a nice drivequite a nice easy drive from this beautiful place  they were by this time ascending the portico steps allan leading the way up and calling to midwinter and mr bashwood to follow him into the library where there was a lighted lamp  in the interval which elapsed before the wine made its appearance midwinter looked at his chance acquaintance of the highroad with strangely mingled feelings of compassion and distrustof compassion that strengthened in spite of him of distrust that persisted in diminishing try as he might to encourage it to grow there perched comfortless on the edge of his chair sat the poor brokendown nervous wretch in his worn black garments with his watery eyes his honest old outspoken wig his miserable mohair stock and his false teeth that were incapable of deceiving anybodythere he sat politely ill at ease now shrinking in the glare of the lamp now wincing under the shock of allans sturdy voice a man with the wrinkles of sixty years in his face and the manners of a child in the presence of strangers an object of pity surely if ever there was a pitiable object yet  whatever else youre afraid of mr bashwood cried allan pouring out a glass of wine dont be afraid of that there isnt a headache in a hogshead of it make yourself comfortable ill leave you and mr midwinter to talk your business over by yourselves its all in mr midwinters hands he acts for me and settles everything at his own discretion  he said those words with a cautious choice of expression very uncharacteristic of him and without further explanation made abruptly for the door midwinter sitting near it noticed his face as he went out easy as the way was into allans favor mr bashwood beyond all kind of doubt had in some unaccountable manner failed to find it  the two strangely assorted companions were left togetherparted widely as it seemed on the surface from any possible interchange of sympathy drawn invisibly one to the other nevertheless by those magnetic similarities of temperament which overleap all difference of age or station and defy all apparent incongruities of mind and character from the moment when allan left the room the hidden influence that works in darkness began slowly to draw the two men together across the great social desert which had lain between them up to this day  midwinter was the first to approach the subject of the interview  may i ask he began if you have been made acquainted with my position here and if you know why it is that i require your assistance  mr bashwoodstill hesitating and still timid but manifestly relieved by allans departuresat further back in his chair and ventured on fortifying himself with a modest little sip of wine  yes sir he replied mr pedgift informed me of allat least i think i may say soof all the circumstances i am to instruct or perhaps i ought to say to advise  no mr bashwood the first word was the best word of the two i am quite ignorant of the duties which mr armadales kindness has induced him to intrust to me if i understand right there can be no question of your capacity to instruct me for you once filled a stewards situation yourself may i inquire where it was  at sir john mellowships sir in west norfolk perhaps you would likei have got it with meto see my testimonial sir john might have dealt more kindly with me but i have no complaint to make its all done and over now his watery eyes looked more watery still and the trembling in his hands spread to his lips as he produced an old dingy letter from his pocketbook and laid it open on the table  the testimonial was very briefly and very coldly expressed but it was conclusive as far as it went sir john considered it only right to say that he had no complaint to make of any want of capacity or integrity in his steward if mr bashwoods domestic position had been compatible with the continued performance of his duties on the estate sir john would have been glad to keep him as it was embarrassments caused by the state of mr bashwoods personal affairs had rendered it undesirable that he should continue in sir johns service and on that ground and that only his employer and he had parted such was sir johns testimony to mr bashwoods character as midwinter read the last lines he thought of another testimonial still in his own possessionof the written character which they had given him at the school when they turned their sick usher adrift in the world his superstition distrusting all new events and all new faces at thorpe ambrose still doubted the man before him as obstinately as ever but when he now tried to put those doubts into words his heart upbraided him and he laid the letter on the table in silence  the sudden pause in the conversation appeared to startle mr bashwood he comforted himself with another little sip of wine and leaving the letter untouched burst irrepressibly into words as if the silence was quite unendurable to him  i am ready to answer any question sir he began mr pedgift told me that i must answer questions because i was applying for a place of trust mr pedgift said neither you nor mr armadale was likely to think the testimonial sufficient of itself sir john doesnt sayhe might have put it more kindly but i dont complainsir john doesnt say what the troubles were that lost me my place perhaps you might wish to know he stopped confusedly looked at the testimonial and said no more  if no interests but mine were concerned in the matter rejoined midwinter the testimonial would i assure you be quite enough to satisfy me but while i am learning my new duties the person who teaches me will be really and truly the steward of my friends estate i am very unwilling to ask you to speak on what may be a painful subject and i am sadly inexperienced in putting such questions as i ought to put but perhaps in mr armadales interests i ought to know something more either from yourself or from mr pedgift if you prefer it he too stopped confusedly looked at the testimonial and said no more  there was another moment of silence the night was warm and mr bashwood among his other misfortunes had the deplorable infirmity of perspiring in the palms of the hands he took out a miserable little cotton pockethandkerchief rolled it up into a ball and softly dabbed it to and fro from one hand to the other with the regularity of a pendulum performed by other men under other circumstances the action might have been ridiculous performed by this man at the crisis of the interview the action was horrible  mr pedgifts time is too valuable sir to be wasted on me he said i will mention what ought to be mentioned myselfif you will please to allow me i have been unfortunate in my family it is very hard to bear though it seems not much to tell my wife one of his hands closed fast on the pockethandkerchief he moistened his dry lips struggled with himself and went on  my wife sir he resumed stood a little in my way she did me i am afraid i must confess some injury with sir john soon after i got the stewards situation she contractedshe tookshe fell into habits i hardly know how to say it of drinking i couldnt break her of it and i couldnt always conceal it from sir johns knowledge she broke out andand tried his patience once or twice when he came to my office on business sir john excused it not very kindly but still he excused it i dont complain of sir john i dont complain now of my wife he pointed a trembling finger at his miserable crapecovered beaver hat on the floor im in mourning for her he said faintly she died nearly a year ago in the county asylum here  his mouth began to work convulsively he took up the glass of wine at his side and instead of sipping it this time drained it to the bottom im not much used to wine sir he said conscious apparently of the flush that flew into his face as he drank and still observant of the obligations of politeness amid all the misery of the recollections that he was calling up  i beg mr bashwood you will not distress yourself by telling me any more said midwinter recoiling from any further sanction on his part of a disclosure which had already bared the sorrows of the unhappy man before him to the quick  im much obliged to you sir replied mr bashwood but if i dont detain you too long and if you will please to remember that mr pedgifts directions to me were very particularand besides i only mentioned my late wife because if she hadnt tried sir johns patience to begin with things might have turned out differently he paused gave up the disjointed sentence in which he had involved himself and tried another i had only two children sir he went on advancing to a new point in his narrative a boy and a girl the girl died when she was a baby my son lived to grow up and it was my son who lost me my place i did my best for him i got him into a respectable office in london they wouldnt take him without security im afraid it was imprudent but i had no rich friends to help me and i became security my boy turned out badly sir heperhaps you will kindly understand what i mean if i say he behaved dishonestly his employers consented at my entreaty to let him off without prosecuting i begged very hardi was fond of my son jamesand i took him home and did my best to reform him he wouldnt stay with me he went away again to london hei beg your pardon sir im afraid im confusing things im afraid im wandering from the point  no no said midwinter kindly if you think it right to tell me this sad story tell it in your own way have you seen your son since he left you to go to london  no sir hes in london still for all i know when i last heard of him he was getting his breadnot very creditably he was employed under the inspector at the private inquiry office in shadyside place  he spoke those wordsapparently as events then stood the most irrelevant to the matter in hand that had yet escaped him actually as events were soon to be the most vitally important that he had uttered yethe spoke those words absently looking about him in confusion and trying vainly to recover the lost thread of his narrative  midwinter compassionately helped him you were telling me he said that your son had been the cause of your losing your place how did that happen  in this way sir said mr bashwood getting back again excitedly into the right train of thought his employers consented to let him off but they came down on his security and i was the man i suppose they were not to blame the security covered their loss i couldnt pay it all out of my savings i had to borrowon the word of a man sir i couldnt help iti had to borrow my creditor pressed me it seemed cruel but if he wanted the money i suppose it was only just i was sold out of house and home i dare say other gentlemen would have said what sir john said i dare say most people would have refused to keep a steward who had had the bailiffs after him and his furniture sold in the neighborhood that was how it ended mr midwinter i neednt detain you any longerhere is sir johns address if you wish to apply to him midwinter generously refused to receive the address  thank you kindly sir said mr bashwood getting tremulously on his legs there is nothing more i think exceptexcept that mr pedgift will speak for me if you wish to inquire into my conduct in his service im very much indebted to mr pedgift hes a little rough with me sometimes but if he hadnt taken me into his office i think i should have gone to the workhouse when i left sir john i was so broken down he picked up his dingy old hat from the floor i wont intrude any longer sir i shall be happy to call again if you wish to have time to consider before you decide  i want no time to consider after what you have told me replied midwinter warmly his memory busy while he spoke with the time when he had told his story to mr brock and was waiting for a generous word in return as the man before him was waiting now today is saturday he went on can you come and give me my first lesson on monday morning i beg your pardon he added interrupting mr bashwoods profuse expressions of acknowledgment and stopping him on his way out of the room there is one thing we ought to settle ought we not we havent spoken yet about your own interest in this matter i mean about the terms he referred a little confusedly to the pecuniary part of the subject mr bashwood getting nearer and nearer to the door answered him more confusedly still  anything siranything you think right i wont intrude any longer ill leave it to you and mr armadale  i will send for mr armadale if you like said midwinter following him into the hall but i am afraid he has as little experience in matters of this kind as i have perhaps if you see no objection we might be guided by mr pedgift  mr bashwood caught eagerly at the last suggestion pushing his retreat while he spoke as far as the front door yes siroh yes yes nobody better than mr pedgift dontpray dont disturb mr armadale his watery eyes looked quite wild with nervous alarm as he turned round for a moment in the light of the hall lamp to make that polite request if sending for allan had been equivalent to unchaining a ferocious watchdog mr bashwood could hardly have been more anxious to stop the proceeding i wish you kindly goodevening sir he went on getting out to the steps im much obliged to you i will be scrupulously punctual on monday morningi hopei thinkim sure you will soon learn everything i can teach you its not difficultoh dear nonot difficult at all i wish you kindly goodevening sir a beautiful night yes indeed a beautiful night for a walk home  with those words all dropping out of his lips one on the top of the other and without noticing in his agony of embarrassment at effecting his departure midwinters outstretched hand he went noiselessly down the steps and was lost in the darkness of the night  as midwinter turned to reenter the house the diningroom door opened and his friend met him in the hall  has mr bashwood gone asked allan  he has gone replied midwinter after telling me a very sad story and leaving me a little ashamed of myself for having doubted him without any just cause i have arranged that he is to give me my first lesson in the stewards office on monday morning  all right said allan you neednt be afraid old boy of my interrupting you over your studies i dare say im wrongbut i dont like mr bashwood  i dare say im wrong retorted the other a little petulantly i do   the sunday morning found midwinter in the park waiting to intercept the postman on the chance of his bringing more news from mr brock  at the customary hour the man made his appearance and placed the expected letter in midwinters hands he opened it far away from all fear of observation this time and read these lines   my dear midwinteri write more for the purpose of quieting your anxiety than because i have anything definite to say in my last hurried letter i had no time to tell you that the elder of the two women whom i met in the gardens had followed me and spoken to me in the street i believe i may characterize what she said without doing her any injustice as a tissue of falsehoods from beginning to end at any rate she confirmed me in the suspicion that some underhand proceeding is on foot of which allan is destined to be the victim and that the prime mover in the conspiracy is the vile woman who helped his mothers marriage and who hastened his mothers death  feeling this conviction i have not hesitated to do for allans sake what i would have done for no other creature in the world i have left my hotel and have installed myself with my old servant robert in a house opposite the house to which i traced the two women we are alternately on the watch quite unsuspected i am certain by the people opposite day and night all my feelings as a gentleman and a clergyman revolt from such an occupation as i am now engaged in but there is no other choice i must either do this violence to my own selfrespect or i must leave allan with his easy nature and in his assailable position to defend himself against a wretch who is prepared i firmly believe to take the most unscrupulous advantage of his weakness and his youth his mothers dying entreaty has never left my memory and god help me i am now degrading myself in my own eyes in consequence  there has been some reward already for the sacrifice this day saturday i have gained an immense advantagei have at last seen the womans face she went out with her veil down as before and robert kept her in view having my instructions if she returned to the house not to follow her back to the door she did return to the house and the result of my precaution was as i had expected to throw her off her guard i saw her face unveiled at the window and afterward again in the balcony if any occasion should arise for describing her particularly you shall have the description at present i need only say that she looks the full age fiveandthirty at which you estimated her and that she is by no means so handsome a woman as i had i hardly know why expected to see  this is all i can now tell you if nothing more happens by monday or tuesday next i shall have no choice but to apply to my lawyers for assistance though i am most unwilling to trust this delicate and dangerous matter in other hands than mine setting my own feelings however out of the question the business which has been the cause of my journey to london is too important to be trifled with much longer as i am trifling with it now in any and every case depend on my keeping you informed of the progress of events and believe me yours truly  decimus brock   midwinter secured the letter as he had secured the letter that preceded itside by side in his pocketbook with the narrative of allans dream  how many days more he asked himself as he went back to the house how many days more  not many the time he was waiting for was a time close at hand   monday came and brought mr bashwood punctual to the appointed hour monday came and found allan immersed in his preparations for the picnic he held a series of interviews at home and abroad all through the day he transacted business with mrs gripper with the butler and with the coachman in their three several departments of eating drinking and driving he went to the town to consult his professional advisers on the subject of the broads and to invite both the lawyers father and son in the absence of anybody else in the neighborhood whom he could ask to join the picnic pedgift senior in his department supplied general information but begged to be excused from appearing at the picnic on the score of business engagements pedgift junior in his department added all the details and casting business engagements to the winds accepted the invitation with the greatest pleasure returning from the lawyers office allans next proceeding was to go to the majors cottage and obtain miss milroys approval of the proposed locality for the pleasure party this object accomplished he returned to his own house to meet the last difficulty now left to encounterthe difficulty of persuading midwinter to join the expedition to the broads  on first broaching the subject allan found his friend impenetrably resolute to remain at home midwinters natural reluctance to meet the major and his daughter after what had happened at the cottage might probably have been overcome but midwinters determination not to allow mr bashwoods course of instruction to be interrupted was proof against every effort that could be made to shake it after exerting his influence to the utmost allan was obliged to remain contented with a compromise midwinter promised not very willingly to join the party toward evening at the place appointed for a gypsy teamaking which was to close the proceedings of the day to this extent he would consent to take the opportunity of placing himself on a friendly footing with the milroys more he could not concede even to allans persuasion and for more it would be useless to ask  the day of the picnic came the lovely morning and the cheerful bustle of preparation for the expedition failed entirely to tempt midwinter into altering his resolution at the regular hour he left the breakfasttable to join mr bashwood in the stewards office the two were quietly closeted over the books at the back of the house while the packing for the picnic went on in front young pedgift short in stature smart in costume and selfreliant in manner arrived some little time before the hour for starting to revise all the arrangements and to make any final improvements which his local knowledge might suggest allan and he were still busy in consultation when the first hitch occurred in the proceedings the womanservant from the cottage was reported to be waiting below for an answer to a note from her young mistress which was placed in allans hands  on this occasion miss milroys emotions had apparently got the better of her sense of propriety the tone of the letter was feverish and the handwriting wandered crookedly up and down in deplorable freedom from all proper restraint  oh mr armadale wrote the majors daughter such a misfortune what are we to do papa has got a letter from grandmamma this morning about the new governess her reference has answered all the questions and shes ready to come at the shortest notice grandmamma thinks how provoking the sooner the better and she says we may expect heri mean the governesseither today or tomorrow papa says he will be so absurdly considerate to everybody that we cant allow miss gwilt to come here if she comes today and find nobody at home to receive her what is to be done i am ready to cry with vexation i have got the worst possible impression though grandmamma says she is a charming person of miss gwilt can you suggest something dear mr armadale im sure papa would give way if you could dont stop to write send me a message back i have got a new hat for the picnic and oh the agony of not knowing whether i am to keep it on or take it off yours truly e m  the devil take miss gwilt said allan staring at his legal adviser in a state of helpless consternation  with all my heart siri dont wish to interfere remarked pedgift junior may i ask whats the matter  allan told him mr pedgift the younger might have his faults but a want of quickness of resource was not among them  theres a way out of the difficulty mr armadale he said if the governess comes today lets have her at the picnic  allans eyes opened wide in astonishment  all the horses and carriages in the thorpe ambrose stables are not wanted for this small party of ours proceeded pedgift junior of course not very good if miss gwilt comes today she cant possibly get here before five oclock good again you order an open carriage to be waiting at the majors door at that time mr armadale and ill give the man his directions where to drive to when the governess comes to the cottage let her find a nice little note of apology along with the cold fowl or whatever else they give her after her journey begging her to join us at the picnic and putting a carriage at her own sole disposal to take her there gad sir said young pedgift gayly she must be a touchy one if she thinks herself neglected after that  capital cried allan she shall have every attention ill give her the ponychaise and the white harness and she shall drive herself if she likes  he scribbled a line to relieve miss milroys apprehensions and gave the necessary orders for the ponychaise ten minutes later the carriages for the pleasure party were at the door  now weve taken all this trouble about her said allan reverting to the governess as they left the house i wonder if she does come today whether we shall see her at the picnic  depends entirely on her age sir remarked young pedgift pronouncing judgment with the happy confidence in himself which eminently distinguished him if shes an old one shell be knocked up with the journey and shell stick to the cold fowl and the cottage if shes a young one either i know nothing of women or the pony in the white harness will bring her to the picnic  they started for the majors cottage     viii the norfolk broads  the little group gathered together in major milroys parlor to wait for the carriages from thorpe ambrose would hardly have conveyed the idea to any previously uninstructed person introduced among them of a party assembled in expectation of a picnic they were almost dull enough as far as outward appearances went to have been a party assembled in expectation of a marriage  even miss milroy herself though conscious of looking her best in her bright muslin dress and her gayly feathered new hat was at this inauspicious moment miss milroy under a cloud although allans note had assured her in allans strongest language that the one great object of reconciling the governesss arrival with the celebration of the picnic was an object achieved the doubt still remained whether the plan proposedwhatever it might bewould meet with her fathers approval in a word miss milroy declined to feel sure of her days pleasure until the carriage made its appearance and took her from the door the major on his side arrayed for the festive occasion in a tight blue frockcoat which he had not worn for years and threatened with a whole long day of separation from his old friend and comrade the clock was a man out of his element if ever such a man existed yet as for the friends who had been asked at allans requestthe widow lady otherwise mrs pentecost and her son the reverend samuel in delicate healthtwo people less capable apparently of adding to the hilarity of the day could hardly have been discovered in the length and breadth of all england a young man who plays his part in society by looking on in green spectacles and listening with a sickly smile may be a prodigy of intellect and a mine of virtue but he is hardly perhaps the right sort of man to have at a picnic an old lady afflicted with deafness whose one inexhaustible subject of interest is the subject of her son and who on the happily rare occasions when that son opens his lips asks everybody eagerly what does my boy say is a person to be pitied in respect of her infirmities and a person to be admired in respect of her maternal devotedness but not a person if the thing could possibly be avoided to take to a picnic such a man nevertheless was the reverend samuel pentecost and such a woman was the reverend samuels mother and in the dearth of any other producible guests there they were engaged to eat drink and be merry for the day at mr armadales pleasure party to the norfolk broads  the arrival of allan with his faithful follower pedgift junior at his heels roused the flagging spirits of the party at the cottage the plan for enabling the governess to join the picnic if she arrived that day satisfied even major milroys anxiety to show all proper attention to the lady who was coming into his house after writing the necessary note of apology and invitation and addressing it in her very best handwriting to the new governess miss milroy ran upstairs to say goodby to her mother and returned with a smiling face and a side look of relief directed at her father to announce that there was nothing now to keep any of them a moment longer indoors the company at once directed their steps to the garden gate and were there met face to face by the second great difficulty of the day how were the six persons of the picnic to be divided between the two open carriages that were in waiting for them  here again pedgift junior exhibited his invaluable faculty of contrivance this highly cultivated young man possessed in an eminent degree an accomplishment more or less peculiar to all the young men of the age we live in he was perfectly capable of taking his pleasure without forgetting his business such a client as the master of thorpe ambrose fell but seldom in his fathers way and to pay special but unobtrusive attention to allan all through the day was the business of which young pedgift while proving himself to be the life and soul of the picnic never once lost sight from the beginning of the merrymaking to the end he had detected the state of affairs between miss milroy and allan at glance and he at once provided for his clients inclinations in that quarter by offering in virtue of his local knowledge to lead the way in the first carriage and by asking major milroy and the curate if they would do him the honor of accompanying him  we shall pass a very interesting place to a military man sir said young pedgift addressing the major with his happy and unblushing confidencethe remains of a roman encampment and my father sir who is a subscriber proceeded this rising lawyer turning to the curate wished me to ask your opinion of the new infant school buildings at little gill beck would you kindly give it me as we go along he opened the carriage door and helped in the major and the curate before they could either of them start any difficulties the necessary result followed allan and miss milroy rode together in the same carriage with the extra convenience of a deaf old lady in attendance to keep the squires compliments within the necessary limits  never yet had allan enjoyed such an interview with miss milroy as the interview he now obtained on the road to the broads  the dear old lady after a little anecdote or two on the subject of her son did the one thing wanting to secure the perfect felicity of her two youthful companions she became considerately blind for the occasion as well as deaf a quarter of an hour after the carriage left the majors cottage the poor old soul reposing on snug cushions and fanned by a fine summer air fell peaceably asleep allan made love and miss milroy sanctioned the manufacture of that occasionally precious article of human commerce sublimely indifferent on both sides to a solemn bass accompaniment on two notes played by the curates mothers unsuspecting nose the only interruption to the lovemaking the snoring being a thing more grave and permanent in its nature was not interrupted at all came at intervals from the carriage ahead not satisfied with having the majors roman encampment and the curates infant schools on his mind pedgift junior rose erect from time to time in his place and respectfully hailing the hindmost vehicle directed allans attention in a shrill tenor voice and with an excellent choice of language to objects of interest on the road the only way to quiet him was to answer which allan invariably did by shouting back yes beautiful upon which young pedgift disappeared again in the recesses of the leading carriage and took up the romans and the infants where he had left them last  the scene through which the picnic party was now passing merited far more attention than it received either from allan or allans friends   an hours steady driving from the majors cottage had taken young armadale and his guests beyond the limits of midwinters solitary walk and was now bringing them nearer and nearer to one of the strangest and loveliest aspects of nature which the inland landscape not of norfolk only but of all england can show little by little the face of the country began to change as the carriages approached the remote and lonely district of the broads the wheat fields and turnip fields became perceptibly fewer and the fat green grazing grounds on either side grew wider and wider in their smooth and sweeping range heaps of dry rushes and reeds laid up for the basketmaker and the thatcher began to appear at the roadside the old gabled cottages of the early part of the drive dwindled and disappeared and huts with mud walls rose in their place with the ancient church towers and the wind and water mills which had hitherto been the only lofty objects seen over the low marshy flat there now rose all round the horizon gliding slow and distant behind fringes of pollard willows the sails of invisible boats moving on invisible waters all the strange and startling anomalies presented by an inland agricultural district isolated from other districts by its intricate surrounding network of pools and streamsholding its communications and carrying its produce by water instead of by landbegan to present themselves in closer and closer succession nets appeared on cottage pailings little flatbottomed boats lay strangely at rest among the flowers in cottage gardens farmers men passed to and fro clad in composite costume of the coast and the field in sailors hats and fishermens boots and plowmens smocks and even yet the lowlying labyrinth of waters embosomed in its mystery of solitude was a hidden labyrinth still a minute more and the carriages took a sudden turn from the hard highroad into a little weedy lane the wheels ran noiseless on the damp and spongy ground a lonely outlying cottage appeared with its litter of nets and boats a few yards further on and the last morsel of firm earth suddenly ended in a tiny creek and quay one turn more to the end of the quayand there spreading its great sheet of water far and bright and smooth on the right hand and the leftthere as pure in its spotless blue as still in its heavenly peacefulness as the summer sky above it was the first of the norfolk broads  the carriages stopped the lovemaking broke off and the venerable mrs pentecost recovering the use of her senses at a moments notice fixed her eyes sternly on allan the instant she woke  i see in your face mr armadale said the old lady sharply that you think i have been asleep  the consciousness of guilt acts differently on the two sexes in nine cases out of ten it is a much more manageable consciousness with a woman than with a man all the confusion on this occasion was on the mans side while allan reddened and looked embarrassed the quickwitted miss milroy instantly embraced the old lady with a burst of innocent laughter he is quite incapable dear mrs pentecost said the little hypocrite of anything so ridiculous as thinking you have been asleep  all i wish mr armadale to know pursued the old lady still suspicious of allan is that my head being giddy i am obliged to close my eyes in a carriage closing the eyes mr armadale is one thing and going to sleep is another where is my son  the reverend samuel appeared silently at the carriage door and assisted his mother to get out did you enjoy the drive sammy asked the old lady beautiful scenery my dear wasnt it young pedgift on whom the arrangements for exploring the broads devolved hustled about giving his orders to the boatman major milroy placid and patient sat apart on an overturned punt and privately looked at his watch was it past noon already more than an hour past for the first time for many a long year the famous clock at home had struck in an empty workshop time had lifted his wonderful scythe and the corporal and his men had relieved guard with no masters eye to watch their performances with no masters hand to encourage them to do their best the major sighed as he put his watch back in his pocket im afraid im too old for this sort of thing thought the good man looking about him dreamily i dont find i enjoy it as much as i thought i should when are we going on the water i wonder wheres neelie  neeliemore properly miss milroywas behind one of the carriages with the promoter of the picnic they were immersed in the interesting subject of their own christian names and allan was as near a pointblank proposal of marriage as it is well possible for a thoughtless young gentleman of twoandtwenty to be  tell me the truth said miss milroy with her eyes modestly riveted on the ground when you first knew what my name was you didnt like it did you  i like everything that belongs to you rejoined allan vigorously i think eleanor is a beautiful name and yet i dont know why i think the major made an improvement when he changed it to neelie  i can tell you why mr armadale said the majors daughter with great gravity there are some unfortunate people in this world whose names arehow can i express itwhose names are misfits mine is a misfit i dont blame my parents for of course it was impossible to know when i was a baby how i should grow up but as things are i and my name dont fit each other when you hear a young lady called eleanor you think of a tall beautiful interesting creature directlythe very opposite of me with my personal appearance eleanor sounds ridiculous and neelie as you yourself remarked is just the thing no no dont say any more im tired of the subject ive got another name in my head if we must speak of names which is much better worth talking about than mine  she stole a glance at her companion which said plainly enough the name is yours allan advanced a step nearer to her and lowered his voice without the slightest necessity to a mysterious whisper miss milroy instantly resumed her investigation of the ground she looked at it with such extraordinary interest that a geologist might have suspected her of scientific flirtation with the superficial strata  what name are you thinking of asked allan  miss milroy addressed her answer in the form of a remark to the superficial strataand let them do what they liked with it in their capacity of conductors of sound if i had been a man she said i should so like to have been called allan  she felt his eyes on her as she spoke and turning her head aside became absorbed in the graining of the panel at the back of the carriage how beautiful it is she exclaimed with a sudden outburst of interest in the vast subject of varnish i wonder how they do it  man persists and woman yields allan declined to shift the ground from lovemaking to coachmaking miss milroy dropped the subject  call me by my name if you really like it he whispered persuasively call me allan for once just to try  she hesitated with a heightened color and a charming smile and shook her head i couldnt just yet she answered softly  may i call you neelie is it too soon  she looked at him again with a sudden disturbance about the bosom of her dress and a sudden flash of tenderness in her darkgray eyes  you know best she said faintly in a whisper  the inevitable answer was on the tip of allans tongue at the very instant however when he opened his lips the abhorrent high tenor of pedgift junior shouting for mr armadale rang cheerfully through the quiet air at the same moment from the other side of the carriage the lurid spectacles of the reverend samuel showed themselves officiously on the search and the voice of the reverend samuels mother who had with great dexterity put the two ideas of the presence of water and a sudden movement among the company together inquired distractedly if anybody was drowned sentiment flies and love shudders at all demonstrations of the noisy kind allan said damn it and rejoined young pedgift miss milroy sighed and took refuge with her father  ive done it mr armadale cried young pedgift greeting his patron gayly we can all go on the water together ive got the biggest boat on the broads the little skiffs he added in a lower tone as he led the way to the quay steps besides being ticklish and easily upset wont hold more than two with the boatman and the major told me he should feel it his duty to go with his daughter if we all separated in different boats i thought that would hardly do sir pursued pedgift junior with a respectfully sly emphasis on the words and besides if we had put the old lady into a skiff with her weight sixteen stone if shes a pound we might have had her upside down in the water half her time which would have occasioned delay and thrown what you call a damp on the proceedings heres the boat mr armadale what do you think of it  the boat added one more to the strangely anomalous objects which appeared at the broads it was nothing less than a stout old lifeboat passing its last declining years on the smooth fresh water after the stormy days of its youth time on the wild salt sea a comfortable little cabin for the use of fowlers in the winter season had been built amidships and a mast and sail adapted for inland navigation had been fitted forward there was room enough and to spare for the guests the dinner and the three men in charge allan clapped his faithful lieutenant approvingly on the shoulder and even mrs pentecost when the whole party were comfortably established on board took a comparatively cheerful view of the prospects of the picnic if anything happens said the old lady addressing the company generally theres one comfort for all of us my son can swim  the boat floated out from the creek into the placid waters of the broad and the full beauty of the scene opened on the view  on the northward and westward as the boat reached the middle of the lake the shore lay clear and low in the sunshine fringed darkly at certain points by rows of dwarf trees and dotted here and there in the opener spaces with windmills and reedthatched cottages of puddled mud southward the great sheet of water narrowed gradually to a little group of closenestling islands which closed the prospect while to the east a long gently undulating line of reeds followed the windings of the broad and shut out all view of the watery wastes beyond so clear and so light was the summer air that the one cloud in the eastern quarter of the heaven was the smoke cloud left by a passing steamer three miles distant and more on the invisible sea when the voices of the pleasure party were still not a sound rose far or near but the faint ripple at the bows as the men with slow deliberate strokes of their long poles pressed the boat forward softly over the shallow water the world and the worlds turmoil seemed left behind forever on the land the silence was the silence of enchantmentthe delicious interflow of the soft purity of the sky and the bright tranquillity of the lake  established in perfect comfort in the boatthe major and his daughter on one side the curate and his mother on the other and allan and young pedgift between the twothe water party floated smoothly toward the little nest of islands at the end of the broad miss milroy was in raptures allan was delighted and the major for once forgot his clock every one felt pleasurably in their different ways the quiet and beauty of the scene mrs pentecost in her way felt it like a clairvoyantwith closed eyes  look behind you mr armadale whispered young pedgift i think the parsons beginning to enjoy himself  an unwonted brisknessportentous apparently of coming speechdid certainly at that moment enliven the curates manner he jerked his head from side to side like a bird he cleared his throat and clasped his hands and looked with a gentle interest at the company getting into spirits seemed in the case of this excellent person to be alarmingly like getting into the pulpit  even in this scene of tranquillity said the reverend samuel coming out softly with his first contribution to the society in the shape of a remark the christian mindled so to speak from one extreme to anotheris forcibly recalled to the unstable nature of all earthly enjoyments how if this calm should not last how if the winds rose and the waters became agitated  you neednt alarm yourself about that sir said young pedgift junes the fine season hereand you can swim  mrs pentecost mesmerically affected in all probability by the near neighborhood of her son opened her eyes suddenly and asked with her customary eagerness what does my boy say  the reverend samuel repeated his words in the key that suited his mothers infirmity the old lady nodded in high approval and pursued her sons train of thought through the medium of a quotation  ah sighed mrs pentecost with infinite relish he rides the whirlwind sammy and directs the storm  noble words said the reverend samuel noble and consoling words  i say whispered allan if he goes on much longer in that way whats to be done  i told you papa it was a risk to ask them added miss milroy in another whisper  my dear remonstrated the major we knew nobody else in the neighborhood and as mr armadale kindly suggested our bringing our friends what could we do  we cant upset the boat remarked young pedgift with sardonic gravity its a lifeboat unfortunately may i venture to suggest putting something into the reverend gentlemans mouth mr armadale its close on three oclock what do you say to ringing the dinnerbell sir  never was the right man more entirely in the right place than pedgift junior at the picnic in ten minutes more the boat was brought to a standstill among the reeds the thorpe ambrose hampers were unpacked on the roof of the cabin and the current of the curates eloquence was checked for the day  how inestimably important in its moral resultsand therefore how praiseworthy in itselfis the act of eating and drinking the social virtues center in the stomach a man who is not a better husband father and brother after dinner than before is digestively speaking an incurably vicious man what hidden charms of character disclose themselves what dormant amiabilities awaken when our common humanity gathers together to pour out the gastric juice at the opening of the hampers from thorpe ambrose sweet sociability offspring of the happy union of civilization and mrs gripper exhaled among the boating party and melted in one friendly fusion the discordant elements of which that party had hitherto been composed now did the reverend samuel pentecost whose light had hitherto been hidden under a bushel prove at last that he could do something by proving that he could eat now did pedgift junior shine brighter than ever he had shone yet in gems of caustic humor and exquisite fertilities of resource now did the squire and the squires charming guest prove the triple connection between champagne that sparkles love that grows bolder and eyes whose vocabulary is without the word no now did cheerful old times come back to the majors memory and cheerful old stories not told for years find their way to the majors lips and now did mrs pentecost coming out wakefully in the whole force of her estimable maternal character seize on a supplementary fork and ply that useful instrument incessantly between the choicest morsels in the whole round of dishes and the few vacant places left available on the reverend samuels plate dont laugh at my son cried the old lady observing the merriment which her proceedings produced among the company its my fault poor deari make him eat and there are men in this world who seeing virtues such as these developed at the table as they are developed nowhere else can nevertheless rank the glorious privilege of dining with the smallest of the diurnal personal worries which necessity imposes on mankindwith buttoning your waistcoat for example or lacing your stays trust no such monster as this with your tender secrets your loves and hatreds your hopes and fears his heart is uncorrected by his stomach and the social virtues are not in him  the last mellow hours of the day and the first cool breezes of the long summer evening had met before the dishes were all laid waste and the bottles as empty as bottles should be this point in the proceedings attained the picnic party looked lazily at pedgift junior to know what was to be done next that inexhaustible functionary was equal as ever to all the calls on him he had a new amusement ready before the quickest of the company could so much as ask him what that amusement was to be  fond of music on the water miss milroy he asked in his airiest and pleasantest manner  miss milroy adored music both on the water and the landalways excepting the one case when she was practicing the art herself on the piano at home  well get out of the reeds first said young pedgift he gave his orders to the boatmen dived briskly into the little cabin and reappeared with a concertina in his hand neat miss milroy isnt it he observed pointing to his initials inlaid on the instrument in motherofpearl my names augustus like my fathers some of my friends knock off the a and call me gustus junior a small joke goes a long way among friends doesnt it mr armadale i sing a little to my own accompaniment ladies and gentlemen and if quite agreeable i shall be proud and happy to do my best  stop cried mrs pentecost i dote on music  with this formidable announcement the old lady opened a prodigious leather bag from which she never parted night or day and took out an eartrumpet of the oldfashioned kindsomething between a keybugle and a french horn i dont care to use the thing generally explained mrs pentecost because im afraid of its making me deafer than ever but i cant and wont miss the music i dote on music if youll hold the other end sammy ill stick it in my ear neelie my dear tell him to begin  young pedgift was troubled with no nervous hesitation he began at once not with songs of the light and modern kind such as might have been expected from an amateur of his age and character but with declamatory and patriotic bursts of poetry set to the bold and blatant music which the people of england loved dearly at the earlier part of the present century and which whenever they can get it they love dearly still the death of marmion the battle of the baltic the bay of biscay nelson under various vocal aspects as exhibited by the late brahamthese were the songs in which the roaring concertina and strident tenor of gustus junior exulted together tell me when youre tired ladies and gentlemen said the minstrel solicitor theres no conceit about me will you have a little sentiment by way of variety shall i wind up with the mistletoe bough and poor mary anne  having favored his audience with those two cheerful melodies young pedgift respectfully requested the rest of the company to follow his vocal example in turn offering in every case to play a running accompaniment impromptu if the singer would only be so obliging as to favor him with the keynote  go on somebody cried mrs pentecost eagerly i tell you again i dote on music we havent had half enough yet have we sammy  the reverend samuel made no reply the unhappy man had reasons of his ownnot exactly in his bosom but a little lowerfor remaining silent in the midst of the general hilarity and the general applause alas for humanity even maternal love is alloyed with mortal fallibility owing much already to his excellent mother the reverend samuel was now additionally indebted to her for a smart indigestion  nobody however noticed as yet the signs and tokens of internal revolution in the curates face everybody was occupied in entreating everybody else to sing miss milroy appealed to the founder of the feast do sing something mr armadale she said i should so like to hear you  if you once begin sir added the cheerful pedgift youll find it get uncommonly easy as you go on music is a science which requires to be taken by the throat at starting  with all my heart said allan in his goodhumored way i know lots of tunes but the worst of it is the words escape me i wonder if i can remember one of moores melodies my poor mother used to be fond of teaching me moores melodies when i was a boy  whose melodies asked mrs pentecost moores aha i know tom moore by heart  perhaps in that case you will be good enough to help me maam if my memory breaks down rejoined allan ill take the easiest melody in the whole collection if youll allow me everybody knows iteveleens bower  im familiar in a general sort of way with the national melodies of england scotland and ireland said pedgift junior ill accompany you sir with the greatest pleasure this is the sort of thing i think he seated himself crosslegged on the roof of the cabin and burst into a complicated musical improvisation wonderful to heara mixture of instrumental flourishes and groans a jig corrected by a dirge and a dirge enlivened by a jig thats the sort of thing said young pedgift with his smile of supreme confidence fire away sir  mrs pentecost elevated her trumpet and allan elevated his voice oh weep for the hour when to eveleens bower he stopped the accompaniment stopped the audience waited its a most extraordinary thing said allan i thought i had the next line on the tip of my tongue and it seems to have escaped me ill begin again if you have no objection oh weep for the hour when to eveleens bower  the lord of the valley with false vows came said mrs pentecost  thank you maam said allan now i shall get on smoothly oh weep for the hour when to eveleens bower the lord of the valley with false vows came the moon was shining bright  no said mrs pentecost  i beg your pardon maam remonstrated allan the moon was shining bright  the moon wasnt doing anything of the kind said mrs pentecost  pedgift junior foreseeing a dispute persevered sotto voce with the accompaniment in the interests of harmony  moores own words maam said allan in my mothers copy of the melodies  your mothers copy was wrong retorted mrs pentecost didnt i tell you just now that i knew tom moore by heart  pedgift juniors peacemaking concertina still flourished and groaned in the minor key  well what did the moon do asked allan in despair  what the moon ought to have done sir or tom moore wouldnt have written it so rejoined mrs pentecost the moon hid her light from the heaven that night and wept behind her clouds oer the maidens shame i wish that young man would leave off playing added mrs pentecost venting her rising irritation on gustus junior ive had enough of himhe tickles my ears  proud im sure maam said the unblushing pedgift the whole science of music consists in tickling the ears  we seem to be drifting into a sort of argument remarked major milroy placidly wouldnt it be better if mr armadale went on with his song  do go on mr armadale added the majors daughter do go on mr pedgift  one of them doesnt know the words and the other doesnt know the music said mrs pentecost let them go on if they can  sorry to disappoint you maam said pedgift junior im ready to go on myself to any extent now mr armadale  allan opened his lips to take up the unfinished melody where he had last left it before he could utter a note the curate suddenly rose with a ghastly face and a hand pressed convulsively over the middle region of his waistcoat  whats the matter cried the whole boating party in chorus  i am exceedingly unwell said the reverend samuel pentecost the boat was instantly in a state of confusion eveleens bower expired on allans lips and even the irrepressible concertina of pedgift was silenced at last the alarm proved to be quite needless mrs pentecosts son possessed a mother and that mother had a bag in two seconds the art of medicine occupied the place left vacant in the attention of the company by the art of music  rub it gently sammy said mrs pentecost ill get out the bottles and give you a dose its his poor stomach major hold my trumpet somebodyand stop the boat you take that bottle neelie my dear and you take this one mr armadale and give them to me as i want them ah poor dear i know whats the matter with him want of power here majorcold acid and flabby ginger to warm him soda to correct him sal volatile to hold him up there sammy drink it before it settles and then go and lie down my dear in that dogkennel of a place they call the cabin no more music added mrs pentecost shaking her forefinger at the proprietor of the concertinaunless its a hymn and that i dont object to  nobody appearing to be in a fit frame of mind for singing a hymn the allaccomplished pedgift drew upon his stores of local knowledge and produced a new idea the course of the boat was immediately changed under his direction in a few minutes more the company found themselves in a little island creek with a lonely cottage at the far end of it and a perfect forest of reeds closing the view all round them what do you say ladies and gentlemen to stepping on shore and seeing what a reedcutters cottage looks like suggested young pedgift  we say yes to be sure answered allan i think our spirits have been a little dashed by mr pentecosts illness and mrs pentecosts bag he added in a whisper to miss milroy a change of this sort is the very thing we want to set us all going again  he and young pedgift handed miss milroy out of the boat the major followed mrs pentecost sat immovable as the egyptian sphinx with her bag on her knees mounting guard over sammy in the cabin  we must keep the fun going sir said allan as he helped the major over the side of the boat we havent half done yet with the enjoyment of the day  his voice seconded his hearty belief in his own prediction to such good purpose that even mrs pentecost heard him and ominously shook her head  ah sighed the curates mother if you were as old as i am young gentleman you wouldnt feel quite so sure of the enjoyment of the day  so in rebuke of the rashness of youth spoke the caution of age the negative view is notoriously the safe view all the world over and the pentecost philosophy is as a necessary consequence generally in the right     ix fate or chance  it was close on six oclock when allan and his friends left the boat and the evening influence was creeping already in its mystery and its stillness over the watery solitude of the broads  the shore in these wild regions was not like the shore elsewhere firm as it looked the garden ground in front of the reedcutters cottage was floating ground that rose and fell and oozed into puddles under the pressure of the foot the boatmen who guided the visitors warned them to keep to the path and pointed through gaps in the reeds and pollards to grassy places on which strangers would have walked confidently where the crust of earth was not strong enough to bear the weight of a child over the unfathomed depths of slime and water beneath the solitary cottage built of planks pitched black stood on ground that had been steadied and strengthened by resting it on piles a little wooden tower rose at one end of the roof and served as a lookout post in the fowling season from this elevation the eye ranged far and wide over a wilderness of winding water and lonesome marsh if the reedcutter had lost his boat he would have been as completely isolated from all communication with town or village as if his place of abode had been a lightvessel instead of a cottage neither he nor his family complained of their solitude or looked in any way the rougher or the worse for it his wife received the visitors hospitably in a snug little room with a raftered ceiling and windows which looked like windows in a cabin on board ship his wifes father told stories of the famous days when the smugglers came up from the sea at night rowing through the network of rivers with muffled oars till they gained the lonely broads and sank their spirit casks in the water far from the coastguards reach his wild little children played at hideandseek with the visitors and the visitors ranged in and out of the cottage and round and round the morsel of firm earth on which it stood surprised and delighted by the novelty of all they saw the one person who noticed the advance of the eveningthe one person who thought of the flying time and the stationary pentecosts in the boatwas young pedgift that experienced pilot of the broads looked askance at his watch and drew allan aside at the first opportunity  i dont wish to hurry you mr armadale said pedgift junior but the time is getting on and theres a lady in the case  a lady repeated allan  yes sir rejoined young pedgift a lady from london connected if youll allow me to jog your memory with a ponychaise and white harness  good heavens the governess cried allan why we have forgotten all about her  dont be alarmed sir theres plenty of time if we only get into the boat again this is how it stands mr armadale we settled if you remember to have the gypsy teamaking at the next broad to thishurle mere  certainly said allan hurle mere is the place where my friend midwinter has promised to come and meet us  hurle mere is where the governess will be sir if your coachman follows my directions pursued young pedgift we have got nearly an hours punting to do along the twists and turns of the narrow waters which they call the sounds here between this and hurle mere and according to my calculations we must get on board again in five minutes if we are to be in time to meet the governess and to meet your friend  we mustnt miss my friend on any account said allan or the governess either of course ill tell the major  major milroy was at that moment preparing to mount the wooden watchtower of the cottage to see the view the ever useful pedgift volunteered to go up with him and rattle off all the necessary local explanations in half the time which the reedcutter would occupy in describing his own neighborhood to a stranger  allan remained standing in front of the cottage more quiet and more thoughtful than usual his interview with young pedgift had brought his absent friend to his memory for the first time since the picnic party had started he was surprised that midwinter so much in his thoughts on all other occasions should have been so long out of his thoughts now something troubled him like a sense of selfreproach as his mind reverted to the faithful friend at home toiling hard over the stewards books in his interests and for his sake dear old fellow thought allan i shall be so glad to see him at the mere the days pleasure wont be complete till he joins us  should i be right or wrong mr armadale if i guessed that you were thinking of somebody asked a voice softly behind him  allan turned and found the majors daughter at his side miss milroy not unmindful of a certain tender interview which had taken place behind a carriage had noticed her admirer standing thoughtfully by himself and had determined on giving him another opportunity while her father and young pedgift were at the top of the watchtower  you know everything said allan smiling i was thinking of somebody  miss milroy stole a glance at hima glance of gentle encouragement there could be but one human creature in mr armadales mind after what had passed between them that morning it would be only an act of mercy to take him back again at once to the interrupted conversation of a few hours since on the subject of names  i have been thinking of somebody too she said halfinviting halfrepelling the coming avowal if i tell you the first letter of my somebodys name will you tell me the first letter of yours  i will tell you anything you like rejoined allan with the utmost enthusiasm  she still shrank coquettishly from the very subject that she wanted to approach tell me your letter first she said in low tones looking away from him  allan laughed m he said is my first letter  she started a little strange that he should be thinking of her by her surname instead of her christian name but it mattered little as long as he was thinking of her  what is your letter asked allan  she blushed and smiled aif you will have it she answered in a reluctant little whisper she stole another look at him and luxuriously protracted her enjoyment of the coming avowal once more how many syllables is the name in she asked drawing patterns shyly on the ground with the end of the parasol  no man with the slightest knowledge of the sex would have been rash enough in allans position to tell her the truth allan who knew nothing whatever of womans natures and who told the truth right and left in all mortal emergencies answered as if he had been under examination in a court of justice  its a name in three syllables he said  miss milroys downcast eyes flashed up at him like lightning three she repeated in the blankest astonishment  allan was too inveterately straightforward to take the warning even now im not strong at my spelling i know he said with his lighthearted laugh but i dont think im wrong in calling midwinter a name in three syllables i was thinking of my friend but never mind my thoughts tell me who a istell me whom you were thinking of  of the first letter of the alphabet mr armadale and i beg positively to inform you of nothing more  with that annihilating answer the majors daughter put up her parasol and walked back by herself to the boat  allan stood petrified with amazement if miss milroy had actually boxed his ears and there is no denying that she had privately longed to devote her hand to that purpose he could hardly have felt more bewildered than he felt now what on earth have i done he asked himself helplessly as the major and young pedgift joined him and the three walked down together to the waterside i wonder what shell say to me next  she said absolutely nothing she never so much as looked at allan when he took his place in the boat there she sat with her eyes and her complexion both much brighter than usual taking the deepest interest in the curates progress toward recovery in the state of mrs pentecosts spirits in pedgift junior for whom she ostentatiously made room enough to let him sit beside her in the scenery and the reedcutters cottage in everybody and everything but allanwhom she would have married with the greatest pleasure five minutes since ill never forgive him thought the majors daughter to be thinking of that illbred wretch when i was thinking of him and to make me all but confess it before i found him out thank heaven mr pedgift is in the boat  in this frame of mind miss neelie applied herself forthwith to the fascination of pedgift and the discomfiture of allan oh mr pedgift how extremely clever and kind of you to think of showing us that sweet cottage lonely mr armadale i dont think its lonely at all i should like of all things to live there what would this picnic have been without you mr pedgift you cant think how i have enjoyed it since we got into the boat cool mr armadale what can you possibly mean by saying its cool its the warmest evening weve had this summer and the music mr pedgift how nice it was of you to bring your concertina i wonder if i could accompany you on the piano i would so like to try oh yes mr armadale no doubt you meant to do something musical too and i dare say you sing very well when you know the words but to tell you the truth i always did and always shall hate moores melodies  thus with merciless dexterity of manipulation did miss milroy work that sharpest female weapon of offense the tongue and thus she would have used it for some time longer if allan had only shown the necessary jealousy or if pedgift had only afforded the necessary encouragement but adverse fortune had decreed that she should select for her victims two men essentially unassailable under existing circumstances allan was too innocent of all knowledge of female subtleties and susceptibilities to understand anything except that the charming neelie was unreasonably out of temper with him without the slightest cause the wary pedgift as became one of the quickwitted youth of the present generation submitted to female influence with his eye fixed immovably all the time on his own interests many a young man of the past generation who was no fool has sacrificed everything for love not one young man in ten thousand of the present generation except the fools has sacrificed a halfpenny the daughters of eve still inherit their mothers merits and commit their mothers faults but the sons of adam in these latter days are men who would have handed the famous apple back with a bow and a thanks no it might get me into a scrape when allansurprised and disappointedmoved away out of miss milroys reach to the forward part of the boat pedgift junior rose and followed him youre a very nice girl thought this shrewdly sensible young man but a clients a client and i am sorry to inform you miss it wont do he set himself at once to rouse allans spirits by diverting his attention to a new subject there was to be a regatta that autumn on one of the broads and his clients opinion as a yachtsman might be valuable to the committee something new i should think to you sir in a sailing match on fresh water he said in his most ingratiatory manner and allan instantly interested answered quite new do tell me about it  as for the rest of the party at the other end of the boat they were in a fair way to confirm mrs pentecosts doubts whether the hilarity of the picnic would last the day out poor neelies natural feeling of irritation under the disappointment which allans awkwardness had inflicted on her was now exasperated into silent and settled resentment by her own keen sense of humiliation and defeat the major had relapsed into his habitually dreamy absent manner his mind was turning monotonously with the wheels of his clock the curate still secluded his indigestion from public view in the innermost recesses of the cabin and the curates mother with a second dose ready at a moments notice sat on guard at the door women of mrs pentecosts age and character generally enjoy their own bad spirits this sighed the old lady wagging her head with a smile of sour satisfaction is what you call a days pleasure is it ah what fools we all were to leave our comfortable homes  meanwhile the boat floated smoothly along the windings of the watery labyrinth which lay between the two broads the view on either side was now limited to nothing but interminable rows of reeds not a sound was heard far or near not so much as a glimpse of cultivated or inhabited land appeared anywhere a trifle dreary hereabouts mr armadale said the evercheerful pedgift but we are just out of it now look ahead sir here we are at hurle mere  the reeds opened back on the right hand and the left and the boat glided suddenly into the wide circle of a pool round the nearer half of the circle the eternal reeds still fringed the margin of the water round the further half the land appeared again here rolling back from the pool in desolate sandhills there rising above it in a sweep of grassy shore at one point the ground was occupied by a plantation and at another by the outbuildings of a lonely old red brick house with a strip of byroad near that skirted the garden wall and ended at the pool the sun was sinking in the clear heaven and the water where the suns reflection failed to tinge it was beginning to look black and cold the solitude that had been soothing the silence that had felt like an enchantment on the other broad in the days vigorous prime was a solitude that saddened herea silence that struck cold in the stillness and melancholy of the days decline  the course of the boat was directed across the mere to a creek in the grassy shore one or two of the little flatbottomed punts peculiar to the broads lay in the creek and the reed cutters to whom the punts belonged surprised at the appearance of strangers came out staring silently from behind an angle of the old garden wall not another sign of life was visible anywhere no ponychaise had been seen by the reed cutters no stranger either man or woman had approached the shores of hurle mere that day  young pedgift took another look at his watch and addressed himself to miss milroy you may or may not see the governess when you get back to thorpe ambrose he said but as the time stands now you wont see her here you know best mr armadale he added turning to allan whether your friend is to be depended on to keep his appointment  i am certain he is to be depended on replied allan looking about himin unconcealed disappointment at midwinters absence  very good pursued pedgift junior if we light the fire for our gypsy teamaking on the open ground there your friend may find us out sir by the smoke thats the indian dodge for picking up a lost man on the prairie miss milroy and its pretty nearly wild enough isnt it to be a prairie here  there are some temptationsprincipally those of the smaller kindwhich it is not in the defensive capacity of female human nature to resist the temptation to direct the whole force of her influence as the one young lady of the party toward the instant overthrow of allans arrangement for meeting his friend was too much for the majors daughter she turned on the smiling pedgift with a look which ought to have overwhelmed him but who ever overwhelmed a solicitor  i think its the most lonely dreary hideous place i ever saw in my life said miss neelie if you insist on making tea here mr pedgift dont make any for me no i shall stop in the boat and though i am absolutely dying with thirst i shall touch nothing till we get back again to the other broad  the major opened his lips to remonstrate to his daughters infinite delight mrs pentecost rose from her seat before he could say a word and after surveying the whole landward prospect and seeing nothing in the shape of a vehicle anywhere asked indignantly whether they were going all the way back again to the place where they had left the carriages in the middle of the day on ascertaining that this was in fact the arrangement proposed and that from the nature of the country the carriages could not have been ordered round to hurle mere without in the first instance sending them the whole of the way back to thorpe ambrose mrs pentecost speaking in her sons interests instantly declared that no earthly power should induce her to be out on the water after dark call me a boat cried the old lady in great agitation wherever theres water theres a night mist and wherever theres a night mist my son samuel catches cold dont talk to me about your moonlight and your teamakingyoure all mad hi you two men there cried mrs pentecost hailing the silent reed cutters on shore sixpence apiece for you if youll take me and my son back in your boat  before young pedgift could interfere allan himself settled the difficulty this time with perfect patience and good temper  i cant think mrs pentecost of your going back in any boat but the boat you have come out in he said there is not the least need as you and miss milroy dont like the place for anybody to go on shore here but me i must go on shore my friend midwinter never broke his promise to me yet and i cant consent to leave hurle mere as long as there is a chance of his keeping his appointment but theres not the least reason in the world why i should stand in the way on that account you have the major and mr pedgift to take care of you and you can get back to the carriages before dark if you go at once i will wait here and give my friend half an hour more and then i can follow you in one of the reedcutters boats  thats the most sensible thing mr armadale youve said today remarked mrs pentecost seating herself again in a violent hurry  tell them to be quick cried the old lady shaking her fist at the boatmen tell them to be quick  allan gave the necessary directions and stepped on shore the wary pedgift sticking fast to his client tried to follow  we cant leave you here alone sir he said protesting eagerly in a whisper let the major take care of the ladies and let me keep you company at the mere  no no said allan pressing him back theyre all in low spirits on board if you want to be of service to me stop like a good fellow where you are and do your best to keep the thing going  he waved his hand and the men pushed the boat off from the shore the others all waved their hands in return except the majors daughter who sat apart from the rest with her face hidden under her parasol the tears stood thick in neelies eyes her last angry feeling against allan died out and her heart went back to him penitently the moment he left the boat how good he is to us all she thought and what a wretch i am she got up with every generous impulse in her nature urging her to make atonement to him she got up reckless of appearances and looked after him with eager eyes and flushed checks as he stood alone on the shore dont be long mr armadale she said with a desperate disregard of what the rest of the company thought of her  the boat was already far out in the water and with all neelies resolution the words were spoken in a faint little voice which failed to reach allans ears the one sound he heard as the boat gained the opposite extremity of the mere and disappeared slowly among the reeds was the sound of the concertina the indefatigable pedgift was keeping things goingevidently under the auspices of mrs pentecostby performing a sacred melody  left by himself allan lit a cigar and took a turn backward and forward on the shore she might have said a word to me at parting he thought ive done everything for the best ive as good as told her how fond of her i am and this is the way she treats me he stopped and stood looking absently at the sinking sun and the fastdarkening waters of the mere some inscrutable influence in the scene forced its way stealthily into his mind and diverted his thoughts from miss milroy to his absent friend he started and looked about him  the reedcutters had gone back to their retreat behind the angle of the wall not a living creature was visible not a sound rose anywhere along the dreary shore even allans spirits began to get depressed it was nearly an hour after the time when midwinter had promised to be at hurle mere he had himself arranged to walk to the pool with a stableboy from thorpe ambrose as his guide by lanes and footpaths which shortened the distance by the road the boy knew the country well and midwinter was habitually punctual at all his appointments had anything gone wrong at thorpe ambrose had some accident happened on the way determined to remain no longer doubting and idling by himself allan made up his mind to walk inland from the mere on the chance of meeting his friend he went round at once to the angle in the wall and asked one of the reedcutters to show him the footpath to thorpe ambrose  the man led him away from the road and pointed to a barely perceptible break in the outer trees of the plantation after pausing for one more useless look around him allan turned his back on the mere and made for the trees  for a few paces the path ran straight through the plantation thence it took a sudden turn and the water and the open country became both lost to view allan steadily followed the grassy track before him seeing nothing and hearing nothing until he came to another winding of the path turning in the new direction he saw dimly a human figure sitting alone at the foot of one of the trees two steps nearer were enough to make the figure familiar to him midwinter he exclaimed in astonishment this is not the place where i was to meet you what are you waiting for here  midwinter rose without answering the evening dimness among the trees which obscured his face made his silence doubly perplexing  allan went on eagerly questioning him did you come here by yourself he asked i thought the boy was to guide you  this time midwinter answered when we got as far as these trees he said i sent the boy back he told me i was close to the place and couldnt miss it  what made you stop here when he left you reiterated allan why didnt you walk on  dont despise me answered the other i hadnt the courage  not the courage repeated allan he paused a moment oh i know he resumed putting his hand gayly on midwinters shoulder youre still shy of the milroys what nonsense when i told you myself that your peace was made at the cottage  i wasnt thinking allan of your friends at the cottage the truth is im hardly myself today i am ill and unnerved trifles startle me he stopped and shrank away under the anxious scrutiny of allans eyes if you will have it he burst out abruptly the horror of that night on board the wreck has got me again theres a dreadful oppression on my head theres a dreadful sinking at my heart i am afraid of something happening to us if we dont part before the day is out i cant break my promise to you for gods sake release me from it and let me go back  remonstrance to any one who knew midwinter was plainly useless at that moment allan humored him come out of this dark airless place he said and we will talk about it the water and the open sky are within a stones throw of us i hate a wood in the evening it even gives me the horrors you have been working too hard over the stewards books come and breathe freely in the blessed open air  midwinter stopped considered for a moment and suddenly submitted  youre right he said and im wrong as usual im wasting time and distressing you to no purpose what folly to ask you to let me go back suppose you had said yes  well asked allan  well repeated midwinter something would have happened at the first step to stop me thats all come on  they walked together in silence on the way to the mere  at the last turn in the path allans cigar went out while he stopped to light it again midwinter walked on before him and was the first to come in sight of the open ground  allan had just kindled the match when to his surprise his friend came back to him round the turn in the path there was light enough to show objects more clearly in this part of the plantation the match as midwinter faced him dropped on the instant from allans hand  good god he cried starting back you look as you looked on board the wreck  midwinter held up his band for silence he spoke with his wild eyes riveted on allans face with his white lips close at allans ear  you remember how i looked he answered in a whisper do you remember what i said when you and the doctor were talking of the dream  i have forgotten the dream said allan  as he made that answer midwinter took his hand and led him round the last turn in the path  do you remember it now he asked and pointed to the mere  the sun was sinking in the cloudless westward heaven the waters of the mere lay beneath tinged red by the dying light the open country stretched away darkening drearily already on the right hand and the left and on the near margin of the pool where all had been solitude before there now stood fronting the sunset the figure of a woman  the two armadales stood together in silence and looked at the lonely figure and the dreary view  midwinter was the first to speak  your own eyes have seen it he said now look at our own words  he opened the narrative of the dream and held it under allans eyes his finger pointed to the lines which recorded the first vision his voice sinking lower and lower repeated the words   the sense came to me of being left alone in the darkness  i waited  the darkness opened and showed me the visionas in a pictureof a broad lonely pool surrounded by open ground above the further margin of the pool i saw the cloudless western sky red with the light of sunset  on the near margin of the pool there stood the shadow of a woman  he ceased and let the hand which held the manuscript drop to his side the other hand pointed to the lonely figure standing with its back turned on them fronting the setting sun  there he said stands the living woman in the shadows place there speaks the first of the dream warnings to you and to me let the future time find us still together and the second figure that stands in the shadows place will be mine  even allan was silenced by the terrible certainty of conviction with which he spoke  in the pause that followed the figure at the pool moved and walked slowly away round the margin of the shore allan stepped out beyond the last of the trees and gained a wider view of the open ground the first object that met his eyes was the ponychaise from thorpe ambrose  he turned back to midwinter with a laugh of relief what nonsense have you been talking he said and what nonsense have i been listening to its the governess at last  midwinter made no reply allan took him by the arm and tried to lead him on he released himself suddenly and seized allan with both hands holding him back from the figure at the pool as he had held him back from the cabin door on the deck of the timber ship once again the effort was in vain once again allan broke away as easily as he had broken away in the past time  one of us must speak to her he said and if you wont i will  he had only advanced a few steps toward the mere when he heard or thought he heard a voice faintly calling after him once and once only the word farewell he stopped with a feeling of uneasy surprise and looked round  was that you midwinter he asked  there was no answer after hesitating a moment more allan returned to the plantation midwinter was gone  he looked back at the pool doubtful in the new emergency what to do next the lonely figure had altered its course in the interval it had turned and was advancing toward the trees allan had been evidently either heard or seen it was impossible to leave a woman unbefriended in that helpless position and in that solitary place for the second time allan went out from the trees to meet her  as he came within sight of her face he stopped in ungovernable astonishment the sudden revelation of her beauty as she smiled and looked at him inquiringly suspended the movement in his limbs and the words on his lips a vague doubt beset him whether it was the governess after all  he roused himself and advancing a few paces mentioned his name may i ask he added if i have the pleasure  the lady met him easily and gracefully halfway major milroys governess she said miss gwilt     x the housemaids face  all was quiet at thorpe ambrose the hall was solitary the rooms were dark the servants waiting for the supper hour in the garden at the back of the house looked up at the clear heaven and the rising moon and agreed that there was little prospect of the return of the picnic party until later in the night the general opinion led by the high authority of the cook predicted that they might all sit down to supper without the least fear of being disturbed by the bell having arrived at this conclusion the servants assembled round the table and exactly at the moment when they sat down the bell rang  the footman wondering went up stairs to open the door and found to his astonishment midwinter waiting alone on the threshold and looking in the servants opinion miserably ill he asked for a light and saying he wanted nothing else withdrew at once to his room the footman went back to his fellowservants and reported that something had certainly happened to his masters friend  on entering his room midwinter closed the door and hurriedly filled a bag with the necessaries for traveling this done he took from a locked drawer and placed in the breast pocket of his coat some little presents which allan had given hima cigar case a purse and a set of studs in plain gold having possessed himself of these memorials he snatched up the bag and laid his hand on the door there for the first time he paused there the headlong haste of all his actions thus far suddenly ceased and the hard despair in his face began to soften he waited with the door in his hand  up to that moment he had been conscious of but one motive that animated him but one purpose that he was resolute to achieve for allans sake he had said to himself when he looked back toward the fatal landscape and saw his friend leaving him to meet the woman at the pool for allans sake he had said again when he crossed the open country beyond the wood and saw afar in the gray twilight the long line of embankment and the distant glimmer of the railway lamps beckoning him away already to the iron road  it was only when he now paused before he closed the door behind himit was only when his own impetuous rapidity of action came for the first time to a check that the nobler nature of the man rose in protest against the superstitious despair which was hurrying him from all that he held dear his conviction of the terrible necessity of leaving allan for allans good had not been shaken for an instant since he had seen the first vision of the dream realized on the shores of the mere but now for the first time his own heart rose against him in unanswerable rebuke go if you must and will but remember the time when you were ill and he sat by your bedside friendless and he opened his heart to youand write if you fear to speak write and ask him to forgive you before you leave him forever  the halfopened door closed again softly midwinter sat down at the writingtable and took up the pen  he tried again and again and yet again to write the farewell words he tried till the floor all round him was littered with torn sheets of paper turn from them which way he would the old times still came back and faced him reproachfully the spacious bedchamber in which he sat narrowed in spite of him to the sick ushers garret at the westcountry inn the kind hand that had once patted him on the shoulder touched him again the kind voice that had cheered him spoke unchangeably in the old friendly tones he flung his arms on the table and dropped his head on them in tearless despair the parting words that his tongue was powerless to utter his pen was powerless to write mercilessly in earnest his superstition pointed to him to go while the time was his own mercilessly in earnest his love for allan held him back till the farewell plea for pardon and pity was written  he rose with a sudden resolution and rang for the servant when mr armadale returns he said ask him to excuse my coming downstairs and say that i am trying to get to sleep he locked the door and put out the light and sat down alone in the darkness the night will keep us apart he said and time may help me to write i may go in the early morning i may go while the thought died in him uncompleted and the sharp agony of the struggle forced to his lips the first cry of suffering that had escaped him yet  he waited in the darkness  as the time stole on his senses remained mechanically awake but his mind began to sink slowly under the heavy strain that had now been laid on it for some hours past a dull vacancy possessed him he made no attempt to kindle the light and write once more he never started he never moved to the open window when the first sound of approaching wheels broke in on the silence of the night he heard the carriages draw up at the door he heard the horses champing their bits he heard the voices of allan and young pedgift on the steps and still he sat quiet in the darkness and still no interest was aroused in him by the sounds that reached his ear from outside  the voices remained audible after the carriages had been driven away the two young men were evidently lingering on the steps before they took leave of each other every word they said reached midwinter through the open window their one subject of conversation was the new governess allans voice was loud in her praise he had never passed such an hour of delight in his life as the hour he had spent with miss gwilt in the boat on the way from hurle mere to the picnic party waiting at the other broad agreeing on his side with all that his client said in praise of the charming stranger young pedgift appeared to treat the subject when it fell into his hands from a different point of view miss gwilts attractions had not so entirely absorbed his attention as to prevent him from noticing the impression which the new governess had produced on her employer and her pupil  theres a screw loose somewhere sir in major milroys family said the voice of young pedgift did you notice how the major and his daughter looked when miss gwilt made her excuses for being late at the mere you dont remember do you remember what miss gwilt said  something about mrs milroy wasnt it allan rejoined  young pedgifts voice dropped mysteriously a note lower  miss gwilt reached the cottage this afternoon sir at the time when i told you she would reach it and she would have joined us at the time i told you she would come but for mrs milroy mrs milroy sent for her upstairs as soon as she entered the house and kept her upstairs a good halfhour and more that was miss gwilts excuse mr armadale for being late at the mere  well and what then  you seem to forget sir what the whole neighborhood has heard about mrs milroy ever since the major first settled among us we have all been told on the doctors own authority that she is too great a sufferer to see strangers isnt it a little odd that she should have suddenly turned out well enough to see miss gwilt in her husbands absence the moment miss gwilt entered the house  not a bit of it of course she was anxious to make acquaintance with her daughters governess  likely enough mr armadale but the major and miss neelie dont see it in that light at any rate i had my eye on them both when the governess told them that mrs milroy had sent for her if ever i saw a girl look thoroughly frightened miss milroy was that girl and if i may be allowed in the strictest confidence to libel a gallant soldier i should say that the major himself was much in the same condition take my word for it sir theres something wrong upstairs in that pretty cottage of yours and miss gwilt is mixed up in it already  there was a minute of silence when the voices were next heard by midwinter they were further away from the houseallan was probably accompanying young pedgift a few steps on his way back  after a while allans voice was audible once more under the portico making inquiries after his friend answered by the servants voice giving midwinters message this brief interruption over the silence was not broken again till the time came for shutting up the house the servants footsteps passing to and fro the clang of closing doors the barking of a disturbed dog in the stableyardthese sounds warned midwinter it was getting late he rose mechanically to kindle a light but his head was giddy his hand trembled he laid aside the matchbox and returned to his chair the conversation between allan and young pedgift had ceased to occupy his attention the instant he ceased to hear it and now again the sense that the precious time was failing him became a lost sense as soon as the house noises which had awakened it had passed away his energies of body and mind were both alike worn out he waited with a stolid resignation for the trouble that was to come to him with the coming day  an interval passed and the silence was once more disturbed by voices outside the voices of a man and a woman this time the first few words exchanged between them indicated plainly enough a meeting of the clandestine kind and revealed the man as one of the servants at thorpe ambrose and the woman as one of the servants at the cottage  here again after the first greetings were over the subject of the new governess became the allabsorbing subject of conversation  the majors servant was brimful of forebodings inspired solely by miss gwilts good looks which she poured out irrepressibly on her sweetheart try as he might to divert her to other topics sooner or later let him mark her words there would be an awful upset at the cottage her master it might be mentioned in confidence led a dreadful life with her mistress the major was the best of men he hadnt a thought in his heart beyond his daughter and his everlasting clock but only let a nicelooking woman come near the place and mrs milroy was jealous of herraging jealous like a woman possessed on that miserable sickbed of hers if miss gwilt who was certainly goodlooking in spite of her hideous hair didnt blow the fire into a flame before many days more were over their heads the mistress was the mistress no longer but somebody else whatever happened the fault this time would lie at the door of the majors mother the old lady and the mistress had had a dreadful quarrel two years since and the old lady had gone away in a fury telling her son before all the servants that if he had a spark of spirit in him he would never submit to his wifes temper as he did it would be too much perhaps to accuse the majors mother of purposely picking out a handsome governess to spite the majors wife but it might be safely said that the old lady was the last person in the world to humor the mistresss jealousy by declining to engage a capable and respectable governess for her granddaughter because that governess happened to be blessed with good looks how it was all to end except that it was certain to end badly no human creature could say things were looking as black already as things well could miss neelie was crying after the days pleasure which was one bad sign the mistress had found fault with nobody which was another the master had wished her goodnight through the door which was a third and the governess had locked herself up in her room which was the worst sign of all for it looked as if she distrusted the servants thus the stream of the womans gossip ran on and thus it reached midwinters ears through the window till the clock in the stableyard struck and stopped the talking when the last vibrations of the bell had died away the voices were not audible again and the silence was broken no more  another interval passed and midwinter made a new effort to rouse himself this time he kindled the light without hesitation and took the pen in hand  he wrote at the first trial with a sudden facility of expression which surprising him as he went on ended in rousing in him some vague suspicion of himself he left the table and bathed his head and face in water and came back to read what he had written the language was barely intelligible sentences were left unfinished words were misplaced one for the other every line recorded the protest of the weary brain against the merciless will that had forced it into action midwinter tore up the sheet of paper as he had torn up the other sheets before it and sinking under the struggle at last laid his weary head on the pillow almost on the instant exhaustion overcame him and before he could put the light out he fell asleep  he was roused by a noise at the door the sunlight was pouring into the room the candle had burned down into the socket and the servant was waiting outside with a letter which had come for him by the mornings post  i ventured to disturb you sir said the man when midwinter opened the door because the letter is marked immediate and i didnt know but it might be of some consequence  midwinter thanked him and looked at the letter it was of some consequencethe handwriting was mr brocks  he paused to collect his faculties the torn sheets of paper on the floor recalled to him in a moment the position in which he stood he locked the door again in the fear that allan might rise earlier than usual and come in to make inquiries thenfeeling strangely little interest in anything that the rector could write to him nowhe opened mr brocks letter and read these lines  tuesday  my dear midwinterit is sometimes best to tell bad news plainly in few words let me tell mine at once in one sentence my precautions have all been defeated the woman has escaped me  this misfortunefor it is nothing lesshappened yesterday monday between eleven and twelve in the forenoon of that day the business which originally brought me to london obliged me to go to doctors commons and to leave my servant robert to watch the house opposite our lodging until my return about an hour and a half after my departure he observed an empty cab drawn up at the door of the house boxes and bags made their appearance first they were followed by the woman herself in the dress i had first seen her in having previously secured a cab robert traced her to the terminus of the northwestern railway saw her pass through the ticket office kept her in view till she reached the platform and there in the crowd and confusion caused by the starting of a large mixed train lost her i must do him the justice to say that he at once took the right course in this emergency instead of wasting time in searching for her on the platform he looked along the line of carriages and he positively declares that he failed to see her in any one of them he admits at the same time that his search conducted between two oclock when he lost sight of her and ten minutes past when the train started was in the confusion of the moment necessarily an imperfect one but this latter circumstance in my opinion matters little i as firmly disbelieve in the womans actual departure by that train as if i had searched every one of the carriages myself and you i have no doubt will entirely agree with me  you now know how the disaster happened let us not waste time and words in lamenting it the evil is done and you and i together must find the way to remedy it  what i have accomplished already on my side may be told in two words any hesitation i might have previously felt at trusting this delicate business in strangers hands was at an end the moment i heard roberts news i went back at once to the city and placed the whole matter confidentially before my lawyers the conference was a long one and when i left the office it was past the post hour or i should have written to you on monday instead of writing today my interview with the lawyers was not very encouraging they warn me plainly that serious difficulties stand in the way of our recovering the lost trace but they have promised to do their best and we have decided on the course to be taken excepting one point on which we totally differ i must tell you what this difference is for while business keeps me away from thorpe ambrose you are the only person whom i can trust to put my convictions to the test  the lawyers are of opinion then that the woman has been aware from the first that i was watching her that there is consequently no present hope of her being rash enough to appear personally at thorpe ambrose that any mischief she may have it in contemplation to do will be done in the first instance by deputy and that the only wise course for allans friends and guardians to take is to wait passively till events enlighten them my own idea is diametrically opposed to this after what has happened at the railway i cannot deny that the woman must have discovered that i was watching her but she has no reason to suppose that she has not succeeded in deceiving me and i firmly believe she is bold enough to take us by surprise and to win or force her way into allans confidence before we are prepared to prevent her  you and you only while i am detained in london can decide whether i am right or wrongand you can do it in this way ascertain at once whether any woman who is a stranger in the neighborhood has appeared since monday last at or near thorpe ambrose if any such person has been observed and nobody escapes observation in the country take the first opportunity you can get of seeing her and ask yourself if her face does or does not answer certain plain questions which i am now about to write down for you you may depend on my accuracy i saw the woman unveiled on more than one occasion and the last time through an excellent glass  1 is her hair light brown and apparently not very plentiful 2 is her forehead high narrow and sloping backward from the brow 3 are her eyebrows very faintly marked and are her eyes small and nearer dark than lighteither gray or hazel i have not seen her close enough to be certain which 4 is her nose aquiline 5 are her lips thin and is the upper lip long 6 does her complexion look like an originally fair complexion which has deteriorated into a dull sickly paleness 7 and lastly has she a retreating chin and is there on the left side of it a mark of some kinda mole or a scar i cant say which  i add nothing about her expression for you may see her under circumstances which may partially alter it as seen by me test her by her features which no circumstances can change if there is a stranger in the neighborhood and if her face answers my seven questions you have found the woman go instantly in that case to the nearest lawyer and pledge my name and credit for whatever expenses may be incurred in keeping her under inspection night and day having done this take the speediest means of communicating with me and whether my business is finished or not i will start for norfolk by the first train  always your friend decimus brock   hardened by the fatalist conviction that now possessed him midwinter read the rectors confession of defeat from the first line to the last without the slightest betrayal either of interest or surprise the one part of the letter at which he looked back was the closing part of it i owe much to mr brocks kindness he thought and i shall never see mr brock again it is useless and hopeless but he asks me to do it and it shall be done a moments look at her will be enougha moments look at her with his letter in my handand a line to tell him that the woman is here  again he stood hesitating at the halfopened door again the cruel necessity of writing his farewell to allan stopped him and stared him in the face  he looked aside doubtingly at the rectors letter i will write the two together he said one may help the other his face flushed deep as the words escaped him he was conscious of doing what he had not done yetof voluntarily putting off the evil hour of making mr brock the pretext for gaining the last respite left the respite of time  the only sound that reached him through the open door was the sound of allan stirring noisily in the next room he stepped at once into the empty corridor and meeting no one on the stairs made his way out of the house the dread that his resolution to leave allan might fail him if he saw allan again was as vividly present to his mind in the morning as it had been all through the night he drew a deep breath of relief as he descended the house stepsrelief at having escaped the friendly greeting of the morning from the one human creature whom he loved  he entered the shrubbery with mr brocks letter in his hand and took the nearest way that led to the majors cottage not the slightest recollection was in his mind of the talk which had found its way to his ears during the night his one reason for determining to see the woman was the reason which the rector had put in his mind the one remembrance that now guided him to the place in which she lived was the remembrance of allans exclamation when he first identified the governess with the figure at the pool  arrived at the gate of the cottage he stopped the thought struck him that he might defeat his own object if he looked at the rectors questions in the womans presence her suspicions would be probably roused in the first instance by his asking to see her as he had determined to ask with or without an excuse and the appearance of the letter in his hand might confirm them  she might defeat him by instantly leaving the room determined to fix the description in his mind first and then to confront her he opened the letter and turning away slowly by the side of the house read the seven questions which he felt absolutely assured beforehand the womans face would answer  in the morning quiet of the park slight noises traveled far a slight noise disturbed midwinter over the letter  he looked up and found himself on the brink of a broad grassy trench having the park on one side and the high laurel hedge of an inclosure on the other the inclosure evidently surrounded the back garden of the cottage and the trench was intended to protect it from being damaged by the cattle grazing in the park  listening carefully as the slight sound which had disturbed him grew fainter he recognized in it the rustling of womens dresses a few paces ahead the trench was crossed by a bridge closed by a wicket gate which connected the garden with the park he passed through the gate crossed the bridge and opening a door at the other end found himself in a summerhouse thickly covered with creepers and commanding a full view of the garden from end to end  he looked and saw the figures of two ladies walking slowly away from him toward the cottage the shorter of the two failed to occupy his attention for an instant he never stopped to think whether she was or was not the majors daughter his eyes were riveted on the other figurethe figure that moved over the garden walk with the long lightly falling dress and the easy seductive grace there presented exactly as he had seen her once alreadythere with her back again turned on him was the woman at the pool  there was a chance that they might take another turn in the gardena turn back toward the summerhouse on that chance midwinter waited no consciousness of the intrusion that he was committing had stopped him at the door of the summerhouse and no consciousness of it troubled him even now every finer sensibility in his nature sinking under the cruel laceration of the past night had ceased to feel the dogged resolution to do what he had come to do was the one animating influence left alive in him he acted he even looked as the most stolid man living might have acted and looked in his place he was selfpossessed enough in the interval of expectation before governess and pupil reached the end of the walk to open mr brocks letter and to fortify his memory by a last look at the paragraph which described her face  he was still absorbed over the description when he heard the smooth rustle of the dresses traveling toward him again standing in the shadow of the summerhouse he waited while she lessened the distance between them with her written portrait vividly impressed on his mind and with the clear light of the morning to help him his eyes questioned her as she came on and these were the answers that her face gave him back  the hair in the rectors description was light brown and not plentiful this womans hair superbly luxuriant in its growth was of the one unpardonably remarkable shade of color which the prejudice of the northern nations never entirely forgivesit was red the forehead in the rectors description was high narrow and sloping backward from the brow the eyebrows were faintly marked and the eyes small and in color either gray or hazel this womans forehead was low upright and broad toward the temples her eyebrows at once strongly and delicately marked were a shade darker than her hair her eyes large bright and well opened were of that purely blue color without a tinge in it of gray or green so often presented to our admiration in pictures and books so rarely met with in the living face the nose in the rectors description was aquiline the line of this womans nose bent neither outward nor inward it was the straight delicately molded nose with the short upper lip beneath of the ancient statues and busts the lips in the rectors description were thin and the upper lip long the complexion was of a dull sickly paleness the chin retreating and the mark of a mole or a scar on the left side of it this womans lips were full rich and sensual her complexion was the lovely complexion which accompanies such hair as hersso delicately bright in its rosier tints so warmly and softly white in its gentler gradations of color on the forehead and the neck her chin round and dimpled was pure of the slightest blemish in every part of it and perfectly in line with her forehead to the end nearer and nearer and fairer and fairer she came in the glow of the morning lightthe most startling the most unanswerable contradiction that eye could see or mind conceive to the description in the rectors letter  both governess and pupil were close to the summerhouse before they looked that way and noticed midwinter standing inside the governess saw him first  a friend of yours miss milroy she asked quietly without starting or betraying any sign of surprise  neelie recognized him instantly prejudiced against midwinter by his conduct when his friend had introduced him at the cottage she now fairly detested him as the unlucky first cause of her misunderstanding with allan at the picnic her face flushed and she drew back from the summerhouse with an expression of merciless surprise  he is a friend of mr armadales she replied sharply i dont know what he wants or why he is here  a friend of mr armadales the governesss face lighted up with a suddenly roused interest as she repeated the words she returned midwinters look still steadily fixed on her with equal steadiness on her side  for my part pursued neelie resenting midwinters insensibility to her presence on the scene i think it a great liberty to treat papas garden as if it were the open park  the governess turned round and gently interposed  my dear miss milroy she remonstrated there are certain distinctions to be observed this gentleman is a friend of mr armadales you could hardly express yourself more strongly if he was a perfect stranger  i express my opinion retorted neelie chafing under the satirically indulgent tone in which the governess addressed her its a matter of taste miss gwilt and tastes differ she turned away petulantly and walked back by herself to the cottage  she is very young said miss gwilt appealing with a smile to midwinters forbearance and as you must see for yourself sir she is a spoiled child she pausedshowed for an instant only her surprise at midwinters strange silence and strange persistency in keeping his eyes still fixed on herthen set herself with a charming grace and readiness to help him out of the false position in which he stood as you have extended your walk thus far she resumed perhaps you will kindly favor me on your return by taking a message to your friend mr armadale has been so good as to invite me to see the thorpe ambrose gardens this morning will you say that major milroy permits me to accept the invitation in company with miss milroy between ten and eleven oclock for a moment her eyes rested with a renewed look of interest on midwinters face she waited still in vain for an answering word from himsmiled as if his extraordinary silence amused rather than angered herand followed her pupil back to the cottage   it was only when the last trace of her had disappeared that midwinter roused himself and attempted to realize the position in which he stood the revelation of her beauty was in no respect answerable for the breathless astonishment which had held him spellbound up to this moment the one clear impression she had produced on him thus far began and ended with his discovery of the astounding contradiction that her face offered in one feature after another to the description in mr brocks letter all beyond this was vague and mistya dim consciousness of a tall elegant woman and of kind words modestly and gracefully spoken to him and nothing more  he advanced a few steps into the garden without knowing whystopped glancing hither and thither like a man lostrecognized the summerhouse by an effort as if years had elapsed since he had seen itand made his way out again at last into the park even here he wandered first in one direction then in another his mind was still reeling under the shock that had fallen on it his perceptions were all confused something kept him mechanically in action walking eagerly without a motive walking he knew not where  a far less sensitively organized man might have been overwhelmed as he was overwhelmed now by the immense the instantaneous revulsion of feeling which the event of the last few minutes had wrought in his mind  at the memorable instant when he had opened the door of the summerhouse no confusing influence troubled his faculties in all that related to his position toward his friend he had reached an absolutely definite conclusion by an absolutely definite process of thought the whole strength of the motive which had driven him into the resolution to part from allan rooted itself in the belief that he had seen at hurle mere the fatal fulfillment of the first vision of the dream and this belief in its turn rested necessarily on the conviction that the woman who was the one survivor of the tragedy in madeira must be also inevitably the woman whom he had seen standing in the shadows place at the pool firm in that persuasion he had himself compared the object of his distrust and of the rectors distrust with the description written by the rector himselfa description carefully minute by a man entirely trustworthyand his own eyes had informed him that the woman whom he had seen at the mere and the woman whom mr brock had identified in london were not one but two in the place of the dream shadow there had stood on the evidence of the rectors letter not the instrument of the fatalitybut a stranger  no such doubts as might have troubled a less superstitious man were started in his mind by the discovery that had now opened on him  it never occurred to him to ask himself whether a stranger might not be the appointed instrument of the fatality now when the letter had persuaded him that a stranger had been revealed as the figure in the dream landscape no such idea entered or could enter his mind the one woman whom his superstition dreaded was the woman who had entwined herself with the lives of the two armadales in the first generation and with the fortunes of the two armadales in the secondwho was at once the marked object of his fathers deathbed warning and the first cause of the family calamities which had opened allans way to the thorpe ambrose estatethe woman in a word whom he would have known instinctively but for mr brocks letter to be the woman whom he had now actually seen  looking at events as they had just happened under the influence of the misapprehension into which the rector had innocently misled him his mind saw and seized its new conclusion instantaneously acting precisely as it had acted in the past time of his interview with mr brock at the isle of man  exactly as he had once declared it to be an allsufficient refutation of the idea of the fatality that he had never met with the timbership in any of his voyages at sea so he now seized on the similarly derived conclusion that the whole claim of the dream to a supernatural origin stood selfrefuted by the disclosure of a stranger in the shadows place once started from this pointonce encouraged to let his love for allan influence him undividedly again his mind hurried along the whole resulting chain of thought at lightning speed if the dream was proved to be no longer a warning from the other world it followed inevitably that accident and not fate had led the way to the night on the wreck and that all the events which had happened since allan and he had parted from mr brock were events in themselves harmless which his superstition had distorted from their proper shape in less than a moment his mobile imagination had taken him back to the morning at castletown when he had revealed to the rector the secret of his name when he had declared to the rector with his fathers letter before his eyes the better faith that was in him now once more he felt his heart holding firmly by the bond of brotherhood between allan and himself now once more he could say with the eager sincerity of the old time if the thought of leaving him breaks my heart the thought of leaving him is wrong as that nobler conviction possessed itself again of his mindquieting the tumult clearing the confusion within himthe house at thorpe ambrose with allan on the steps waiting looking for him opened on his eyes through the trees a sense of illimitable relief lifted his eager spirit high above the cares and doubts and fears that had oppressed it so long and showed him once more the better and brighter future of his early dreams his eyes filled with tears and he pressed the rectors letter in his wild passionate way to his lips as he looked at allan through the vista of the trees but for this morsel of paper he thought my life might have been one long sorrow to me and my fathers crime might have parted us forever   such was the result of the stratagem which had shown the housemaids face to mr brock as the face of miss gwilt and soby shaking midwinters trust in his own superstition in the one case in which that superstition pointed to the truthdid mother oldershaws cunning triumph over difficulties and dangers which had never been contemplated by mother oldershaw herself     xi miss gwilt among the quicksands  1 from the rev decimus brock to ozias midwinter  thursday  my dear midwinterno words can tell what a relief it was to me to get your letter this morning and what a happiness i honestly feel in having been thus far proved to be in the wrong the precautions you have taken in case the woman should still confirm my apprehensions by venturing herself at thorpe ambrose seem to me to be all that can be desired you are no doubt sure to hear of her from one or other of the people in the lawyers office whom you have asked to inform you of the appearance of a stranger in the town  i am the more pleased at finding how entirely i can trust you in this matter for i am likely to be obliged to leave allans interests longer than i supposed solely in your hands my visit to thorpe ambrose must i regret to say be deferred for two months the only one of my brotherclergymen in london who is able to take my duty for me cannot make it convenient to remove with his family to somersetshire before that time i have no alternative but to finish my business here and be back at my rectory on saturday next if anything happens you will of course instantly communicate with me and in that case be the inconvenience what it may i must leave home for thorpe ambrose if on the other hand all goes more smoothly than my own obstinate apprehensions will allow me to suppose then allan to whom i have written must not expect to see me till this day two months  no result has up to this time rewarded our exertions to recover the trace lost at the railway i will keep my letter open however until post time in case the next few hours bring any news  always truly yours  decimus brock  p si have just heard from the lawyers they have found out the name the woman passed by in london if this discovery not a very important one i am afraid suggests any new course of proceeding to you pray act on it at once the name ismiss gwilt   2 from miss gwilt to mrs oldershaw  the cottage thorpe ambrose saturday june 28  if you will promise not to be alarmed mamma oldershaw i will begin this letter in a very odd way by copying a page of a letter written by somebody else you have an excellent memory and you may not have forgotten that i received a note from major milroys mother after she had engaged me as governess on monday last it was dated and signed and here it is as far as the first page june 23d 1851 dear madampray excuse my troubling you before you go to thorpe ambrose with a word more about the habits observed in my sons household when i had the pleasure of seeing you at two oclock today in kingsdown crescent i had another appointment in a distant part of london at three and in the hurry of the moment one or two little matters escaped me which i think i ought to impress on your attention the rest of the letter is not of the slightest importance but the lines that i have just copied are well worthy of all the attention you can bestow on them they have saved me from discovery my dear before i have been a week in major milroys service  it happened no later than yesterday evening and it began and ended in this manner  there is a gentleman here of whom i shall have more to say presently who is an intimate friend of young armadales and who bears the strange name of midwinter he contrived yesterday to speak to me alone in the park almost as soon as he opened his lips i found that my name had been discovered in london no doubt by the somersetshire clergyman and that mr midwinter had been chosen evidently by the same person to identify the miss gwilt who had vanished from brompton with the miss gwilt who had appeared at thorpe ambrose you foresaw this danger i remember but you could scarcely have imagined that the exposure would threaten me so soon  i spare you the details of our conversation to come to the end mr midwinter put the matter very delicately declaring to my great surprise that he felt quite certain himself that i was not the miss gwilt of whom his friend was in search and that he only acted as he did out of regard to the anxiety of a person whose wishes he was bound to respect would i assist him in setting that anxiety completely at rest as far as i was concerned by kindly answering one plain questionwhich he had no other right to ask me than the right my indulgence might give him the lost miss gwilt had been missed on monday last at two oclock in the crowd on the platform of the northwestern railway in euston square would i authorize him to say that on that day and at that hour the miss gwilt who was major milroys governess had never been near the place  i need hardly tell you that i seized the fine opportunity he had given me of disarming all future suspicion i took a high tone on the spot and met him with the old ladys letter he politely refused to look at it i insisted on his looking at it i dont choose to be mistaken i said for a woman who may be a bad character because she happens to bear or to have assumed the same name as mine i insist on your reading the first part of this letter for my satisfaction if not for your own he was obliged to comply and there was the proof in the old ladys handwriting that at two oclock on monday last she and i were together in kingsdown crescent which any directory would tell him is a crescent in bayswater i leave you to imagine his apologies and the perfect sweetness with which i received them  i might of course if i had not preserved the letter have referred him to you or to the majors mother with similar results as it is the object has been gained without trouble or delay i have been proved not to be myself and one of the many dangers that threatened me at thorpe ambrose is a danger blown over from this moment your housemaids face may not be a very handsome one but there is no denying that it has done us excellent service  so much for the past now for the future you shall hear how i get on with the people about me and you shall judge for yourself what the chances are for and against my becoming mistress of thorpe ambrose  let me begin with young armadalebecause it is beginning with good news i have produced the right impression on him already and heaven knows that is nothing to boast of any moderately goodlooking woman who chose to take the trouble could make him fall in love with her he is a rattlepated young foolone of those noisy rosy lighthaired goodtempered men whom i particularly detest i had a whole hour alone with him in a boat the first day i came here and i have made good use of my time i can tell you from that day to this the only difficulty with him is the difficulty of concealing my own feelings especially when he turns my dislike of him into downright hatred by sometimes reminding me of his mother i really never saw a man whom i could use so ill if i had the opportunity he will give me the opportunity i believe if no accident happens sooner than we calculated on i have just returned from a party at the great house in celebration of the rentday dinner and the squires attentions to me and my modest reluctance to receive them have already excited general remark  my pupil miss milroy comes next she too is rosy and foolish and what is more awkward and squat and freckled and illtempered and illdressed no fear of her though she hates me like poison which is a great comfort for i get rid of her out of lesson time and walking time it is perfectly easy to see that she has made the most of her opportunities with young armadale opportunities bytheby which we never calculated on and that she has been stupid enough to let him slip through her fingers when i tell you that she is obliged for the sake of appearances to go with her father and me to the little entertainments at thorpe ambrose and to see how young armadale admires me you will understand the kind of place i hold in her affections she would try me past all endurance if i didnt see that i aggravate her by keeping my temper so of course i keep it if i do break out it will be over our lessonsnot over our french our grammar history and globesbut over our music no words can say how i feel for her poor piano half the musical girls in england ought to have their fingers chopped off in the interests of society and if i had my way miss milroys fingers should be executed first  as for the major i can hardly stand higher in his estimation than i stand already i am always ready to make his breakfast and his daughter is not i can always find things for him when he loses them and his daughter cant i never yawn when he proses and his daughter does i like the poor dear harmless old gentleman so i wont say a word more about him  well here is a fair prospect for the future surely my good oldershaw there never was a prospect yet without an ugly place in it my prospect has two ugly places in it the name of one of them is mrs milroy and the name of the other is mr midwinter  mrs milroy first before i had been five minutes in the cottage on the day of my arrival what do you think she did she sent downstairs and asked to see me the message startled me a little after hearing from the old lady in london that her daughterinlaw was too great a sufferer to see anybody but of course when i got her message i had no choice but to go up stairs to the sickroom i found her bedridden with an incurable spinal complaint and a really horrible object to look at but with all her wits about her and if i am not greatly mistaken as deceitful a woman with as vile a temper as you could find anywhere in all your long experience her excessive politeness and her keeping her own face in the shade of the bedcurtains while she contrived to keep mine in the light put me on my guard the moment i entered the room we were more than half an hour together without my stepping into any one of the many clever little traps she laid for me the only mystery in her behavior which i failed to see through at the time was her perpetually asking me to bring her things things she evidently did not want from different parts of the room  since then events have enlightened me my first suspicions were raised by overhearing some of the servants gossip and i have been confirmed in my opinion by the conduct of mrs milroys nurse  on the few occasions when i have happened to be alone with the major the nurse has also happened to want something of her master and has invariably forgotten to announce her appearance by knocking at the door do you understand now why mrs milroy sent for me the moment i got into the house and what she wanted when she kept me going backward and forward first for one thing and then for another there is hardly an attractive light in which my face and figure can be seen in which that womans jealous eyes have not studied them already i am no longer puzzled to know why the father and daughter started and looked at each other when i was first presented to them or why the servants still stare at me with a mischievous expectation in their eyes when i ring the bell and ask them to do anything it is useless to disguise the truth mother oldershaw between you and me when i went upstairs into that sickroom i marched blindfold into the clutches of a jealous woman if mrs milroy can turn me out of the house mrs milroy will and morning and night she has nothing else to do in that bed prison of hers but to find out the way  in this awkward position my own cautious conduct is admirably seconded by the dear old majors perfect insensibility his wifes jealousy of him is as monstrous a delusion as any that could be found in a madhouse it is the growth of her own vile temper under the aggravation of an incurable illness the poor man hasnt a thought beyond his mechanical pursuits and i dont believe he knows at this moment whether i am a handsome woman or not with this chance to help me i may hope to set the nurses intrusions and the mistresss contrivances at defiancefor a time at any rate but you know what a jealous woman is and i think i know what mrs milroy is and i own i shall breathe more freely on the day when young armadale opens his foolish lips to some purpose and sets the major advertising for a new governess  armadales name reminds me of armadales friend there is more danger threatening in that quarter and what is worse i dont feel half as well armed beforehand against mr midwinter as i do against mrs milroy  everything about this man is more or less mysterious which i dont like to begin with how does he come to be in the confidence of the somersetshire clergyman how much has that clergyman told him how is it that he was so firmly persuaded when he spoke to me in the park that i was not the miss gwilt of whom his friend was in search i havent the ghost of an answer to give to any of those three questions i cant even discover who he is or how he and young armadale first became acquainted i hate him no i dont i only want to find out about him he is very young little and lean and active and dark with bright black eyes which say to me plainly we belong to a man with brains in his head and a will of his own a man who hasnt always been hanging about a country house in attendance on a fool yes i am positively certain mr midwinter has done something or suffered something in his past life young as he is and i would give i dont know what to get at it dont resent my taking up so much space in my writing about him he has influence enough over young armadale to be a very awkward obstacle in my way unless i can secure his good opinion at starting  well you may ask and what is to prevent your securing his good opinion i am sadly afraid mother oldershaw i have got it on terms i never bargained for i am sadly afraid the man is in love with me already  dont toss your head and say just like her vanity after the horrors i have gone through i have no vanity left and a man who admires me is a man who makes me shudder there was a time i ownpooh what am i writing sentiment i declare sentiment to you laugh away my dear as for me i neither laugh nor cry i mend my pen and get on with mywhat do the men call itmy report  the only thing worth inquiring is whether i am right or wrong in my idea of the impression i have made on him  let me see i have been four times in his company the first time was in the majors garden where we met unexpectedly face to face he stood looking at me like a man petrified without speaking a word the effect of my horrid red hair perhaps quite likely let us lay it on my hair the second time was in going over the thorpe ambrose grounds with young armadale on one side of me and my pupil in the sulks on the other out comes mr midwinter to join us though he had work to do in the stewards office which he had never been known to neglect on any other occasion laziness possibly or an attachment to miss milroy i cant say we will lay it on miss milroy if you like i only know he did nothing but look at me the third time was at the private interview in the park which i have told you of already i never saw a man so agitated at putting a delicate question to a woman in my life but that might have been only awkwardness and his perpetually looking back after me when we had parted might have been only looking back at the view lay it on the view by all means lay it on the view the fourth time was this very evening at the little party they made me play and as the piano was a good one i did my best all the company crowded round me and paid me their compliments my charming pupil paid hers with a face like a cats just before she spits except mr midwinter he waited till it was time to go and then he caught me alone for a moment in the hall there was just time for him to take my hand and say two words shall i tell you how he took my hand and what his voice sounded like when he spoke quite needless you have always told me that the late mr oldershaw doted on you just recall the first time he took your hand and whispered a word or two addressed to your private ear to what did you attribute his behavior that occasion i have no doubt if you had been playing on the piano in the course of the evening you would have attributed it entirely to the music  no you may take my word for it the harm is done this man is no rattlepated fool who changes his fancies as readily as he changes his clothes the fire that lights those big black eyes of his is not an easy fire when a woman has once kindled it for that woman to put out i dont wish to discourage you i dont say the changes are against us but with mrs milroy threatening me on one side and mr midwinter on the other the worst of all risks to run is the risk of losing time young armadale has hinted already as well as such a lout can hint at a private interview miss milroys eyes are sharp and the nurses eyes are sharper and i shall lose my place if either of them find me out no matter i must take my chance and give him the interview only let me get him alone only let me escape the prying eyes of the women andif his friend doesnt come between usi answer for the result  in the meantime have i anything more to tell you are there any other people in our way at thorpe ambrose not another creature none of the resident families call here young armadale being most fortunately in bad odor in the neighborhood there are no handsome highlybred women to come to the house and no persons of consequence to protest against his attentions to a governess the only guests he could collect at his party tonight were the lawyer and his family a wife a son and two daughters and a deaf old woman and her sonall perfectly unimportant people and all obedient humble servants of the stupid young squire  talking of obedient humble servants there is one other person established here who is employed in the stewards officea miserable shabby dilapidated old man named bashwood he is a perfect stranger to me and i am evidently a perfect stranger to him for he has been asking the housemaid at the cottage who i am it is paying no great compliment to myself to confess it but it is not the less true that i produced the most extraordinary impression on this feeble old creature the first time he saw me he turned all manner of colors and stood trembling and staring at me as if there was something perfectly frightful in my face i felt quite startled for the moment for of all the ways in which men have looked at me no man ever looked at me in that way before did you ever see the boa constrictor fed at the zoological gardens they put a live rabbit into his cage and there is a moment when the two creatures look at each other i declare mr bashwood reminded me of the rabbit  why do i mention this i dont know why perhaps i have been writing too long and my head is beginning to fail me perhaps mr bashwoods manner of admiring me strikes my fancy by its novelty absurd i am exciting myself and troubling you about nothing oh what a weary long letter i have written and how brightly the stars look at me through the window and how awfully quiet the night is send me some more of those sleeping drops and write me one of your nice wicked amusing letters you shall hear from me again as soon as i know a little better how it is all likely to end goodnight and keep a corner in your stony old heart for  l g   3 from mrs oldershaw to miss gwilt  diana street pimlico monday  my dear lydiai am in no state of mind to write you an amusing letter your news is very discouraging and the recklessness of your tone quite alarms me consider the money i have already advanced and the interests we both have at stake whatever else you are dont be reckless for heavens sake  what can i do i ask myself as a woman of business what can i do to help you i cant give you advice for i am not on the spot and i dont know how circumstances may alter from one day to another situated as we are now i can only be useful in one way i can discover a new obstacle that threatens you and i think i can remove it  you say with great truth that there never was a prospect yet without an ugly place in it and that there are two ugly places in your prospect my dear there may be three ugly places if i dont bestir myself to prevent it and the name of the third place will bebrock is it possible you can refer as you have done to the somersetshire clergyman and not see that the progress you make with young armadale will be sooner or later reported to him by young armadales friend why now i think of it you are doubly at the parsons mercy you are at the mercy of any fresh suspicion which may bring him into the neighborhood himself at a days notice and you are at the mercy of his interference the moment he hears that the squire is committing himself with a neighbors governess if i can do nothing else i can keep this additional difficulty out of your way and oh lydia with what alacrity i shall exert myself after the manner in which the old wretch insulted me when i told him that pitiable story in the street i declare i tingle with pleasure at this new prospect of making a fool of mr brock  and how is it to be done just as we have done it already to be sure he has lost miss gwilt otherwise my housemaid hasnt he very well he shall find her again wherever he is now suddenly settled within easy reach of him as long as she stops in the place he will stop in it and as we know he is not at thorpe ambrose there you are free of him the old gentlemans suspicions have given us a great deal of trouble so far let us turn them to some profitable account at last let us tie him by his suspicions to my housemaids apronstring most refreshing quite a moral retribution isnt it  the only help i need trouble you for is help you can easily give find out from mr midwinter where the parson is now and let me know by return of post if he is in london i will personally assist my housemaid in the necessary mystification of him if he is anywhere else i will send her after him accompanied by a person on whose discretion i can implicitly rely  you shall have the sleeping drops tomorrow in the meantime i say at the end what i said at the beginningno recklessness dont encourage poetical feelings by looking at the stars and dont talk about the night being awfully quiet there are people in observatories paid to look at the stars for you leave it to them and as for the night do what providence intended you to do with the night when providence provided you with eyelidsgo to sleep in it affectionately yours  maria oldershaw  4 from the reverend decimus brock to ozias midwinter  bascombe rectory west somerset thursday july 8  my dear midwinterone line before the post goes out to relieve you of all sense of responsibility at thorpe ambrose and to make my apologies to the lady who lives as governess in major milroys family  the miss gwiltor perhaps i ought to say the woman calling herself by that namehas to my unspeakable astonishment openly made her appearance here in my own parish she is staying at the inn accompanied by a plausiblelooking man who passes as her brother what this audacious proceeding really meansunless it marks a new step in the conspiracy against allan taken under new adviceis of course more than i can yet find out  my own idea is that they have recognized the impossibility of getting at allan without finding me or you as an obstacle in their way and that they are going to make a virtue of necessity by boldly trying to open their communications through me the man looks capable of any stretch of audacity and both he and the woman had the impudence to bow when i met them in the village half an hour since they have been making inquiries already about allans mother here where her exemplary life may set their closest scrutiny at defiance if they will only attempt to extort money as the price of the womans silence on the subject of poor mrs armadales conduct in madeira at the time of her marriage they will find me well prepared for them beforehand i have written by this post to my lawyers to send a competent man to assist me and he will stay at the rectory in any character which he thinks it safest to assume under present circumstances  you shall hear what happens in the next day or two  always truly yours decimus brock     xii the clouding of the sky  nine days had passed and the tenth day was nearly at an end since miss gwilt and her pupil had taken their morning walk in the cottage garden  the night was overcast since sunset there had been signs in the sky from which the popular forecast had predicted rain the receptionrooms at the great house were all empty and dark allan was away passing the evening with the milroys and midwinter was waiting his returnnot where midwinter usually waited among the books in the library but in the little back room which allans mother had inhabited in the last days of her residence at thorpe ambrose  nothing had been taken away but much had been added to the room since midwinter had first seen it the books which mrs armadale had left behind her the furniture the old matting on the floor the old paper on the walls were all undisturbed the statuette of niobe still stood on its bracket and the french window still opened on the garden but now to the relics left by the mother were added the personal possessions belonging to the son the wall bare hitherto was decorated with watercolor drawingswith a portrait of mrs armadale supported on one side by a view of the old house in somersetshire and on the other by a picture of the yacht among the books which bore in faded ink mrs armadales inscriptions from my father were other books inscribed in the same handwriting in brighter ink to my son hanging to the wall ranged on the chimneypiece scattered over the table were a host of little objects some associated with allans past life others necessary to his daily pleasures and pursuits and all plainly testifying that the room which he habitually occupied at thorpe ambrose was the very room which had once recalled to midwinter the second vision of the dream here strangely unmoved by the scene around him so lately the object of his superstitious distrust allans friend now waited composedly for allans return and here more strangely still he looked on a change in the household arrangements due in the first instance entirely to himself his own lips had revealed the discovery which he had made on the first morning in the new house his own voluntary act had induced the son to establish himself in the mothers room  under what motives had he spoken the words under no motives which were not the natural growth of the new interests and the new hopes that now animated him  the entire change wrought in his convictions by the memorable event that had brought him face to face with miss gwilt was a change which it was not in his nature to hide from allans knowledge he had spoken openly and had spoken as it was in his character to speak the merit of conquering his superstition was a merit which he shrank from claiming until he had first unsparingly exposed that superstition in its worst and weakest aspects to view  it was only after he had unreservedly acknowledged the impulse under which he had left allan at the mere that he had taken credit to himself for the new point of view from which he could now look at the dream then and not till then he had spoken of the fulfillment of the first vision as the doctor at the isle of man might have spoken of it he had asked as the doctor might have asked where was the wonder of their seeing a pool at sunset when they had a whole network of pools within a few hours drive of them and what was there extraordinary in discovering a woman at the mere when there were roads that led to it and villages in its neighborhood and boats employed on it and pleasure parties visiting it so again he had waited to vindicate the firmer resolution with which he looked to the future until he had first revealed all that he now saw himself of the errors of the past the abandonment of his friends interests the unworthiness of the confidence that had given him the stewards place the forgetfulness of the trust that mr brock had reposed in him all implied in the one idea of leaving allanwere all pointed out the glaring selfcontradictions betrayed in accepting the dream as the revelation of a fatality and in attempting to escape that fatality by an exertion of freewillin toiling to store up knowledge of the stewards duties for the future and in shrinking from letting the future find him in allans housewere in their turn unsparingly exposed to every error to every inconsistency he resolutely confessed before he ventured on the last simple appeal which closed all will you trust me in the future will you forgive and forget the past  a man who could thus open his whole heart without one lurking reserve inspired by consideration for himself was not a man to forget any minor act of concealment of which his weakness might have led him to be guilty toward his friend it lay heavy on midwinters conscience that he had kept secret from allan a discovery which he ought in allans dearest interests to have revealedthe discovery of his mothers room  but one doubt still closed his lipsthe doubt whether mrs armadales conduct in madeira had been kept secret on her return to england  careful inquiry first among the servants then among the tenantry careful consideration of the few reports current at the time as repeated to him by the few persons left who remembered them convinced him at last that the family secret had been successfully kept within the family limits once satisfied that whatever inquiries the son might make would lead to no disclosure which could shake his respect for his mothers memory midwinter had hesitated no longer he had taken allan into the room and had shown him the books on the shelves and all that the writing in the books disclosed he had said plainly my one motive for not telling you this before sprang from my dread of interesting you in the room which i looked at with horror as the second of the scenes pointed at in the dream forgive me this also and you will have forgiven me all  with allans love for his mothers memory but one result could follow such an avowal as this he had liked the little room from the first as a pleasant contrast to the oppressive grandeur of the other rooms at thorpe ambrose and now that he knew what associations were connected with it his resolution was at once taken to make it especially his own the same day all his personal possessions were collected and arranged in his mothers roomin midwinters presence and with midwinters assistance given to the work  under those circumstances had the change now wrought in the household arrangements been produced and in this way had midwinters victory over his own fatalismby making allan the daily occupant of a room which he might otherwise hardly ever have enteredactually favored the fulfillment of the second vision of the dream   the hour wore on quietly as allans friend sat waiting for allans return sometimes reading sometimes thinking placidly he whiled away the time no vexing cares no boding doubts troubled him now the rentday which he had once dreaded had come and gone harmlessly a friendlier understanding had been established between allan and his tenants mr bashwood had proved himself to be worthy of the confidence reposed in him the pedgifts father and son had amply justified their clients good opinion of them wherever midwinter looked the prospect was bright the future was without a cloud  he trimmed the lamp on the table beside him and looked out at the night the stable clock was chiming the halfhour past eleven as he walked to the window and the first raindrops were beginning to fall he had his hand on the bell to summon the servant and send him over to the cottage with an umbrella when he was stopped by hearing the familiar footstep on the walk outside  how late you are said midwinter as allan entered through the open french window was there a party at the cottage  no only ourselves the time slipped away somehow he answered in lower tones than usual and sighed as he took his chair  you seem to be out of spirits pursued midwinter whats the matter  allan hesitated i may as well tell you he said after a moment its nothing to be ashamed of i only wonder you havent noticed it before theres a woman in it as usualim in love  midwinter laughed has miss milroy been more charming tonight than ever he asked gayly  miss milroy repeated allan what are you thinking of im not in love with miss milroy  who is it then  who is it what a question to ask who can it be but miss gwilt  there was a sudden silence allan sat listlessly with his hands in his pockets looking out through the open window at the falling rain if he had turned toward his friend when he mentioned miss gwilts name he might possibly have been a little startled by the change he would have seen in midwinters face  i suppose you dont approve of it he said after waiting a little  there was no answer  its too late to make objections proceeded allan i really mean it when i tell you im in love with her  a fortnight since you were in love with miss milroy said the other in quiet measured tones  pooh a mere flirtation its different this time im in earnest about miss gwilt  he looked round as he spoke midwinter turned his face aside on the instant and bent it over a book  i see you dont approve of the thing allan went on do you object to her being only a governess you cant do that im sure if you were in my place her being only a governess wouldnt stand in the way with you  no said midwinter i cant honestly say it would stand in the way with me he gave the answer reluctantly and pushed his chair back out of the light of the lamp  a governess is a lady who is not rich said allan in an oracular manner and a duchess is a lady who is not poor and thats all the difference i acknowledge between them miss gwilt is older than i ami dont deny that what age do you guess her at midwinter i say seven or eight and twenty what do you say  nothing i agree with you  do you think seven or eight and twenty is too old for me if you were in love with a woman yourself you wouldnt think seven or eight and twenty too oldwould you  i cant say i should think it too old if  if you were really fond of her  once more there was no answer  well resumed allan if theres no harm in her being only a governess and no harm in her being a little older than i am whats the objection to miss gwilt  i have made no objection  i dont say you have but you dont seem to like the notion of it for all that  there was another pause midwinter was the first to break the silence this time  are you sure of yourself allan he asked with his face bent once more over the book are you really attached to this lady have you thought seriously already of asking her to be your wife  i am thinking seriously of it at this moment said allan i cant be happyi cant live without her upon my soul i worship the very ground she treads on  how long his voice faltered and he stopped how long he reiterated have you worshipped the very ground she treads on  longer than you think for i know i can trust you with all my secrets  dont trust me  nonsense i will trust you there is a little difficulty in the way which i havent mentioned yet its a matter of some delicacy and i want to consult you about it between ourselves i have had private opportunities with miss gwilt  midwinter suddenly started to his feet and opened the door  well talk of this tomorrow he said goodnight  allan looked round in astonishment the door was closed again and he was alone in the room  he has never shaken hands with me exclaimed allan looking bewildered at the empty chair  as the words passed his lips the door opened and midwinter appeared again  we havent shaken hands he said abruptly god bless you allan well talk of it tomorrow goodnight  allan stood alone at the window looking out at the pouring rain he felt ill at ease without knowing why midwinters ways get stranger and stranger he thought what can he mean by putting me off till tomorrow when i wanted to speak to him tonight he took up his bedroom candle a little impatiently put it down again and walking back to the open window stood looking out in the direction of the cottage i wonder if shes thinking of me he said to himself softly  she was thinking of him she had just opened her desk to write to mrs oldershaw and her pen had that moment traced the opening line make your mind easy i have got him     xiii exit  it rained all through the night and when the morning came it was raining still  contrary to his ordinary habit midwinter was waiting in the breakfastroom when allan entered it he looked worn and weary but his smile was gentler and his manner more composed than usual to allans surprise he approached the subject of the previous nights conversation of his own accord as soon as the servant was out of the room  i am afraid you thought me very impatient and very abrupt with you last night he said i will try to make amends for it this morning i will hear everything you wish to say to me on the subject of miss gwilt  i hardly like to worry you said allan you look as if you had had a bad nights rest  i have not slept well for some time past replied midwinter quietly something has been wrong with me but i believe i have found out the way to put myself right again without troubling the doctors late in the morning i shall have something to say to you about this let us get back first to what you were talking of last night you were speaking of some difficulty he hesitated and finished the sentence in a tone so low that allan failed to hear him perhaps it would be better he went on if instead of speaking to me you spoke to mr brock  i would rather speak to you said allan but tell me first was i right or wrong last night in thinking you disapproved of my falling in love with miss gwilt  midwinters lean nervous fingers began to crumble the bread in his plate his eyes looked away from allan for the first time  if you have any objection persisted allan i should like to hear it  midwinter suddenly looked up again his cheeks turning ashy pale and his glittering black eyes fixed full on allans face  you love her he said does she love you  you wont think me vain returned allan i told you yesterday i had had private opportunities with her  midwinters eyes dropped again to the crumbs on his plate i understand he interposed quickly you were wrong last night i had no objections to make  dont you congratulate me asked allan a little uneasily such a beautiful woman such a clever woman  midwinter held out his hand i owe you more than mere congratulations he said in anything which is for your happiness i owe you help he took allans hand and wrung it hard can i help you he asked growing paler and paler as he spoke  my dear fellow exclaimed allan what is the matter with you your hand is as cold as ice  midwinter smiled faintly i am always in extremes he said my hand was as hot as fire the first time you took it at the old westcountry inn come to that difficulty which you have not come to yet you are young rich your own masterand she loves you what difficulty can there be  allan hesitated i hardly know how to put it he replied as you said just now i love her and she loves me and yet there is a sort of strangeness between us one talks a good deal about ones self when one is in love at least i do ive told her all about myself and my mother and how i came in for this place and the rest of it wellthough it doesnt strike me when we are togetherit comes across me now and then when im away from her that she doesnt say much on her side in fact i know no more about her than you do  do you mean that you know nothing about miss gwilts family and friends  thats it exactly  have you never asked her about them  i said something of the sort the other day returned allan and im afraid as usual i said it in the wrong way she lookedi cant quite tell you how not exactly displeased butoh what things words are id give the world midwinter if i could only find the right word when i want it as well as you do  did miss gwilt say anything to you in the way of a reply  thats just what i was coming to she said i shall have a melancholy story to tell you one of these days mr armadale about myself and my family but you look so happy and the circumstances are so distressing that i have hardly the heart to speak of it now ah she can express herselfwith the tears in her eyes my dear fellow with the tears in her eyes of course i changed the subject directly and now the difficulty is how to get back to it delicately without making her cry again we must get back to it you know not on my account i am quite content to marry her first and hear of her family misfortunes poor thing afterward but i know mr brock if i cant satisfy him about her family when i write to tell him of this which of course i must do he will be dead against the whole thing im my own master of course and i can do as i like about it but dear old brock was such a good friend to my poor mother and he has been such a good friend to meyou see what i mean dont you  certainly allan mr brock has been your second father any disagreement between you about such a serious matter as this would be the saddest thing that could happen you ought to satisfy him that miss gwilt is what i am sure miss gwilt will prove to be worthy in every way worthy his voice sank in spite of him and he left the sentence unfinished  just my feeling in the matter allan struck in glibly now we can come to what i particularly wanted to consult you about if this was your case midwinter you would be able to say the right words to heryou would put it delicately even though you were putting it quite in the dark i cant do that im a blundering sort of fellow and im horribly afraid if i cant get some hint at the truth to help me at starting of saying something to distress her family misfortunes are such tender subjects to touch on especially with such a refined woman such a tenderhearted woman as miss gwilt there may have been some dreadful death in the familysome relation who has disgraced himselfsome infernal cruelty which has forced the poor thing out on the world as a governess well turning it over in my mind it struck me that the major might be able to put me on the right tack it is quite possible that he might have been informed of miss gwilts family circumstances before he engaged her isnt it  it is possible allan certainly  just my feeling again my notion is to speak to the major if i could only get the story from him first i should know so much better how to speak to miss gwilt about it afterward you advise me to try the major dont you  there was a pause before midwinter replied when he did answer it was a little reluctantly  i hardly know how to advise you allan he said this is a very delicate matter  i believe you would try the major if you were in my place returned allan reverting to his inveterately personal way of putting the question  perhaps i might said midwinter more and more unwillingly but if i did speak to the major i should be very careful in your place not to put myself in a false position i should be very careful to let no one suspect me of the meanness of prying into a womans secrets behind her back  allans face flushed good heavens midwinter he exclaimed who could suspect me of that  nobody allan who really knows you  the major knows me the major is the last man in the world to misunderstand me all i want him to do is to help me if he can to speak about a delicate subject to miss gwilt without hurting her feelings can anything be simpler between two gentlemen  instead of replying midwinter still speaking as constrainedly as ever asked a question on his side do you mean to tell major milroy he said what your intentions really are toward miss gwilt  allans manner altered he hesitated and looked confused  i have been thinking of that he replied and i mean to feel my way first and then tell him or not afterward as matters turn out  a proceeding so cautious as this was too strikingly inconsistent with allans character not to surprise any one who knew him midwinter showed his surprise plainly  you forget that foolish flirtation of mine with miss milroy allan went on more and more confusedly the major may have noticed it and may have thought i meantwell what i didnt mean it might be rather awkward mightnt it to propose to his face for his governess instead of his daughter  he waited for a word of answer but none came midwinter opened his lips to speak and suddenly checked himself allan uneasy at his silence doubly uneasy under certain recollections of the majors daughter which the conversation had called up rose from the table and shortened the interview a little impatiently  come come he said dont sit there looking unutterable things dont make mountains out of molehills you have such an old old head midwinter on those young shoulders of yours lets have done with all these pros and cons do you mean to tell me in plain words that it wont do to speak to the major  i cant take the responsibility allan of telling you that to be plainer still i cant feel confident of the soundness of any advice i may give you inin our present position toward each other all i am sure of is that i cannot possibly be wrong in entreating you to do two things  what are they  if you speak to major milroy pray remember the caution i have given you pray think of what you say before you say it  ill think never fear what next  before you take any serious step in this matter write and tell mr brock will you promise me to do that  with all my heart anything more  nothing more i have said my last words  allan led the way to the door come into my room he said and ill give you a cigar the servants will be in here directly to clear away and i want to go on talking about miss gwilt  dont wait for me said midwinter ill follow you in a minute or two  he remained seated until allan had closed the door then rose and took from a corner of the room where it lay hidden behind one of the curtains a knapsack ready packed for traveling as he stood at the window thinking with the knapsack in his hand a strangely old careworn look stole over his face he seemed to lose the last of his youth in an instant   what the womans quicker insight had discovered days since the mans slower perception had only realized in the past night the pang that had wrung him when he heard allans avowal had set the truth selfrevealed before midwinter for the first time he had been conscious of looking at miss gwilt with new eyes and a new mind on the next occasion when they met after the memorable interview in major milroys garden but he had never until now known the passion that she had roused in him for what it really was knowing it at last feeling it consciously in full possession of him he had the courage which no man with a happier experience of life would have possessedthe courage to recall what allan had confided to him and to look resolutely at the future through his own grateful remembrances of the past  steadfastly through the sleepless hours of the night he had bent his mind to the conviction that he must conquer the passion which had taken possession of him for allans sake and that the one way to conquer it wasto go no afterdoubt as to the sacrifice had troubled him when morning came and no afterdoubt troubled him now the one question that kept him hesitating was the question of leaving thorpe ambrose though mr brocks letter relieved him from all necessity of keeping watch in norfolk for a woman who was known to be in somersetshire though the duties of the stewards office were duties which might be safely left in mr bashwoods tried and trustworthy handsstill admitting these considerations his mind was not easy at the thought of leaving allan at a time when a crisis was approaching in allans life  he slung the knapsack loosely over his shoulder and put the question to his conscience for the last time can you trust yourself to see her day by day as you must see hercan you trust yourself to hear him talk of her hour by hour as you must hear himif you stay in this house again the answer came as it had come all through the night again his heart warned him in the very interests of the friendship that he held sacred to go while the time was his own to go before the woman who had possessed herself of his love had possessed herself of his power of selfsacrifice and his sense of gratitude as well  he looked round the room mechanically before he turned to leave it every remembrance of the conversation that had just taken place between allan and himself pointed to the same conclusion and warned him as his own conscience had warned him to go  had he honestly mentioned any one of the objections which he or any man must have seen to allans attachment had heas his knowledge of his friends facile character bound him to dowarned allan to distrust his own hasty impulses and to test himself by time and absence before he made sure that the happiness of his whole life was bound up in miss gwilt no the bare doubt whether in speaking of these things he could feel that he was speaking disinterestedly had closed his lips and would close his lips for the future till the time for speaking had gone by was the right man to restrain allan the man who would have given the world if he had it to stand in allans place there was but one plain course of action that an honest man and a grateful man could follow in the position in which he stood far removed from all chance of seeing her and from all chance of hearing of heralone with his own faithful recollection of what he owed to his friendhe might hope to fight it down as he had fought down the tears in his childhood under his gypsy masters stick as he had fought down the misery of his lonely youth time in the country booksellers shop i must go he said as he turned wearily from the window before she comes to the house again i must go before another hour is over my head  with that resolution he left the room and in leaving it took the irrevocable step from present to future   the rain was still falling the sullen sky all round the horizon still lowered watery and dark when midwinter equipped for traveling appeared in allans room  good heavens cried allan pointing to the knapsack what does that mean  nothing very extraordinary said midwinter it only meansgoodby  goodby repeated allan starting to his feet in astonishment  midwinter put him back gently into his chair and drew a seat near to it for himself  when you noticed that i looked ill this morning he said i told you that i had been thinking of a way to recover my health and that i meant to speak to you about it later in the day that latter time has come i have been out of sorts as the phrase is for some time past you have remarked it yourself allan more than once and with your usual kindness you have allowed it to excuse many things in my conduct which would have been otherwise unpardonable even in your friendly eyes  my dear fellow interposed allan you dont mean to say you are going out on a walking tour in this pouring rain  never mind the rain rejoined midwinter the rain and i are old friends you know something allan of the life i led before you met with me from the time when i was a child i have been used to hardship and exposure night and day sometimes for months together i never had my head under a roof for years and years the life of a wild animalperhaps i ought to say the life of a savagewas the life i led while you were at home and happy i have the leaven of the vagabondthe vagabond animal or the vagabond man i hardly know whichin me still does it distress you to hear me talk of myself in this way i wont distress you i will only say that the comfort and the luxury of our life here are at times i think a little too much for a man to whom comforts and luxuries come as strange things i want nothing to put me right again but more air and exercise fewer good breakfasts and dinners my dear friend than i get here let me go back to some of the hardships which this comfortable house is expressly made to shut out let me meet the wind and weather as i used to meet them when i was a boy let me feel weary again for a little while without a carriage near to pick me up and hungry when the night falls with miles of walking between my supper and me give me a week or two away allanup northward on foot to the yorkshire moorsand i promise to return to thorpe ambrose better company for you and for your friends i shall be back before you have time to miss me mr bashwood will take care of the business in the office it is only for a fortnight and it is for my own goodlet me go  i dont like it said allan i dont like your leaving me in this sudden manner theres something so strange and dreary about it why not try riding if you want more exercise all the horses in the stables are at your disposal at all events you cant possibly go today look at the rain  midwinter looked toward the window and gently shook his head  i thought nothing of the rain he said when i was a mere child getting my living with the dancing dogswhy should i think anything of it now my getting wet and your getting wet allan are two very different things when i was a fishermans boy in the hebrides i hadnt a dry thread on me for weeks together  but youre not in the hebrides now persisted allan and i expect our friends from the cottage tomorrow evening you cant start till after tomorrow miss gwilt is going to give us some more music and you know you like miss gwilts playing  midwinter turned aside to buckle the straps of his knapsack give me another chance of hearing miss gwilt when i come back he said with his head down and his fingers busy at the straps  you have one fault my dear fellow and it grows on you remonstrated allan when you have once taken a thing into our head youre the most obstinate man alive theres no persuading you to listen to reason if you will go added allan suddenly rising as midwinter took up his hat and stick in silence i have half a mind to go with you and try a little roughing it too  go with me repeated midwinter with a momentary bitterness in his tone and leave miss gwilt  allan sat down again and admitted the force of the objection in significant silence without a word more on his side midwinter held out his hand to take leave they were both deeply moved and each was anxious to hide his agitation from the other allan took the last refuge which his friends firmness left to him he tried to lighten the farewell moment by a joke  ill tell you what he said i begin to doubt if youre quite cured yet of your belief in the dream i suspect youre running away from me after all  midwinter looked at him uncertain whether he was in jest or earnest what do you mean he asked  what did you tell me retorted allan when you took me in here the other day and made a clean breast of it what did you say about this room and the second vision of the dream by jupiter he exclaimed starting to his feet once more now i look again here is the second vision theres the rain pattering against the windowtheres the lawn and the garden outsidehere am i where i stood in the dreamand there are you where the shadow stood the whole scene complete outofdoors and in and ive discovered it this time  a moments life stirred again in the dead remains of midwinters superstition his color changed and he eagerly almost fiercely disputed allans conclusion  no he said pointing to the little marble figure on the bracket the scene is not completeyou have forgotten something as usual the dream is wrong this time thank godutterly wrong in the vision you saw the statue was lying in fragments on the floor and you were stooping over them with a troubled and an angry mind there stands the statue safe and sound and you havent the vestige of an angry feeling in your mind have you he seized allan impulsively by the hand at the same moment the consciousness came to him that he was speaking and acting as earnestly as if he still believed in the dream the color rushed back over his face and he turned away in confused silence  what did i tell you said allan laughing a little uneasily that night on the wreck is hanging on your mind as heavily as ever  nothing hangs heavy on me retorted midwinter with a sudden outburst of impatience but the knapsack on my back and the time im wasting here ill go out and see if its likely to clear up  youll come back interposed allan  midwinter opened the french window and stepped out into the garden  yes he said answering with all his former gentleness of manner ill come back in a fortnight goodby allan and good luck with miss gwilt  he pushed the window to and was away across the garden before his friend could open it again and follow him  allan rose and took one step into the garden then checked himself at the window and returned to his chair he knew midwinter well enough to feel the total uselessness of attempting to follow him or to call him back he was gone and for two weeks to come there was no hope of seeing him again an hour or more passed the rain still fell and the sky still threatened a heavier and heavier sense of loneliness and despondencythe sense of all others which his previous life had least fitted him to understand and endurepossessed itself of allans mind in sheer horror of his own uninhabitably solitary house he rang for his hat and umbrella and resolved to take refuge in the majors cottage  i might have gone a little way with him thought allan his mind still running on midwinter as he put on his hat i should like to have seen the dear old fellow fairly started on his journey  he took his umbrella if he had noticed the face of the servant who gave it to him he might possibly have asked some questions and might have heard some news to interest him in his present frame of mind as it was he went out without looking at the man and without suspecting that his servants knew more of midwinters last moments at thorpe ambrose than he knew himself not ten minutes since the grocer and butcher had called in to receive payment of their bills and the grocer and the butcher had seen how midwinter started on his journey  the grocer had met him first not far from the house stopping on his way in the pouring rain to speak to a little ragged imp of a boy the pest of the neighborhood the boys customary impudence had broken out even more unrestrainedly than usual at the sight of the gentlemans knapsack and what had the gentleman done in return he had stopped and looked distressed and had put his two hands gently on the boys shoulders the grocers own eyes had seen that and the grocers own ears had heard him say poor little chap i know how the wind gnaws and the rain wets through a ragged jacket better than most people who have got a good coat on their backs and with those words he had put his hand in his pocket and had rewarded the boys impudence with a present of a shilling wrong hereabouts said the grocer touching his forehead thats my opinion of mr armadales friend  the butcher had seen him further on in the journey at the other end of the town he had stoppedagain in the pouring rainand this time to look at nothing more remarkable than a halfstarved cur shivering on a doorstep i had my eye on him said the butcher and what do you think he did he crossed the road over to my shop and bought a bit of meat fit for a christian very well he says goodmorning and crosses back again and on the word of a man down he goes on his knees on the wet doorstep and out he takes his knife and cuts up the meat and gives it to the dog meat i tell you again fit for a christian im not a hard man maam concluded the butcher addressing the cook but meats meat and it will serve your masters friend right if he lives to want it  with those old unforgotten sympathies of the old unforgotten time to keep him company on his lonely road he had left the town behind him and had been lost to view in the misty rain the grocer and the butcher had seen the last of him and had judged a great nature as all natures are judged from the grocer and the butcher point of view  the end of the second book     book the third     i mrs milroy  two days after midwinters departure from thorpe ambrose mrs milroy having completed her morning toilet and having dismissed her nurse rang the bell again five minutes afterward and on the womans reappearance asked impatiently if the post had come in  post echoed the nurse havent you got your watch dont you know that its a good halfhour too soon to ask for your letters she spoke with the confident insolence of a servant long accustomed to presume on her mistresss weakness and her mistresss necessities mrs milroy on her side appeared to be well used to her nurses manner she gave her orders composedly without noticing it  when the postman does come she said see him yourself i am expecting a letter which i ought to have had two days since i dont understand it im beginning to suspect the servants  the nurse smiled contemptuously whom will you suspect next she asked there dont put yourself out ill answer the gatebell this morning and well see if i cant bring you a letter when the postman comes saying those words with the tone and manner of a woman who is quieting a fractious child the nurse without waiting to be dismissed left the room  mrs milroy turned slowly and wearily on her bed when she was left by herself again and let the light from the window fall on her face it was the face of a woman who had once been handsome and who was still so far as years went in the prime of her life longcontinued suffering of body and longcontinued irritation of mind had worn her awayin the roughly expressive popular phraseto skin and bone the utter wreck of her beauty was made a wreck horrible to behold by her desperate efforts to conceal the sight of it from her own eyes from the eyes of her husband and her child from the eyes even of the doctor who attended her and whose business it was to penetrate to the truth her head from which the greater part of the hair had fallen off would have been less shocking to see than the hideously youthful wig by which she tried to hide the loss no deterioration of her complexion no wrinkling of her skin could have been so dreadful to look at as the rouge that lay thick on her cheeks and the white enamel plastered on her forehead the delicate lace and the bright trimming on her dressinggown the ribbons in her cap and the rings on her bony fingers all intended to draw the eye away from the change that had passed over her directed the eye to it on the contrary emphasized it made it by sheer force of contrast more hopeless and more horrible than it really was an illustrated book of the fashions in which women were represented exhibiting their finery by means of the free use of their limbs lay on the bed from which she had not moved for years without being lifted by her nurse a handglass was placed with the book so that she could reach it easily she took up the glass after her attendant had left the room and looked at her face with an unblushing interest and attention which she would have been ashamed of herself at the age of eighteen  older and older and thinner and thinner she said the major will soon be a free man but ill have that redhaired hussy out of the house first  she dropped the lookingglass on the counterpane and clinched the hand that held it her eyes suddenly riveted themselves on a little crayon portrait of her husband hanging on the opposite wall they looked at the likeness with the hard and cruel brightness of the eyes of a bird of prey red is your taste in your old age is it she said to the portrait red hair and a scrofulous complexion and a padded figure a balletgirls walk and a pickpockets light fingers miss gwilt miss with those eyes and that walk she turned her head suddenly on the pillow and burst into a harsh jeering laugh miss she repeated over and over again with the venomously pointed emphasis of the most merciless of all human forms of contemptthe contempt of one woman for another  the age we live in is an age which finds no human creature inexcusable is there an excuse for mrs milroy let the story of her life answer the question  she had married the major at an unusually early age and in marrying him had taken a man for her husband who was old enough to be her fathera man who at that time had the reputation and not unjustly of having made the freest use of his social gifts and his advantages of personal appearance in the society of women indifferently educated and below her husband in station she had begun by accepting his addresses under the influence of her own flattered vanity and had ended by feeling the fascination which major milroy had exercised over women infinitely her mental superiors in his earlier life he had been touched on his side by her devotion and had felt in his turn the attraction of her beauty her freshness and her youth up to the time when their little daughter and only child had reached the age of eight years their married life had been an unusually happy one at that period the double misfortune fell on the household of the failure of the wifes health and the almost total loss of the husbands fortune and from that moment the domestic happiness of the married pair was virtually at an end  having reached the age when men in general are readier under the pressure of calamity to resign themselves than to resist the major had secured the little relics of his property had retired into the country and had patiently taken refuge in his mechanical pursuits a woman nearer to him in age or a woman with a better training and more patience of disposition than his wife possessed would have understood the majors conduct and have found consolation in the majors submission mrs milroy found consolation in nothing neither nature nor training helped her to meet resignedly the cruel calamity which had struck at her in the bloom of womanhood and the prime of beauty the curse of incurable sickness blighted her at once and for life  suffering can and does develop the latent evil that there is in humanity as well as the latent good the good that was in mrs milroys nature shrank up under that subtly deteriorating influence in which the evil grew and flourished month by month as she became the weaker woman physically she became the worse woman morally all that was mean cruel and false in her expanded in steady proportion to the contraction of all that had once been generous gentle and true old suspicions of her husbands readiness to relapse into the irregularities of his bachelor life which in her healthier days of mind and body she had openly confessed to himwhich she had always sooner or later seen to be suspicions that he had not deservedcame back now that sickness had divorced her from him in the form of that baser conjugal distrust which keeps itself cunningly secret which gathers together its inflammatory particles atom by atom into a heap and sets the slowly burning frenzy of jealousy alight in the mind no proof of her husbands blameless and patient life that could now be shown to mrs milroy no appeal that could be made to her respect for herself or for her child growing up to womanhood availed to dissipate the terrible delusion born of her hopeless illness and growing steadily with its growth like all other madness it had its ebb and flow its time of spasmodic outburst and its time of deceitful repose but active or passive it was always in her it had injured innocent servants and insulted blameless strangers it had brought the first tears of shame and sorrow into her daughters eyes and had set the deepest lines that scored it in her husbands face it had made the secret misery of the little household for years and it was now to pass beyond the family limits and to influence coming events at thorpe ambrose in which the future interests of allan and allans friend were vitally concerned  a moments glance at the posture of domestic affairs in the cottage prior to the engagement of the new governess is necessary to the due appreciation of the serious consequences that followed miss gwilts appearance on the scene  on the marriage of the governess who had lived in his service for many years a woman of an age and an appearance to set even mrs milroys jealousy at defiance the major had considered the question of sending his daughter away from home far more seriously than his wife supposed he was conscious that scenes took place in the house at which no young girl should be present but he felt an invincible reluctance to apply the one efficient remedythe keeping his daughter away from home in school time and holiday time alike the struggle thus raised in his mind once set at rest by the resolution to advertise for a new governess major milroys natural tendency to avoid trouble rather than to meet it had declared itself in its customary manner he had closed his eyes again on his home anxieties as quietly as usual and had gone back as he had gone back on hundreds of previous occasions to the consoling society of his old friend the clock  it was far otherwise with the majors wife the chance which her husband had entirely overlooked that the new governess who was to come might be a younger and a more attractive woman than the old governess who had gone was the first chance that presented itself as possible to mrs milroys mind she had said nothing secretly waiting and secretly nursing her inveterate distrust she had encouraged her husband and her daughter to leave her on the occasion of the picnic with the express purpose of making an opportunity for seeing the new governess alone the governess had shown herself and the smoldering fire of mrs milroys jealousy had burst into flame in the moment when she and the handsome stranger first set eyes on each other  the interview over mrs milroys suspicions fastened at once and immovably on her husbands mother  she was well aware that there was no one else in london on whom the major could depend to make the necessary inquiries she was well aware that miss gwilt had applied for the situation in the first instance as a stranger answering an advertisement published in a newspaper yet knowing this she had obstinately closed her eyes with the blind frenzy of the blindest of all the passions to the facts straight before her and looking back to the last of many quarrels between them which had ended in separating the elder lady and herself had seized on the conclusion that miss gwilts engagement was due to her motherinlaws vindictive enjoyment of making mischief in her household the inference which the very servants themselves witnesses of the family scandal had correctly drawnthat the majors mother in securing the services of a wellrecommended governess for her son had thought it no part of her duty to consider that governesss looks in the purely fanciful interests of the majors wifewas an inference which it was simply impossible to convey into mrs milroys mind miss gwilt had barely closed the sickroom door when the whispered words hissed out of mrs milroys lips before another week is over your head my lady you go  from that moment through the wakeful night and the weary day the one object of the bedridden womans life was to procure the new governesss dismissal from the house  the assistance of the nurse in the capacity of spy was securedas mrs milroy had been accustomed to secure other extra services which her attendant was not bound to render herby a present of a dress from the mistresss wardrobe one after another articles of wearing apparel which were now useless to mrs milroy had ministered in this way to feed the nurses greedthe insatiable greed of an ugly woman for fine clothes bribed with the smartest dress she had secured yet the household spy took her secret orders and applied herself with a vile enjoyment of it to her secret work  the days passed the work went on but nothing had come of it mistress and servant had a woman to deal with who was a match for both of them  repeated intrusions on the major when the governess happened to be in the same room with him failed to discover the slightest impropriety of word look or action on either side stealthy watching and listening at the governesss bedroom door detected that she kept a light in her room at late hours of the night and that she groaned and ground her teeth in her sleepand detected nothing more careful superintendence in the daytime proved that she regularly posted her own letters instead of giving them to the servant and that on certain occasions when the occupation of her hours out of lesson time and walking time was left at her own disposal she had been suddenly missed from the garden and then caught coming back alone to it from the park once and once only the nurse had found an opportunity of following her out of the garden had been detected immediately in the park and had been asked with the most exasperating politeness if she wished to join miss gwilt in a walk small circumstances of this kind which were sufficiently suspicious to the mind of a jealous woman were discovered in abundance but circumstances on which to found a valid ground of complaint that might be laid before the major proved to be utterly wanting day followed day and miss gwilt remained persistently correct in her conduct and persistently irreproachable in her relations toward her employer and her pupil  foiled in this direction mrs milroy tried next to find an assailable place in the statement which the governesss reference had made on the subject of the governesss character  obtaining from the major the minutely careful report which his mother had addressed to him on this topic mrs milroy read and reread it and failed to find the weak point of which she was in search in any part of the letter all the customary questions on such occasions had been asked and all had been scrupulously and plainly answered the one sole opening for an attack which it was possible to discover was an opening which showed itself after more practical matters had been all disposed of in the closing sentences of the letter  i was so struck the passage ran by the grace and distinction of miss gwilts manners that i took an opportunity when she was out of the room of asking how she first came to be governess in the usual way i was told a sad family misfortune in which she behaved nobly she is a very sensitive person and shrinks from speaking of it among strangersa natural reluctance which i have always felt it a matter of delicacy to respect hearing this of course i felt the same delicacy on my side it was no part of my duty to intrude on the poor things private sorrows my only business was to do what i have now done to make sure that i was engaging a capable and respectable governess to instruct my grandchild  after careful consideration of these lines mrs milroy having a strong desire to find circumstances suspicious found them suspicious accordingly she determined to sift the mystery of miss gwilts family misfortunes to the bottom on the chance of extracting from it something useful to her purpose there were two ways of doing this she might begin by questioning the governess herself or she might begin by questioning the governesss reference experience of miss gwilts quickness of resource in dealing with awkward questions at their introductory interview decided her on taking the latter course ill get the particulars from the reference first thought mrs milroy and then question the creature herself and see if the two stories agree  the letter of inquiry was short and scrupulously to the point  mrs milroy began by informing her correspondent that the state of her health necessitated leaving her daughter entirely under the governesss influence and control on that account she was more anxious than most mothers to be thoroughly informed in every respect about the person to whom she confided the entire charge of an only child and feeling this anxiety she might perhaps be excused for putting what might be thought after the excellent character miss gwilt had received a somewhat unnecessary question with that preface mrs milroy came to the point and requested to be informed of the circumstances which had obliged miss gwilt to go out as a governess  the letter expressed in these terms was posted the same day on the morning when the answer was due no answer appeared the next morning arrived and still there was no reply when the third morning came mrs milroys impatience had broken loose from all restraint she had rung for the nurse in the manner which has been already recorded and had ordered the woman to be in waiting to receive the letters of the morning with her own hands in this position matters now stood and in these domestic circumstances the new series of events at thorpe ambrose took their rise   mrs milroy had just looked at her watch and had just put her hand once more to the bellpull when the door opened and the nurse entered the room  has the postman come asked mrs milroy  the nurse laid a letter on the bed without answering and waited with unconcealed curiosity to watch the effect which it produced on her mistress  mrs milroy tore open the envelope the instant it was in her hand a printed paper appeared which she threw aside surrounding a letter which she looked at in her own handwriting she snatched up the printed paper it was the customary postoffice circular informing her that her letter had been duly presented at the right address and that the person whom she had written to was not to be found  something wrong asked the nurse detecting a change in her mistresss face  the question passed unheeded mrs milroys writingdesk was on the table at the bedside she took from it the letter which the majors mother had written to her son and turned to the page containing the name and address of miss gwilts reference mrs mandeville 18 kingsdown crescent bayswater she read eagerly to herself and then looked at the address on her own returned letter no error had been committed the directions were identically the same  something wrong reiterated the nurse advancing a step nearer to the bed  thank godyes cried mrs milroy with a sudden outburst of exultation she tossed the postoffice circular to the nurse and beat her bony hands on the bedclothes in an ecstasy of anticipated triumph miss gwilts an impostor miss gwilts an impostor if i die for it rachel ill be carried to the window to see the police take her away  its one thing to say shes an impostor behind her back and another thing to prove it to her face remarked the nurse she put her hand as she spoke into her apron pocket and with a significant look at her mistress silently produced a second letter  for me asked mrs milroy  no said the nurse for miss gwilt  the two women eyed each other and understood each other without another word  where is she said mrs milroy  the nurse pointed in the direction of the park out again for another walk before breakfastby herself  mrs milroy beckoned to the nurse to stoop close over her can you open it rachel she whispered  rachel nodded  can you close it again so that nobody would know  can you spare the scarf that matches your pearl gray dress asked rachel  take it said mrs milroy impatiently  the nurse opened the wardrobe in silence took the scarf in silence and left the room in silence in less than five minutes she came back with the envelope of miss gwilts letter open in her hand  thank you maam for the scarf said rachel putting the open letter composedly on the counterpane of the bed  mrs milroy looked at the envelope it had been closed as usual by means of adhesive gum which had been made to give way by the application of steam as mrs milroy took out the letter her hand trembled violently and the white enamel parted into cracks over the wrinkles on her forehead  rachel withdrew to the window to keep watch on the park dont hurry she said no signs of her yet  mrs milroy still paused keeping the allimportant morsel of paper folded in her hand she could have taken miss gwilts life but she hesitated at reading miss gwilts letter  are you troubled with scruples asked the nurse with a sneer consider it a duty you owe to your daughter  you wretch said mrs milroy with that expression of opinion she opened the letter  it was evidently written in great haste was undated and was signed in initials only thus it ran  diana street  my dear lydiathe cab is waiting at the door and i have only a moment to tell you that i am obliged to leave london on business for three or four days or a week at longest my letters will be forwarded if you write i got yours yesterday and i agree with you that it is very important to put him off the awkward subject of yourself and your family as long as you safely can the better you know him the better you will be able to make up the sort of story that will do once told you will have to stick to it and having to stick to it beware of making it complicated and beware of making it in a hurry i will write again about this and give you my own ideas in the meantime dont risk meeting him too often in the park  yours m o  well asked the nurse returning to the bedside have you done with it  meeting him in the park repeated mrs milroy with her eyes still fastened on the letter him rachel where is the major  in his own room  i dont believe it  have your own way i want the letter and the envelope  can you close it again so that she wont know  what i can open i can shut anything more  nothing more  mrs milroy was left alone again to review her plan of attack by the new light that had now been thrown on miss gwilt  the information that had been gained by opening the governesss letter pointed plainly to the conclusion that an adventuress had stolen her way into the house by means of a false reference but having been obtained by an act of treachery which it was impossible to acknowledge it was not information that could be used either for warning the major or for exposing miss gwilt the one available weapon in mrs milroys hands was the weapon furnished by her own returned letter and the one question to decide was how to make the best and speediest use of it  the longer she turned the matter over in her mind the more hasty and premature seemed the exultation which she had felt at the first sight of the postoffice circular that a lady acting as reference to a governess should have quitted her residence without leaving any trace behind her and without even mentioning an address to which her letters could be forwarded was a circumstance in itself sufficiently suspicious to be mentioned to the major but mrs milroy however perverted her estimate of her husband might be in some respects knew enough of his character to be assured that if she told him what had happened he would frankly appeal to the governess herself for an explanation miss gwilts quickness and cunning would in that case produce some plausible answer on the spot which the majors partiality would be only too ready to accept and she would at the same time no doubt place matters in train by means of the post for the due arrival of all needful confirmation on the part of her accomplice in london to keep strict silence for the present and to institute without the governesss knowledge such inquiries as might be necessary to the discovery of undeniable evidence was plainly the only safe course to take with such a man as the major and with such a woman as miss gwilt helpless herself to whom could mrs milroy commit the difficult and dangerous task of investigation the nurse even if she was to be trusted could not be spared at a days notice and could not be sent away without the risk of exciting remark was there any other competent and reliable person to employ either at thorpe ambrose or in london mrs milroy turned from side to side of the bed searching every corner of her mind for the needful discovery and searching in vain oh if i could only lay my hand on some man i could trust she thought despairingly if i only knew where to look for somebody to help me  as the idea passed through her mind the sound of her daughters voice startled her from the other side of the door  may i come in asked neelie  what do you want returned mrs milroy impatiently  i have brought up your breakfast mamma  my breakfast repeated mrs milroy in surprise why doesnt rachel bring it up as usual she considered a moment and then called out sharply come in     ii the man is found  neelie entered the room carrying the tray with the tea the dry toast and the pat of butter which composed the invalids invariable breakfast  what does this mean asked mrs milroy speaking and looking as she might have spoken and looked if the wrong servant had come into the room  neelie put the tray down on the bedside table i thought i should like to bring you up your breakfast mamma for once in a way she replied and i asked rachel to let me  come here said mrs milroy and wish me goodmorning  neelie obeyed as she stooped to kiss her mother mrs milroy caught her by the arm and turned her roughly to the light there were plain signs of disturbance and distress in her daughters face a deadly thrill of terror ran through mrs milroy on the instant she suspected that the opening of the letter had been discovered by miss gwilt and that the nurse was keeping out of the way in consequence  let me go mamma said neelie shrinking under her mothers grasp you hurt me  tell me why you have brought up my breakfast this morning persisted mrs milroy  i have told you mamma  you have not you have made an excuse i see it in your face come what is it  neelies resolution gave way before her mothers she looked aside uneasily at the things in the tray i have been vexed she said with an effort and i didnt want to stop in the breakfastroom i wanted to come up here and to speak to you  vexed who has vexed you what has happened has miss gwilt anything to do with it  neelie looked round again at her mother in sudden curiosity and alarm mamma she said you read my thoughts i declare you frighten me it was miss gwilt  before mrs milroy could say a word more on her side the door opened and the nurse looked in  have you got what you want she asked as composedly as usual miss there insisted on taking your tray up this morning has she broken anything  go to the window i want to speak to rachel said mrs milroy  as soon as her daughters back was turned she beckoned eagerly to the nurse anything wrong she asked in a whisper do you think she suspects us  the nurse turned away with her hard sneering smile i told you it should be done she said and it has been done she hasnt the ghost of a suspicion i waited in the room and i saw her take up the letter and open it  mrs milroy drew a deep breath of relief thank you she said loud enough for her daughter to hear i want nothing more  the nurse withdrew and neelie came back from the window mrs milroy took her by the hand and looked at her more attentively and more kindly than usual her daughter interested her that morning for her daughter had something to say on the subject of miss gwilt  i used to think that you promised to be pretty child she said cautiously resuming the interrupted conversation in the least direct way but you dont seem to be keeping your promise you look out of health and out of spirits what is the matter with you  if there had been any sympathy between mother and child neelie might have owned the truth she might have said frankly i am looking ill because my life is miserable to me i am fond of mr armadale and mr armadale was once fond of me we had one little disagreement only one in which i was to blame i wanted to tell him so at the time and i have wanted to tell him so ever since and miss gwilt stands between us and prevents me she has made us like strangers she has altered him and taken him away from me he doesnt look at me as he did he doesnt speak to me as he did he is never alone with me as he used to be i cant say the words to him that i long to say and i cant write to him for it would look as if i wanted to get him back it is all over between me and mr armadale and it is that womans fault there is illblood between miss gwilt and me the whole day long and say what i may and do what i may she always gets the better of me and always puts me in the wrong everything i saw at thorpe ambrose pleased me everything i did at thorpe ambrose made me happy before she came nothing pleases me and nothing makes me happy now if neelie had ever been accustomed to ask her mothers advice and to trust herself to her mothers love she might have said such words as these as it was the tears came into her eyes and she hung her head in silence  come said mrs milroy beginning to lose patience you have something to say to me about miss gwilt what is it  neelie forced back her tears and made an effort to answer  she aggravates me beyond endurance mamma i cant bear her i shall do something neelie stopped and stamped her foot angrily on the floor i shall throw something at her head if we go on much longer like this i should have thrown something this morning if i hadnt left the room oh do speak to papa about it do find out some reason for sending her away ill go to schoolill do anything in the world to get rid of miss gwilt  to get rid of miss gwilt at those wordsat that echo from her daughters lips of the one dominant desire kept secret in her own heartmrs milroy slowly raised herself in bed what did it mean was the help she wanted coming from the very last of all quarters in which she could have thought of looking for it  why do you want to get rid of miss gwilt she asked what have you got to complain of  nothing said neelie thats the aggravation of it miss gwilt wont let me have anything to complain of she is perfectly detestable she is driving me mad and she is the pink of propriety all the time i dare say its wrong but i dont carei hate her  mrs milroys eyes questioned her daughters face as they had never questioned it yet there was something under the surface evidentlysomething which it might be of vital importance to her own purpose to discoverwhich had not risen into view she went on probing her way deeper and deeper into neelies mind with a warmer and warmer interest in neelies secret  pour me out a cup of tea she said and dont excite yourself my dear why do you speak to me about this why dont you speak to your father  i have tried to speak to papa said neelie but its no use he is too good to know what a wretch she is she is always on her best behavior with him she is always contriving to be useful to him i cant make him understand why i dislike miss gwilt i cant make you understandi only understand it myself she tried to pour out the tea and in trying upset the cup ill go downstairs again exclaimed neelie with a burst of tears im not fit for anything i cant even pour out a cup of tea  mrs milroy seized her hand and stopped her trifling as it was neelies reference to the relations between the major and miss gwilt had roused her mothers ready jealousy the restraints which mrs milroy had laid on herself thus far vanished in a momentvanished even in the presence of a girl of sixteen and that girl her own child  wait here she said eagerly you have come to the right place and the right person go on abusing miss gwilt i like to hear youi hate her too  you mamma exclaimed neelie looking at her mother in astonishment  for a moment mrs milroy hesitated before she said more some lastleft instinct of her married life in its earlier and happier time pleaded hard with her to respect the youth and the sex of her child but jealousy respects nothing in the heaven above and on the earth beneath nothing but itself the slow fire of selftorment burning night and day in the miserable womans breast flashed its deadly light into her eyes as the next words dropped slowly and venomously from her lips  if you had had eyes in your head you would never have gone to your father she said your father has reasons of his own for hearing nothing that you can say or that anybody can say against miss gwilt  many girls at neelies age would have failed to see the meaning hidden under those words it was the daughters misfortune in this instance to have had experience enough of the mother to understand her neelie started back from the bedside with her face in a glow mamma she said you are talking horribly papa is the best and dearest and kindestoh i wont hear it i wont hear it  mrs milroys fierce temper broke out in an instantbroke out all the more violently from her feeling herself in spite of herself to have been in the wrong  you impudent little fool she retorted furiously do you think i want you to remind me of what i owe to your father am i to learn how to speak of your father and how to think of your father and how to love and honor your father from a forward little minx like you i was finely disappointed i can tell you when you were borni wished for a boy you impudent hussy if you ever find a man who is fool enough to marry you he will be a lucky man if you only love him half as well a quarter as well a hundredthousandth part as well as i loved your father ah you can cry when its too late you can come creeping back to beg your mothers pardon after you have insulted her you little dowdy halfgrown creature i was handsomer than ever you will be when i married your father i would have gone through fire and water to serve your father if he had asked me to cut off one of my arms i would have done iti would have done it to please him she turned suddenly with her face to the wall forgetting her daughter forgetting her husband forgetting everything but the torturing remembrance of her lost beauty my arms she repeated to herself faintly what arms i had when i was young she snatched up the sleeve of her dressinggown furtively with a shudder oh look at it now look at it now  neelie fell on her knees at the bedside and hid her face in sheer despair of finding comfort and help anywhere else she had cast herself impulsively on her mothers mercy and this was how it had ended oh mamma she pleaded you know i didnt mean to offend you i couldnt help it when you spoke so of my father oh do do forgive me  mrs milroy turned again on her pillow and looked at her daughter vacantly forgive you she repeated with her mind still in the past groping its way back darkly to the present  i beg your pardon mammai beg your pardon on my knees i am so unhappy i do so want a little kindness wont you forgive me  wait a little rejoined mrs milroy ah she said after an interval now i know forgive you yes ill forgive you on one condition she lifted neelies head and looked her searchingly in the face tell me why you hate miss gwilt youve a reason of your own for hating her and you havent confessed it yet  neelies head dropped again the burning color that she was hiding by hiding her face showed itself on her neck her mother saw it and gave her time  tell me reiterated mrs milroy more gently why do you hate her  the answer came reluctantly a word at a time in fragments  because she is trying  trying what  trying to make somebody who is much  much what  much too young for her  marry her  yes mamma  breathlessly interested mrs milroy leaned forward and twined her hand caressingly in her daughters hair  who is it neelie she asked in a whisper  you will never say i told you mamma  never who is it  mr armadale  mrs milroy leaned back on her pillow in dead silence the plain betrayal of her daughters first love by her daughters own lips which would have absorbed the whole attention of other mothers failed to occupy her for a moment her jealousy distorting all things to fit its own conclusions was busied in distorting what she had just heard a blind she thought which has deceived my girl it doesnt deceive me is miss gwilt likely to succeed she asked aloud does mr armadale show any sort of interest in her  neelie looked up at her mother for the first time the hardest part of the confession was over now she had revealed the truth about miss gwilt and she had openly mentioned allans name  he shows the most unaccountable interest she said its impossible to understand it its downright infatuation i havent patience to talk about it  how do you come to be in mr armadales secrets inquired mrs milroy has he informed you of all the people in the world of his interest in miss gwilt  me exclaimed neelie indignantly its quite bad enough that he should have told papa  at the reappearance of the major in the narrative mrs milroys interest in the conversation rose to its climax she raised herself again from the pillow get a chair she said sit down child and tell me all about it every word mindevery word  i can only tell you mamma what papa told me  when  saturday i went in with papas lunch to the workshop and he said i have just had a visit from mr armadale and i want to give you a caution while i think of it i didnt say anything mamma i only waited papa went on and told me that mr armadale had been speaking to him on the subject of miss gwilt and that he had been asking a question about her which nobody in his position had a right to ask papa said he had been obliged goodhumoredly to warn mr armadale to be a little more delicate and a little more careful next time i didnt feel much interested mamma it didnt matter to me what mr armadale said or did why should i care about it  never mind yourself interposed mrs milroy sharply go on with what your father said what was he doing when he was talking about miss gwilt how did he look  much as usual mamma he was walking up and down the workshop and i took his arm and walked up and down with him  i dont care what you were doing said mrs milroy more and more irritably did your father tell you what mr armadales question was or did he not  yes mamma he said mr armadale began by mentioning that he was very much interested in miss gwilt and he then went on to ask whether papa could tell him anything about her family misfortunes  what cried mrs milroy the word burst from her almost in a scream and the white enamel on her face cracked in all directions mr armadale said that she went on leaning out further and further over the side of the bed  neelie started up and tried to put her mother back on the pillow  mamma she exclaimed are you in pain are you ill you frighten me  nothing nothing nothing said mrs milroy she was too violently agitated to make any other than the commonest excuse my nerves are bad this morning dont notice it ill try the other side of the pillow go on go on im listening though im not looking at you she turned her face to the wall and clinched her trembling hands convulsively beneath the bedclothes ive got her she whispered to herself under her breath ive got her at last  im afraid ive been talking too much said neelie im afraid ive been stopping here too long shall i go downstairs mamma and come back later in the day  go on repeated mrs milroy mechanically what did your father say next anything more about mr armadale  nothing more except how papa answered him replied neelie papa repeated his own words when he told me about it he said in the absence of any confidence volunteered by the lady herself mr armadale all i know or wish to knowand you must excuse me for saying all any one else need know or wish to knowis that miss gwilt gave me a perfectly satisfactory reference before she entered my house severe mamma wasnt it i dont pity him in the least he richly deserved it the next thing was papas caution to me he told me to check mr armadales curiosity if he applied to me next as if he was likely to apply to me and as if i should listen to him if he did thats all mamma you wont suppose will you that i have told you this because i want to hinder mr armadale from marrying miss gwilt let him marry her if he pleases i dont care said neelie in a voice that faltered a little and with a face which was hardly composed enough to be in perfect harmony with a declaration of indifference all i want is to be relieved from the misery of having miss gwilt for my governess id rather go to school i should like to go to school my minds quite changed about all that only i havent the heart to tell papa i dont know whats come to me i dont seem to have heart enough for anything now and when papa takes me on his knee in the evening and says lets have a talk neelie he makes me cry would you mind breaking it to him mamma that ive changed my mind and i want to go to school the tears rose thickly in her eyes and she failed to see that her mother never even turned on the pillow to look round at her  yes yes said mrs milroy vacantly youre a good girl you shall go to school  the cruel brevity of the reply and the tone in which it was spoken told neelie plainly that her mothers attention had been wandering far away from her and that it was useless and needless to prolong the interview she turned aside quietly without a word of remonstrance it was nothing new in her experience to find herself shut out from her mothers sympathies she looked at her eyes in the glass and pouring out some cold water bathed her face miss gwilt shant see ive been crying thought neelie as she went back to the bedside to take her leave ive tired you out mamma she said gently let me go now and let me come back a little later when you have had some rest  yes repeated her mother as mechanically as ever a little later when i have had some rest  neelie left the room the minute after the door had closed on her mrs milroy rang the bell for her nurse in the face of the narrative she had just heard in the face of every reasonable estimate of probabilities she held to her own jealous conclusions as firmly as ever mr armadale may believe her and my daughter may believe her thought the furious woman but i know the major and she cant deceive me  the nurse came in prop me up said mrs milroy and give me my desk i want to write  youre excited replied the nurse youre not fit to write  give me the desk reiterated mrs milroy  anything more asked rachel repeating her invariable formula as she placed the desk on the bed  yes come back in half an hour i shall want you to take a letter to the great house  the nurses sardonic composure deserted her for once mercy on us she exclaimed with an accent of genuine surprise what next you dont mean to say youre going to write  i am going to write to mr armadale interposed mrs milroy and you are going to take the letter to him and wait for an answer and mind this not a living soul but our two selves must know of it in the house  why are you writing to mr armadale asked rachel and why is nobody to know of it but our two selves  wait rejoined mrs milroy and you will see  the nurses curiosity being a womans curiosity declined to wait  ill help you with my eyes open she said but i wont help you blindfold  oh if i only had the use of my limbs groaned mrs milroy you wretch if i could only do without you  you have the use of your head retorted the impenetrable nurse and you ought to know better than to trust me by halves at this time of day  it was brutally put but it was truedoubly true after the opening of miss gwilts letter mrs milroy gave way  what do you want to know she asked tell me and leave me  i want to know what you are writing to mr armadale about  about miss gwilt  what has mr armadale to do with you and miss gwilt  mrs milroy held up the letter that had been returned to her by the authorities at the postoffice  stoop she said miss gwilt may be listening at the door ill whisper  the nurse stooped with her eye on the door you know that the postman went with this letter to kingsdown crescent said mrs milroy and you know that he found mrs mandeville gone away nobody could tell where  well whispered rachel what next  this next when mr armadale gets the letter that i am going to write to him he will follow the same road as the postman and well see what happens when he knocks at mrs mandevilles door  how do you get him to the door  i tell him to go to miss gwilts reference  is he sweet on miss gwilt  yes  ah said the nurse i see     iii the brink of discovery  the morning of the interview between mrs milroy and her daughter at the cottage was a morning of serious reflection for the squire at the great house  even allans easytempered nature had not been proof against the disturbing influences exercised on it by the events of the last three days midwinters abrupt departure had vexed him and major milroys reception of his inquiries relating to miss gwilt weighed unpleasantly on his mind since his visit to the cottage he had felt impatient and ill at ease for the first time in his life with everybody who came near him impatient with pedgift junior who had called on the previous evening to announce his departure for london on business the next day and to place his services at the disposal of his client ill at ease with miss gwilt at a secret meeting with her in the park that morning and ill at ease in his own company as he now sat moodily smoking in the solitude of his room i cant live this sort of life much longer thought allan if nobody will help me to put the awkward question to miss gwilt i must stumble on some way of putting it for myself  what way the answer to that question was as hard to find as ever allan tried to stimulate his sluggish invention by walking up and down the room and was disturbed by the appearance of the footman at the first turn  now then what is it he asked impatiently  a letter sir and the person waits for an answer  allan looked at the address it was in a strange handwriting he opened the letter and a little note inclosed in it dropped to the ground the note was directed still in the strange handwriting to mrs mandeville 18 kingsdown crescent bayswater favored by mr armadale more and more surprised allan turned for information to the signature at the end of the letter it was anne milroy  anne milroy he repeated it must be the majors wife what can she possibly want with me by way of discovering what she wanted allan did at last what he might more wisely have done at first he sat down to read the letter  private the cottage monday  dear sirthe name at the end of these lines will i fear recall to you a very rude return made on my part some time since for an act of neighborly kindness on yours i can only say in excuse that i am a great sufferer and that if i was illtempered enough in a moment of irritation under severe pain to send back your present of fruit i have regretted doing so ever since attribute this letter if you please to my desire to make some atonement and to my wish to be of service to our good friend and landlord if i possibly can  i have been informed of the question which you addressed to my husband the day before yesterday on the subject of miss gwilt from all i have heard of you i am quite sure that your anxiety to know more of this charming person than you know now is an anxiety proceeding from the most honorable motives believing this i feel a womans interestincurable invalid as i amin assisting you if you are desirous of becoming acquainted with miss gwilts family circumstances without directly appealing to miss gwilt herself it rests with you to make the discovery and i will tell you how  it so happens that some few days since i wrote privately to miss gwilts reference on this very subject i had long observed that my governess was singularly reluctant to speak of her family and her friends and without attributing her silence to other than perfectly proper motives i felt it my duty to my daughter to make some inquiry on the subject the answer that i have received is satisfactory as far as it goes my correspondent informs me that miss gwilts story is a very sad one and that her own conduct throughout has been praiseworthy in the extreme the circumstances of a domestic nature as i gather are all plainly stated in a collection of letters now in the possession of miss gwilts reference this lady is perfectly willing to let me see the letters but not possessing copies of them and being personally responsible for their security she is reluctant if it can be avoided to trust them to the post and she begs me to wait until she or i can find some reliable person who can be employed to transmit the packet from her hands to mine  under these circumstances it has struck me that you might possibly with your interest in the matter be not unwilling to take charge of the papers if i am wrong in this idea and if you are not disposed after what i have told you to go to the trouble and expense of a journey to london you have only to burn my letter and inclosure and to think no more about it if you decide on becoming my envoy i gladly provide you with the necessary introduction to mrs mandeville you have only on presenting it to receive the letters in a sealed packet to send them here on your return to thorpe ambrose and to wait an early communication from me acquainting you with the result  in conclusion i have only to add that i see no impropriety in your taking if you feel so inclined the course that i propose to you miss gwilts manner of receiving such allusions as i have made to her family circumstances has rendered it unpleasant for me and would render it quite impossible for you to seek information in the first instance from herself i am certainly justified in applying to her reference and you are certainly not to blame for being the medium of safely transmitting a sealed communication with one lady to another if i find in that communication family secrets which cannot honorably be mentioned to any third person i shall of course be obliged to keep you waiting until i have first appealed to miss gwilt if i find nothing recorded but what is to her honor and what is sure to raise her still higher in your estimation i am undeniably doing her a service by taking you into my confidence this is how i look at the matter but pray dont allow me to influence you  in any case i have one condition to make which i am sure you will understand to be indispensable the most innocent actions are liable in this wicked world to the worst possible interpretation i must therefore request that you will consider this communication as strictly private i write to you in a confidence which is on no account until circumstances may in my opinion justify the revelation of it to extend beyond our two selves  believe me dear sir truly yours  anne milroy  in this tempting form the unscrupulous ingenuity of the majors wife had set the trap without a moments hesitation allan followed his impulses as usual and walked straight into it writing his answer and pursuing his own reflections simultaneously in a highly characteristic state of mental confusion  by jupiter this is kind of mrs milroy my dear madam just the thing i wanted at the time when i needed it most i dont know how to express my sense of your kindness except by saying that i will go to london and fetch the letters with the greatest pleasure she shall have a basket of fruit regularly every day all through the season i will go at once dear madam and be back tomorrow ah nothing like the women for helping one when one is in love this is just what my poor mother would have done in mrs milroys place on my word of honor as a gentleman i will take the utmost care of the letters and keep the thing strictly private as you request i would have given five hundred pounds to anybody who would have put me up to the right way to speak to miss gwilt and here is this blessed woman does it for nothing believe me my dear madam gratefully yours allan armadale  having sent his reply out to mrs milroys messenger allan paused in a momentary perplexity he had an appointment with miss gwilt in the park for the next morning it was absolutely necessary to let her know that he would be unable to keep it she had forbidden him to write and he had no chance that day of seeing her alone in this difficulty he determined to let the necessary intimation reach her through the medium of a message to the major announcing his departure for london on business and asking if he could be of service to any member of the family having thus removed the only obstacle to his freedom of action allan consulted the timetable and found to his disappointment that there was a good hour to spare before it would be necessary to drive to the railway station in his existing frame of mind he would infinitely have preferred starting for london in a violent hurry  when the time came at last allan on passing the stewards office drummed at the door and called through it to mr bashwood im going to town back tomorrow there was no answer from within and the servant interposing informed his master that mr bashwood having no business to attend to that day had locked up the office and had left some hours since  on reaching the station the first person whom allan encountered was pedgift junior going to london on the legal business which he had mentioned on the previous evening at the great house the necessary explanations exchanged and it was decided that the two should travel in the same carriage allan was glad to have a companion and pedgift enchanted as usual to make himself useful to his client bustled away to get the tickets and see to the luggage sauntering to and fro on the platform until his faithful follower returned allan came suddenly upon no less a person than mr bashwood himself standing back in a corner with the guard of the train and putting a letter accompanied to all appearance by a fee privately into the mans hand  halloo cried allan in his hearty way something important there mr bashwood eh  if mr bashwood had been caught in the act of committing murder he could hardly have shown greater alarm than he now testified at allans sudden discovery of him snatching off his dingy old hat he bowed bareheaded in a palsy of nervous trembling from head to foot no sirno sir only a little letter a little letter a little letter said the deputysteward taking refuge in reiteration and bowing himself swiftly backward out of his employers sight  allan turned carelessly on his heel i wish i could take to that fellow he thought but i cant hes such a sneak what the deuce was there to tremble about does he think i want to pry into his secrets  mr bashwoods secret on this occasion concerned allan more nearly than allan supposed the letter which he had just placed in charge of the guard was nothing less than a word of warning addressed to mrs oldershaw and written by miss gwilt  if you can hurry your business wrote the majors governess do so and come back to london immediately things are going wrong here and miss milroy is at the bottom of the mischief this morning she insisted on taking up her mothers breakfast always on other occasions taken up by the nurse they had a long confabulation in private and half an hour later i saw the nurse slip out with a letter and take the path that leads to the great house the sending of the letter has been followed by young armadales sudden departure for londonin the face of an appointment which he had with me for tomorrow morning this looks serious the girl is evidently bold enough to make a fight of it for the position of mrs armadale of thorpe ambrose and she has found out some way of getting her mother to help her dont suppose i am in the least nervous or discouraged and dont do anything till you hear from me again only get back to london for i may have serious need of your assistance in the course of the next day or two  i send this letter to town to save a post by the midday train in charge of the guard as you insist on knowing every step i take at thorpe ambrose i may as well tell you that my messenger for i cant go to the station myself is that curious old creature whom i mentioned to you in my first letter ever since that time he has been perpetually hanging about here for a look at me i am not sure whether i frighten him or fascinate him perhaps i do both together all you need care to know is that i can trust him with my trifling errands and possibly as time goes on with something more l g   meanwhile the train had started from the thorpe ambrose station and the squire and his traveling companion were on their way to london  some men finding themselves in allans company under present circumstances might have felt curious to know the nature of his business in the metropolis young pedgifts unerring instinct as a man of the world penetrated the secret without the slightest difficulty the old story thought this wary old head wagging privately on its lusty young shoulders theres a woman in the case as usual any other business would have been turned over to me perfectly satisfied with this conclusion mr pedgift the younger proceeded with an eye to his professional interest to make himself agreeable to his client in the capacity of volunteer courier he seized on the whole administrative business of the journey to london as he had seized on the whole administrative business of the picnic at the broads on reaching the terminus allan was ready to go to any hotel that might be recommended his invaluable solicitor straightway drove him to a hotel at which the pedgift family had been accustomed to put up for three generations  you dont object to vegetables sir said the cheerful pedgift as the cab stopped at a hotel in covent garden market very good you may leave the rest to my grandfather my father and me i dont know which of the three is most beloved and respected in this house how dye do william our headwaiter mr armadale is your wifes rheumatism better and does the little boy get on nicely at school your masters out is he never mind youll do this william is mr armadale of thorpe ambrose i have prevailed on mr armadale to try our house have you got the bedroom i wrote for very good let mr armadale have it instead of me my grandfathers favorite bedroom sir no 57 on the second floor pray take it i can sleep anywhere will you have the mattress on the top of the featherbed you hear william tell matilda the mattress on the top of the featherbed how is matilda has she got the toothache as usual the headchambermaid mr armadale and a most extraordinary woman she will not part with a hollow tooth in her lower jaw my grandfather says have it out my father says have it out i say have it out and matilda turns a deaf ear to all three of us yes william yes if mr armadale approves this sittingroom will do about dinner sir shall we say in that case halfpast seven william halfpast seven not the least need to order anything mr armadale the headwaiter has only to give my compliments to the cook and the best dinner in london will be sent up punctual to the minute as a necessary consequence say mr pedgift junior if you please william otherwise sir we might get my grandfathers dinner or my fathers dinner and they might turn out a little too heavy and oldfashioned in their way of feeding for you and me as to the wine william at dinner my champagne and the sherry that my father thinks nasty after dinner the claret with the blue sealthe wine my innocent grandfather said wasnt worth sixpence a bottle ha ha poor old boy you will send up the evening papers and the playbills just as usual andthat will do i think william for the present an invaluable servant mr armadale theyre all invaluable servants in this house we may not be fashionable here sir but by the lord harry we are snug a cab you would like a cab dont stir ive rung the bell twicethat means cab wanted in a hurry might i ask mr armadale which way your business takes you toward bayswater would you mind dropping me in the park its a habit of mine when im in london to air myself among the aristocracy yours truly sir has an eye for a fine woman and a fine horse and when hes in hyde park hes quite in his native element thus the allaccomplished pedgift ran on and by these little arts did he recommend himself to the good opinion of his client  when the dinner hour united the traveling companions again in their sittingroom at the hotel a far less acute observer than young pedgift must have noticed the marked change that appeared in allans manner he looked vexed and puzzled and sat drumming with his fingers on the diningtable without uttering a word  im afraid something has happened to annoy you sir since we parted company in the park said pedgift junior excuse the question i only ask it in case i can be of any use  something that i never expected has happened returned allan i dont know what to make of it i should like to have your opinion he added after a little hesitation that is to say if you will excuse my not entering into any particulars  certainly assented young pedgift sketch it in outline sir the merest hint will do i wasnt born yesterday oh these women thought the youthful philosopher in parenthesis  well began allan you know what i said when we got to this hotel i said i had a place to go to in bayswater pedgift mentally checked off the first point case in the suburbs bayswater and a personthat is to saynoas i said before a person to inquire after pedgift checked off the next point person in the case sheperson or heperson sheperson unquestionably well i went to the house and when i asked for heri mean the personshethat is to say the personoh confound it cried allan i shall drive myself mad and you too if i try to tell my story in this roundabout way here it is in two words i went to no 18 kingsdown crescent to see a lady named mandeville and when i asked for her the servant said mrs mandeville had gone away without telling anybody where and without even leaving an address at which letters could be sent to her there its out at last and what do you think of it now  tell me first sir said the wary pedgift what inquiries you made when you found this lady had vanished  inquiries repeated allan i was utterly staggered i didnt say anything what inquiries ought i to have made  pedgift junior cleared his throat and crossed his legs in a strictly professional manner  i have no wish mr armadale he began to inquire into your business with mrs mandeville  no interposed allan bluntly i hope you wont inquire into that my business with mrs mandeville must remain a secret  but pursued pedgift laying down the law with the forefinger of one hand on the outstretched palm of the other i may perhaps be allowed to ask generally whether your business with mrs mandeville is of a nature to interest you in tracing her from kingsdown crescent to her present residence  certainly said allan i have a very particular reason for wishing to see her  in that case sir returned pedgift junior there were two obvious questions which you ought to have asked to begin withnamely on what date mrs mandeville left and how she left having discovered this you should have ascertained next under what domestic circumstances she went awaywhether there was a misunderstanding with anybody say a difficulty about money matters also whether she went away alone or with somebody else also whether the house was her own or whether she only lodged in it also in the latter event  stop stop youre making my head swim cried allan i dont understand all these ins and outs im not used to this sort of thing  ive been used to it myself from my childhood upward sir remarked pedgift and if i can be of any assistance say the word  youre very kind returned allan if you could only help me to find mrs mandeville and if you wouldnt mind leaving the thing afterward entirely in my hands  ill leave it in your hands sir with all the pleasure in life said pedgift junior and ill lay five to one he added mentally when the time comes youll leave it in mine well go to bayswater together mr armadale tomorrow morning in the meantime heres the soup the case now before the court is pleasure versus business i dont know what you say sir i say without a moments hesitation verdict for the plaintiff let us gather our rosebuds while we may excuse my high spirits mr armadale though buried in the country i was made for a london life the very air of the metropolis intoxicates me with that avowal the irresistible pedgift placed a chair for his patron and issued his orders cheerfully to his viceroy the headwaiter iced punch william after the soup i answer for the punch mr armadale its made after a recipe of my greatuncles he kept a tavern and founded the fortunes of the family i dont mind telling you the pedgifts have had a publican among them theres no false pride about me worth makes the man as pope says and want of it the fellow the rest is all but leather and prunella i cultivate poetry as well as music sir in my leisure hours in fact im more or less on familiar terms with the whole of the nine muses aha heres the punch the memory of my greatuncle the publican mr armadaledrunk in solemn silence  allan tried hard to emulate his companions gayety and good humor but with very indifferent success his visit to kingsdown crescent recurred ominously again and again to his memory all through the dinner and all through the public amusements to which he and his legal adviser repaired at a later hour of the evening when pedgift junior put out his candle that night he shook his wary head and regretfully apostrophized the women for the second time  by ten oclock the next morning the indefatigable pedgift was on the scene of action to allans great relief he proposed making the necessary inquiries at kingsdown crescent in his own person while his patron waited near at hand in the cab which had brought them from the hotel after a delay of little more than five minutes he reappeared in full possession of all attainable particulars his first proceeding was to request allan to step out of the cab and to pay the driver next he politely offered his arm and led the way round the corner of the crescent across a square and into a bystreet which was rendered exceptionally lively by the presence of the local cabstand here he stopped and asked jocosely whether mr armadale saw his way now or whether it would be necessary to test his patience by making an explanation  see my way repeated allan in bewilderment i see nothing but a cabstand  pedgift junior smiled compassionately and entered on his explanation it was a lodginghouse at kingsdown crescent he begged to state to begin with he had insisted on seeing the landlady a very nice person with all the remains of having been a fine girl about fifty years ago quite in pedgifts styleif he had only been alive at the beginning of the present centuryquite in pedgifts style but perhaps mr armadale would prefer hearing about mrs mandeville unfortunately there was nothing to tell there had been no quarreling and not a farthing left unpaid the lodger had gone and there wasnt an explanatory circumstance to lay hold of anywhere it was either mrs mandevilles way to vanish or there was something under the rose quite undiscoverable so far pedgift had got the date on which she left and the time of day at which she left and the means by which she left the means might help to trace her she had gone away in a cab which the servant had fetched from the nearest stand the stand was now before their eyes and the waterman was the first person to apply togoing to the waterman for information being clearly if mr armadale would excuse the joke going to the fountainhead treating the subject in this airy manner and telling allan that he would be back in a moment pedgift junior sauntered down the street and beckoned the waterman confidentially into the nearest publichouse  in a little while the two reappeared the waterman taking pedgift in succession to the first third fourth and sixth of the cabmen whose vehicles were on the stand the longest conference was held with the sixth man and it ended in the sudden approach of the sixth cab to the part of the street where allan was waiting  get in sir said pedgift opening the door ive found the man he remembers the lady and though he has forgotten the name of the street he believes he can find the place he drove her to when he once gets back into the neighborhood i am charmed to inform you mr armadale that we are in lucks way so far i asked the waterman to show me the regular men on the stand and it turns out that one of the regular men drove mrs mandeville the waterman vouches for him hes quite an anomalya respectable cabman drives his own horse and has never been in any trouble these are the sort of men sir who sustain ones belief in human nature ive had a look at our friend and i agree with the waterman i think we can depend on him  the investigation required some exercise of patience at the outset it was not till the cab had traversed the distance between bayswater and pimlico that the driver began to slacken his pace and look about him after once or twice retracing its course the vehicle entered a quiet bystreet ending in a dead wall with a door in it and stopped at the last house on the lefthand side the house next to the wall  here it is gentlemen said the man opening the cab door  allan and allans adviser both got out and both looked at the house with the same feeling of instinctive distrust  buildings have their physiognomyespecially buildings in great citiesand the face of this house was essentially furtive in its expression the front windows were all shut and the front blinds were all drawn down it looked no larger than the other houses in the street seen in front but it ran back deceitfully and gained its greater accommodation by means of its greater depth it affected to be a shop on the groundfloor but it exhibited absolutely nothing in the space that intervened between the window and an inner row of red curtains which hid the interior entirely from view at one side was the shop door having more red curtains behind the glazed part of it and bearing a brass plate on the wooden part of it inscribed with the name of oldershaw on the other side was the private door with a bell marked professional and another brass plate indicating a medical occupant on this side of the house for the name on it was doctor downward if ever brick and mortar spoke yet the brick and mortar here said plainly we have got our secrets inside and we mean to keep them  this cant be the place said allan there must be some mistake  you know best sir remarked pedgift junior with his sardonic gravity you know mrs mandevilles habits  i exclaimed allan you may be surprised to hear it but mrs mandeville is a total stranger to me  im not in the least surprised to hear it sir the landlady at kingsdown crescent informed me that mrs mandeville was an old woman suppose we inquire added the impenetrable pedgift looking at the red curtains in the shop window with a strong suspicion that mrs mandevilles granddaughter might possibly be behind them  they tried the shop door first it was locked they rang a lean and yellow young woman with a tattered french novel in her hand opened it  goodmorning miss said pedgift is mrs mandeville at home  the yellow young woman stared at him in astonishment no person of that name is known here she answered sharply in a foreign accent  perhaps they know her at the private door suggested pedgift junior  perhaps they do said the yellow young woman and shut the door in his face  rather a quicktempered young person that sir said pedgift i congratulate mrs mandeville on not being acquainted with her he led the way as he spoke to doctor downwards side of the premises and rang the bell  the door was opened this time by a man in a shabby livery he too stared when mrs mandevilles name was mentioned and he too knew of no such person in the house  very odd said pedgift appealing to allan  what is odd asked a softly stepping softly speaking gentleman in black suddenly appearing on the threshold of the parlor door  pedgift junior politely explained the circumstances and begged to know whether he had the pleasure of speaking to doctor downward  the doctor bowed if the expression may be pardoned he was one of those carefully constructed physicians in whom the publicespecially the female publicimplicitly trust he had the necessary bald head the necessary double eyeglass the necessary black clothes and the necessary blandness of manner all complete his voice was soothing his ways were deliberate his smile was confidential what particular branch of his profession doctor downward followed was not indicated on his doorplate but he had utterly mistaken his vocation if he was not a ladies medical man  are you quite sure there is no mistake about the name asked the doctor with a strong underlying anxiety in his manner i have known very serious inconvenience to arise sometimes from mistakes about names no there is really no mistake in that case gentlemen i can only repeat what my servant has already told you dont apologize pray goodmorning the doctor withdrew as noiselessly as he had appeared the man in the shabby livery silently opened the door and allan and his companion found themselves in the street again  mr armadale said pedgift i dont know how you feel i feel puzzled  thats awkward returned allan i was just going to ask you what we ought to do next  i dont like the look of the place the look of the shopwoman or the look of the doctor pursued the other and yet i cant say i think they are deceiving us i cant say i think they really know mrs mandevilles name  the impressions of pedgift junior seldom misled him and they had not misled him in this case the caution which had dictated mrs oldershaws private removal from bayswater was the caution which frequently overreaches itself it had warned her to trust nobody at pimlico with the secret of the name she had assumed as miss gwilts reference but it had entirely failed to prepare her for the emergency that had really happened in a word mrs oldershaw had provided for everything except for the one unimaginable contingency of an afterinquiry into the character of miss gwilt  we must do something said allan it seems useless to stop here  nobody had ever yet caught pedgift junior at the end of his resources and allan failed to catch him at the end of them now i quite agree with you sir he said we must do something well crossexamine the cabman  the cabman proved to be immovable charged with mistaking the place he pointed to the empty shop window i dont know what you may have seen gentlemen he remarked but theres the only shop window i ever saw with nothing at all inside it that fixed the place in my mind at the time and i know it again when i see it charged with mistaking the person or the day or the house at which he had taken the person up the cabman proved to be still unassailable the servant who fetched him was marked as a girl well known on the stand the day was marked as the unluckiest workingday he had had since the first of the year and the lady was marked as having had her money ready at the right moment which not one elderly lady in a hundred usually had and having paid him his fare on demand without disputing it which not one elderly lady in a hundred usually did take my number gentlemen concluded the cabman and pay me for my time and what ive said to you ill swear to anywhere  pedgift made a note in his pocketbook of the mans number having added to it the name of the street and the names on the two brass plates he quietly opened the cab door we are quite in the dark thus far he said suppose we grope our way back to the hotel  he spoke and looked more seriously than usual the mere fact of mrs mandevilles having changed her lodging without telling any one where she was going and without leaving any address at which letters could be forwarded to herwhich the jealous malignity of mrs milroy had interpreted as being undeniably suspicious in itselfhad produced no great impression on the more impartial judgment of allans solicitor people frequently left their lodgings in a private manner with perfectly producible reasons for doing so but the appearance of the place to which the cabman persisted in declaring that he had driven mrs mandeville set the character and proceedings of that mysterious lady before pedgift junior in a new light his personal interest in the inquiry suddenly strengthened and he began to feel a curiosity to know the real nature of allans business which he had not felt yet  our next move mr armadale is not a very easy move to see he said as they drove back to the hotel do you think you could put me in possession of any further particulars  allan hesitated and pedgift junior saw that he had advanced a little too far i mustnt force it he thought i must give it time and let it come of its own accord in the absence of any other information sir he resumed what do you say to my making some inquiry about that queer shop and about those two names on the doorplate my business in london when i leave you is of a professional nature and i am going into the right quarter for getting information if it is to be got  there cant be any harm i suppose in making inquiries replied allan  he too spoke more seriously than usual he too was beginning to feel an allmastering curiosity to know more some vague connection not to be distinctly realized or traced out began to establish itself in his mind between the difficulty of approaching miss gwilts family circumstances and the difficulty of approaching miss gwilts reference ill get down and walk and leave you to go on to your business he said i want to consider a little about this and a walk and a cigar will help me  my business will be done sir between one and two said pedgift when the cab had been stopped and allan had got out shall we meet again at two oclock at the hotel  allan nodded and the cab drove off     iv allan at bay  two oclock came and pedgift junior punctual to his time came with it his vivacity of the morning had all sparkled out he greeted allan with his customary politeness but without his customary smile and when the headwaiter came in for orders his dismissal was instantly pronounced in words never yet heard to issue from the lips of pedgift in that hotel nothing at present  you seem to be in low spirits said allan cant we get our information can nobody tell you anything about the house in pimlico  three different people have told me about it mr armadale and they have all three said the same thing  allan eagerly drew his chair nearer to the place occupied by his traveling companion his reflections in the interval since they had last seen each other had not tended to compose him that strange connection so easy to feel so hard to trace between the difficulty of approaching miss gwilts family circumstances and the difficulty of approaching miss gwilts reference which had already established itself in his thoughts had by this time stealthily taken a firmer and firmer hold on his mind doubts troubled him which he could neither understand nor express curiosity filled him which he half longed and half dreaded to satisfy  i am afraid i must trouble you with a question or two sir before i can come to the point said pedgift junior i dont want to force myself into your confidence i only want to see my way in what looks to me like a very awkward business do you mind telling me whether others besides yourself are interested in this inquiry of ours  other people are interested in it replied allan theres no objection to telling you that  is there any other person who is the object of the inquiry besides mrs mandeville herself pursued pedgift winding his way a little deeper into the secret  yes there is another person said allan answering rather unwillingly  is the person a young woman mr armadale  allan started how do you come to guess that he began then checked himself when it was too late dont ask me any more questions he resumed im a bad hand at defending myself against a sharp fellow like you and im bound in honor toward other people to keep the particulars of this business to myself  pedgift junior had apparently heard enough for his purpose he drew his chair in his turn nearer to allan he was evidently anxious and embarrassed but his professional manner began to show itself again from sheer force of habit  ive done with my questions sir he said and i have something to say now on my side in my fathers absence perhaps you may be kindly disposed to consider me as your legal adviser if you will take my advice you will not stir another step in this inquiry  what do you mean interposed allan  it is just possible mr armadale that the cabman positive as he is may have been mistaken i strongly recommend you to take it for granted that he is mistaken and to drop it there  the caution was kindly intended but it came too late allan did what ninetynine men out of a hundred in his position would have donehe declined to take his lawyers advice  very well sir said pedgift junior if you will have it you must have it  he leaned forward close to allans ear and whispered what he had heard of the house in pimlico and of the people who occupied it  dont blame me mr armadale he added when the irrevocable words had been spoken i tried to spare you  allan suffered the shock as all great shocks are suffered in silence his first impulse would have driven him headlong for refuge to that very view of the cabmans assertion which had just been recommended to him but for one damning circumstance which placed itself inexorably in his way miss gwilts marked reluctance to approach the story of her past life rose irrepressibly on his memory in indirect but horrible confirmation of the evidence which connected miss gwilts reference with the house in pimlico one conclusion and one onlythe conclusion which any man must have drawn hearing what he had just heard and knowing no more than he knewforced itself into his mind a miserable fallen woman who had abandoned herself in her extremity to the help of wretches skilled in criminal concealment who had stolen her way back to decent society and a reputable employment by means of a false character and whose position now imposed on her the dreadful necessity of perpetual secrecy and perpetual deceit in relation to her past lifesuch was the aspect in which the beautiful governess at thorpe ambrose now stood revealed to allans eyes  falsely revealed or truly revealed had she stolen her way back to decent society and a reputable employment by means of a false character she had did her position impose on her the dreadful necessity of perpetual secrecy and perpetual deceit in relation to her past life it did was she some such pitiable victim to the treachery of a man unknown as allan had supposed she was no such pitiable victim the conclusion which allan had drawnthe conclusion literally forced into his mind by the facts before himwas nevertheless the conclusion of all others that was furthest even from touching on the truth the true story of miss gwilts connection with the house in pimlico and the people who inhabited ita house rightly described as filled with wicked secrets and people rightly represented as perpetually in danger of feeling the grasp of the lawwas a story which coming events were yet to disclose a story infinitely less revolting and yet infinitely more terrible than allan or allans companion had either of them supposed  i tried to spare you mr armadale repeated pedgift i was anxious if i could possibly avoid it not to distress you  allan looked up and made an effort to control himself you have distressed me dreadfully he said you have quite crushed me down but it is not your fault i ought to feel you have done me a service and what i ought to do i will do when i am my own man again there is one thing allan added after a moments painful consideration which ought to be understood between us at once the advice you offered me just now was very kindly meant and it was the best advice that could be given i will take it gratefully we will never talk of this again if you please and i beg and entreat you will never speak about it to any other person will you promise me that  pedgift gave the promise with very evident sincerity but without his professional confidence of manner the distress in allans face seemed to daunt him after a moment of very uncharacteristic hesitation he considerately quitted the room  left by himself allan rang for writing materials and took out of his pocketbook the fatal letter of introduction to mrs mandeville which he had received from the majors wife  a man accustomed to consider consequences and to prepare himself for action by previous thought would in allans present circumstances have felt some difficulty as to the course which it might now be least embarrassing and least dangerous to pursue accustomed to let his impulses direct him on all other occasions allan acted on impulse in the serious emergency that now confronted him though his attachment to miss gwilt was nothing like the deeply rooted feeling which he had himself honestly believed it to be she had taken no common place in his admiration and she filled him with no common grief when he thought of her now his one dominant desire at that critical moment in his life was a mans merciful desire to protect from exposure and ruin the unhappy woman who had lost her place in his estimation without losing her claim to the forbearance that could spare and to the compassion that could shield her i cant go back to thorpe ambrose i cant trust myself to speak to her or to see her again but i can keep her miserable secret and i will with that thought in his heart allan set himself to perform the first and foremost duty which now claimed himthe duty of communicating with mrs milroy if he had possessed a higher mental capacity and a clearer mental view he might have found the letter no easy one to write as it was he calculated no consequences and felt no difficulty his instinct warned him to withdraw at once from the position in which he now stood toward the majors wife and he wrote what his instinct counseled him to write under those circumstances as rapidly as the pen could travel over the paper   dunns hotel covent garden tuesday  dear madampray excuse my not returning to thorpe ambrose today as i said i would unforeseen circumstances oblige me to stop in london i am sorry to say i have not succeeded in seeing mrs mandeville for which reason i cannot perform your errand and i beg therefore with many apologies to return the letter of introduction i hope you will allow me to conclude by saying that i am very much obliged to you for your kindness and that i will not venture to trespass on it any further  i remain dear madam yours truly  allan armadale   in those artless words still entirely unsuspicious of the character of the woman he had to deal with allan put the weapon she wanted into mrs milroys hands  the letter and its inclosure once sealed up and addressed he was free to think of himself and his future as he sat idly drawing lines with his pen on the blottingpaper the tears came into his eyes for the first timetears in which the woman who had deceived him had no share his heart had gone back to his dead mother if she had been alive he thought i might have trusted her and she would have comforted me it was useless to dwell on it he dashed away the tears and turned his thoughts with the heartsick resignation that we all know to living and present things  he wrote a line to mr bashwood briefly informing the deputy steward that his absence from thorpe ambrose was likely to be prolonged for some little time and that any further instructions which might be necessary under those circumstances would reach him through mr pedgift the elder this done and the letters sent to the post his thoughts were forced back once more on himself again the blank future waited before him to be filled up and again his heart shrank from it to the refuge of the past  this time other images than the image of his mother filled his mind the one allabsorbing interest of his earlier days stirred living and eager in him again he thought of the sea he thought of his yacht lying idle in the fishing harbor at his westcountry home the old longing got possession of him to hear the wash of the waves to see the filling of the sails to feel the vessel that his own hands had helped to build bounding under him once more he rose in his impetuous way to call for the timetable and to start for somersetshire by the first train when the dread of the questions which mr brock might ask the suspicion of the change which mr brock might see in him drew him back to his chair ill write he thought to have the yacht rigged and refitted and ill wait to go to somersetshire myself till midwinter can go with me he sighed as his memory reverted to his absent friend never had he felt the void made in his life by midwinters departure so painfully as he felt it now in the dreariest of all social solitudesthe solitude of a stranger in london left by himself at a hotel  before long pedgift junior looked in with an apology for his intrusion allan felt too lonely and too friendless not to welcome his companions reappearance gratefully im not going back to thorpe ambrose he said im going to stay a little while in london i hope you will be able to stay with me to do him justice pedgift was touched by the solitary position in which the owner of the great thorpe ambrose estate now appeared before him he had never in his relations with allan so entirely forgotten his business interests as he forgot them now  you are quite right sir to stop here londons the place to divert your mind said pedgift cheerfully all business is more or less elastic in its nature mr armadale ill spin my business out and keep you company with the greatest pleasure we are both of us on the right side of thirty sir lets enjoy ourselves what do you say to dining early and going to the play and trying the great exhibition in hyde park tomorrow morning after breakfast if we only live like fightingcocks and go in perpetually for public amusements we shall arrive in no time at the mens sana in corpore sano of the ancients dont be alarmed at the quotation sir i dabble a little in latin after business hours and enlarge my sympathies by occasional perusal of the pagan writers assisted by a crib william dinner at five and as its particularly important today ill see the cook myself  the evening passed the next day passed thursday morning came and brought with it a letter for allan the direction was in mrs milroys handwriting and the form of address adopted in the letter warned allan the moment he opened it that something had gone wrong   private  the cottage thorpe ambrose wednesday  siri have just received your mysterious letter it has more than surprised it has really alarmed me after having made the friendliest advances to you on my side i find myself suddenly shut out from your confidence in the most unintelligible and i must add the most discourteous manner it is quite impossible that i can allow the matter to rest where you have left it the only conclusion i can draw from your letter is that my confidence must have been abused in some way and that you know a great deal more than you are willing to tell me speaking in the interest of my daughters welfare i request that you will inform me what the circumstances are which have prevented your seeing mrs mandeville and which have led to the withdrawal of the assistance that you unconditionally promised me in your letter of monday last  in my state of health i cannot involve myself in a lengthened correspondence i must endeavor to anticipate any objections you may make and i must say all that i have to say in my present letter in the event which i am most unwilling to consider possible of your declining to accede to the request that i have just addressed to you i beg to say that i shall consider it my duty to my daughter to have this very unpleasant matter cleared up if i dont hear from you to my full satisfaction by return of post i shall be obliged to tell my husband that circumstances have happened which justify us in immediately testing the respectability of miss gwilts reference and when he asks me for my authority i will refer him to you  your obedient servant anne milroy   in those terms the majors wife threw off the mask and left her victim to survey at his leisure the trap in which she had caught him allans belief in mrs milroys good faith had been so implicitly sincere that her letter simply bewildered him he saw vaguely that he had been deceived in some way and that mrs milroys neighborly interest in him was not what it had looked on the surface and he saw no more the threat of appealing to the majoron which with a womans ignorance of the natures of men mrs milroy had relied for producing its effectwas the only part of the letter to which allan reverted with any satisfaction it relieved instead of alarming him if there is to be a quarrel he thought it will be a comfort at any rate to have it out with a man  firm in his resolution to shield the unhappy woman whose secret he wrongly believed himself to have surprised allan sat down to write his apologies to the majors wife after setting up three polite declarations in close marching order he retired from the field he was extremely sorry to have offended mrs milroy he was innocent of all intention to offend mrs milroy and he begged to remain mrs milroys truly never had allans habitual brevity as a letterwriter done him better service than it did him now with a little more skillfulness in the use of his pen he might have given his enemy even a stronger hold on him than the hold she had got already  the interval day passed and with the next mornings post mrs milroys threat came realized in the shape of a letter from her husband the major wrote less formally than his wife had written but his questions were mercilessly to the point   private  the cottage thorpe ambrose friday july 11 1851  dear sirwhen you did me the favor of calling here a few days since you asked a question relating to my governess miss gwilt which i thought rather a strange one at the time and which caused as you may remember a momentary embarrassment between us  this morning the subject of miss gwilt has been brought to my notice again in a manner which has caused me the utmost astonishment in plain words mrs milroy has informed me that miss gwilt has exposed herself to the suspicion of having deceived us by a false reference on my expressing the surprise which such an extraordinary statement caused me and requesting that it might be instantly substantiated i was still further astonished by being told to apply for all particulars to no less a person than mr armadale i have vainly requested some further explanation from mrs milroy she persists in maintaining silence and in referring me to yourself  under these extraordinary circumstances i am compelled in justice to all parties to ask you certain questions which i will endeavor to put as plainly as possible and which i am quite ready to believe from my previous experience of you that you will answer frankly on your side  i beg to inquire in the first place whether you admit or deny mrs milroys assertion that you have made yourself acquainted with particulars relating either to miss gwilt or to miss gwilts reference of which i am entirely ignorant in the second place if you admit the truth of mrs milroys statement i request to know how you became acquainted with those particulars thirdly and lastly i beg to ask you what the particulars are  if any special justification for putting these questions be neededwhich purely as a matter of courtesy toward yourself i am willing to admiti beg to remind you that the most precious charge in my house the charge of my daughter is confided to miss gwilt and that mrs milroys statement places you to all appearance in the position of being competent to tell me whether that charge is properly bestowed or not  i have only to add that as nothing has thus far occurred to justify me in entertaining the slightest suspicion either of my governess or her reference i shall wait before i make any appeal to miss gwilt until i have received your answerwhich i shall expect by return of post believe me dear sir faithfully yours  david milroy   this transparently straightforward letter at once dissipated the confusion which had thus far existed in allans mind he saw the snare in which he had been caught though he was still necessarily at a loss to understand why it had been set for him as he had not seen it yet mrs milroy had clearly placed him between two alternativesthe alternative of putting himself in the wrong by declining to answer her husbands questions or the alternative of meanly sheltering his responsibility behind the responsibility of a woman by acknowledging to the majors own face that the majors wife had deceived him  in this difficulty allan acted as usual without hesitation his pledge to mrs milroy to consider their correspondence private still bound him disgracefully as she had abused it and his resolution was as immovable as ever to let no earthly consideration tempt him into betraying miss gwilt i may have behaved like a fool he thought but i wont break my word and i wont be the means of turning that miserable woman adrift in the world again  he wrote to the major as artlessly and briefly as he had written to the majors wife he declared his unwillingness to cause a friend and neighbor any disappointment if he could possibly help it on this occasion he had no other choice the questions the major asked him were questions which he could not consent to answer he was not very clever at explaining himself and he hoped he might be excused for putting it in that way and saying no more  mondays post brought with it major milroys rejoinder and closed the correspondence   the cottage thorpe ambrose sunday  siryour refusal to answer my questions unaccompanied as it is by even the shadow of an excuse for such a proceeding can be interpreted but in one way besides being an implied acknowledgment of the correctness of mrs milroys statement it is also an implied reflection on my governesss character as an act of justice toward a lady who lives under the protection of my roof and who has given me no reason whatever to distrust her i shall now show our correspondence to miss gwilt and i shall repeat to her the conversation which i had with mrs milroy on the subject in mrs milroys presence  one word more respecting the future relations between us and i have done my ideas on certain subjects are i dare say the ideas of an oldfashioned man in my time we had a code of honor by which we regulated our actions according to that code if a man made private inquiries into a ladys affairs without being either her husband her father or her brother he subjected himself to the responsibility of justifying his conduct in the estimation of others and if he evaded that responsibility he abdicated the position of a gentleman it is quite possible that this antiquated way of thinking exists no longer but it is too late for me at my time of life to adopt more modern views i am scrupulously anxious seeing that we live in a country and a time in which the only court of honor is a policecourt to express myself with the utmost moderation of language upon this the last occasion that i shall have to communicate with you allow me therefore merely to remark that our ideas of the conduct which is becoming in a gentleman differ seriously and permit me on this account to request that you will consider yourself for the future as a stranger to my family and to myself  your obedient servant  david milroy   the monday morning on which his client received the majors letter was the blackest monday that had yet been marked in pedgifts calendar when allans first angry sense of the tone of contempt in which his friend and neighbor pronounced sentence on him had subsided it left him sunk in a state of depression from which no efforts made by his traveling companion could rouse him for the rest of the day reverting naturally now that his sentence of banishment had been pronounced to his early intercourse with the cottage his memory went back to neelie more regretfully and more penitently than it had gone back to her yet if she had shut the door on me instead of her father was the bitter reflection with which allan now reviewed the past i shouldnt have had a word to say against it i should have felt it served me right  the next day brought another lettera welcome letter this time from mr brock allan had written to somersetshire on the subject of refitting the yacht some days since the letter had found the rector engaged as he innocently supposed in protecting his old pupil against the woman whom he had watched in london and whom he now believed to have followed him back to his own home acting under the directions sent to her mrs oldershaws housemaid had completed the mystification of mr brock she had tranquilized all further anxiety on the rectors part by giving him a written undertaking in the character of miss gwilt engaging never to approach mr armadale either personally or by letter firmly persuaded that he had won the victory at last poor mr brock answered allans note in the highest spirits expressing some natural surprise at his leaving thorpe ambrose but readily promising that the yacht should be refitted and offering the hospitality of the rectory in the heartiest manner  this letter did wonders in raising allans spirits it gave him a new interest to look to entirely disassociated from his past life in norfolk he began to count the days that were still to pass before the return of his absent friend it was then tuesday if midwinter came back from his walking trip as he had engaged to come back in a fortnight saturday would find him at thorpe ambrose a note sent to meet the traveler might bring him to london the same night and if all went well before another week was over they might be afloat together in the yacht  the next day passed to allans relief without bringing any letters the spirits of pedgift rose sympathetically with the spirits of his client toward dinner time he reverted to the mens sana in corpore sano of the ancients and issued his orders to the headwaiter more royally than ever  thursday came and brought the fatal postman with more news from norfolk a letterwriter now stepped on the scene who had not appeared there yet and the total overthrow of all allans plans for a visit to somersetshire was accomplished on the spot  pedgift junior happened that morning to be the first at the breakfast table when allan came in he relapsed into his professional manner and offered a letter to his patron with a bow performed in dreary silence  for me inquired allan shrinking instinctively from a new correspondent  for you sirfrom my father replied pedgift inclosed in one to myself perhaps you will allow me to suggest by way of preparing you forfor something a little unpleasantthat we shall want a particularly good dinner today and if theyre not performing any modern german music tonight i think we should do well to finish the evening melodiously at the opera  something wrong at thorpe ambrose asked allen  yes mr armadale something wrong at thorpe ambrose  allan sat down resignedly and opened the letter   private and confidential  high street thorpe ambrose 17th july 1851  dear siri cannot reconcile it with my sense of duty to your interests to leave you any longer in ignorance of reports current in this town and its neighborhood which i regret to say are reports affecting yourself  the first intimation of anything unpleasant reached me on monday last it was widely rumored in the town that something had gone wrong at major milroys with the new governess and that mr armadale was mixed up in it i paid no heed to this believing it to be one of the many trumpery pieces of scandal perpetually set going here and as necessary as the air they breathe to the comfort of the inhabitants of this highly respectable place  tuesday however put the matter in a new light the most interesting particulars were circulated on the highest authority on wednesday the gentry in the neighborhood took the matter up and universally sanctioned the view adopted by the town today the public feeling has reached its climax and i find myself under the necessity of making you acquainted with what has happened  to begin at the beginning it is asserted that a correspondence took place last week between major milroy and yourself in which you cast a very serious suspicion on miss gwilts respectability without defining your accusations and without on being applied to producing your proofs upon this the major appears to have felt it his duty while assuring his governess of his own firm belief in her respectability to inform her of what had happened in order that she might have no future reason to complain of his having had any concealments from her in a matter affecting her character very magnanimous on the majors part but you will see directly that miss gwilt was more magnanimous still after expressing her thanks in a most becoming manner she requested permission to withdraw herself from major milroys service  various reports are in circulation as to the governesss reason for taking this step  the authorized version as sanctioned by the resident gentry represents miss gwilt to have said that she could not condescendin justice to herself and in justice to her highly respectable referenceto defend her reputation against undefined imputations cast on it by a comparative stranger at the same time it was impossible for her to pursue such a course of conduct as this unless she possessed a freedom of action which was quite incompatible with her continuing to occupy the dependent position of a governess for that reason she felt it incumbent on her to leave her situation but while doing this she was equally determined not to lead to any misinterpretation of her motives by leaving the neighborhood no matter at what inconvenience to herself she would remain long enough at thorpe ambrose to await any more definitely expressed imputations that might be made on her character and to repel them publicly the instant they assumed a tangible form  such is the position which this highminded lady has taken up with an excellent effect on the public mind in these parts it is clearly her interest for some reason to leave her situation without leaving the neighborhood on monday last she established herself in a cheap lodging on the outskirts of the town and on the same day she probably wrote to her reference for yesterday there came a letter from that lady to major milroy full of virtuous indignation and courting the fullest inquiry the letter has been shown publicly and has immensely strengthened miss gwilts position she is now considered to be quite a heroine the thorpe ambrose mercury has got a leading article about her comparing her to joan of arc it is considered probable that she will be referred to in the sermon next sunday we reckon five strongminded single ladies in this neighborhoodand all five have called on her a testimonial was suggested but it has been given up at miss gwilts own request and a general movement is now on foot to get her employment as a teacher of music lastly i have had the honor of a visit from the lady herself in her capacity of martyr to tell me in the sweetest manner that she doesnt blame mr armadale and that she considers him to be an innocent instrument in the hands of other and more designing people i was carefully on my guard with her for i dont altogether believe in miss gwilt and i have my lawyers suspicions of the motive that is at the bottom of her present proceedings  i have written thus far my dear sir with little hesitation or embarrassment but there is unfortunately a serious side to this business as well as a ridiculous side and i must unwillingly come to it before i close my letter  it is i think quite impossible that you can permit yourself to be spoken of as you are spoken of now without stirring personally in the matter you have unluckily made many enemies here and foremost among them is my colleague mr darch he has been showing everywhere a somewhat rashly expressed letter you wrote to him on the subject of letting the cottage to major milroy instead of to himself and it has helped to exasperate the feeling against you it is roundly stated in so many words that you have been prying into miss gwilts family affairs with the most dishonorable motives that you have tried for a profligate purpose of your own to damage her reputation and to deprive her of the protection of major milroys roof and that after having been asked to substantiate by proof the suspicions that you have cast on the reputation of a defenseless woman you have maintained a silence which condemns you in the estimation of all honorable men  i hope it is quite unnecessary for me to say that i dont attach the smallest particle of credit to these infamous reports but they are too widely spread and too widely believed to be treated with contempt i strongly urge you to return at once to this place and to take the necessary measures for defending your character in concert with me as your legal adviser i have formed since my interview with miss gwilt a very strong opinion of my own on the subject of that lady which it is not necessary to commit to paper suffice it to say here that i shall have a means to propose to you for silencing the slanderous tongues of your neighbors on the success of which i stake my professional reputation if you will only back me by your presence and authority  it may perhaps help to show you the necessity there is for your return if i mention one other assertion respecting yourself which is in everybodys mouth your absence is i regret to tell you attributed to the meanest of all motives it is said that you are remaining in london because you are afraid to show your face at thorpe ambrose  believe me dear sir your faithful servant  a pedgift sen   allan was of an age to feel the sting contained in the last sentence of his lawyers letter he started to his feet in a paroxysm of indignation which revealed his character to pedgift junior in an entirely new light  wheres the timetable cried allan i must go back to thorpe ambrose by the next train if it doesnt start directly ill have a special engine i must and will go back instantly and i dont care two straws for the expense  suppose we telegraph to my father sir suggested the judicious pedgift its the quickest way of expressing your feelings and the cheapest  so it is said allan thank you for reminding me of it telegraph to them tell your father to give every man in thorpe ambrose the lie direct in my name put it in capital letters pedgiftput it in capital letters  pedgift smiled and shook his head if he was acquainted with no other variety of human nature he thoroughly knew the variety that exists in country towns  it wont have the least effect on them mr armadale he remarked quietly theyll only go on lying harder than ever if you want to upset the whole town one line will do it with five shillings worth of human labor and electric fluid sir i dabble a little in science after business hours well explode a bombshell in thorpe ambrose he produced the bombshell on a slip of paper as he spoke a pedgift junior to a pedgift seniorspread it all over the place that mr armadale is coming down by the next train  more words suggested allan looking over his shoulder make it stronger  leave my father to make it stronger sir returned the wary pedgift my father is on the spot and his command of language is something quite extraordinary he rang the bell and dispatched the telegram  now that something had been done allan subsided gradually into a state of composure he looked back again at mr pedgifts letter and then handed it to mr pedgifts son  can you guess your fathers plan for setting me right in the neighborhood he asked  pedgift the younger shook his wise head his plan appears to be connected in some way sir with his opinion of miss gwilt  i wonder what he thinks of her said allan  i shouldnt be surprised mr armadale returned pedgift junior if his opinion staggers you a little when you come to hear it my father has had a large legal experience of the shady side of the sex and he learned his profession at the old bailey  allan made no further inquiries he seemed to shrink from pursuing the subject after having started it himself lets be doing something to kill the time he said lets pack up and pay the bill  they packed up and paid the bill the hour came and the train left for norfolk at last  while the travelers were on their way back a somewhat longer telegraphic message than allans was flashing its way past them along the wires in the reverse directionfrom thorpe ambrose to london the message was in cipher and the signs being interpreted it ran thus from lydia gwilt to maria oldershawgood news he is coming back i mean to have an interview with him everything looks well now i have left the cottage i have no womens prying eyes to dread and i can come and go as i please mr midwinter is luckily out of the way i dont despair of becoming mrs armadale yet whatever happens depend on my keeping away from london until i am certain of not taking any spies after me to your place i am in no hurry to leave thorpe ambrose i mean to be even with miss milroy first  shortly after that message was received in london allan was back again in his own house  it was eveningpedgift junior had just left himand pedgift senior was expected to call on business in half an hours time     v pedgifts remedy  after waiting to hold a preliminary consultation with his son mr pedgift the elder set forth alone for his interview with allan at the great house  allowing for the difference in their ages the son was in this instance so accurately the reflection of the father that an acquaintance with either of the two pedgifts was almost equivalent to an acquaintance with both add some little height and size to the figure of pedgift junior give more breadth and boldness to his humor and some additional solidity and composure to his confidence in himself and the presence and character of pedgift senior stood for all general purposes revealed before you  the lawyers conveyance to thorpe ambrose was his own smart gig drawn by his famous fasttrotting mare it was his habit to drive himself and it was one among the trifling external peculiarities in which he and his son differed a little to affect something of the sporting character in his dress the drab trousers of pedgift the elder fitted close to his legs his boots in dry weather and wet alike were equally thick in the sole his coat pockets overlapped his hips and his favorite summer cravat was of light spotted muslin tied in the neatest and smallest of bows he used tobacco like his son but in a different form while the younger man smoked the elder took snuff copiously and it was noticed among his intimates that he always held his pinch in a state of suspense between his box and his nose when he was going to clinch a good bargain or to say a good thing the art of diplomacy enters largely into the practice of all successful men in the lower branch of the law mr pedgifts form of diplomatic practice had been the same throughout his life on every occasion when he found his arts of persuasion required at an interview with another man he invariably kept his strongest argument or his boldest proposal to the last and invariably remembered it at the door after previously taking his leave as if it was a purely accidental consideration which had that instant occurred to him jocular friends acquainted by previous experience with this form of proceeding had given it the name of pedgifts postscript there were few people in thorpe ambrose who did not know what it meant when the lawyer suddenly checked his exit at the opened door came back softly to his chair with his pinch of snuff suspended between his box and his nose said bytheby theres a point occurs to me and settled the question offhand after having given it up in despair not a minute before  this was the man whom the march of events at thorpe ambrose had now thrust capriciously into a foremost place this was the one friend at hand to whom allan in his social isolation could turn for counsel in the hour of need   goodevening mr armadale many thanks for your prompt attention to my very disagreeable letter said pedgift senior opening the conversation cheerfully the moment he entered his clients house i hope you understand sir that i had really no choice under the circumstances but to write as i did  i have very few friends mr pedgift returned allan simply and i am sure you are one of the few  much obliged mr armadale i have always tried to deserve your good opinion and i mean if i can to deserve it now you found yourself comfortable i hope sir at the hotel in london we call it our hotel some rare old wine in the cellar which i should have introduced to your notice if i had had the honor of being with you my son unfortunately knows nothing about wine  allan felt his false position in the neighborhood far too acutely to be capable of talking of anything but the main business of the evening his lawyers politely roundabout method of approaching the painful subject to be discussed between them rather irritated than composed him he came at once to the point in his own bluntly straightforward way  the hotel was very comfortable mr pedgift and your son was very kind to me but we are not in london now and i want to talk to you about how i am to meet the lies that are being told of me in this place only point me out any one man cried allan with a rising voice and a mounting colorany one man who says i am afraid to show my face in the neighborhood and ill horsewhip him publicly before another day is over his head  pedgift senior helped himself to a pinch of snuff and held it calmly in suspense midway between his box and his nose  you can horsewhip a man sir but you cant horsewhip a neighborhood said the lawyer in his politely epigrammatic manner we will fight our battle if you please without borrowing our weapons of the coachman yet a while at any rate  but how are we to begin asked allan impatiently how am i to contradict the infamous things they say of me  there are two ways of stepping out of your present awkward position sira short way and a long way replied pedgift senior the short way which is always the best has occurred to me since i have heard of your proceedings in london from my son i understand that you permitted him after you received my letter to take me into your confidence i have drawn various conclusions from what he has told me which i may find it necessary to trouble you with presently in the meantime i should be glad to know under what circumstances you went to london to make these unfortunate inquiries about miss gwilt was it your own notion to pay that visit to mrs mandeville or were you acting under the influence of some other person  allan hesitated i cant honestly tell you it was my own notion he replied and said no more  i thought as much remarked pedgift senior in high triumph the short way out of our present difficulty mr armadale lies straight through that other person under whose influence you acted that other person must be presented forthwith to public notice and must stand in that other persons proper place the name if you please sir to begin withwell come to the circumstances directly  i am sorry to say mr pedgift that we must try the longest way if you have no objection replied allan quietly the short way happens to be a way i cant take on this occasion  the men who rise in the law are the men who decline to take no for an answer mr pedgift the elder had risen in the law and mr pedgift the elder now declined to take no for an answer but all pertinacityeven professional pertinacity includedsooner or later finds its limits and the lawyer doubly fortified as he was by long experience and copious pinches of snuff found his limits at the very outset of the interview it was impossible that allan could respect the confidence which mrs milroy had treacherously affected to place in him but he had an honest mans regard for his own pledged wordthe regard which looks straightforward at the fact and which never glances sidelong at the circumstancesand the utmost persistency of pedgift senior failed to move him a hairbreadth from the position which he had taken up no is the strongest word in the english language in the mouth of any man who has the courage to repeat it often enough and allan had the courage to repeat it often enough on this occasion  very good sir said the lawyer accepting his defeat without the slightest loss of temper the choice rests with you and you have chosen we will go the long way it starts allow me to inform you from my office and it leads as i strongly suspect through a very miry road tomiss gwilt  allan looked at his legal adviser in speechless astonishment  if you wont expose the person who is responsible in the first instance sir for the inquiries to which you unfortunately lent yourself proceeded mr pedgift the elder the only other alternative in your present position is to justify the inquiries themselves  and how is that to be done inquired allan  by proving to the whole neighborhood mr armadale what i firmly believe to be the truththat the pet object of the public protection is an adventuress of the worst class an undeniably worthless and dangerous woman in plainer english still sir by employing time enough and money enough to discover the truth about miss gwilt   before allan could say a word in answer there was an interruption at the door after the usual preliminary knock one of the servants came in  i told you i was not to be interrupted said allan irritably good heavens am i never to have done with them another letter  yes sir said the man holding it out and he added speaking words of evil omen in his masters ears the person waits for an answer  allan looked at the address of the letter with a natural expectation of encountering the handwriting of the majors wife the anticipation was not realized his correspondent was plainly a lady but the lady was not mrs milroy  who can it be he said looking mechanically at pedgift senior as he opened the envelope  pedgift senior gently tapped his snuffbox and said without a moments hesitation miss gwilt  allan opened the letter the first two words in it were the echo of the two words the lawyer had just pronounced it was miss gwilt  once more allan looked at his legal adviser in speechless astonishment  i have known a good many of them in my time sir explained pedgift senior with a modesty equally rare and becoming in a man of his age not as handsome as miss gwilt i admit but quite as bad i dare say read your letter mr armadaleread your letter  allan read these lines   miss gwilt presents her compliments to mr armadale and begs to know if it will be convenient to him to favor her with an interview either this evening or tomorrow morning miss gwilt offers no apology for making her present request she believes mr armadale will grant it as an act of justice toward a friendless woman whom he has been innocently the means of injuring and who is earnestly desirous to set herself right in his estimation   allan handed the letter to his lawyer in silent perplexity and distress  the face of mr pedgift the elder expressed but one feeling when he had read the letter in his turn and had handed it backa feeling of profound admiration what a lawyer she would have made he exclaimed fervently if she had only been a man  i cant treat this as lightly as you do mr pedgift said allan its dreadfully distressing to me i was so fond of her he added in a lower tonei was so fond of her once  mr pedgift senior suddenly became serious on his side  do you mean to say sir that you actually contemplate seeing miss gwilt he asked with an expression of genuine dismay  i cant treat her cruelly returned allan i have been the means of injuring herwithout intending it god knows i cant treat her cruelly after that  mr armadale said the lawyer you did me the honor a little while since to say that you considered me your friend may i presume on that position to ask you a question or two before you go straight to your own ruin  any questions you like said allan looking back at the letterthe only letter he had ever received from miss gwilt  you have had one trap set for you already sir and you have fallen into it do you want to fall into another  you know the answer to that question mr pedgift as well as i do  ill try again mr armadale we lawyers are not easily discouraged do you think that any statement miss gwilt might make to you if you do see her would be a statement to be relied on after what you and my son discovered in london  she might explain what we discovered in london suggested allan still looking at the writing and thinking of the hand that had traced it  might explain it my dear sir she is quite certain to explain it i will do her justice i believe she would make out a case without a single flaw in it from beginning to end  that last answer forced allans attention away from the letter the lawyers pitiless common sense showed him no mercy  if you see that woman again sir proceeded pedgift senior you will commit the rashest act of folly i ever heard of in all my experience she can have but one object in coming hereto practice on your weakness for her nobody can say into what false step she may not lead you if you once give her the opportunity you admit yourself that you have been fond of her your attentions to her have been the subject of general remark if you havent actually offered her the chance of becoming mrs armadale you have done the next thing to it and knowing all this you propose to see her and to let her work on you with her devilish beauty and her devilish cleverness in the character of your interesting victim you who are one of the best matches in england you who are the natural prey of all the hungry single women in the community i never heard the like of it i never in all my professional experience heard the like of it if you must positively put yourself in a dangerous position mr armadale concluded pedgift the elder with the everlasting pinch of snuff held in suspense between his box and his nose theres a wildbeast show coming to our town next week let in the tigress sir dont let in miss gwilt  for the third time allan looked at his lawyer and for the third time his lawyer looked back at him quite unabashed  you seem to have a very bad opinion of miss gwilt said allan  the worst possible opinion mr armadale retorted pedgift senior coolly we will return to that when we have sent the ladys messenger about his business will you take my advice will you decline to see her  i would willingly declineit would be so dreadfully distressing to both of us said allan i would willingly decline if i only knew how  bless my soul mr armadale its easy enough dont commit you yourself in writing send out to the messenger and say theres no answer  the short course thus suggested was a course which allan positively declined to take its treating her brutally he said i cant and wont do it  once more the pertinacity of pedgift the elder found its limits and once more that wise man yielded gracefully to a compromise on receiving his clients promise not to see miss gwilt he consented to allans committing himself in writing under his lawyers dictation the letter thus produced was modeled in allans own style it began and ended in one sentence mr armadale presents his compliments to miss gwilt and regrets that he cannot have the pleasure of seeing her at thorpe ambrose allan had pleaded hard for a second sentence explaining that he only declined miss gwilts request from a conviction that an interview would be needlessly distressing on both sides but his legal adviser firmly rejected the proposed addition to the letter when you say no to a woman sir remarked pedgift senior always say it in one word if you give her your reasons she invariably believes that you mean yes  producing that little gem of wisdom from the rich mine of his professional experience mr pedgift the elder sent out the answer to miss gwilts messenger and recommended the servant to see the fellow whoever he was well clear of the house  now sir said the lawyer we will come back if you like to my opinion of miss gwilt it doesnt at all agree with yours im afraid you think her an object of pityquite natural at your age i think her an object for the inside of a prisonquite natural at mine you shall hear the grounds on which i have formed my opinion directly let me show you that i am in earnest by putting the opinion itself in the first place to a practical test do you think miss gwilt is likely to persist in paying you a visit mr armadale after the answer you have just sent to her  quite impossible cried allan warmly miss gwilt is a lady after the letter i have sent to her she will never come near me again  there we join issue sir cried pedgift senior i say she will snap her fingers at your letter which was one of the reasons why i objected to your writing it i say she is in all probability waiting her messengers return in or near your grounds at this moment i say she will try to force her way in here before fourandtwenty hours more are over your head egad sir cried mr pedgift looking at his watch its only seven oclock now shes bold enough and clever enough to catch you unawares this very evening permit me to ring for the servantpermit me to request that you will give him orders immediately to say you are not at home you neednt hesitate mr armadale if youre right about miss gwilt its a mere formality if im right its a wise precaution back your opinion sir said mr pedgift ringing the bell i back mine  allan was sufficiently nettled when the bell rang to feel ready to give the order but when the servant came in past remembrances got the better of him and the words stuck in his throat you give the order he said to mr pedgift and walked away abruptly to the window youre a good fellow thought the old lawyer looking after him and penetrating his motive on the instant the claws of that shedevil shant scratch you if i can help it  the servant waited inexorably for his orders  if miss gwilt calls here either this evening or at any other time said pedgift senior mr armadale is not at home wait if she asks when mr armadale will be back you dont know wait if she proposes coming in and sitting down you have a general order that nobody is to come in and sit down unless they have a previous appointment with mr armadale come cried old pedgift rubbing his hands cheerfully when the servant had left the room ive stopped her out now at any rate the orders are all given mr armadale we may go on with our conversation  allan came back from the window the conversation is not a very pleasant one he said no offense to you but i wish it was over  we will get it over as soon as possible sir said pedgift senior still persisting as only lawyers and women can persist in forcing his way little by little nearer and nearer to his own object let us go back if you please to the practical suggestion which i offered to you when the servant came in with miss gwilts note there is i repeat only one way left for you mr armadale out of your present awkward position you must pursue your inquiries about this woman to an endon the chance which i consider next to a certainty that the end will justify you in the estimation of the neighborhood  i wish to god i had never made any inquiries at all said allan nothing will induce me mr pedgift to make any more  why asked the lawyer  can you ask me why retorted allan hotly after your son has told you what we found out in london even if i had less cause to beto be sorry for miss gwilt than i have even if it was some other woman do you think i would inquire any further into the secret of a poor betrayed creaturemuch less expose it to the neighborhood i should think myself as great a scoundrel as the man who has cast her out helpless on the world if i did anything of the kind i wonder you can ask me the questionupon my soul i wonder you can ask me the question  give me your hand mr armadale cried pedgift senior warmly i honor you for being so angry with me the neighborhood may say what it pleases youre a gentleman sir in the best sense of the word now pursued the lawyer dropping allans hand and lapsing back instantly from sentiment to business just hear what i have got to say in my own defense suppose miss gwilts real position happens to be nothing like what you are generously determined to believe it to be  we have no reason to suppose that said allan resolutely  such is your opinion sir persisted pedgift mine founded on what is publicly known of miss gwilts proceedings here and on what i have seen of miss gwilt herself is that she is as far as i am from being the sentimental victim you are inclined to make her out gently mr armadale remember that i have put my opinion to a practical test and wait to condemn it offhand until events have justified you let me put my points sirmake allowances for me as a lawyerand let me put my points you and my son are young men and i dont deny that the circumstances on the surface appear to justify the interpretation which as young men you have placed on them i am an old mani know that circumstances are not always to be taken as they appear on the surfaceand i possess the great advantage in the present case of having had years of professional experience among some of the wickedest women who ever walked this earth  allan opened his lips to protest and checked himself in despair of producing the slightest effect pedgift senior bowed in polite acknowledgment of his clients selfrestraint and took instant advantage of it to go on  all miss gwilts proceedings he resumed since your unfortunate correspondence with the major show me that she is an old hand at deceit the moment she is threatened with exposureexposure of some kind there can be no doubt after what you discovered in londonshe turns your honorable silence to the best possible account and leaves the majors service in the character of a martyr once out of the house what does she do next she boldly stops in the neighborhood and serves three excellent purposes by doing so in the first place she shows everybody that she is not afraid of facing another attack on her reputation in the second place she is close at hand to twist you round her little finger and to become mrs armadale in spite of circumstances if you and i allow her the opportunity in the third place if you and i are wise enough to distrust her she is equally wise on her side and doesnt give us the first great chance of following her to london and associating her with her accomplices is this the conduct of an unhappy woman who has lost her character in a moment of weakness and who has been driven unwillingly into a deception to get it back again  you put it cleverly said allan answering with marked reluctance i cant deny that you put it cleverly  your own common sense mr armadale is beginning to tell you that i put it justly said pedgift senior i dont presume to say yet what this womans connection may be with those people at pimlico all i assert is that it is not the connection you suppose having stated the facts so far i have only to add my own personal impression of miss gwilt i wont shock you if i can help it ill try if i cant put it cleverly again she came to my office as i told you in my letter no doubt to make friends with your lawyer if she could she came to tell me in the most forgiving and christian manner that she didnt blame you  do you ever believe in anybody mr pedgift interposed allan  sometimes mr armadale returned pedgift the elder as unabashed as ever i believe as often as a lawyer can to proceed sir when i was in the criminal branch of practice it fell to my lot to take instructions for the defense of women committed for trial from the womens own lips whatever other difference there might be among them i got in time to notice among those who were particularly wicked and unquestionably guilty one point in which they all resembled each other tall and short old and young handsome and ugly they all had a secret selfpossession that nothing could shake on the surface they were as different as possible some of them were in a state of indignation some of them were drowned in tears some of them were full of pious confidence and some of them were resolved to commit suicide before the night was out but only put your finger suddenly on the weak point in the story told by any one of them and there was an end of her rage or her tears or her piety or her despair and out came the genuine woman in full possession of all her resources with a neat little lie that exactly suited the circumstances of the case miss gwilt was in tears sirbecoming tears that didnt make her nose redand i put my finger suddenly on the weak point in her story down dropped her pathetic pockethandkerchief from her beautiful blue eyes and out came the genuine woman with the neat little lie that exactly suited the circumstances i felt twenty years younger mr armadale on the spot i declare i thought i was in newgate again with my notebook in my hand taking my instructions for the defense  the next thing youll say mr pedgift cried allan angrily is that miss gwilt has been in prison  pedgift senior calmly rapped his snuffbox and had his answer ready at a moments notice  she may have richly deserved to see the inside of a prison mr armadale but in the age we live in that is one excellent reason for her never having been near any place of the kind a prison in the present tender state of public feeling for a charming woman like miss gwilt my dear sir if she had attempted to murder you or me and if an inhuman judge and jury had decided on sending her to a prison the first object of modern society would be to prevent her going into it and if that couldnt be done the next object would be to let her out again as soon as possible read your newspaper mr armadale and youll find we live in piping times for the black sheep of the communityif they are only black enough i insist on asserting sir that we have got one of the blackest of the lot to deal with in this case i insist on asserting that you have had the rare luck in these unfortunate inquiries to pitch on a woman who happens to be a fit object for inquiry in the interests of the public protection differ with me as strongly as you please but dont make up your mind finally about miss gwilt until events have put those two opposite opinions of ours to the test that i have proposed a fairer test there cant be i agree with you that no lady worthy of the name could attempt to force her way in here after receiving your letter but i deny that miss gwilt is worthy of the name and i say she will try to force her way in here in spite of you  and i say she wont retorted allan firmly  pedgift senior leaned back in his chair and smiled there was a momentary silence and in that silence the doorbell rang  the lawyer and the client both looked expectantly in the direction of the hall  no cried allan more angrily than ever  yes cried pedgift senior contradicting him with the utmost politeness  they waited the event the opening of the house door was audible but the room was too far from it for the sound of voices to reach the ear as well after a long interval of expectation the closing of the door was heard at last allan rose impetuously and rang the bell mr pedgift the elder sat sublimely calm and enjoyed with a gentle zest the largest pinch of snuff he had taken yet  anybody for me asked allan when the servant came in  the man looked at pedgift senior with an expression of unutterable reverence and answered miss gwilt  i dont want to crow over you sir said mr pedgift the elder when the servant had withdrawn but what do you think of miss gwilt now  allan shook his head in silent discouragement and distress  time is of some importance mr armadale after what has just happened do you still object to taking the course i have had the honor of suggesting to you  i cant mr pedgift said allan i cant be the means of disgracing her in the neighborhood i would rather be disgraced myselfas i am  let me put it in another way sir excuse my persisting you have been very kind to me and my family and i have a personal interest as well as a professional interest in you if you cant prevail on yourself to show this womans character in its true light will you take common precautions to prevent her doing any more harm will you consent to having her privately watched as long as she remains in this neighborhood  for the second time allan shook his head  is that your final resolution sir  it is mr pedgift but i am much obliged to you for your advice all the same  pedgift senior rose in a state of gentle resignation and took up his hat goodevening sir he said and made sorrowfully for the door allan rose on his side innocently supposing that the interview was at an end persons better acquainted with the diplomatic habits of his legal adviser would have recommended him to keep his seat the time was ripe for pedgifts postscript and the lawyers indicative snuffbox was at that moment in one of his hands as he opened the door with the other  goodevening said allan  pedgift senior opened the door stopped considered closed the door again came back mysteriously with his pinch of snuff in suspense between his box and his nose and repeating his invariable formula bytheby theres a point occurs to me quietly resumed possession of his empty chair  allan wondering took the seat in his turn which he had just left lawyer and client looked at each other once more and the inexhaustible interview began again     vi pedgifts postscript  i mentioned that a point had occurred to me sir remarked pedgift senior  you did said allan  would you like to hear what it is mr armadale  if you please said allan  with all my heart sir this is the point i attach considerable importanceif nothing else can be doneto having miss gwilt privately looked after as long as she stops at thorpe ambrose it struck me just now at the door mr armadale that what you are not willing to do for your own security you might be willing to do for the security of another person  what other person inquired allan  a young lady who is a near neighbor of yours sir shall i mention the name in confidence miss milroy  allan started and changed color  miss milroy he repeated can she be concerned in this miserable business i hope not mr pedgift i sincerely hope not  i paid a visit in your interests sir at the cottage this morning proceeded pedgift senior you shall hear what happened there and judge for yourself major milroy has been expressing his opinion of you pretty freely and i thought it highly desirable to give him a caution its always the way with those quiet addleheaded men when they do once wake up theres no reasoning with their obstinacy and no quieting their violence well sir this morning i went to the cottage the major and miss neelie were both in the parlormiss not looking so pretty as usual pale i thought pale and worn and anxious up jumps the addleheaded major i wouldnt give that mr armadale for the brains of a man who can occupy himself for half his lifetime in making a clockup jumps the addleheaded major in the loftiest manner and actually tries to look me down ha ha the idea of anybody looking me down at my time of life i behaved like a christian i nodded kindly to old whatsoclock fine morning major says i have you any business with me says he just a word says i miss neelie like the sensible girl she is gets up to leave the room and what does her ridiculous father do he stops her you neednt go my dear i have nothing to say to mr pedgift says this old military idiot and turns my way and tries to look me down again you are mr armadales lawyer says he if you come on any business relating to mr armadale i refer you to my solicitor his solicitor is darch and darch has had enough of me in business i can tell you my errand here major does certainly relate to mr armadale says i but it doesnt concern your lawyerat any rate just yet i wish to caution you to suspend your opinion of my client or if you wont do that to be careful how you express it in public i warn you that our turn is to come and that you are not at the end yet of this scandal about miss gwilt it struck me as likely that he would lose his temper when he found himself tackled in that way and he amply fulfilled my expectations he was quite violent in his languagethe poor weak creatureactually violent with me i behaved like a christian again i nodded kindly and wished him goodmorning when i looked round to wish miss neelie goodmorning too she was gone you seem restless mr armadale remarked pedgift senior as allan feeling the sting of old recollections suddenly started out of his chair and began pacing up and down the room i wont try your patience much longer sir i am coming to the point  i beg your pardon mr pedgift said allan returning to his seat and trying to look composedly at the lawyer through the intervening image of neelie which the lawyer had called up  well sir i left the cottage resumed pedgift senior just as i turned the corner from the garden into the park whom should i stumble on but miss neelie herself evidently on the lookout for me i want to speak to you for one moment mr pedgift says she does mr armadale think me mixed up in this matter she was violently agitatedtears in her eyes sir of the sort which my legal experience has not accustomed me to see i quite forgot myself i actually gave her my arm and led her away gently among the trees a nice position to find me in if any of the scandalmongers of the town had happened to be walking in that direction my dear miss milroy says i why should mr armadale think you mixed up in it  you ought to have told her at once that i thought nothing of the kind exclaimed allan indignantly why did you leave her a moment in doubt about it  because i am a lawyer mr armadale rejoined pedgift senior dryly even in moments of sentiment under convenient trees with a pretty girl on my arm i cant entirely divest myself of my professional caution dont look distressed sir pray i set things right in due course of time before i left miss milroy i told her in the plainest terms no such idea had ever entered your head  did she seem relieved asked allan  she was able to dispense with the use of my arm sir replied old pedgift as dryly as ever and to pledge me to inviolable secrecy on the subject of our interview she was particularly desirous that you should hear nothing about it if you are at all anxious on your side to know why i am now betraying her confidence i beg to inform you that her confidence related to no less a person than the lady who favored you with a call just nowmiss gwilt  allan who had been once more restlessly pacing the room stopped and returned to his chair  is this serious he asked  most serious sir returned pedgift senior i am betraying miss neelies secret in miss neelies own interest let us go back to that cautious question i put to her she found some little difficulty in answering it for the reply involved her in a narrative of the parting interview between her governess and herself this is the substance of it the two were alone when miss gwilt took leave of her pupil and the words she used as reported to me by miss neelie were these she said your mother has declined to allow me to take leave of her do you decline too miss neelies answer was a remarkably sensible one for a girl of her age we have not been good friends she said and i believe we are equally glad to part with each other but i have no wish to decline taking leave of you saying that she held out her hand miss gwilt stood looking at her steadily without taking it and addressed her in these words you are not mrs armadale yet gently sir keep your temper its not at all wonderful that a woman conscious of having her own mercenary designs on you should attribute similar designs to a young lady who happens to be your near neighbor let me go on miss neelie by her own confession and quite naturally i think was excessively indignant she owns to having answered you shameless creature how dare you say that to me miss gwilts rejoinder was rather a remarkable onethe anger on her side appears to have been of the cool still venomous kind nobody ever yet injured me miss milroy she said without sooner or later bitterly repenting it you will bitterly repent it she stood looking at her pupil for a moment in dead silence and then left the room miss neelie appears to have felt the imputation fastened on her in connection with you far more sensitively than she felt the threat she had previously known as everybody had known in the house that some unacknowledged proceedings of yours in london had led to miss gwilts voluntary withdrawal from her situation and she now inferred from the language addressed to her that she was actually believed by miss gwilt to have set those proceedings on foot to advance herself and to injure her governess in your estimation gently sir gently i havent quite done yet as soon as miss neelie had recovered herself she went upstairs to speak to mrs milroy miss gwilts abominable imputation had taken her by surprise and she went to her mother first for enlightenment and advice she got neither the one nor the other mrs milroy declared she was too ill to enter on the subject and she has remained too ill to enter on it ever since miss neelie applied next to her father the major stopped her the moment your name passed her lips he declared he would never hear you mentioned again by any member of his family she has been left in the dark from that time to this not knowing how she might have been misrepresented by miss gwilt or what falsehoods you might have been led to believe of her at my age and in my profession i dont profess to have any extraordinary softness of heart but i do think mr armadale that miss neelies position deserves our sympathy  ill do anything to help her cried allan impulsively you dont know mr pedgift what reason i have he checked himself and confusedly repeated his first words ill do anything he reiterated earnestlyanything in the world to help her  do you really mean that mr armadale excuse my asking but you can very materially help miss neelie if you choose  how asked allan only tell me how  by giving me your authority sir to protect her from miss gwilt  having fired that shot pointblank at his client the wise lawyer waited a little to let it take its effect before he said any more  allans face clouded and he shifted uneasily from side to side of his chair  your son is hard enough to deal with mr pedgift he said and you are harder than your son  thank you sir rejoined the ready pedgift in my sons name and my own for a handsome compliment to the firm if you really wish to be of assistance to miss neelie he went on more seriously i have shown you the way you can do nothing to quiet her anxiety which i have not done already as soon as i had assured her that no misconception of her conduct existed in your mind she went away satisfied her governesss parting threat doesnt seem to have dwelt on her memory i can tell you mr armadale it dwells on mine you know my opinion of miss gwilt and you know what miss gwilt herself has done this very evening to justify that opinion even in your eyes may i ask after all that has passed whether you think she is the sort of woman who can be trusted to confine herself to empty threats  the question was a formidable one to answer forced steadily back from the position which he had occupied at the outset of the interview by the irresistible pressure of plain facts allan began for the first time to show symptoms of yielding on the subject of miss gwilt is there no other way of protecting miss milroy but the way you have mentioned he asked uneasily  do you think the major would listen to you sir if you spoke to him asked pedgift senior sarcastically im rather afraid he wouldnt honor me with his attention or perhaps you would prefer alarming miss neelie by telling her in plain words that we both think her in danger or suppose you send me to miss gwilt with instructions to inform her that she has done her pupil a cruel injustice women are so proverbially ready to listen to reason and they are so universally disposed to alter their opinions of each other on applicationespecially when one woman thinks that another woman has destroyed her prospect of making a good marriage dont mind me mr armadale im only a lawyer and i can sit waterproof under another shower of miss gwilts tears  damn it mr pedgift tell me in plain words what you want to do cried allan losing his temper at last  in plain words mr armadale i want to keep miss gwilts proceedings privately under view as long as she stops in this neighborhood i answer for finding a person who will look after her delicately and discreetly and i agree to discontinue even this harmless superintendence of her actions if there isnt good reasons shown for continuing it to your entire satisfaction in a weeks time i make that moderate proposal sir in what i sincerely believe to be miss milroys interest and i wait your answer yes or no  cant i have time to consider asked allan driven to the last helpless expedient of taking refuge in delay  certainly mr armadale but dont forget while you are considering that miss milroy is in the habit of walking out alone in your park innocent of all apprehension of danger and that miss gwilt is perfectly free to take any advantage of that circumstance that miss gwilt pleases  do as you like exclaimed allan in despair and for gods sake dont torment me any longer  popular prejudice may deny it but the profession of the law is a practically christian profession in one respect at least of all the large collection of ready answers lying in wait for mankind on a lawyers lips none is kept in better working order than the soft answer which turneth away wrath pedgift senior rose with the alacrity of youth in his legs and the wise moderation of age on his tongue many thanks sir he said for the attention you have bestowed on me i congratulate you on your decision and i wish you goodevening this time his indicative snuffbox was not in his hand when he opened the door and he actually disappeared without coming back for a second postscript  allans head sank on his breast when he was left alone if it was only the end of the week he thought longingly if i only had midwinter back again  as that aspiration escaped the clients lips the lawyer got gayly into his gig hie away old girl cried pedgift senior patting the fasttrotting mare with the end of his whip i never keep a lady waitingand ive got business tonight with one of your own sex     vii the martyrdom of miss gwilt  the outskirts of the little town of thorpe ambrose on the side nearest to the great house have earned some local celebrity as exhibiting the prettiest suburb of the kind to be found in east norfolk here the villas and gardens are for the most part built and laid out in excellent taste the trees are in the prime of their growth and the healthy common beyond the houses rises and falls in picturesque and delightful variety of broken ground the rank fashion and beauty of the town make this place their evening promenade and when a stranger goes out for a drive if he leaves it to the coachman the coachman starts by way of the common as a matter of course  on the opposite side that is to say on the side furthest from the great house the suburbs in the year 1851 were universally regarded as a sore subject by all persons zealous for the reputation of the town  here nature was uninviting man was poor and social progress as exhibited under the form of building halted miserably the streets dwindled feebly as they receded from the center of the town into smaller and smaller houses and died away on the barren open ground into an atrophy of skeleton cottages builders hereabouts appeared to have universally abandoned their work in the first stage of its creation landholders set up poles on lost patches of ground and plaintively advertising that they were to let for building raised sickly little crops meanwhile in despair of finding a purchaser to deal with them all the waste paper of the town seemed to float congenially to this neglected spot and all the fretful children came and cried here in charge of all the slatternly nurses who disgraced the place if there was any intention in thorpe ambrose of sending a wornout horse to the knackers that horse was sure to be found waiting his doom in a field on this side of the town no growth flourished in these desert regions but the arid growth of rubbish and no creatures rejoiced but the creatures of the nightthe vermin here and there in the beds and the cats everywhere on the tiles  the sun had set and the summer twilight was darkening the fretful children were crying in their cradles the horse destined for the knacker dozed forlorn in the field of his imprisonment the cats waited stealthily in corners for the coming night but one living figure appeared in the lonely suburbthe figure of mr bashwood but one faint sound disturbed the dreadful silencethe sound of mr bashwoods softly stepping feet  moving slowly past the heaps of bricks rising at intervals along the road coasting carefully round the old iron and the broken tiles scattered here and there in his path mr bashwood advanced from the direction of the country toward one of the unfinished streets of the suburb his personal appearance had been apparently made the object of some special attention his false teeth were brilliantly white his wig was carefully brushed his mourning garments renewed throughout gleamed with the hideous and slimy gloss of cheap black cloth he moved with a nervous jauntiness and looked about him with a vacant smile having reached the first of the skeleton cottages his watery eyes settled steadily for the first time on the view of the street before him the next instant he started his breath quickened he leaned trembling and flushing against the unfinished wall at his side a lady still at some distance was advancing toward him down the length of the street shes coming he whispered with a strange mixture of rapture and fear of alternating color and paleness showing itself in his haggard face i wish i was the ground she treads on i wish i was the glove shes got on her hand he burst ecstatically into those extravagant words with a concentrated intensity of delight in uttering them that actually shook his feeble figure from head to foot  smoothly and gracefully the lady glided nearer and nearer until she revealed to mr bashwoods eyes what mr bashwoods instincts had recognized in the first instancethe face of miss gwilt  she was dressed with an exquisitely expressive economy of outlay the plainest straw bonnet procurable trimmed sparingly with the cheapest white ribbon was on her head modest and tasteful poverty expressed itself in the speckless cleanliness and the modestly proportioned skirts of her light print gown and in the scanty little mantilla of cheap black silk which she wore over it edged with a simple frilling of the same material the luster of her terrible red hair showed itself unshrinkingly in a plaited coronet above her forehead and escaped in one vagrant lovelock perfectly curled that dropped over her left shoulder her gloves fitting her like a second skin were of the sober brown hue which is slowest to show signs of use one hand lifted her dress daintily above the impurities of the road the other held a little nosegay of the commonest garden flowers noiselessly and smoothly she came on with a gentle and regular undulation of the print gown with the lovelock softly lifted from moment to moment in the evening breeze with her head a little drooped and her eyes on the groundin walk and look and manner in every casual movement that escaped her expressing that subtle mixture of the voluptuous and the modest which of the many attractive extremes that meet in women is in a mans eyes the most irresistible of all  mr bashwood she exclaimed in loud clear tones indicative of the utmost astonishment what a surprise to find you here i thought none but the wretched inhabitants ever ventured near this side of the town hush she added quickly in a whisper you heard right when you heard that mr armadale was going to have me followed and watched theres a man behind one of the houses we must talk out loud of indifferent things and look as if we had met by accident ask me what i am doing out loud directly you shall never see me again if you dont instantly leave off trembling and do what i tell you  she spoke with a merciless tyranny of eye and voicewith a merciless use of her power over the feeble creature whom she addressed mr bashwood obeyed her in tones that quavered with agitation and with eyes that devoured her beauty in a strange fascination of terror and delight  i am trying to earn a little money by teaching music she said in the voice intended to reach the spys ears if you are able to recommend me any pupils mr bashwood your good word will oblige me have you been in the grounds today she went on dropping her voice again in a whisper has mr armadale been near the cottage has miss milroy been out of the garden no are you sure look out for them tomorrow and next day and next day they are certain to meet and make it up again and i must and will know of it hush ask me my terms for teaching music what are you frightened about its me the mans afternot you louder than when you asked me what i was doing just now louder or i wont trust you any more ill go to somebody else  once more mr bashwood obeyed dont be angry with me he murmured faintly when he had spoken the necessary words my heart beats so youll kill me  you poor old dear she whispered back with a sudden change in her manner with an easy satirical tenderness what business have you with a heart at your age be here tomorrow at the same time and tell me what you have seen in the grounds my terms are only five shillings a lesson she went on in her louder tone im sure thats not much mr bashwood i give such long lessons and i get all my pupils music halfprice she suddenly dropped her voice again and looked him brightly into instant subjection dont let mr armadale out of your sight tomorrow if that girl manages to speak to him and if i dont hear of it ill frighten you to death if i do hear of it ill kiss you hush wish me goodnight and go on to the town and leave me to go the other way i dont want youim not afraid of the man behind the houses i can deal with him by myself say goodnight and ill let you shake hands say it louder and ill give you one of my flowers if youll promise not to fall in love with it she raised her voice again goodnight mr bashwood dont forget my terms five shillings a lesson and the lessons last an hour at a time and i get all my pupils music halfprice which is an immense advantage isnt it she slipped a flower into his handfrowned him into obedience and smiled to reward him for obeying at the same momentlifted her dress again above the impurities of the roadand went on her way with a dainty and indolent deliberation as a cat goes on her way when she has exhausted the enjoyment of frightening a mouse  left alone mr bashwood turned to the low cottage wall near which he had been standing and resting himself on it wearily looked at the flower in his hand  his past existence had disciplined him to bear disaster and insult as few happier men could have borne them but it had not prepared him to feel the masterpassion of humanity for the first time at the dreary end of his life in the hopeless decay of a manhood that had withered under the double blight of conjugal disappointment and parental sorrow oh if i was only young again murmured the poor wretch resting his arms on the wall and touching the flower with his dry fevered lips in a stealthy rapture of tenderness she might have liked me when i was twenty he suddenly started back into an erect position and stared about him in vacant bewilderment and terror she told me to go home he said with a startled look why am i stopping here he turned and hurried on to the townin such dread of her anger if she looked round and saw him that he never so much as ventured on a backward glance at the road by which she had retired and never detected the spy dogging her footsteps under cover of the empty houses and the brickheaps by the roadside  smoothly and gracefully carefully preserving the speckless integrity of her dress never hastening her pace and never looking aside to the right hand or the left miss gwilt pursued her way toward the open country the suburban road branched off at its end in two directions on the left the path wound through a ragged little coppice to the grazing grounds of a neighboring farm on the right it led across a hillock of waste land to the highroad stopping a moment to consider but not showing the spy that she suspected him by glancing behind her while there was a hidingplace within his reach miss gwilt took the path across the hillock ill catch him there she said to herself looking up quietly at the long straight line of the empty highroad  once on the ground that she had chosen for her purpose she met the difficulties of the position with perfect tact and selfpossession after walking some thirty yards along the road she let her nosegay drop half turned round in stooping to pick it up saw the man stopping at the same moment behind her and instantly went on again quickening her pace little by little until she was walking at the top of her speed the spy fell into the snare laid for him seeing the night coming and fearing that he might lose sight of her in the darkness he rapidly lessened the distance between them miss gwilt went on faster and faster till she plainly heard his footstep behind her then stopped turned and met the man face to face the next moment  my compliments to mr armadale she said and tell him ive caught you watching me  im not watching you miss retorted the spy thrown off his guard by the daring plainness of the language in which she had spoken to him  miss gwilts eyes measured him contemptuously from head to foot he was a weakly undersized man she was the taller and quite possibly the stronger of the two  take your hat off you blackguard when you speak to a lady she said and tossed his hat in an instant across a ditch by which they were standing into a pool on the other side  this time the spy was on his guard he knew as well as miss gwilt knew the use which might be made of the precious minutes if he turned his back on her and crossed the ditch to recover his hat its well for you youre a woman he said standing scowling at her bareheaded in the fastdarkening light  miss gwilt glanced sidelong down the onward vista of the road and saw through the gathering obscurity the solitary figure of a man rapidly advancing toward her some women would have noticed the approach of a stranger at that hour and in that lonely place with a certain anxiety miss gwilt was too confident in her own powers of persuasion not to count on the mans assistance beforehand whoever he might be because he was a man she looked back at the spy with redoubled confidence in herself and measured him contemptuously from head to foot for the second time  i wonder whether im strong enough to throw you after your hat she said ill take a turn and consider it  she sauntered on a few steps toward the figure advancing along the road the spy followed her close try it he said brutally youre a fine woman youre welcome to put your arms round me if you like as the words escaped him he too saw the stranger for the first time he drew back a step and waited miss gwilt on her side advanced a step and waited too  the stranger came on with the lithe light step of a practiced walker swinging a stick in his hand and carrying a knapsack on his shoulders a few paces nearer and his face became visible he was a dark man his black hair was powdered with dust and his black eyes were looking steadfastly forward along the road before him  miss gwilt advanced with the first signs of agitation she had shown yet is it possible she said softly can it really be you  it was midwinter on his way back to thorpe ambrose after his fortnight among the yorkshire moors  he stopped and looked at her in breathless surprise the image of the woman had been in his thoughts at the moment when the woman herself spoke to him miss gwilt he exclaimed and mechanically held out his hand  she took it and pressed it gently i should have been glad to see you at any time she said you dont know how glad i am to see you now may i trouble you to speak to that man he has been following me and annoying me all the way from the town  midwinter stepped past her without uttering a word faint as the light was the spy saw what was coming in his face and turning instantly leaped the ditch by the roadside before midwinter could follow miss gwilts hand was on his shoulder  no she said you dont know who his employer is  midwinter stopped and looked at her  strange things have happened since you left us she went on i have been forced to give up my situation and i am followed and watched by a paid spy dont ask who forced me out of my situation and who pays the spyat least not just yet i cant make up my mind to tell you till i am a little more composed let the wretch go do you mind seeing me safe back to my lodging its in your way home may imay i ask for the support of your arm my little stock of courage is quite exhausted she took his arm and clung close to it the woman who had tyrannized over mr bashwood was gone and the woman who had tossed the spys hat into the pool was gone a timid shrinking interesting creature filled the fair skin and trembled on the symmetrical limbs of miss gwilt she put her handkerchief to her eyes they say necessity has no law she murmured faintly i am treating you like an old friend god knows i want one  they went on toward the town she recovered herself with a touching fortitude she put her handkerchief back in her pocket and persisted in turning the conversation on midwinters walking tour it is bad enough to be a burden on you she said gently pressing on his arm as she spoke i mustnt distress you as well tell me where you have been and what you have seen interest me in your journey help me to escape from myself  they reached the modest little lodging in the miserable little suburb miss gwilt sighed and removed her glove before she took midwinters hand i have taken refuge here she said simply it is clean and quiet i am too poor to want or expect more we must say goodby i suppose unlessshe hesitated modestly and satisfied herself by a quick look round that they were unobservedunless you would like to come in and rest a little i feel so gratefully toward you mr midwinter is there any harm do you think in my offering you a cup of tea  the magnetic influence of her touch was thrilling through him while she spoke change and absence to which he had trusted to weaken her hold on him had treacherously strengthened it instead a man exceptionally sensitive a man exceptionally pure in his past life he stood hand in hand in the tempting secrecy of the night with the first woman who had exercised over him the allabsorbing influence of her sex at his age and in his position who could have left her the man with a mans temperament doesnt live who could have left her midwinter went in  a stupid sleepy lad opened the house door even he being a male creature brightened under the influence of miss gwilt the urn john she said kindly and another cup and saucer ill borrow your candle to light my candles upstairs and then i wont trouble you any more tonight john was wakeful and active in an instant no trouble miss he said with awkward civility miss gwilt took his candle with a smile how good people are to me she whispered innocently to midwinter as she led the way upstairs to the little drawingroom on the first floor  she lit the candles and turning quickly on her guest stopped him at the first attempt he made to remove the knapsack from his shoulders no she said gently in the good old times there were occasions when the ladies unarmed their knights i claim the privilege of unarming my knight her dexterous fingers intercepted his at the straps and buckles and she had the dusty knapsack off before he could protest against her touching it  they sat down at the one little table in the room it was very poorly furnished but there was something of the dainty neatness of the woman who inhabited it in the arrangement of the few poor ornaments on the chimneypiece in the one or two prettily bound volumes on the chiffonier in the flowers on the table and the modest little workbasket in the window women are not all coquettes she said as she took off her bonnet and mantilla and laid them carefully on a chair i wont go into my room and look in my glass and make myself smart you shall take me just as i am her hands moved about among the teathings with a smooth noiseless activity  her magnificent hair flashed crimson in the candlelight as she turned her head hither and thither searching with an easy grace for the things she wanted in the tray exercise had heightened the brilliancy of her complexion and had quickened the rapid alternations of expression in her eyesthe delicious languor that stole over them when she was listening or thinking the bright intelligence that flashed from them softly when she spoke in the lightest word she said in the least thing she did there was something that gently solicited the heart of the man who sat with her perfectly modest in her manner possessed to perfection of the graceful restraints and refinements of a lady she had all the allurements that feast the eye all the siren invitations that seduce the sensea subtle suggestiveness in her silence and a sexual sorcery in her smile  should i be wrong she asked suddenly suspending the conversation which she had thus far persistently restricted to the subject of midwinters walking tour if i guessed that you have something on your mindsomething which neither my tea nor my talk can charm away are men as curious as women is the somethingme  midwinter struggled against the fascination of looking at her and listening to her i am very anxious to hear what has happened since i have been away he said but i am still more anxious miss gwilt not to distress you by speaking of a painful subject  she looked at him gratefully it is for your sake that i have avoided the painful subject she said toying with her spoon among the dregs in her empty cup but you will hear about it from others if you dont hear about it from me and you ought to know why you found me in that strange situation and why you see me here pray remember one thing to begin with i dont blame your friend mr armadale i blame the people whose instrument he is  midwinter started is it possible he began that allan can be in any way answerable he stopped and looked at miss gwilt in silent astonishment  she gently laid her hand on his dont be angry with me for only telling the truth she said your friend is answerable for everything that has happened to meinnocently answerable mr midwinter i firmly believe we are both victims he is the victim of his position as the richest single man in the neighborhood and i am the victim of miss milroys determination to marry him  miss milroy repeated midwinter more and more astonished why allan himself told me he stopped again  he told you that i was the object of his admiration poor fellow he admires everybody his head is almost as empty as this said miss gwilt smiling indicatively into the hollow of her cup she dropped the spoon sighed and became serious again i am guilty of the vanity of having let him admire me she went on penitently without the excuse of being able on my side to reciprocate even the passing interest that he felt in me i dont undervalue his many admirable qualities or the excellent position he can offer to his wife but a womans heart is not to be commandedno mr midwinter not even by the fortunate master of thorpe ambrose who commands everything else  she looked him full in the face as she uttered that magnanimous sentiment his eyes dropped before hers and his dark color deepened he had felt his heart leap in him at the declaration of her indifference to allan for the first time since they had known each other his interests now stood selfrevealed before him as openly adverse to the interests of his friend  i have been guilty of the vanity of letting mr armadale admire me and i have suffered for it resumed miss gwilt if there had been any confidence between my pupil and me i might have easily satisfied her that she might become mrs armadaleif she couldwithout having any rivalry to fear on my part but miss milroy disliked and distrusted me from the first she took her own jealous view no doubt of mr armadales thoughtless attentions to me it was her interest to destroy the position such as it was that i held in his estimation and it is quite likely her mother assisted her mrs milroy had her motive also which i am really ashamed to mention for wishing to drive me out of the house anyhow the conspiracy has succeeded i have been forced with mr armadales help to leave the majors service dont be angry mr midwinter dont form a hasty opinion i dare say miss milroy has some good qualities though i have not found them out and i assure you again and again that i dont blame mr armadale i only blame the people whose instrument he is  how is he their instrument how can he be the instrument of any enemy of yours asked midwinter pray excuse my anxiety miss gwilt allans good name is as dear to me as my own  miss gwilts eyes turned full on him again and miss gwilts heart abandoned itself innocently to an outburst of enthusiasm how i admire your earnestness she said how i like your anxiety for your friend oh if women could only form such friendships oh you happy happy men her voice faltered and her convenient teacup absorbed her for the third time i would give all the little beauty i possess she said if i could only find such a friend as mr armadale has found in you i never shall mr midwinteri never shall let us go back to what we were talking about i can only tell you how your friend is concerned in my misfortune by telling you something first about myself i am like many other governesses i am the victim of sad domestic circumstances it may be weak of me but i have a horror of alluding to them among strangers my silence about my family and my friends exposes me to misinterpretation in my dependent position does it do me any harm mr midwinter in your estimation  god forbid said midwinter fervently there is no man living he went on thinking of his own family story who has better reason to understand and respect your silence than i have  miss gwilt seized his hand impulsively oh she said i knew it the first moment i saw you i knew that you too had suffered that you too had sorrows which you kept sacred strange strange sympathy i believe in mesmerismdo you she suddenly recollected herself and shuddered oh what have i done what must you think of me she exclaimed as he yielded to the magnetic fascination of her touch and forgetting everything but the hand that lay warm in his own bent over it and kissed it spare me she said faintly as she felt the burning touch of his lips i am so friendlessi am so completely at your mercy  he turned away from her and hid his face in his hands he was trembling and she saw it she looked at him while his face was hidden from her she looked at him with a furtive interest and surprise how that man loves me she thought i wonder whether there was a time when i might have loved him  the silence between them remained unbroken for some minutes he had felt her appeal to his consideration as she had never expected or intended him to feel ithe shrank from looking at her or from speaking to her again  shall i go on with my story she asked shall we forget and forgive on both sides a womans inveterate indulgence for every expression of a mans admiration which keeps within the limits of personal respect curved her lips gently into a charming smile she looked down meditatively at her dress and brushed a crumb off her lap with a little flattering sigh i was telling you she went on of my reluctance to speak to strangers of my sad family story it was in that way as i afterward found out that i laid myself open to miss milroys malice and miss milroys suspicion private inquiries about me were addressed to the lady who was my referenceat miss milroys suggestion in the first instance i have no doubt i am sorry to say this is not the worst of it by some underhand means of which i am quite ignorant mr armadales simplicity was imposed on and when application was made secretly to my reference in london it was made mr midwinter through your friend  midwinter suddenly rose from his chair and looked at her the fascination that she exercised over him powerful as it was became a suspended influence now that the plain disclosure came plainly at last from her lips he looked at her and sat down again like a man bewildered without uttering a word  remember how weak he is pleaded miss gwilt gently and make allowances for him as i do the trifling accident of his failing to find my reference at the address given him seems i cant imagine why to have excited mr armadales suspicion at any rate he remained in london what he did there it is impossible for me to say i was quite in the dark i knew nothing i distrusted nobody i was as happy in my little round of duties as i could be with a pupil whose affections i had failed to win when one morning to my indescribable astonishment major milroy showed me a correspondence between mr armadale and himself he spoke to me in his wifes presence poor creature i make no complaint of her such affliction as she suffers excuses everything i wish i could give you some idea of the letters between major milroy and mr armadale but my head is only a womans head and i was so confused and distressed at the time all i can tell you is that mr armadale chose to preserve silence about his proceedings in london under circumstances which made that silence a reflection on my character the major was most kind his confidence in me remained unshaken but could his confidence protect me against his wifes prejudice and his daughters illwill oh the hardness of women to each other oh the humiliation if men only knew some of us as we really are what could i do i couldnt defend myself against mere imputations and i couldnt remain in my situation after a slur had been cast on me my pride heaven help me i was brought up like a gentlewoman and i have sensibilities that are not blunted even yetmy pride got the better of me and i left my place dont let it distress you mr midwinter theres a bright side to the picture the ladies in the neighborhood have overwhelmed me with kindness i have the prospect of getting pupils to teach i am spared the mortification of going back to be a burden on my friends the only complaint i have to make is i think a just one mr armadale has been back at thorpe ambrose for some days i have entreated him by letter to grant me an interview to tell me what dreadful suspicions he has of me and to let me set myself right in his estimation would you believe it he has declined to see meunder the influence of others not of his own free will i am sure cruel isnt it but he has even used me more cruelly still he persists in suspecting me it is he who is having me watched oh mr midwinter dont hate me for telling you what you must know the man you found persecuting me and frightening me tonight was only earning his money after all as mr armadales spy  once more midwinter started to his feet and this time the thoughts that were in him found their way into words  i cant believe it i wont believe it he exclaimed indignantly if the man told you that the man lied i beg your pardon miss gwilt i beg your pardon from the bottom of my heart dont pray dont think i doubt you i only say there is some dreadful mistake i am not sure that i understand as i ought all that you have told me but this last infamous meanness of which you think allan guilty i do understand i swear to you he is incapable of it some scoundrel has been taking advantage of him some scoundrel has been using his name ill prove it to you if you will only give me time let me go and clear it up at once i cant rest i cant bear to think of it i cant even enjoy the pleasure of being here oh he burst out desperately im sure you feel for me after what you have saidi feel so for you  he stopped in confusion miss gwilts eyes were looking at him again and miss gwilts hand had found its way once more into his own  you are the most generous of living men she said softly i will believe what you tell me to believe go she added in a whisper suddenly releasing his hand and turning away from him for both our sakes go  his heart beat fast he looked at her as she dropped into a chair and put her handkerchief to her eyes for one moment he hesitated the next he snatched up his knapsack from the floor and left her precipitately without a backward look or a parting word  she rose when the door closed on him a change came over her the instant she was alone the color faded out of her cheeks the beauty died out of her eyes her face hardened horribly with a silent despair its even baser work than i bargained for she said to deceive him after pacing to and fro in the room for some minutes she stopped wearily before the glass over the fireplace you strange creature she murmured leaning her elbows on the mantelpiece and languidly addressing the reflection of herself in the glass have you got any conscience left and has that man roused it  the reflection of her face changed slowly the color returned to her cheeks the delicious languor began to suffuse her eyes again her lips parted gently and her quickening breath began to dim the surface of the glass she drew back from it after a moments absorption in her own thoughts with a start of terror what am i doing she asked herself in a sudden panic of astonishment am i mad enough to be thinking of him in that way  she burst into a mocking laugh and opened her desk on the table recklessly with a bang its high time i had some talk with mother jezebel she said and sat down to write to mrs oldershaw  i have met with mr midwinter she began under very lucky circumstances and i have made the most of my opportunity he has just left me for his friend armadale and one of two good things will happen tomorrow if they dont quarrel the doors of thorpe ambrose will be opened to me again at mr midwinters intercession if they do quarrel i shall be the unhappy cause of it and i shall find my way in for myself on the purely christian errand of reconciling them  she hesitated at the next sentence wrote the first few words of it scratched them out again and petulantly tore the letter into fragments and threw the pen to the other end of the room turning quickly on her chair she looked at the seat which midwinter had occupied her foot restlessly tapping the floor and her handkerchief thrust like a gag between her clinched teeth young as you are she thought with her mind reviving the image of him in the empty chair there has been something out of the common in your life and i must and will know it  the house clock struck the hour and roused her she sighed and walking back to the glass wearily loosened the fastenings of her dress wearily removed the studs from the chemisette beneath it and put them on the chimneypiece she looked indolently at the reflected beauties of her neck and bosom as she unplaited her hair and threw it back in one great mass over her shoulders fancy she thought if he saw me now she turned back to the table and sighed again as she extinguished one of the candles and took the other in her hand midwinter she said as she passed through the foldingdoors of the room to her bedchamber i dont believe in his name to begin with   the night had advanced by more than an hour before midwinter was back again at the great house  twice well as the homeward way was known to him he had strayed out of the right road the events of the eveningthe interview with miss gwilt herself after his fortnights solitary thinking of her the extraordinary change that had taken place in her position since he had seen her last and the startling assertion of allans connection with ithad all conspired to throw his mind into a state of ungovernable confusion the darkness of the cloudy night added to his bewilderment even the familiar gates of thorpe ambrose seemed strange to him when he tried to think of it it was a mystery to him how he had reached the place  the front of the house was dark and closed for the night midwinter went round to the back the sound of mens voices as he advanced caught his ear they were soon distinguishable as the voices of the first and second footman and the subject of conversation between them was their master  ill bet you an even halfcrown hes driven out of the neighborhood before another week is over his head said the first footman  done said the second he isnt as easy driven as you think  isnt he retorted the other hell be mobbed if he stops here i tell you again hes not satisfied with the mess hes got into already i know it for certain hes having the governess watched  at those words midwinter mechanically checked himself before he turned the corner of the house his first doubt of the result of his meditated appeal to allan ran through him like a sudden chill the influence exercised by the voice of public scandal is a force which acts in opposition to the ordinary law of mechanics it is strongest not by concentration but by distribution to the primary sound we may shut our ears but the reverberation of it in echoes is irresistible on his way back midwinters one desire had been to find allan up and to speak to him immediately his one hope now was to gain time to contend with the new doubts and to silence the new misgivings his one present anxiety was to hear that allan had gone to bed he turned the corner of the house and presented himself before the men smoking their pipes in the back garden as soon as their astonishment allowed them to speak they offered to rouse their master allan had given his friend up for that night and had gone to bed about half an hour since  it was my masters particular order sir said the headfootman that he was to be told of it if you came back  it is my particular request returned midwinter that you wont disturb him  the men looked at each other wonderingly as he took his candle and left them     viii she comes between them  appointed hours for the various domestic events of the day were things unknown at thorpe ambrose irregular in all his habits allan accommodated himself to no stated times with the solitary exception of dinnertime at any hour of the day or night he retired to rest early or late and he rose early or late exactly as he felt inclined the servants were forbidden to call him and mrs gripper was accustomed to improvise the breakfast as she best might from the time when the kitchen fire was first lighted to the time when the clock stood on the stroke of noon  toward nine oclock on the morning after his return midwinter knocked at allans door and on entering the room found it empty after inquiry among the servants it appeared that allan had risen that morning before the man who usually attended on him was up and that his hot water had been brought to the door by one of the housemaids who was then still in ignorance of midwinters return nobody had chanced to see the master either on the stairs or in the hall nobody had heard him ring the bell for breakfast as usual in brief nobody knew anything about him except what was obviously clear to allthat he was not in the house  midwinter went out under the great portico he stood at the head of the flight of steps considering in which direction he should set forth to look for his friend allans unexpected absence added one more to the disquieting influences which still perplexed his mind he was in the mood in which trifles irritate a man and fancies are allpowerful to exalt or depress his spirits  the sky was cloudy and the wind blew in puffs from the south there was every prospect to weatherwise eyes of coming rain while midwinter was still hesitating one of the grooms passed him on the drive below the man proved on being questioned to be better informed about his masters movements than the servants indoors he had seen allan pass the stables more than an hour since going out by the back way into the park with a nosegay in his hand  a nosegay in his hand the nosegay hung incomprehensibly on midwinters mind as he walked round on the chance of meeting allan to the back of the house what does the nosegay mean he asked himself with an unintelligible sense of irritation and a petulant kick at a stone that stood in his way  it meant that allan had been following his impulses as usual the one pleasant impression left on his mind after his interview with pedgift senior was the impression made by the lawyers account of his conversation with neelie in the park the anxiety that he should not misjudge her which the majors daughter had so earnestly expressed placed her before allans eyes in an irresistibly attractive characterthe character of the one person among all his neighbors who had some respect still left for his good opinion acutely sensible of his social isolation now that there was no midwinter to keep him company in the empty house hungering and thirsting in his solitude for a kind word and a friendly look he began to think more and more regretfully and more and more longingly of the bright young face so pleasantly associated with his first happiest days at thorpe ambrose to be conscious of such a feeling as this was with a character like allans to act on it headlong lead him where it might he had gone out on the previous morning to look for neelie with a peaceoffering of flowers but with no very distinct idea of what he should say to her if they met and failing to find her on the scene of her customary walks he had characteristically persisted the next morning in making a second attempt with another peaceoffering on a larger scale still ignorant of his friends return he was now at some distance from the house searching the park in a direction which he had not tried yet  after walking out a few hundred yards beyond the stables and failing to discover any signs of allan midwinter retraced his steps and waited for his friends return pacing slowly to and fro on the little strip of garden ground at the back of the house  from time to time as he passed it he looked in absently at the room which had formerly been mrs armadales which was now through his interposition habitually occupied by her sonthe room with the statuette on the bracket and the french windows opening to the ground which had once recalled to him the second vision of the dream the shadow of the man which allan had seen standing opposite to him at the long window the view over a lawn and flowergarden the pattering of the rain against the glass the stretching out of the shadows arm and the fall of the statue in fragments on the floorthese objects and events of the visionary scene so vividly present to his memory once were all superseded by later remembrances now were all left to fade as they might in the dim background of time he could pass the room again and again alone and anxious and never once think of the boat drifting away in the moonlight and the nights imprisonment on the wrecked ship  toward ten oclock the wellremembered sound of allans voice became suddenly audible in the direction of the stables in a moment more he was visible from the garden his second mornings search for neelie had ended to all appearance in a second defeat of his object the nosegay was still in his hand and he was resignedly making a present of it to one of the coachmans children  midwinter impulsively took a step forward toward the stables and abruptly checked his further progress  conscious that his position toward his friend was altered already in relation to miss gwilt the first sight of allan filled his mind with a sudden distrust of the governesss influence over him which was almost a distrust of himself he knew that he had set forth from the moors on his return to thorpe ambrose with the resolution of acknowledging the passion that had mastered him and of insisting if necessary on a second and a longer absence in the interests of the sacrifice which he was bent on making to the happiness of his friend what had become of that resolution now the discovery of miss gwilts altered position and the declaration that she had voluntarily made of her indifference to allan had scattered it to the winds the first words with which he would have met his friend if nothing had happened to him on the homeward way were words already dismissed from his lips he drew back as he felt it and struggled with an instinctive loyalty toward allan to free himself at the last moment from the influence of miss gwilt  having disposed of his useless nosegay allan passed on into the garden and the instant he entered it recognized midwinter with a loud cry of surprise and delight  am i awake or dreaming he exclaimed seizing his friend excitably by both hands you dear old midwinter have you sprung up out of the ground or have you dropped from the clouds  it was not till midwinter had explained the mystery of his unexpected appearance in every particular that allan could be prevailed on to say a word about himself when he did speak he shook his head ruefully and subdued the hearty loudness of his voice with a preliminary look round to see if the servants were within hearing  ive learned to be cautious since you went away and left me said allan my dear fellow you havent the least notion what things have happened and what an awful scrape im in at this very moment  you are mistaken allan i have heard more of what has happened than you suppose  what the dreadful mess im in with miss gwilt the row with the major the infernal scandalmongering in the neighborhood you dont mean to say  yes interposed midwinter quietly i have heard of it all  good heavens how did you stop at thorpe ambrose on your way back have you been in the coffeeroom at the hotel have you met pedgift have you dropped into the reading rooms and seen what they call the freedom of the press in the town newspaper  midwinter paused before he answered and looked up at the sky the clouds had been gathering unnoticed over their heads and the first raindrops were beginning to fall  come in here said allan well go up to breakfast this way he led midwinter through the open french window into his own sittingroom the wind blew toward that side of the house and the rain followed them in midwinter who was last turned and closed the window  allan was too eager for the answer which the weather had interrupted to wait for it till they reached the breakfastroom he stopped close at the window and added two more to his string of questions  how can you possibly have heard about me and miss gwilt he asked who told you  miss gwilt herself replied midwinter gravely  allans manner changed the moment the governesss name passed his friends lips  i wish you had heard my story first he said where did you meet with miss gwilt  there was a momentary pause they both stood still at the window absorbed in the interest of the moment they both forgot that their contemplated place of shelter from the rain had been the breakfastroom upstairs  before i answer your question said midwinter a little constrainedly i want to ask you something allan on my side is it really true that you are in some way concerned in miss gwilts leaving major milroys service  there was another pause the disturbance which had begun to appear in allans manner palpably increased  its rather a long story he began i have been taken in midwinter ive been imposed on by a person whoi cant help saying itwho cheated me into promising what i oughtnt to have promised and doing what i had better not have done it isnt breaking my promise to tell you i can trust in your discretion cant i you will never say a word will you  stop said midwinter dont trust me with any secrets which are not your own if you have given a promise dont trifle with it even in speaking to such an intimate friend as i am he laid his hand gently and kindly on allans shoulder i cant help seeing that i have made you a little uncomfortable he went on i cant help seeing that my question is not so easy a one to answer as i had hoped and supposed shall we wait a little shall we go upstairs and breakfast first  allan was far too earnestly bent on presenting his conduct to his friend in the right aspect to heed midwinters suggestion he spoke eagerly on the instant without moving from the window  my dear fellow its a perfectly easy question to answer onlyhe hesitatedonly it requires what im a bad hand at it requires an explanation  do you mean asked midwinter more seriously but not less gently than before that you must first justify yourself and then answer my question  thats it said allan with an air of relief youre hit the right nail on the head just as usual  midwinters face darkened for the first time i am sorry to hear it he said his voice sinking low and his eyes dropping to the ground as he spoke  the rain was beginning to fall thickly it swept across the garden straight on the closed windows and pattered heavily against the glass  sorry repeated allan my dear fellow you havent heard the particulars yet wait till i explain the thing first  you are a bad hand at explanations said midwinter repeating allans own words dont place yourself at a disadvantage dont explain it  allan looked at him in silent perplexity and surprise  you are my friendmy best and dearest friend midwinter went on i cant bear to let you justify yourself to me as if i was your judge or as if i doubted you he looked up again at allan frankly and kindly as he said those words besides he resumed i think if i look into my memory i can anticipate your explanation we had a moments talk before i went away about some very delicate questions which you proposed putting to major milroy i remember i warned you i remember i had my misgivings should i be guessing right if i guessed that those questions have been in some way the means of leading you into a false position if it is true that you have been concerned in miss gwilts leaving her situation is it also trueis it only doing you justice to believethat any mischief for which you are responsible has been mischief innocently done  yes said allan speaking for the first time a little constrainedly on his side it is only doing me justice to say that he stopped and began drawing lines absently with his finger on the blurred surface of the windowpane youre not like other people midwinter he resumed suddenly with an effort and i should have liked you to have heard the particulars all the same  i will hear them if you desire it returned midwinter but i am satisfied without another word that you have not willingly been the means of depriving miss gwilt of her situation if that is understood between you and me i think we need say no more besides i have another question to ask of much greater importancea question that has been forced on me by what i saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears last night  he stopped recoiling in spite of himself shall we go upstairs first he asked abruptly leading the way to the door and trying to gain time  it was useless once again the room which they were both free to leave the room which one of them had twice tried to leave already held them as if they were prisoners  without answering without even appearing to have heard midwinters proposal to go upstairs allan followed him mechanically as far as the opposite side of the window there he stopped midwinter he burst out in a sudden panic of astonishment and alarm there seems to be something strange between us youre not like yourself what is it  with his hand on the lock of the door midwinter turned and looked back into the room the moment had come his haunting fear of doing his friend an injustice had shown itself in a restraint of word look and action which had been marked enough to force its way to allans notice the one course left now in the dearest interests of the friendship that united them was to speak at once and to speak boldly  theres something strange between us reiterated allan for gods sake what is it  midwinter took his hand from the door and came down again to the window fronting allan he occupied the place of necessity which allan had just left it was the side of the window on which the statuette stood the little figure placed on its projecting bracket was close behind him on his right hand no signs of change appeared in the stormy sky the rain still swept slanting across the garden and pattered heavily against the glass  give me your hand allan  allan gave it and midwinter held it firmly while he spoke  there is something strange between us he said there is something to be set right which touches you nearly and it has not been set right yet you asked me just now where i met with miss gwilt i met with her on my way back here upon the highroad on the further side of the town she entreated me to protect her from a man who was following and frightening her i saw the scoundrel with my own eyes and i should have laid hands on him if miss gwilt herself had not stopped me she gave a very strange reason for stopping me she said i didnt know who his employer was  allans ruddy color suddenly deepened he looked aside quickly through the window at the pouring rain at the same moment their hands fell apart and there was a pause of silence on either side midwinter was the first to speak again  later in the evening he went on miss gwilt explained herself she told me two things she declared that the man whom i had seen following her was a hired spy i was surprised but i could not dispute it she told me next allanwhat i believe with my whole heart and soul to be a falsehood which has been imposed on her as the truthshe told me that the spy was in your employment  allan turned instantly from the window and looked midwinter full in the face again i must explain myself this time he said resolutely  the ashy paleness peculiar to him in moments of strong emotion began to show itself on midwinters cheeks  more explanations he said and drew back a step with his eyes fixed in a sudden terror of inquiry on allans face  you dont know what i know midwinter you dont know that what i have done has been done with a good reason and what is more i have not trusted to myselfi have had good advice  did you hear what i said just now asked midwinter incredulously you cantsurely you cant have been attending to me  i havent missed a word rejoined allan i tell you again you dont know what i know of miss gwilt she has threatened miss milroy miss milroy is in danger while her governess stops in this neighborhood  midwinter dismissed the majors daughter from the conversation with a contemptuous gesture of his hand  i dont want to hear about miss milroy he said dont mix up miss milroygood god allan am i to understand that the spy set to watch miss gwilt was doing his vile work with your approval  once for all my dear fellow will you or will you not let me explain  explain cried midwinter his eyes aflame and his hot creole blood rushing crimson into his face explain the employment of a spy what after having driven miss gwilt out of her situation by meddling with her private affairs you meddle again by the vilest of all meansthe means of a paid spy you set a watch on the woman whom you yourself told me you loved only a fortnight sincethe woman you were thinking of as your wife i dont believe it i wont believe it is my head failing me is it allan armadale i am speaking to is it allan armadales face looking at me stop you are acting under some mistaken scruple some low fellow has crept into your confidence and has done this in your name without telling you first  allan controlled himself with admirable patience and admirable consideration for the temper of his friend if you persist in refusing to hear me he said i must wait as well as i can till my turn comes  tell me you are a stranger to the employment of that man and i will hear you willingly  suppose there should be a necessity that you know nothing about for employing him  i acknowledge no necessity for the cowardly persecution of a helpless woman  a momentary flush of irritationmomentary and no morepassed over allans face you mightnt think her quite so helpless he said if you knew the truth  are you the man to tell me the truth retorted the other you who have refused to hear her in her own defense you who have closed the doors of this house against her  allan still controlled himself but the effort began at last to be visible  i know your temper is a hot one he said but for all that your violence quite takes me by surprise i cant account for it unlesshe hesitated a moment and then finished the sentence in his usual frank outspoken wayunless you are sweet yourself on miss gwilt  those last words heaped fuel on the fire they stripped the truth instantly of all concealments and disguises and laid it bare to view allans instinct had guessed and the guiding influence stood revealed of midwinters interest in miss gwilt  what right have you to say that he asked with raised voice and threatening eyes  i told you said allan simply when i thought i was sweet on her myself come come its a little hard i think even if you are in love with her to believe everything she tells you and not to let me say a word is that the way you decide between us  yes it is cried the other infuriated by allans second allusion to miss gwilt when i am asked to choose between the employer of a spy and the victim of a spy i side with the victim  dont try me too hard midwinter i have a temper to lose as well as you  he stopped struggling with himself the torture of passion in midwinters face from which a less simple and less generous nature might have recoiled in horror touched allan suddenly with an artless distress which at that moment was little less than sublime he advanced with his eyes moistening and his hand held out you asked me for my hand just now he said and i gave it you will you remember old times and give me yours before its too late  no retorted midwinter furiously i may meet miss gwilt again and i may want my hand free to deal with your spy  he had drawn back along the wall as allan advanced until the bracket which supported the statuette was before instead of behind him in the madness of his passion he saw nothing but allans face confronting him in the madness of his passion he stretched out his right hand as he answered and shook it threateningly in the air it struck the forgotten projection of the bracketand the next instant the statuette lay in fragments on the floor  the rain drove slanting over flowerbed and lawn and pattered heavily against the glass and the two armadales stood by the window as the two shadows had stood in the second vision of the dream with the wreck of the image between them  allan stooped over the fragments of the little figure and lifted them one by one from the floor  leave me he said without looking up or we shall both repent it  without a word midwinter moved back slowly he stood for the second time with his hand on the door and looked his last at the room the horror of the night on the wreck had got him once more and the flame of his passion was quenched in an instant  the dream he whispered under his breath the dream again  the door was tried from the outside and a servant appeared with a trivial message about the breakfast  midwinter looked at the man with a blank dreadful helplessness in his face show me the way out he said the place is dark and the room turns round with me  the servant took him by the arm and silently led him out  as the door closed on them allan picked up the last fragment of the broken figure he sat down alone at the table and hid his face in his hands the selfcontrol which he had bravely preserved under exasperation renewed again and again now failed him at last in the friendless solitude of his room and in the first bitterness of feeling that midwinter had turned against him like the rest he burst into tears  the moments followed each other the slow time wore on little by little the signs of a new elemental disturbance began to show themselves in the summer storm the shadow of a swiftly deepening darkness swept over the sky the pattering of the rain lessened with the lessening wind there was a momentary hush of stillness then on a sudden the rain poured down again like a cataract and the low roll of thunder came up solemnly on the dying air     ix she knows the truth  1 from mr bashwood to miss gwilt  thorpe ambrose july 20th 1851  dear madami received yesterday by private messenger your obliging note in which you direct me to communicate with you through the post only as long as there is reason to believe that any visitors who may come to you are likely to be observed may i be permitted to say that i look forward with respectful anxiety to the time when i shall again enjoy the only real happiness i have ever experiencedthe happiness of personally addressing you  in compliance with your desire that i should not allow this day the sunday to pass without privately noticing what went on at the great house i took the keys and went this morning to the stewards office i accounted for my appearance to the servants by informing them that i had work to do which it was important to complete in the shortest possible time the same excuse would have done for mr armadale if we had met but no such meeting happened  although i was at thorpe ambrose in what i thought good time i was too late to see or hear anything myself of a serious quarrel which appeared to have taken place just before i arrived between mr armadale and mr midwinter  all the little information i can give you in this matter is derived from one of the servants the man told me that he heard the voices of the two gentlemen loud in mr armadales sittingroom he went in to announce breakfast shortly afterward and found mr midwinter in such a dreadful state of agitation that he had to be helped out of the room the servant tried to take him upstairs to lie down and compose himself he declined saying he would wait a little first in one of the lower rooms and begging that he might be left alone the man had hardly got downstairs again when he heard the front door opened and closed he ran back and found that mr midwinter was gone the rain was pouring at the time and thunder and lightning came soon afterward dreadful weather certainly to go out in the servant thinks mr midwinters mind was unsettled i sincerely hope not mr midwinter is one of the few people i have met with in the course of my life who have treated me kindly  hearing that mr armadale still remained in the sittingroom i went into the stewards office which as you may remember is on the same side of the house and left the door ajar and set the window open waiting and listening for anything that might happen dear madam there was a time when i might have thought such a position in the house of my employer not a very becoming one let me hasten to assure you that this is far from being my feeling now i glory in any position which makes me serviceable to you  the state of the weather seemed hopelessly adverse to that renewal of intercourse between mr armadale and miss milroy which you so confidently anticipate and of which you are so anxious to be made aware strangely enough however it is actually in consequence of the state of the weather that i am now in a position to give you the very information you require mr armadale and miss milroy met about an hour since the circumstances were as follows  just at the beginning of the thunderstorm i saw one of the grooms run across from the stables and heard him tap at his masters window mr armadale opened the window and asked what was the matter the groom said he came with a message from the coachmans wife she had seen from her room over the stables which looks on to the park miss milroy quite alone standing for shelter under one of the trees as that part of the park was at some distance from the majors cottage she had thought that her master might wish to send and ask the young lady into the houseespecially as she had placed herself with a thunderstorm coming on in what might turn out to be a very dangerous position  the moment mr armadale understood the mans message he called for the waterproof things and the umbrellas and ran out himself instead of leaving it to the servants in a little time he and the groom came back with miss milroy between them as well protected as could be from the rain  i ascertained from one of the womenservants who had taken the young lady into a bedroom and had supplied her with such dry things as she wanted that miss milroy had been afterward shown into the drawingroom and that mr armadale was there with her the only way of following your instructions and finding out what passed between them was to go round the house in the pelting rain and get into the conservatory which opens into the drawingroom by the outer door i hesitate at nothing dear madam in your service i would cheerfully get wet every day to please you besides though i may at first sight be thought rather an elderly man a wetting is of no very serious consequence to me i assure you i am not so old as i look and i am of a stronger constitution than appears  it was impossible for me to get near enough in the conservatory to see what went on in the drawingroom without the risk of being discovered but most of the conversation reached me except when they dropped their voices this is the substance of what i heard  i gathered that miss milroy had been prevailed on against her will to take refuge from the thunderstorm in mr armadales house she said so at least and she gave two reasons the first was that her father had forbidden all intercourse between the cottage and the great house mr armadale met this objection by declaring that her father had issued his orders under a total misconception of the truth and by entreating her not to treat him as cruelly as the major had treated him he entered i suspect into some explanations at this point but as he dropped his voice i am unable to say what they were his language when i did hear it was confused and ungrammatical it seemed however to be quite intelligible enough to persuade miss milroy that her father had been acting under a mistaken impression of the circumstances at least i infer this for when i next heard the conversation the young lady was driven back to her second objection to being in the housewhich was that mr armadale had behaved very badly to her and that he richly deserved that she should never speak to him again  in this latter case mr armadale attempted no defense of any kind he agreed with her that he had behaved badly he agreed with her that he richly deserved she should never speak to him again at the same time he implored her to remember that he had suffered his punishment already he was disgraced in the neighborhood and his dearest friend his one intimate friend in the world had that very morning turned against him like the rest far or near there was not a living creature whom he was fond of to comfort him or to say a friendly word to him he was lonely and miserable and his heart ached for a little kindnessand that was his only excuse for asking miss milroy to forget and forgive the past  i must leave you i fear to judge for yourself of the effect of this on the young lady for though i tried hard i failed to catch what she said i am almost certain i heard her crying and mr armadale entreating her not to break his heart they whispered a great deal which aggravated me i was afterward alarmed by mr armadale coming out into the conservatory to pick some flowers he did not come as far fortunately as the place where i was hidden and he went in again into the drawingroom and there was more talking i suspect at close quarters which to my great regret i again failed to catch pray forgive me for having so little to tell you i can only add that when the storm cleared off miss milroy went away with the flowers in her hand and with mr armadale escorting her from the house my own humble opinion is that he had a powerful friend at court all through the interview in the young ladys own liking for him  this is all i can say at present with the exception of one other thing i heard which i blush to mention but your word is law and you have ordered me to have no concealments from you  their talk turned once dear madam on yourself i think i heard the word creature from miss milroy and i am certain that mr armadale while acknowledging that he had once admired you added that circumstances had since satisfied him of his folly i quote his own expression it made me quite tremble with indignation if i may be permitted to say so the man who admires miss gwilt lives in paradise respect if nothing else ought to have closed mr armadales lips he is my employer i know but after his calling it an act of folly to admire you though i am his deputysteward i utterly despise him  trusting that i may have been so happy as to give you satisfaction thus far and earnestly desirous to deserve the honor of your continued confidence in me i remain dear madam  your grateful and devoted servant  felix bashwood  2 from mrs oldershaw to miss gwilt  diana street monday july 21st  my dear lydiai trouble you with a few lines they are written under a sense of the duty which i owe to myself in our present position toward each other  i am not at all satisfied with the tone of your last two letters and i am still less pleased at your leaving me this morning without any letter at alland this when we had arranged in the doubtful state of our prospects that i was to hear from you every day i can only interpret your conduct in one way i can only infer that matters at thorpe ambrose having been all mismanaged are all going wrong  it is not my present object to reproach you for why should i waste time language and paper i merely wish to recall to your memory certain considerations which you appear to be disposed to overlook shall i put them in the plainest english yes for with all my faults i am frankness personified  in the first place then i have an interest in your becoming mrs armadale of thorpe ambrose as well as you secondly i have provided you to say nothing of good advice with all the money needed to accomplish our object thirdly i hold your notes of hand at short dates for every farthing so advanced fourthly and lastly though i am indulgent to a fault in the capacity of a friendin the capacity of a woman of business my dear i am not to be trifled with that is all lydia at least for the present  pray dont suppose i write in anger i am only sorry and disheartened my state of mind resembles davids if i had the wings of a dove i would flee away and be at rest  affectionately yours maria oldershaw  3 from mr bashwood to miss gwilt  thorpe ambrose july 21st  dear madamyou will probably receive these lines a few hours after my yesterdays communication reaches you i posted my first letter last night and i shall post this before noon today  my present object in writing is to give you some more news from this house i have the inexpressible happiness of announcing that mr armadales disgraceful intrusion on your privacy is at an end the watch set on your actions is to be withdrawn this day i write dear madam with the tears in my eyestears of joy caused by feelings which i ventured to express in my previous letter see first paragraph toward the end pardon me this personal reference i can speak to you i dont know why so much more readily with my pen than with my tongue  let me try to compose myself and proceed with my narrative  i had just arrived at the stewards office this morning when mr pedgift the elder followed me to the great house to see mr armadale by special appointment it is needless to say that i at once suspended any little business there was to do feeling that your interests might possibly be concerned it is also most gratifying to add that this time circumstances favored me i was able to stand under the open window and to hear the whole interview  mr armadale explained himself at once in the plainest terms he gave orders that the person who had been hired to watch you should be instantly dismissed on being asked to explain this sudden change of purpose he did not conceal that it was owing to the effect produced on his mind by what had passed between mr midwinter and himself on the previous day mr midwinters language cruelly unjust as it was had nevertheless convinced him that no necessity whatever could excuse any proceeding so essentially base in itself as the employment of a spy and on that conviction he was now determined to act  but for your own positive directions to me to conceal nothing that passes here in which your name is concerned i should really be ashamed to report what mr pedgift said on his side he has behaved kindly to me i know but if he was my own brother i could never forgive him the tone in which he spoke of you and the obstinacy with which he tried to make mr armadale change his mind  he began by attacking mr midwinter he declared that mr midwinters opinion was the very worst opinion that could be taken for it was quite plain that you dear madam had twisted him round your finger producing no effect by this coarse suggestion which nobody who knows you could for a moment believe mr pedgift next referred to miss milroy and asked mr armadale if he had given up all idea of protecting her what this meant i cannot imagine i can only report it for your private consideration mr armadale briefly answered that he had his own plan for protecting miss milroy and that the circumstances were altered in that quarter or words to a similar effect still mr pedgift persisted he went on i blush to mention from bad to worse he tried to persuade mr armadale next to bring an action at law against one or other of the persons who had been most strongly condemning his conduct in the neighborhood for the purposei really hardly know how to write itof getting you into the witnessbox and worse yet when mr armadale still said no mr pedgift after having as i suspected by the sound of his voice been on the point of leaving the room artfully came back and proposed sending for a detective officer from london simply to look at you the whole of this mystery about miss gwilts true character he said may turn on a question of identity it wont cost much to have a man down from london and its worth trying whether her face is or is not known at headquarters to the police i again and again assure you dearest lady that i only repeat those abominable words from a sense of duty toward yourself i shooki declare i shook from head to foot when i heard them  to resume for there is more to tell you  mr armadale to his crediti dont deny it though i dont like him still said no he appeared to be getting irritated under mr pedgifts persistence and he spoke in a somewhat hasty way you persuaded me on the last occasion when we talked about this he said to do something that i have been since heartily ashamed of you wont succeed in persuading me mr pedgift a second time those were his words mr pedgift took him up short mr pedgift seemed to be nettled on his side  if that is the light in which you see my advice sir he said the less you have of it for the future the better your character and position are publicly involved in this matter between yourself and miss gwilt and you persist at a most critical moment in taking a course of your own which i believe will end badly after what i have already said and done in this very serious case i cant consent to go on with it with both my hands tied and i cant drop it with credit to myself while i remain publicly known as your solicitor you leave me no alternative sir but to resign the honor of acting as your legal adviser i am sorry to hear it says mr armadale but i have suffered enough already through interfering with miss gwilt i cant and wont stir any further in the matter you may not stir any further in it sir says mr pedgift and i shall not stir any further in it for it has ceased to be a question of professional interest to me but mark my words mr armadale you are not at the end of this business yet some other persons curiosity may go on from the point where you and i have stopped and some other persons hand may let the broad daylight in yet on miss gwilt  i report their language dear madam almost word for word i believe as i heard it it produced an indescribable impression on me it filled me i hardly know why with quite a panic of alarm i dont at all understand it and i understand still less what happened immediately afterward  mr pedgifts voice when he said those last words sounded dreadfully close to me he must have been speaking at the open window and he must i fear have seen me under it i had time before he left the house to get out quietly from among the laurels but not to get back to the office accordingly i walked away along the drive toward the lodge as if i was going on some errand connected with the stewards business  before long mr pedgift overtook me in his gig and stopped so you feel some curiosity about miss gwilt do you he said gratify your curiosity by all means i dont object to it i felt naturally nervous but i managed to ask him what he meant he didnt answer he only looked down at me from the gig in a very odd manner and laughed i have known stranger things happen even than that he said to himself suddenly and drove off  i have ventured to trouble you with this last incident though it may seem of no importance in your eyes in the hope that your superior ability may be able to explain it my own poor faculties i confess are quite unable to penetrate mr pedgifts meaning all i know is that he has no right to accuse me of any such impertinent feeling as curiosity in relation to a lady whom i ardently esteem and admire i dare not put it in warmer words  i have only to add that i am in a position to be of continued service to you here if you wish it mr armadale has just been into the office and has told me briefly that in mr midwinters continued absence i am still to act as stewards deputy till further notice  believe me dear madam anxiously and devotedly yours felix bashwood  4 from allan armadale to the reverend decimus brock  thorpe ambrose tuesday  my dear mr brocki am in sad trouble midwinter has quarreled with me and left me and my lawyer has quarreled with me and left me and except dear little miss milroy who has forgiven me all the neighbors have turned their backs on me there is a good deal about me in this but i cant help it i am very miserable alone in my own house do pray come and see me you are the only old friend i have left and i do long so to tell you about it  n bon my word of honor as a gentleman i am not to blame yours affectionately  allan armadale  p si would come to you for this place is grown quite hateful to me but i have a reason for not going too far away from miss milroy just at present  5 from robert stapleton to allan armadale esq  bascombe rectory thursday morning  respected siri see a letter in your writing on the table along with the others which i am sorry to say my master is not well enough to open he is down with a sort of low fever the doctor says it has been brought on with worry and anxiety which master was not strong enough to bear this seems likely for i was with him when he went to london last month and what with his own business and the business of looking after that person who afterward gave us the slip he was worried and anxious all the time and for the matter of that so was i  my master was talking of you a day or two since he seemed unwilling that you should know of his illness unless he got worse but i think you ought to know of it at the same time he is not worse perhaps a trifle better the doctor says he must be kept very quiet and not agitated on any account so be pleased to take no notice of thisi mean in the way of coming to the rectory i have the doctors orders to say it is not needful and it would only upset my master in the state he is in now  i will write again if you wish it please accept of my duty and believe me to remain sir your humble servant  robert stapleton  p sthe yacht has been rigged and repainted waiting your orders she looks beautiful  6 from mrs oldershaw to miss gwilt  diana street july 24th  miss gwiltthe post hour has passed for three mornings following and has brought me no answer to my letter are you purposely bent on insulting me or have you left thorpe ambrose in either case i wont put up with your conduct any longer the law shall bring you to book if i cant  your first note of hand for thirty pounds falls due on tuesday next the 29th if you had behaved with common consideration toward me i would have let you renew it with pleasure as things are i shall have the note presented and if it is not paid i shall instruct my man of business to take the usual course  yours maria oldershaw   7 from miss gwilt to mrs oldershaw  5 paradise place thorpe ambrose july 25th  mrs oldershawthe time of your man of business being no doubt of some value i write a line to assist him when he takes the usual course he will find me waiting to be arrested in the firstfloor apartments at the above address in my present situation and with my present thoughts the best service you can possibly render me is to lock me up  l g  8 from mrs oldershaw to miss gwilt  diana street july 26th  my darling lydiathe longer i live in this wicked world the more plainly i see that womens own tempers are the worst enemies women have to contend with what a truly regretful style of correspondence we have fallen into what a sad want of selfrestraint my dear on your side and on mine  let me as the oldest in years be the first to make the needful excuses the first to blush for my own want of selfcontrol your cruel neglect lydia stung me into writing as i did i am so sensitive to ill treatment when it is inflicted on me by a person whom i love and admire and though turned sixty i am still unfortunately for myself so young at heart accept my apologies for having made use of my pen when i ought to have been content to take refuge in my pockethandkerchief forgive your attached maria for being still young at heart  but oh my dearthough i own i threatened youhow hard of you to take me at my word how cruel of you if your debt had been ten times what it is to suppose me capable whatever i might say of the odious inhumanity of arresting my bosom friend heavens have i deserved to be taken at my word in this unmercifully exact way after the years of tender intimacy that have united us but i dont complain i only mourn over the frailty of our common human nature let us expect as little of each other as possible my dear we are both women and we cant help it i declare when i reflect on the origin of our unfortunate sexwhen i remember that we were all originally made of no better material than the rib of a man and that rib of so little importance to its possessor that he never appears to have missed it afterward i am quite astonished at our virtues and not in the least surprised at our faults  i am wandering a little i am losing myself in serious thought like that sweet character in shakespeare who was fancy free one last word dearest to say that my longing for an answer to this proceeds entirely from my wish to hear from you again in your old friendly tone and is quite unconnected with any curiosity to know what you are doing at thorpe ambroseexcept such curiosity as you yourself might approve need i add that i beg you as a favor to me to renew on the customary terms i refer to the little bill due on tuesday next and i venture to suggest that day six weeks  yours with a truly motherly feeling  maria oldershaw  9 from miss gwilt to mrs oldershaw  paradise place july 27th  i have just got your last letter the brazen impudence of it has roused me i am to be treated like a child am ito be threatened first and then if threatening fails to be coaxed afterward you shall coax me you shall know my motherly friend the sort of child you have to deal with  i had a reason mrs oldershaw for the silence which has so seriously offended you i was afraidactually afraidto let you into the secret of my thoughts no such fear troubles me now my only anxiety this morning is to make you my best acknowledgments for the manner in which you have written to me after carefully considering it i think the worst turn i can possibly do you is to tell you what you are burning to know so here i am at my desk bent on telling it if you dont bitterly repent when you are at the end of this letter not having held to your first resolution and locked me up out of harms way while you had the chance my name is not lydia gwilt  where did my last letter end i dont remember and dont care make it out as you cani am not going back any further than this day week that is to say sunday last  there was a thunderstorm in the morning it began to clear off toward noon i didnt go out i waited to see midwinter or to hear from him are you surprised at my not writing mr before his name we have got so familiar my dear that mr would be quite out of place he had left me the evening before under very interesting circumstances i had told him that his friend armadale was persecuting me by means of a hired spy he had declined to believe it and had gone straight to thorpe ambrose to clear the thing up i let him kiss my hand before he went he promised to come back the next day the sunday i felt i had secured my influence over him and i believed he would keep his word  well the thunder passed away as i told you the weather cleared up the people walked out in their best clothes the dinners came in from the bakers i sat dreaming at my wretched little hired piano nicely dressed and looking my bestand still no midwinter appeared it was late in the afternoon and i was beginning to feel offended when a letter was brought to me it had been left by a strange messenger who went away again immediately i looked at the letter midwinter at lastin writing instead of in person i began to feel more offended than ever for as i told you i thought i had used my influence over him to better purpose  the letter when i read it set my mind off in a new direction it surprised it puzzled it interested me i thought and thought and thought of him all the rest of the day  he began by asking my pardon for having doubted what i told him mr armadales own lips had confirmed me they had quarreled as i had anticipated they would and he and the man who had once been his dearest friend on earth had parted forever so far i was not surprised i was amused by his telling me in his extravagant way that he and his friend were parted forever and i rather wondered what he would think when i carried out my plan and found my way into the great house on pretense of reconciling them  but the second part of the letter set me thinking here it is in his own words  it is only by struggling against myself and no language can say how hard the struggle has been that i have decided on writing instead of speaking to you a merciless necessity claims my future life i must leave thorpe ambrose i must leave england without hesitating without stopping to look back there are reasonsterrible reasons which i have madly trifled withfor my never letting mr armadale set eyes on me or hear of me again after what has happened between us i must go never more to live under the same roof never more to breathe the same air with that man i must hide myself from him under an assumed name i must put the mountains and the seas between us i have been warned as no human creature was ever warned before i believei dare not tell you whyi believe that if the fascination you have for me draws me back to you fatal consequences will come of it to the man whose life has been so strangely mingled with your life and minethe man who was once your admirer and my friend and yet feeling this seeing it in my mind as plainly as i see the sky above my head there is a weakness in me that still shrinks from the one imperative sacrifice of never seeing you again i am fighting with it as a man fights with the strength of his despair i have been near enough not an hour since to see the house where you live and have forced myself away again out of sight of it can i force myself away further still now that my letter is writtennow when the useless confession escapes me and i own to loving you with the first love i have ever known with the last love i shall ever feel let the coming time answer the question i dare not write of it or think of it more   those were the last words in that strange way the letter ended  i felt a perfect fever of curiosity to know what he meant his loving me of course was easy enough to understand but what did he mean by saying he had been warned why was he never to live under the same roof never to breathe the same air again with young armadale what sort of quarrel could it be which obliged one man to hide himself from another under an assumed name and to put the mountains and the seas between them above all if he came back and let me fascinate him why should it be fatal to the hateful lout who possesses the noble fortune and lives in the great house  i never longed in my life as i longed to see him again and put these questions to him i got quite superstitious about it as the day drew on they gave me a sweetbread and a cherry pudding for dinner i actually tried if he would come back by the stones in the plate he will he wont he will he wontand so on it ended in he wont i rang the bell and had the things taken away i contradicted destiny quite fiercely i said he will and i waited at home for him  you dont know what a pleasure it is to me to give you all these little particulars count upmy bosom friend my second mothercount up the money you have advanced on the chance of my becoming mrs armadale and then think of my feeling this breathless interest in another man oh mrs oldershaw how intensely i enjoy the luxury of irritating you  the day got on toward evening i rang again and sent down to borrow a railway timetable what trains were there to take him away on sunday the national respect for the sabbath stood my friend there was only one train which had started hours before he wrote to me i went and consulted my glass it paid me the compliment of contradicting the divination by cherrystones my glass said get behind the windowcurtain he wont pass the long lonely evening without coming back again to look at the house i got behind the windowcurtain and waited with his letter in my hand  the dismal sunday light faded and the dismal sunday quietness in the street grew quieter still the dusk came and i heard a step coming with it in the silence my heart gave a little jumponly think of my having any heart left i said to myself midwinter and midwinter it was  when he came in sight he was walking slowly stopping and hesitating at every two or three steps my ugly little drawingroom window seemed to be beckoning him on in spite of himself after waiting till i saw him come to a standstill a little aside from the house but still within view of my irresistible window i put on my things and slipped out by the back way into the garden the landlord and his family were at supper and nobody saw me i opened the door in the wall and got round by the lane into the street at that awkward moment i suddenly remembered what i had forgotten before the spy set to watch me who was no doubt waiting somewhere in sight of the house  it was necessary to get time to think and it was in my state of mind impossible to let midwinter go without speaking to him in great difficulties you generally decide at once if you decide at all i decided to make an appointment with him for the next evening and to consider in the interval how to manage the interview so that it might escape observation this as i felt at the time was leaving my own curiosity free to torment me for fourandtwenty mortal hours but what other choice had i it was as good as giving up being mistress of thorpe ambrose altogether to come to a private understanding with midwinter in the sight and possibly in the hearing of armadales spy  finding an old letter of yours in my pocket i drew back into the lane and wrote on the blank leaf with the little pencil that hangs at my watchchain i must and will speak to you it is impossible tonight but be in the street tomorrow at this time and leave me afterward forever if you like when you have read this overtake me and say as you pass without stopping or looking round yes i promise  i folded up the paper and came on him suddenly from behind as he started and turned round i put the note into his hand pressed his hand and passed on before i had taken ten steps i heard him behind me i cant say he didnt look roundi saw his big black eyes bright and glittering in the dusk devour me from head to foot in a moment but otherwise he did what i told him i can deny you nothing he whispered i promise he went on and left me i couldnt help thinking at the time how that brute and booby armadale would have spoiled everything in the same situation  i tried hard all night to think of a way of making our interview of the next evening safe from discovery and tried in vain even as early as this i began to feel as if midwinters letter had in some unaccountable manner stupefied me  monday morning made matters worse news came from my faithful ally mr bashwood that miss milroy and armadale had met and become friends again you may fancy the state i was in an hour or two later there came more news from mr bashwoodgood news this time the mischievous idiot at thorpe ambrose had shown sense enough at last to be ashamed of himself he had decided on withdrawing the spy that very day and he and his lawyer had quarreled in consequence  so here was the obstacle which i was too stupid to remove for myself obligingly removed for me no more need to fret about the coming interview with midwinter and plenty of time to consider my next proceedings now that miss milroy and her precious swain had come together again would you believe it the letter or the man himself i dont know which had taken such a hold on me that though i tried and tried i could think of nothing else and this when i had every reason to fear that miss milroy was in a fair way of changing her name to armadale and when i knew that my heavy debt of obligation to her was not paid yet was there ever such perversity i cant account for it can you  the dusk of the evening came at last i looked out of the windowand there he was  i joined him at once the people of the house as before being too much absorbed in their eating and drinking to notice anything else we mustnt be seen together here i whispered i must go on first and you must follow me  he said nothing in the way of reply what was going on in his mind i cant pretend to guess but after coming to his appointment he actually hung back as if he was half inclined to go away again  you look as if you were afraid of me i said  i am afraid of you he answeredof you and of myself  it was not encouraging it was not complimentary but i was in such a frenzy of curiosity by this time that if he had been ruder still i should have taken no notice of it i led the way a few steps toward the new buildings and stopped and looked round after him  must i ask it of you as a favor i said after your giving me your promise and after such a letter as you have written to me  something suddenly changed him he was at my side in an instant i beg your pardon miss gwilt lead the way where you please he dropped back a little after that answer and i heard him say to himself what is to be will be what have i to do with it and what has she  it could hardly have been the words for i didnt understand themit must have been the tone he spoke in i suppose that made me feel a momentary tremor i was half inclined without the ghost of a reason for it to wish him goodnight and go in again not much like me you will say not much indeed it didnt last a moment your darling lydia soon came to her senses again  i led the way toward the unfinished cottages and the country beyond it would have been much more to my taste to have had him into the house and have talked to him in the light of the candles but i had risked it once already and in this scandalmongering place and in my critical position i was afraid to risk it again the garden was not to be thought of either for the landlord smokes his pipe there after his supper there was no alternative but to take him away from the town  from time to time i looked back as i went on there he was always at the same distance dim and ghostlike in the dusk silently following me  i must leave off for a little while the church bells have broken out and the jangling of them drives me mad in these days when we have all got watches and clocks why are bells wanted to remind us when the service begins we dont require to be rung into the theater how excessively discreditable to the clergy to be obliged to ring us into the church    they have rung the congregation in at last and i can take up my pen and go on again  i was a little in doubt where to lead him to the highroad was on one side of me but empty as it looked somebody might be passing when we least expected it the other way was through the coppice i led him through the coppice  at the outskirts of the trees on the other side there was a dip in the ground with some felled timber lying on it and a little pool beyond still and white and shining in the twilight the long grazinggrounds rose over its further shore with the mist thickening on them and a dim black line far away of cattle in slow procession going home there wasnt a living creature near there wasnt a sound to be heard i sat down on one of the felled trees and looked back for him come i said softlycome and sit by me here  why am i so particular about all this i hardly know the place made an unaccountably vivid impression on me and i cant help writing about it if i end badlysuppose we say on the scaffoldi believe the last thing i shall see before the hangman pulls the drop will be the little shining pool and the long misty grazinggrounds and the cattle winding dimly home in the thickening night dont be alarmed you worthy creature my fancies play me strange tricks sometimes and there is a little of last nights laudanum i dare say in this part of my letter  he camein the strangest silent way like a man walking in his sleephe came and sat down by me either the night was very close or i was by this time literally in a fever i couldnt bear my bonnet on i couldnt bear my gloves the want to look at him and see what his singular silence meant and the impossibility of doing it in the darkening light irritated my nerves till i thought i should have screamed i took his hand to try if that would help me it was burning hot and it closed instantly on mineyou know how silence after that was not to be thought of the one safe way was to begin talking to him at once  dont despise me i said i am obliged to bring you to this lonely place i should lose my character if we were seen together  i waited a little his hand warned me once more not to let the silence continue i determined to make him speak to me this time  you have interested me and frightened me i went on you have written me a very strange letter i must know what it means  it is too late to ask you have taken the way and i have taken the way from which there is no turning back he made that strange answer in a tone that was quite new to mea tone that made me even more uneasy than his silence had made me the moment before too late he repeatedtoo late there is only one question to ask me now  what is it  as i said the words a sudden trembling passed from his hand to mine and told me instantly that i had better have held my tongue before i could move before i could think he had me in his arms ask me if i love you he whispered at the same moment his head sank on my bosom and some unutterable torture that was in him burst its way out as it does with us in a passion of sobs and tears  my first impulse was the impulse of a fool i was on the point of making our usual protest and defending myself in our usual way luckily or unluckily i dont know which i have lost the fine edge of the sensitiveness of youth and i checked the first movement of my hands and the first word on my lips oh dear how old i felt while he was sobbing his heart out on my breast how i thought of the time when he might have possessed himself of my love all he had possessed himself of now wasmy waist  i wonder whether i pitied him it doesnt matter if i did at any rate my hand lifted itself somehow and my fingers twined themselves softly in his hair horrible recollections came back to me of other times and made me shudder as i touched him and yet i did it what fools women are  i wont reproach you i said gently i wont say this is a cruel advantage to take of me in such a position as mine you are dreadfully agitated i will let you wait a little and compose yourself  having got as far as that i stopped to consider how i should put the questions to him that i was burning to ask but i was too confused i suppose or perhaps too impatient to consider i let out what was uppermost in my mind in the words that came first  i dont believe you love me i said you write strange things to me you frighten me with mysteries what did you mean by saying in your letter that it would be fatal to mr armadale if you came back to me what danger can there be to mr armadale  before i could finish the question he suddenly lifted his head and unclasped his arms i had apparently touched some painful subject which recalled him to himself instead of my shrinking from him it was he who shrank from me i felt offended with him why i dont knowbut offended i was and i thanked him with my bitterest emphasis for remembering what was due to me at last  do you believe in dreams he burst out in the most strangely abrupt manner without taking the slightest notice of what i had said to him tell me he went on without allowing me time to answer were you or was any relation of yours ever connected with allan armadales father or mother were you or was anybody belonging to you ever in the island of madeira  conceive my astonishment if you can i turned cold in an instant i turned cold all over he was plainly in the secret of what had happened when i was in mrs armadales service in madeirain all probability before he was born that was startling enough of itself and he had evidently some reason of his own for trying to connect me with those eventswhich was more startling still  no i said as soon as i could trust myself to speak i know nothing of his father or mother  and nothing of the island of madeira  nothing of the island of madeira  he turned his head away and began talking to himself  strange he said as certainly as i was in the shadows place at the window she was in the shadows place at the pool  under other circumstances his extraordinary behavior might have alarmed me but after his question about madeira there was some greater fear in me which kept all common alarm at a distance i dont think i ever determined on anything in my life as i determined on finding out how he had got his information and who he really was it was quite plain to me that i had roused some hidden feeling in him by my question about armadale which was as strong in its way as his feeling for me what had become of my influence over him  i couldnt imagine what had become of it but i could and did set to work to make him feel it again  dont treat me cruelly i said i didnt treat you cruelly just now oh mr midwinter its so lonely its so darkdont frighten me  frighten you he was close to me again in a moment frighten you he repeated the word with as much astonishment as if i had woke him from a dream and charged him with something that he had said in his sleep  it was on the tip of my tongue finding how i had surprised him to take him while he was off his guard and to ask why my question about armadale had produced such a change in his behavior to me but after what had happened already i was afraid to risk returning to the subject too soon something or otherwhat they call an instinct i dare saywarned me to let armadale alone for the present and to talk to him first about himself as i told you in one of my early letters i had noticed signs and tokens in his manner and appearance which convinced me young as he was that he had done something or suffered something out of the common in his past life i had asked myself more and more suspiciously every time i saw him whether he was what he appeared to be and first and foremost among my other doubts was a doubt whether he was passing among us by his real name having secrets to keep about my own past life and having gone myself in other days by more than one assumed name i suppose i am all the readier to suspect other people when i find something mysterious about them any way having the suspicion in my mind i determined to startle him as he had startled me by an unexpected question on my sidea question about his name  while i was thinking he was thinking and as it soon appeared of what i had just said to him i am so grieved to have frightened you he whispered with that gentleness and humility which we all so heartily despise in a man when he speaks to other women and which we all so dearly like when he speaks to ourselves i hardly know what i have been saying he went on my mind is miserably disturbed pray forgive me if you can i am not myself tonight  i am not angry i said i have nothing to forgive we are both imprudent we are both unhappy i laid my head on his shoulder do you really love me i asked him softly in a whisper  his arm stole round me again and i felt the quick beat of his heart get quicker and quicker if you only knew he whispered back if you only knew he could say no more i felt his face bending toward mine and dropped my head lower and stopped him in the very act of kissing me  no i said i am only a woman who has taken your fancy you are treating me as if i was your promised wife  be my promised wife he whispered eagerly and tried to raise my head i kept it down the horror of these old remembrances that you know of came back and made me tremble a little when he asked me to be his wife i dont think i was actually faint but something like faintness made me close my eyes the moment i shut them the darkness seemed to open as if lightning had split it and the ghosts of those other men rose in the horrid gap and looked at me  speak to me he whispered tenderly my darling my angel speak to me  his voice helped me to recover myself i had just sense enough left to remember that the time was passing and that i had not put my question to him yet about his name  suppose i felt for you as you feel for me i said suppose i loved you dearly enough to trust you with the happiness of all my life to come  i paused a moment to get my breath it was unbearably still and close the air seemed to have died when the night came  would you be marrying me honorably i went on if you married me in your present name  his arm dropped from my waist and i felt him give one great start after that he sat by me still and cold and silent as if my question had struck him dumb i put my arm round his neck and lifted my head again on his shoulder whatever the spell was i had laid on him my coming closer in that way seemed to break it  who told you he stopped no he went on nobody can have told you what made you suspect he stopped again  nobody told me i said and i dont know what made me suspect women have strange fancies sometimes is midwinter really your name  i cant deceive you he answered after another interval of silence midwinter is not really my name  i nestled a little closer to him  what is your name i asked  he hesitated  i lifted my face till my cheek just touched his i persisted with my lips close at his ear  what no confidence in me even yet no confidence in the woman who has almost confessed she loves youwho has almost consented to be your wife  he turned his face to mine for the second time he tried to kiss me and for the second time i stopped him  if i tell you my name he said i must tell you more  i let my cheek touch his again  why not i said how can i love a manmuch less marry himif he keeps himself a stranger to me  there was no answering that as i thought but he did answer it  it is a dreadful story he said it may darken all your life if you know it as it has darkened mine  i put my other arm round him and persisted tell it me im not afraid tell it me  he began to yield to my other arm  will you keep it a sacred secret he said never to be breathednever to be known but to you and me  i promised him it should be a secret i waited in a perfect frenzy of expectation twice he tried to begin and twice his courage failed him  i cant he broke out in a wild helpless way i cant tell it  my curiosity or more likely my temper got beyond all control he had irritated me till i was reckless what i said or what i did i suddenly clasped him close and pressed my lips to his i love you i whispered in a kiss now will you tell me  for the moment he was speechless i dont know whether i did it purposely to drive him wild i dont know whether i did it involuntarily in a burst of rage nothing is certain but that i interpreted his silence the wrong way i pushed him back from me in a fury the instant after i had kissed him i hate you i said you have maddened me into forgetting myself leave me i dont care for the darkness leave me instantly and never see me again  he caught me by the hand and stopped me he spoke in a new voice he suddenly commanded as only men can  sit down he said you have given me back my courageyou shall know who i am  in the silence and the darkness all round us i obeyed him and sat down  in the silence and the darkness all round us he took me in his arms again and told me who he was    shall i trust you with his story shall i tell you his real name shall i show you as i threatened the thoughts that have grown out of my interview with him and out of all that has happened to me since that time  or shall i keep his secret as i promised and keep my own secret too by bringing this weary long letter to an end at the very moment when you are burning to hear more  those are serious questions mrs oldershawmore serious than you suppose i have had time to calm down and i begin to see what i failed to see when i first took up my pen to write to you the wisdom of looking at consequences have i frightened myself in trying to frighten you it is possiblestrange as it may seem it is really possible  i have been at the window for the last minute or two thinking there is plenty of time for thinking before the post leaves the people are only now coming out of church  i have settled to put my letter on one side and to take a look at my diary in plainer words i must see what i risk if i decide on trusting you and my diary will show me what my head is too weary to calculate without help i have written the story of my days and sometimes the story of my nights much more regularly than usual for the last week having reasons of my own for being particularly careful in this respect under present circumstances if i end in doing what it is now in my mind to do it would be madness to trust to my memory the smallest forgetfulness of the slightest event that has happened from the night of my interview with midwinter to the present time might be utter ruin to me  utter ruin to her you will say what kind of ruin does she mean  wait a little till i have asked my diary whether i can safely tell you     x miss gwilts diary  july 21st monday night eleven oclockmidwinter has just left me we parted by my desire at the path out of the coppice he going his way to the hotel and i going mine to my lodgings  i have managed to avoid making another appointment with him by arranging to write to him tomorrow morning this gives me the nights interval to compose myself and to coax my mind back if i can to my own affairs will the night pass and the morning find me still thinking of the letter that came to him from his fathers deathbed of the night he watched through on the wrecked ship and more than all of the first breathless moment when he told me his real name  would it help me to shake off these impressions i wonder if i made the effort of writing them down there would be no danger in that case of my forgetting anything important and perhaps after all it may be the fear of forgetting something which i ought to remember that keeps this story of midwinters weighing as it does on my mind at any rate the experiment is worth trying in my present situation i must be free to think of other things or i shall never find my way through all the difficulties at thorpe ambrose that are still to come  let me think what haunts me to begin with  the names haunt me i keep saying and saying to myself both alikechristian name and surname both alike a lighthaired allan armadale whom i have long since known of and who is the son of my old mistress a darkhaired allan armadale whom i only know of now and who is only known to others under the name of ozias midwinter stranger still it is not relationship it is not chance that has made them namesakes the father of the light armadale was the man who was born to the family name and who lost the family inheritance the father of the dark armadale was the man who took the name on condition of getting the inheritanceand who got it  so there are two of themi cant help thinking of itboth unmarried the lighthaired armadale who offers to the woman who can secure him eight thousand a year while he lives who leaves her twelve hundred a year when he dies who must and shall marry me for those two golden reasons and whom i hate and loathe as i never hated and loathed a man yet and the darkhaired armadale who has a poor little income which might perhaps pay his wifes milliner if his wife was careful who has just left me persuaded that i mean to marry him and whomwell whom i might have loved once before i was the woman i am now  and allan the fair doesnt know he has a namesake and allan the dark has kept the secret from everybody but the somersetshire clergyman whose discretion he can depend on and myself  and there are two allan armadalestwo allan armadalestwo allan armadales there three is a lucky number haunt me again after that if you can  what next the murder in the timber ship no the murder is a good reason why the dark armadale whose father committed it should keep his secret from the fair armadale whose father was killed but it doesnt concern me i remember there was a suspicion in madeira at the time of something wrong was it wrong was the man who had been tricked out of his wife to blame for shutting the cabin door and leaving the man who had tricked him to drown in the wreck yes the woman wasnt worth it  what am i sure of that really concerns myself  i am sure of one very important thing i am sure that midwinteri must call him by his ugly false name or i may confuse the two armadales before i have donei am sure that midwinter is perfectly ignorant that i and the little imp of twelve years old who waited on mrs armadale in madeira and copied the letters that were supposed to arrive from the west indies are one and the same there are not many girls of twelve who could have imitated a mans handwriting and held their tongues about it afterward as i did but that doesnt matter now what does matter is that midwinters belief in the dream is midwinters only reason for trying to connect me with allan armadale by associating me with allan armadales father and mother i asked him if he actually thought me old enough to have known either of them and he said no poor fellow in the most innocent bewildered way would he say no if he saw me now shall i turn to the glass and see if i look my fiveandthirty years or shall i go on writing i will go on writing  there is one thing more that haunts me almost as obstinately as the names  i wonder whether i am right in relying on midwinters superstition as i do to help me in keeping him at armslength after having let the excitement of the moment hurry me into saying more than i need have said he is certain to press me he is certain to come back with a mans hateful selfishness and impatience in such things to the question of marrying me will the dream help me to check him after alternately believing and disbelieving in it he has got by his own confession to believing in it again can i say i believe in it too i have better reasons for doing so than he knows of i am not only the person who helped mrs armadales marriage by helping her to impose on her own father i am the woman who tried to drown herself the woman who started the series of accidents which put young armadale in possession of his fortune the woman who has come thorpe ambrose to marry him for his fortune now he has got it and more extraordinary still the woman who stood in the shadows place at the pool these may be coincidences but they are strange coincidences i declare i begin to fancy that i believe in the dream too  suppose i say to him i think as you think i say what you said in your letter to me let us part before the harm is done leave me before the third vision of the dream comes true leave me and put the mountains and the seas between you and the man who bears your name  suppose on the other side that his love for me makes him reckless of everything else suppose he says those desperate words again which i understand now what is to be will be what have i to do with it and what has she supposesuppose  i wont write any more i hate writing it doesnt relieve meit makes me worse im further from being able to think of all that i must think of than i was when i sat down it is past midnight tomorrow has come already and here i am as helpless as the stupidest woman living bed is the only fit place for me  bed if it was ten years since instead of today and if i had married midwinter for love i might be going to bed now with nothing heavier on my mind than a visit on tiptoe to the nursery and a last look at night to see if my children were sleeping quietly in their cribs i wonder whether i should have loved my children if i had ever had any perhaps yesperhaps no it doesnt matter   tuesday morning ten oclockwho was the man who invented laudanum i thank him from the bottom of my heart whoever he was if all the miserable wretches in pain of body and mind whose comforter he has been could meet together to sing his praises what a chorus it would be i have had six delicious hours of oblivion i have woke up with my mind composed i have written a perfect little letter to midwinter i have drunk my nice cup of tea with a real relish of it i have dawdled over my morning toilet with an exquisite sense of reliefand all through the modest little bottle of drops which i see on my bedroom chimneypiece at this moment drops you are a darling if i love nothing else i love you  my letter to midwinter has been sent through the post and i have told him to reply to me in the same manner  i feel no anxiety about his answerhe can only answer in one way i have asked for a little time to consider because my family circumstances require some consideration in his interests as well as in mine i have engaged to tell him what those circumstances are what shall i say i wonder when we next meet and i have requested him in the meantime to keep all that has passed between us a secret for the present as to what he is to do himself in the interval while i am supposed to be considering i have left it to his own discretionmerely reminding him that his attempting to see me again while our positions toward each other cannot be openly avowed might injure my reputation i have offered to write to him if he wishes it and i have ended by promising to make the interval of our necessary separation as short as i can  this sort of plain unaffected letterwhich i might have written to him last night if his story had not been running in my head as it didhas one defect i know it certainly keeps him out of the way while i am casting my net and catching my gold fish at the great house for the second time but it also leaves an awkward day of reckoning to come with midwinter if i succeed how am i to manage him what am i to do i ought to face those two questions as boldly as usual but somehow my courage seems to fail me and i dont quite fancy meeting that difficulty till the time comes when it must be met shall i confess to my diary that i am sorry for midwinter and that i shrink a little from thinking of the day when he hears that i am going to be mistress at the great house  but i am not mistress yet and i cant take a step in the direction of the great house till i have got the answer to my letter and till i know that midwinter is out of the way patience patience i must go and forget myself at my piano there is the moonlight sonata open and tempting me on the musicstand have i nerve enough to play it i wonder or will it set me shuddering with the mystery and terror of it as it did the other day   five oclocki have got his answer the slightest request i can make is a command to him he has gone and he sends me his address in london there are two considerations he says which help to reconcile me to leaving you the first is that you wish it and that it is only to be for a little while the second is that i think i can make some arrangements in london for adding to my income by my own labor i have never cared for money for myself but you dont know how i am beginning already to prize the luxuries and refinements that money can provide for my wifes sake poor fellow i almost wish i had not written to him as i did i almost wish i had not sent him away from me  fancy if mother oldershaw saw this page in my diary i have had a letter from her this morninga letter to remind me of my obligations and to tell me she suspects things are all going wrong let her suspect i shant trouble myself to answer i cant be worried with that old wretch in the state i am in now  it is a lovely afternooni want a walki mustnt think of midwinter suppose i put on my bonnet and try my experiment at once at the great house everything is in my favor there is no spy to follow me and no lawyer to keep me out this time am i handsome enough today well yes handsome enough to be a match for a little dowdy awkward freckled creature who ought to be perched on a form at school and strapped to a backboard to straighten her crooked shoulders    the nursery lisps out in all they utter     besides they always smell of breadandbutter  how admirably byron has described girls in their teens   eight oclocki have just got back from armadales house i have seen him and spoken to him and the end of it may be set down in three plain words i have failed there is no more chance of my being mrs armadale of thorpe ambrose than there is of my being queen of england  shall i write and tell oldershaw shall i go back to london not till i have had time to think a little not just yet  let me think i have failed completelyfailed with all the circumstances in favor of success i caught him alone on the drive in front of the house he was excessively disconcerted but at the same time quite willing to hear me i tried him first quietlythen with tears and the rest of it i introduced myself in the character of the poor innocent woman whom he had been the means of injuring i confused i interested i convinced him i went on to the purely christian part of my errand and spoke with such feeling of his separation from his friend for which i was innocently responsible that i turned his odious rosy face quite pale and made him beg me at last not to distress him but whatever other feelings i roused in him i never once roused his old feeling for me i saw it in his eyes when he looked at me i felt it in his fingers when we shook hands we parted friends and nothing more  it is for this is it miss milroy that i resisted temptation morning after morning when i knew you were out alone in the park i have just left you time to slip in and take my place in armadales good graces have i i never resisted temptation yet without suffering for it in some such way as this if i had only followed my first thoughts on the day when i took leave of you my young ladywell well never mind that now i have got the future before me you are not mrs armadale yet and i can tell you one other thingwhoever else he marries he will never marry you if i am even with you in no other way trust me whatever comes of it to be even with you there  i am not to my own surprise in one of my furious passions the last time i was in this perfectly cool state under serious provocation something came of it which i darent write down even in my own private diary i shouldnt be surprised if something comes of it now  on my way back i called at mr bashwoods lodgings in the town he was not at home and i left a message telling him to come here tonight and speak to me i mean to relieve him at once of the duty of looking after armadale and miss milroy i may not see my way yet to ruining her prospects at thorpe ambrose as completely as she has ruined mine but when the time comes and i do see it i dont know to what lengths my sense of injury may take me and there may be inconvenience and possibly danger in having such a chickenhearted creature as mr bashwood in my confidence  i suspect i am more upset by all this than i supposed midwinters story is beginning to haunt me again without rhyme or reason  a soft quick trembling knock at the street door i know who it is no hand but old bashwoods could knock in that way   nine oclocki have just got rid of him he has surprised me by coming out in a new character  it seems though i didnt detect him that he was at the great house while i was in company with armadale he saw us talking on the drive and he afterward heard what the servants said who saw us too the wise opinion below stairs is that we have made it up and that the master is likely to marry me after all hes sweet on her red hair was the elegant expression they used in the kitchen little missie cant match her there and little missie will get the worst of it how i hate the coarse ways of the lower orders  while old bashwood was telling me this i thought he looked even more confused and nervous than usual but i failed to see what was really the matter until after i had told him that he was to leave all further observation of mr armadale and miss milroy to me every drop of the little blood there is in the feeble old creatures body seemed to fly up into his face he made quite an overpowering effort he really looked as if he would drop down dead of fright at his own boldness but he forced out the question for all that stammering and stuttering and kneading desperately with both hands at the brim of his hideous great hat i beg your pardon miss gwigwigwilt you are not really gogogoing to marry mr armadale are you jealousif ever i saw it in a mans face yet i saw it in hisactually jealous of armadale at his age if i had been in the humor for it i should have burst out laughing in his face as it was i was angry and lost all patience with him i told him he was an old fool and ordered him to go on quietly with his usual business until i sent him word that he was wanted again he submitted as usual but there was an indescribable something in his watery old eyes when he took leave of me which i have never noticed in them before love has the credit of working all sorts of strange transformations can it be really possible that love has made mr bashwood man enough to be angry with me  wednesdaymy experience of miss milroys habits suggested a suspicion to me last night which i thought it desirable to clear up this morning  it was always her way when i was at the cottage to take a walk early in the morning before breakfast considering that i used often to choose that very time for my private meetings with armadale it struck me as likely that my former pupil might be taking a leaf out of my book and that i might make some desirable discoveries if i turned my steps in the direction of the majors garden at the right hour i deprived myself of my drops to make sure of waking passed a miserable night in consequence and was ready enough to get up at six oclock and walk the distance from my lodgings to the cottage in the fresh morning air  i had not been five minutes on the park side of the garden inclosure before i saw her come out  she seemed to have had a bad night too her eyes were heavy and red and her lips and cheeks looked swollen as if she had been crying there was something on her mind evidently something as it soon appeared to take her out of the garden into the park she walked if one can call it walking with such legs as hers straight to the summer house and opened the door and crossed the bridge and went on quicker and quicker toward the low ground in the park where the trees are thickest i followed her over the open space with perfect impunity in the preoccupied state she was in and when she began to slacken her pace among the trees i was among the trees too and was not afraid of her seeing me  before long there was a crackling and trampling of heavy feet coming up toward us through the underwood in a deep dip of the ground i knew that step as well as she knew it here i am she said in a faint little voice i kept behind the trees a few yards off in some doubt on which side armadale would come out of the underwood to join her he came out up the side of the dell opposite to the tree behind which i was standing they sat down together on the bank i sat down behind the tree and looked at them through the underwood and heard without the slightest difficulty every word that they said  the talk began by his noticing that she looked out of spirits and asking if anything had gone wrong at the cottage the artful little minx lost no time in making the necessary impression on him she began to cry he took her hand of course and tried in his brutishly straightforward way to comfort her no she was not to be comforted a miserable prospect was before her she had not slept the whole night for thinking of it her father had called her into his room the previous evening had spoken about the state of her education and had told her in so many words that she was to go to school the place had been found and the terms had been settled and as soon as her clothes could be got ready miss was to go  while that hateful miss gwilt was in the house says this model young person i would have gone to school willinglyi wanted to go but its all different now i dont think of it in the same way i feel too old for school im quite heartbroken mr armadale there she stopped as if she had meant to say more and gave him a look which finished the sentence plainly im quite heartbroken mr armadale now we are friendly again at going away from you for downright brazen impudence which a grown woman would be ashamed of give me the young girls whose modesty is so pertinaciously insisted on by the nauseous domestic sentimentalists of the present day  even armadale booby as he is understood her after bewildering himself in a labyrinth of words that led nowhere he took herone can hardly say round the waist for she hasnt got onehe took her round the last hookandeye of her dress and by way of offering her a refuge from the indignity of being sent to school at her age made her a proposal of marriage in so many words  if i could have killed them both at that moment by lifting up my little finger i have not the least doubt i should have lifted it as things were i only waited to see what miss milroy would do  she appeared to think it necessaryfeeling i suppose that she had met him without her fathers knowledge and not forgetting that i had had the start of her as the favored object of mr armadales good opinionto assert herself by an explosion of virtuous indignation she wondered how he could think of such a thing after his conduct with miss gwilt and after her father had forbidden him the house did he want to make her feel how inexcusably she had forgotten what was due to herself was it worthy of a gentleman to propose what he knew as well as she did was impossible and so on and so on any man with brains in his head would have known what all this rodomontade really meant armadale took it so seriously that he actually attempted to justify himself  he declared in his headlong blundering way that he was quite in earnest he and her father might make it up and be friends again and if the major persisted in treating him as a stranger young ladies and gentlemen in their situation had made runaway marriages before now and fathers and mothers who wouldnt forgive them before had forgiven them afterward such outrageously straightforward lovemaking as this left miss milroy of course but two alternativesto confess that she had been saying no when she meant yes or to take refuge in another explosion she was hypocrite enough to prefer another explosion how dare you mr armadale go away directly its inconsiderate its heartless its perfectly disgraceful to say such things to me and so on and so on it seems incredible but it is not the less true that he was positively fool enough to take her at her word he begged her pardon and went away like a child that is put in the cornerthe most contemptible object in the form of man that eyes ever looked on  she waited after he had gone to compose herself and i waited behind the trees to see how she would succeed her eyes wandered round slyly to the path by which he had left her she smiled grinned would be the truer way of putting it with such a mouth as hers took a few steps on tiptoe to look after him turned back again and suddenly burst into a violent fit of crying i am not quite so easily taken in as armadale and i saw what it all meant plainly enough  tomorrow i thought to myself you will be in the park again miss by pure accident the next day you will lead him on into proposing to you for the second time the day after he will venture back to the subject of runaway marriages and you will only be becomingly confused and the day after that if he has got a plan to propose and if your clothes are ready to be packed for school you will listen to him yes yes time is always on the mans side where a woman is concerned if the man is only patient enough to let time help him  i let her leave the place and go back to the cottage quite unconscious that i had been looking at her i waited among the trees thinking the truth is i was impressed by what i had heard and seen in a manner that it is not very easy to describe it put the whole thing before me in a new light it showed mewhat i had never even suspected till this morningthat she is really fond of him  heavy as my debt of obligation is to her there is no fear now of my failing to pay it to the last farthing it would have been no small triumph for me to stand between miss milroy and her ambition to be one of the leading ladies of the county but it is infinitely more where her first love is concerned to stand between miss milroy and her hearts desire shall i remember my own youth and spare her no she has deprived me of the one chance i had of breaking the chain that binds me to a past life too horrible to be thought of i am thrown back into a position compared to which the position of an outcast who walks the streets is endurable and enviable no miss milroyno mr armadale i will spare neither of you  i have been back some hours i have been thinking and nothing has come of it ever since i got that strange letter of midwinters last sunday my usual readiness in emergencies has deserted me when i am not thinking of him or of his story my mind feels quite stupefied i who have always known what to do on other occasions dont know what to do now it would be easy enough of course to warn major milroy of his daughters proceedings but the major is fond of his daughter armadale is anxious to be reconciled with him armadale is rich and prosperous and ready to submit to the elder man and sooner or later they will be friends again and the marriage will follow warning major milroy is only the way to embarrass them for the present it is not the way to part them for good and all  what is the way i cant see it i could tear my own hair off my head i could burn the house down if there was a train of gunpowder under the whole world i could light it and blow the whole world to destructioni am in such a rage such a frenzy with myself for not seeing it  poor dear midwinter yes dear i dont care im lonely and helpless i want somebody who is gentle and loving to make much of me i wish i had his head on my bosom again i have a good mind to go to london and marry him am i mad yes all people who are as miserable as i am are mad i must go to the window and get some air shall i jump out no it disfigures one so and the coroners inquest lets so many people see it  the air has revived me i begin to remember that i have time on my side at any rate nobody knows but me of their secret meetings in the park the first thing in the morning if jealous old bashwood who is slinking and sly enough for anything tries to look privately after armadale in his own interests he will try at the usual time when he goes to the stewards office he knows nothing of miss milroys early habits and he wont be on the spot till armadale has got back to the house for another week to come i may wait and watch them and choose my own time and way of interfering the moment i see a chance of his getting the better of her hesitation and making her say yes  so here i wait without knowing how things will end with midwinter in london with my purse getting emptier and emptier and no appearance so far of any new pupils to fill it with mother oldershaw certain to insist on having her money back the moment she knows i have failed without prospects friends or hopes of any kinda lost woman if ever there was a lost woman yet well i say it again and again and againi dont care here i stop if i sell the clothes off my back if i hire myself at the publichouse to play to the brutes in the taproom here i stop till the time comes and i see the way to parting armadale and miss milroy forever   seven oclockany signs that the time is coming yet i hardly know there are signs of a change at any rate in my position in the neighborhood  two of the oldest and ugliest of the many old and ugly ladies who took up my case when i left major milroys service have just called announcing themselves with the insufferable impudence of charitable englishwomen as a deputation from my patronesses it seems that the news of my reconciliation with armadale has spread from the servants offices at the great house and has reached the town with this result  it is the unanimous opinion of my patronesses and the opinion of major milroy also who has been consulted that i have acted with the most inexcusable imprudence in going to armadales house and in there speaking on friendly terms with a man whose conduct toward myself has made his name a byword in the neighborhood my total want of selfrespect in this matter has given rise to a report that i am trading as cleverly as ever on my good looks and that i am as likely as not to end in making armadale marry me after all my patronesses are of course too charitable to believe this they merely feel it necessary to remonstrate with me in a christian spirit and to warn me that any second and similar imprudence on my part would force all my best friends in the place to withdraw the countenance and protection which i now enjoy  having addressed me turn and turn about in these terms evidently all rehearsed beforehand my two gorgon visitors straightened themselves in their chairs and looked at me as much as to say you may often have heard of virtue miss gwilt but we dont believe you ever really saw it in full bloom till we came and called on you  seeing they were bent on provoking me i kept my temper and answered them in my smoothest sweetest and most ladylike manner i have noticed that the christianity of a certain class of respectable people begins when they open their prayerbooks at eleven oclock on sunday morning and ends when they shut them up again at one oclock on sunday afternoon nothing so astonishes and insults christians of this sort as reminding them of their christianity on a weekday on this hint as the man says in the play i spoke  what have i done that is wrong i asked innocently mr armadale has injured me and i have been to his house and forgiven him the injury surely there must be some mistake ladies you cant have really come here to remonstrate with me in a christian spirit for performing an act of christianity  the two gorgons got up i firmly believe some women have cats tails as well as cats faces i firmly believe the tails of those two particular cats wagged slowly under their petticoats and swelled to four times their proper size  temper we were prepared for miss gwilt they said but not profanity we wish you goodevening  so they left me and so miss gwilt sinks out of the patronizing notice of the neighborhood  i wonder what will come of this trumpery little quarrel one thing will come of it which i can see already the report will reach miss milroys ears she will insist on armadales justifying himself and armadale will end in satisfying her of his innocence by making another proposal this will be quite likely to hasten matters between them at least it would with me if i was in her place i should say to myself i will make sure of him while i can supposing it doesnt rain tomorrow morning i think i will take another early walk in the direction of the park   midnightas i cant take my drops with a morning walk before me i may as well give up all hope of sleeping and go on with my diary even with my drops i doubt if my head would be very quiet on my pillow tonight since the little excitement of the scene with my ladypatronesses has worn off i have been troubled with misgivings which would leave me but a poor chance under any circumstances of getting much rest  i cant imagine why but the parting words spoken to armadale by that old brute of a lawyer have come back to my mind here they are as reported in mr bashwoods letter some other persons curiosity may go on from the point where you and i have stopped and some other persons hand may let the broad daylight in yet on miss gwilt  what does he mean by that and what did he mean afterward when he overtook old bashwood in the drive by telling him to gratify his curiosity does this hateful pedgift actually suppose there is any chance ridiculous why i have only to look at the feeble old creature and he darent lift his little finger unless i tell him he try to pry into my past life indeed why people with ten times his brains and a hundred times his courage have triedand have left off as wise as they began  i dont know though it might have been better if i had kept my temper when bashwood was here the other night and it might be better still if i saw him tomorrow and took him back into my good graces by giving him something to do for me suppose i tell him to look after the two pedgifts and to discover whether there is any chance of their attempting to renew their connection with armadale no such thing is at all likely but if i gave old bashwood this commission it would flatter his sense of his own importance to me and would at the same time serve the excellent purpose of keeping him out of my way   thursday morning nine oclocki have just got back from the park  for once i have proved a true prophet there they were together at the same early hour in the same secluded situation among the trees and there was miss in full possession of the report of my visit to the great house and taking her tone accordingly  after saying one or two things about me which i promise him not to forget armadale took the way to convince her of his constancy which i felt beforehand he would be driven to take he repeated his proposal of marriage with excellent effect this time tears and kisses and protestations followed and my late pupil opened her heart at last in the most innocent manner home she confessed was getting so miserable to her now that it was only less miserable than going to school her mothers temper was becoming more violent and unmanageable every day the nurse who was the only person with any influence over her had gone away in disgust her father was becoming more and more immersed in his clock and was made more and more resolute to send her away from home by the distressing scenes which now took place with her mother almost day by day i waited through these domestic disclosures on the chance of hearing any plans they might have for the future discussed between them and my patience after no small exercise of it was rewarded at last  the first suggestion as was only natural where such a fool as armadale was concerned came from the girl  she started an idea which i own i had not anticipated she proposed that armadale should write to her father and cleverer still she prevented all fear of his blundering by telling him what he was to say he was to express himself as deeply distressed at his estrangement from the major and to request permission to call at the cottage and say a few words in his own justification that was all the letter was not to be sent that day for the applicants for the vacant place of mrs milroys nurse were coming and seeing them and questioning them would put her father with his dislike of such things in no humor to receive armadales application indulgently the friday would be the day to send the letter and on the saturday morning if the answer was unfortunately not favorable they might meet again i dont like deceiving my father he has always been so kind to me and there will be no need to deceive him allan if we can only make you friends again those were the last words the little hypocrite said when i left them  what will the major do saturday morning will show i wont think of it till saturday morning has come and gone they are not man and wife yet and again and again i say it though my brains are still as helpless as ever man and wife they shall never be  on my way home again i caught bashwood at his breakfast with his poor old black teapot and his little penny loaf and his one cheap morsel of oily butter and his darned dirty tablecloth it sickens me to think of it  i coaxed and comforted the miserable old creature till the tears stood in his eyes and he quite blushed with pleasure he undertakes to look after the pedgifts with the utmost alacrity pedgift the elder he described when once roused as the most obstinate man living nothing will induce him to give way unless armadale gives way also on his side pedgift the younger is much the more likely of the two to make attempts at a reconciliation such at least is bashwoods opinion it is of very little consequence now what happens either way the only important thing is to tie my elderly admirer safely again to my apronstring and this is done  the post is late this morning it has only just come in and has brought me a letter from midwinter  it is a charming letter it flatters me and flutters me as if i was a young girl again no reproaches for my never having written to him no hateful hurrying of me in plain words to marry him he only writes to tell me a piece of news he has obtained through his lawyers a prospect of being employed as occasional correspondent to a newspaper which is about to be started in london the employment will require him to leave england for the continent which would exactly meet his own wishes for the future but he cannot consider the proposal seriously until he has first ascertained whether it would meet my wishes too he knows no will but mine and he leaves me to decide after first mentioning the time allowed him before his answer must be sent in it is the time of course if i agree to his going abroad in which i must marry him but there is not a word about this in his letter he asks for nothing but a sight of my handwriting to help him through the interval while we are separated from each other  that is the letter not very long but so prettily expressed  i think i can penetrate the secret of his fancy for going abroad that wild idea of putting the mountains and the seas between armadale and himself is still in his mind as if either he or i could escape doing what we are fated to dosupposing we really are fatedby putting a few hundred or a few thousand miles between armadale and ourselves what strange absurdity and inconsistency and yet how i like him for being absurd and inconsistent for dont i see plainly that i am at the bottom of it all who leads this clever man astray in spite of himself who makes him too blind to see the contradiction in his own conduct which he would see plainly in the conduct of another person how interested i do feel in him how dangerously near i am to shutting my eyes on the past and letting myself love him was eve fonder of adam than ever i wonder after she had coaxed him into eating the apple i should have quite doted on him if i had been in her place memorandum to write midwinter a charming little letter on my side with a kiss in it and as time is allowed him before he sends in his answer to ask for time too before i tell him whether i will or will not go abroad   five oclocka tiresome visit from my landlady eager for a little gossip and full of news which she thinks will interest me  she is acquainted i find with mrs milroys late nurse and she has been seeing her friend off at the station this afternoon they talked of course of affairs at the cottage and my name found its way into the conversation i am quite wrong it seems if the nurses authority is to be trusted in believing miss milroy to be responsible for sending mr armadale to my reference in london miss milroy really knew nothing about it and it all originated in her mothers mad jealousy of me the present wretched state of things at the cottage is due entirely to the same cause mrs milroy is firmly persuaded that my remaining at thorpe ambrose is referable to my having some private means of communicating with the major which it is impossible for her to discover with this conviction in her mind she has become so unmanageable that no person with any chance of bettering herself could possibly remain in attendance on her and sooner or later the major object to it as he may will be obliged to place her under proper medical care  that is the sum and substance of what the wearisome landlady had to tell me unnecessary to say that i was not in the least interested by it even if the nurses assertion is to be depended onwhich i persist in doubtingit is of no importance now i know that miss milroy and nobody but miss milroy has utterly ruined my prospect of becoming mrs armadale of thorpe ambrose and i care to know nothing more if her mother was really alone in the attempt to expose my false reference her mother seems to be suffering for it at any rate and so goodby to mrs milroy and heaven defend me from any more last glimpses at the cottages seen through the medium of my landladys spectacles   nine oclockbashwood has just left me having come with news from the great house pedgift the younger has made his attempt at bringing about a reconciliation this very day and has failed i am the sole cause of the failure armadale is quite willing to be reconciled if pedgift the elder will avoid all future occasion of disagreement between them by never recurring to the subject of miss gwilt this however happens to be exactly the condition which pedgifts fatherwith his opinion of me and my doingsshould consider it his duty to armadale not to accept so lawyer and client remain as far apart as ever and the obstacle of the pedgifts is cleared out of my way  it might have been a very awkward obstacle so far as pedgift the elder is concerned if one of his suggestions had been carried out i mean if an officer of the london police had been brought down here to look at me it is a question even now whether i had better not take to the thick veil again which i always wear in london and other large places the only difficulty is that it would excite remark in this inquisitive little town to see me wearing a thick veil for the first time in the summer weather  it is close on ten oclock i have been dawdling over my diary longer than i supposed  no words can describe how weary and languid i feel why dont i take my sleeping drops and go to bed there is no meeting between armadale and miss milroy to force me into early rising tomorrow morning am i trying for the hundredth time to see my way clearly into the futuretrying in my present state of fatigue to be the quickwitted woman i once was before all these anxieties came together and overpowered me or am i perversely afraid of my bed when i want it most i dont know i am tired and miserable i am looking wretchedly haggard and old with a little encouragement i might be fool enough to burst out crying luckily there is no one to encourage me what sort of a night is it i wonder  a cloudy night with the moon showing at intervals and the wind rising i can just hear it moaning among the ins and outs of the unfinished cottages at the end of the street my nerves must be a little shaken i think i was startled just now by a shadow on the wall it was only after a moment or two that i mustered sense enough to notice where the candle was and to see that the shadow was my own  shadows remind me of midwinter or if the shadows dont something else does i must have another look at his letter and then i will positively go to bed  i shall end in getting fond of him if i remain much longer in this lonely uncertain stateso irresolute so unlike my usual selfi shall end in getting fond of him what madness as if i could ever be really fond of a man again  suppose i took one of my sudden resolutions and married him poor as he is he would give me a name and a position if i became his wife let me see how the namehis own namewould look if i really did consent to it for mine  mrs armadale pretty  mrs allan armadale prettier still  my nerves must be shaken here is my own handwriting startling me now it is so strange it is enough to startle anybody the similarity in the two names never struck me in this light before marry which of the two i might my name would of course be the same i should have been mrs armadale if i had married the lighthaired allan at the great house and i can be mrs armadale still if i marry the darkhaired allan in london its almost maddening to write it downto feel that something ought to come of itand to find nothing come  how can anything come of it if i did go to london and marry him as of course i must marry him under his real name would he let me be known by it afterward with all his reasons for concealing his real name he would insistno he is too fond of me to do thathe would entreat me to take the name which he has assumed mrs midwinter hideous ozias too when i wanted to address him familiarly as his wife should worse than hideous  and yet there would be some reason for humoring him in this if he asked me  suppose the brute at the great house happened to leave this neighborhood as a single man and suppose in his absence any of the people who know him heard of a mrs allan armadale they would set her down at once as his wife even if they actually saw meif i actually came among them with that name and if he was not present to contradict ithis own servants would be the first to say we knew she would marry him after all and my ladypatronesses who will be ready to believe anything of me now we have quarreled would join the chorus sotto voce only think my dear the report that so shocked us actually turns out to be true no if i marry midwinter i must either be perpetually putting my husband and myself in a false positionor i must leave his real name his pretty romantic name behind me at the church door  my husband as if i was really going to marry him i am not going to marry him and theres an end of it  halfpast tenoh dear oh dear how my temples throb and how hot my weary eyes feel there is the moon looking at me through the window how fast the little scattered clouds are flying before the wind now they let the moon in and now they shut the moon out what strange shapes the patches of yellow light take and lose again all in a moment no peace and quiet for me look where i may the candle keeps flickering and the very sky itself is restless tonight  to bed to bed as lady macbeth says i wonder bytheby what lady macbeth would have done in my position she would have killed somebody when her difficulties first began probably armadale   friday morninga nights rest thanks again to my drops i went to breakfast in better spirits and received a morning welcome in the shape of a letter from mrs oldershaw  my silence has produced its effect on mother jezebel she attributes it to the right cause and she shows her claws at last if i am not in a position to pay my note of hand for thirty pounds which is due on tuesday next her lawyer is instructed to take the usual course if i am not in a position to pay it why when i have settled today with my landlord i shall have barely five pounds left there is not the shadow of a prospect between now and tuesday of my earning any money and i dont possess a friend in this place who would trust me with sixpence the difficulties that are swarming round me wanted but one more to complete them and that one has come  midwinter would assist me of course if i could bring myself to ask him for assistance but that means marrying him am i really desperate enough and helpless enough to end it in that way no not yet  my head feels heavy i must get out into the fresh air and think about it   two oclocki believe i have caught the infection of midwinters superstition i begin to think that events are forcing me nearer and nearer to some end which i dont see yet but which i am firmly persuaded is now not far off  i have been insulteddeliberately insulted before witnessesby miss milroy  after walking as usual in the most unfrequented place i could pick out and after trying not very successfully to think to some good purpose of what i am to do next i remembered that i needed some notepaper and pens and went back to the town to the stationers shop it might have been wiser to have sent for what i wanted but i was weary of myself and weary of my lonely rooms and i did my own errand for no better reason than that it was something to do  i had just got into the shop and was asking for what i wanted when another customer came in we both looked up and recognized each other at the same moment miss milroy  a woman and a lad were behind the counter besides the man who was serving me the woman civilly addressed the new customer what can we have the pleasure of doing for you miss after pointing it first by looking me straight in the face she answered nothing thank you at present ill come back when the shop is empty  she went out the three people in the shop looked at me in silence in silence on my side i paid for my purchases and left the place i dont know how i might have felt if i had been in my usual spirits in the anxious unsettled state i am in now i cant deny it the girl stung me  in the weakness of the moment for it was nothing else i was on the point of matching her petty spitefulness by spitefulness quite as petty on my side i had actually got as far as the whole length of the street on my way to the majors cottage bent on telling him the secret of his daughters morning walks before my better sense came back to me when i did cool down i turned round at once and took the way home no no miss milroy mere temporary mischiefmaking at the cottage which would only end in your father forgiving you and in armadale profiting by his indulgence will nothing like pay the debt i owe you i dont forget that your heart is set on armadale and that the major however he may talk has always ended hitherto in giving you your own way my head may be getting duller and duller but it has not quite failed me yet  in the meantime there is mother oldershaws letter waiting obstinately to be answered and here am i not knowing what to do about it yet shall i answer it or not it doesnt matter for the present there are some hours still to spare before the post goes out  suppose i asked armadale to lend me the money i should enjoy getting something out of him and i believe in his present situation with miss milroy he would do anything to be rid of me mean enough this on my part pooh when you hate and despise a man as i hate and despise armadale who cares for looking mean in his eyes  and yet my prideor my something else i dont know whatshrinks from it  halfpast twoonly halfpast two oh the dreadful weariness of these long summer days i cant keep thinking and thinking any longer i must do something to relieve my mind can i go to my piano no im not fit for it work no i shall get thinking again if i take to my needle a man in my place would find refuge in drink im not a man and i cant drink ill dawdle over my dresses and put my things tidy        has an hour passed more than an hour it seems like a minute  i cant look back through these leaves but i know i wrote somewhere that i felt myself getting nearer and nearer to some end that was still hidden from me the end is hidden no longer the cloud is off my mind the blindness has gone from my eyes i see it i see it  it came to mei never sought it if i was lying on my deathbed i could swear with a safe conscience i never sought it  i was only looking over my things i was as idly and as frivolously employed as the most idle and most frivolous woman living i went through my dresses and my linen what could be more innocent children go through their dresses and their linen  it was such a long summer day and i was so tired of myself i went to my boxes next i looked over the large box first which i usually leave open and then i tried the small box which i always keep locked  from one thing to the other i came at last to the bundle of letters at the bottomthe letters of the man for whom i once sacrificed and suffered everything the man who has made me what i am  a hundred times i had determined to burn his letters but i have never burned them this time all i said was i wont read his letters and i did read them  the villainthe false cowardly heartless villainwhat have i to do with his letters now oh the misery of being a woman oh the meanness that our memory of a man can tempt us to when our love for him is dead and gone i read the lettersi was so lonely and so miserable i read the letters  i came to the lastthe letter he wrote to encourage me when i hesitated as the terrible time came nearer and nearer the letter that revived me when my resolution failed at the eleventh hour i read on line after line till i came to these words  i really have no patience with such absurdities as you have written to me you say i am driving you on to do what is beyond a womans courage am i i might refer you to any collection of trials english or foreign to show that you were utterly wrong but such collections may be beyond your reach and i will only refer you to a case in yesterdays newspaper the circumstances are totally different from our circumstances but the example of resolution in a woman is an example worth your notice  you will find among the law reports a married woman charged with fraudulently representing herself to be the missing widow of an officer in the merchant service who was supposed to have been drowned the name of the prisoners husband living and the name of the officer a very common one both as to christian and surname happened to be identically the same there was money to be got by it sorely wanted by the prisoners husband to whom she was devotedly attached if the fraud had succeeded the woman took it all on herself her husband was helpless and ill and the bailiffs were after him the circumstances as you may read for yourself were all in her favor and were so well managed by her that the lawyers themselves acknowledged she might have succeeded if the supposed drowned man had not turned up alive and well in the nick of time to confront her the scene took place at the lawyers office and came out in the evidence at the police court the woman was handsome and the sailor was a goodnatured man he wanted at first if the lawyers would have allowed him to let her off he said to her among other things you didnt count on the drowned man coming back alive and hearty did you maam its lucky for you she said i didnt count on it you have escaped the sea but you wouldnt have escaped me why what would you have done if you had known i was coming back says the sailor she looked him steadily in the face and answered i would have killed you there do you think such a woman as that would have written to tell me i was pressing her further than she had courage to go a handsome woman too like yourself you would drive some men in my position to wish they had her now in your place  i read no further when i had got on line by line to those words it burst on me like a flash of lightning in an instant i saw it as plainly as i see it now it is horrible it is unheard of it outdares all daring but if i can only nerve myself to face one terrible necessity it is to be done i may personate the richly provided widow of allan armadale of thorpe ambrose if i can count on allan armadales death in a given time  there in plain words is the frightful temptation under which i now feel myself sinking it is frightful in more ways than one for it has come straight out of that other temptation to which i yielded in the bygone time  yes there the letter has been waiting for me in my box to serve a purpose never thought of by the villain who wrote it there is the case as he called itonly quoted to taunt me utterly unlike my own case at the timethere it has been waiting and lurking for me through all the changes in my life till it has come to be like my case at last  it might startle any woman to see this and even this is not the worst the whole thing has been in my diary for days past without my knowing it every idle fancy that escaped me has been tending secretly that one way and i never saw never suspected it till the reading of the letter put my own thoughts before me in a new lighttill i saw the shadow of my own circumstances suddenly reflected in one special circumstance of that other womans case  it is to be done if i can but look the necessity in the face it is to be done if i can count on allan armadales death in a given time  all but his death is easy the whole series of events under which i have been blindly chafing and fretting for more than a week past have been one and allthough i was too stupid to see itevents in my favor events paving the way smoothly and more smoothly straight to the end  in three bold stepsonly threethat end might be reached let midwinter marry me privately under his real namestep the first let armadale leave thorpe ambrose a single man and die in some distant place among strangersstep the second  why am i hesitating why not go on to step the third and last  i will go on step the third and last is my appearance after the announcement of armadales death has reached this neighborhood in the character of armadales widow with my marriage certificate in my hand to prove my claim it is as clear as the sun at noonday thanks to the exact similarity between the two names and thanks to the careful manner in which the secret of that similarity has been kept i may be the wife of the dark allan armadale known as such to nobody but my husband and myself and i may out of that very position claim the character of widow of the light allan armadale with proof to support me in the shape of my marriage certificate which would be proof in the estimation of the most incredulous person living  to think of my having put all this in my diary to think of my having actually contemplated this very situation and having seen nothing more in it at the time than a reason if i married midwinter for consenting to appear in the world under my husbands assumed name  what is it daunts me the dread of obstacles the fear of discovery  where are the obstacles where is the fear of discovery  i am actually suspected all over the neighborhood of intriguing to be mistress of thorpe ambrose i am the only person who knows the real turn that armadales inclinations have taken not a creature but myself is as yet aware of his early morning meetings with miss milroy if it is necessary to part them i can do it at any moment by an anonymous line to the major if it is necessary to remove armadale from thorpe ambrose i can get him away at three days notice his own lips informed me when i last spoke to him that he would go to the ends of the earth to be friends again with midwinter if midwinter would let him i have only to tell midwinter to write from london and ask to be reconciled and midwinter would obey meand to london armadale would go every difficulty at starting is smoothed over ready to my hand every afterdifficulty i could manage for myself in the whole venturedesperate as it looks to pass myself off for the widow of one man while i am all the while the wife of the otherthere is absolutely no necessity that wants twice considering but the one terrible necessity of armadales death  his death it might be a terrible necessity to any other woman but is it ought it to be terrible to me  i hate him for his mothers sake i hate him for his own sake i hate him for going to london behind my back and making inquiries about me i hate him for forcing me out of my situation before i wanted to go i hate him for destroying all my hopes of marrying him and throwing me back helpless on my own miserable life but oh after what i have done already in the past time how can i how can i  the girl toothe girl who has come between us who has taken him away from me who has openly insulted me this very dayhow the girl whose heart is set on him would feel it if he died what a vengeance on her if i did it and when i was received as armadales widow what a triumph for me triumph it is more than triumphit is the salvation of me a name that cant be assailed a station that cant be assailed to hide myself in from my past life comfort luxury wealth an income of twelve hundred a year secured to me secured by a will which has been looked at by a lawyer secured independently of anything armadale can say or do himself i never had twelve hundred a year at my luckiest time i never had half as much really my own what have i got now just five pounds left in the worldand the prospect next week of a debtors prison  but oh after what i have done already in the past time how can i how can i  some womenin my place and with my recollections to look back onwould feel it differently some women would say its easier the second time than the first why cant i why cant i  oh you devil tempting me is there no angel near to raise some timely obstacle between this and tomorrow which might help me to give it up  i shall sink under iti shall sink if i write or think of it any more ill shut up these leaves and go out again ill get some common person to come with me and we will talk of common things ill take out the woman of the house and her children we will go and see something there is a show of some kind in the townill treat them to it im not such an illnatured woman when i try and the landlady has really been kind to me surely i might occupy my mind a little in seeing her and her children enjoying themselves  a minute since i shut up these leaves as i said i would and now i have opened them again i dont know why i think my brain is turned i feel as if something was lost out of my mind i feel as if i ought to find it here  i have found it midwinter  is it possible that i can have been thinking of the reasons for and against for an hour pastwriting midwinters name over and over againspeculating seriously on marrying himand all the time not once remembering that even with every other impediment removed he alone when the time came would be an insurmountable obstacle in my way has the effort to face the consideration of armadales death absorbed me to that degree i suppose it has i cant account for such extraordinary forgetfulness on my part in any other way  shall i stop and think it out as i have thought out all the rest shall i ask myself if the obstacle of midwinter would after all when the time came be the unmanageable obstacle that it looks at present no what need is there to think of it i have made up my mind to get the better of the temptation i have made up my mind to give my landlady and her children a treat i have made up my mind to close my diary and closed it shall be  six oclockthe landladys gossip is unendurable the landladys children distract me i have left them to run back here before post time and write a line to mrs oldershaw  the dread that i shall sink under the temptation has grown stronger and stronger on me i have determined to put it beyond my power to have my own way and follow my own will mother oldershaw shall be the salvation of me for the first time since i have known her if i cant pay my note of hand she threatens me with an arrest well she shall arrest me in the state my mind is in now the best thing that can happen to me is to be taken away from thorpe ambrose whether i like it or not i will write and say that i am to be found here i will write and tell her in so many words that the best service she can render me is to lock me up   seven oclockthe letter has gone to the post i had begun to feel a little easier when the children came in to thank me for taking them to the show one of them is a girl and the girl upset me she is a forward child and her hair is nearly the color of mine she said i shall be like you when i have grown bigger shant i her idiot of a mother said please to excuse her miss and took her out of the room laughing like me i dont pretend to be fond of the child but think of her being like me   saturday morningi have done well for once in acting on impulse and writing as i did to mrs oldershaw the only new circumstance that has happened is another circumstance in my favor  major milroy has answered armadales letter entreating permission to call at the cottage and justify himself his daughter read it in silence when armadale handed it to her at their meeting this morning in the park but they talked about it afterward loud enough for me to hear them the major persists in the course he has taken he says his opinion of armadales conduct has been formed not on common report but on armadales own letters and he sees no reason to alter the conclusion at which he arrived when the correspondence between them was closed  this little matter had i confess slipped out of my memory it might have ended awkwardly for me if major milroy had been less obstinately wedded to his own opinion armadale might have justified himself the marriage engagement might have been acknowledged and all my power of influencing the matter might have been at an end as it is they must continue to keep the engagement strictly secret and miss milroy who has never ventured herself near the great house since the thunderstorm forced her into it for shelter will be less likely than ever to venture there now i can part them when i please with an anonymous line to the major i can part them when i please  after having discussed the letter the talk between them turned on what they were to do next major milroys severity as it soon appeared produced the usual results armadale returned to the subject of the elopement and this time she listened to him there is everything to drive her to it her outfit of clothes is nearly ready and the summer holidays at the school which has been chosen for her end at the end of next week when i left them they had decided to meet again and settle something on monday  the last words i heard him address to her before i went away shook me a little he said there is one difficulty neelie that neednt trouble us at any rate i have got plenty of money and then he kissed her the way to his life began to look an easier way to me when he talked of his money and kissed her  some hours have passed and the more i think of it the more i fear the blank interval between this time and the time when mrs oldershaw calls in the law and protects me against myself it might have been better if i had stopped at home this morning but how could i after the insult she offered me yesterday i tingled all over to go and look at her  today sunday monday tuesday they cant arrest me for the money before wednesday and my miserable five pounds are dwindling to four and he told her he had plenty of money and she blushed and trembled when he kissed her it might have been better for him better for her and better for me if my debt had fallen due yesterday and if the bailiffs had their hands on me at this moment  suppose i had the means of leaving thorpe ambrose by the next train and going somewhere abroad and absorbing myself in some new interest among new people could i do it rather than look again at that easy way to his life which would smooth the way to everything else  perhaps i might but where is the money to come from surely some way of getting it struck me a day or two since yes that mean idea of asking armadale to help me well i will be mean for once ill give him the chance of making a generous use of that wellfilled purse which it is such a comfort to him to reflect on in his present circumstances it would soften my heart toward any man if he lent me money in my present extremity and if armadale lends me money it might soften my heart toward him when shall i go at once i wont give myself time to feel the degradation of it and to change my mind   three clocki mark the hour he has sealed his own doom he has insulted me  yes i have suffered it once from miss milroy and i have now suffered it a second time from armadale himself an insulta marked merciless deliberate insult in the open day  i had got through the town and had advanced a few hundred yards along the road that leads to the great house when i saw armadale at a little distance coming toward me he was walking fastevidently with some errand of his own to take him to the town the instant he caught sight of me he stopped colored up took off his hat hesitated and turned aside down a lane behind him which i happen to know would take him exactly in the contrary direction to the direction in which he was walking when he first saw me his conduct said in so many words miss milroy may hear of it i darent run the risk of being seen speaking to you men have used me heartlessly men have done and said hard things to me but no man living ever yet treated me as if i was plaguestruck and as if the very air about me was infected by my presence  i say no more when he walked away from me down that lane he walked to his death i have written to midwinter to expect me in london nest week and to be ready for our marriage soon afterward   four oclockhalf an hour since i put on my bonnet to go out and post the letter to midwinter myself and here i am still in my room with my mind torn by doubts and my letter on the table  armadale counts for nothing in the perplexities that are now torturing me it is midwinter who makes me hesitate can i take the first of those three steps that lead me to the end without the common caution of looking at consequences can i marry midwinter without knowing beforehand how to meet the obstacle of my husband when the time comes which transforms me from the living armadales wife to the dead armadales widow  why cant i think of it when i know i must think of it why cant i look at it as steadily as i have looked at all the rest i feel his kisses on my lips i feel his tears on my bosom i feel his arms round me again he is far away in london and yet he is here and wont let me think of it  why cant i wait a little why cant i let time help me time its saturday what need is there to think of it unless i like there is no post to london today i must wait if i posted the letter it wouldnt go besides tomorrow i may hear from mrs oldershaw i ought to wait to hear from mrs oldershaw i cant consider myself a free woman till i know what mrs oldershaw means to do there is a necessity for waiting till tomorrow i shall take my bonnet off and lock the letter up in my desk   sunday morningthere is no resisting it one after another the circumstances crowd on me they come thicker and thicker and they all force me one way  i have got mother oldershaws answer the wretch fawns on me and cringes to me i can see as plainly as if she had acknowledged it that she suspects me of seeing my own way to success at thorpe ambrose without her assistance having found threatening me useless she tries coaxing me now i am her darling lydia again she is quite shocked that i could imagine she ever really intended to arrest her bosom friend and she has only to entreat me as a favor to herself to renew the bill  i say once more no mortal creature could resist it time after time i have tried to escape the temptation and time after time the circumstances drive me back again i can struggle no longer the post that takes the letters tonight shall take my letter to midwinter among the rest  tonight if i give myself till tonight something else may happen if i give myself till tonight i may hesitate again im weary of the torture of hesitating i must and will have relief in the present cost what it may in the future my letter to midwinter will drive me mad if i see it staring and staring at me in my desk any longer i can post it in ten minutes timeand i will  it is done the first of the three steps that lead me to the end is a step taken my mind is quieterthe letter is in the post  by tomorrow midwinter will receive it before the end of the week armadale must be publicly seen to leave thorpe ambrose and i must be publicly seen to leave with him  have i looked at the consequences of my marriage to midwinter no do i know how to meet the obstacle of my husband when the time comes which transforms me from the living armadales wife to the dead armadales widow  no when the time comes i must meet the obstacle as i best may i am going blindfold thenso far as midwinter is concernedinto this frightful risk yes blindfold am i out of my senses very likely or am i a little too fond of him to look the thing in the face i dare say who cares  i wont i wont i wont think of it havent i a will of my own and cant i think if i like of something else  here is mother jezebels cringing letter that is something else to think of ill answer it i am in a fine humor for writing to mother jezebel        conclusion of miss gwilts letter to mrs oldershaw  i told you when i broke off that i would wait before i finished this and ask my diary if i could safely tell you what i have now got it in my mind to do well i have asked and my diary says dont tell her under these circumstances i close my letterwith my best excuses for leaving you in the dark  i shall probably be in london before longand i may tell you by word of mouth what i dont think it safe to write here mind i make no promise it all depends on how i feel toward you at the time i dont doubt your discretion but under certain circumstances i am not so sure of your courage l g  p smy best thanks for your permission to renew the bill i decline profiting by the proposal the money will be ready when the money is due i have a friend now in london who will pay it if i ask him do you wonder who the friend is you will wonder at one or two other things mrs oldershaw before many weeks more are over your head and mine     xi love and law  on the morning of monday the 28th of july miss gwiltonce more on the watch for allan and neeliereached her customary post of observation in the park by the usual roundabout way  she was a little surprised to find neelie alone at the place of meeting she was more seriously astonished when the tardy allan made his appearance ten minutes later to see him mounting the side of the dell with a large volume under his arm and to hear him say as an apology for being late that he had muddled away his time in hunting for the books and that he had only found one after all which seemed in the least likely to repay either neelie or himself for the trouble of looking into it  if miss gwilt had waited long enough in the park on the previous saturday to hear the lovers parting words on that occasion she would have been at no loss to explain the mystery of the volume under allans arm and she would have understood the apology which he now offered for being late as readily as neelie herself  there is a certain exceptional occasion in lifethe occasion of marriageon which even girls in their teens sometimes become capable more or less hysterically of looking at consequences at the farewell moment of the interview on saturday neelies mind had suddenly precipitated itself into the future and she had utterly confounded allan by inquiring whether the contemplated elopement was an offense punishable by the law her memory satisfied her that she had certainly read somewhere at some former period in some book or other possibly a novel of an elopement with a dreadful endof a bride dragged home in hystericsand of a bridegroom sentenced to languish in prison with all his beautiful hair cut off by act of parliament close to his head supposing she could bring herself to consent to the elopement at allwhich she positively declined to promiseshe must first insist on discovering whether there was any fear of the police being concerned in her marriage as well as the parson and the clerk allan being a man ought to know and to allan she looked for informationwith this preliminary assurance to assist him in laying down the law that she would die of a broken heart a thousand times over rather than be the innocent means of sending him to languish in prison and of cutting his hair off by act of parliament close to his head its no laughing matter said neelie resolutely in conclusion i decline even to think of our marriage till my mind is made easy first on the subject of the law  but i dont know anything about the law not even as much as you do said allan hang the law i dont mind my head being cropped lets risk it  risk it repeated neelie indignantly have you no consideration for me i wont risk it where theres a will theres a way we must find out the law for ourselves  with all my heart said allan how  out of books to be sure there must be quantities of information in that enormous library of yours at the great house if you really love me you wont mind going over the backs of a few thousand books for my sake  ill go over the backs of ten thousand cried allan warmly would you mind telling me what im to look for  for law to be sure when it says law on the back open it and look inside for marriageread every word of itand then come here and explain it to me what you dont think your head is to be trusted to do such a simple thing as that  im certain it isnt said allan cant you help me  of course i can if you cant manage without me law may be hard but it cant be harder than music and i must and will satisfy my mind bring me all the books you can find on monday morningin a wheelbarrow if there are a good many of them and if you cant manage it in any other way  the result of this conversation was allans appearance in the park with a volume of blackstones commentaries under his arm on the fatal monday morning when miss gwilts written engagement of marriage was placed in midwinters hands here again in this as in all other human instances the widely discordant elements of the grotesque and the terrible were forced together by that subtle law of contrast which is one of the laws of mortal life amid all the thickening complications now impending over their headswith the shadow of meditated murder stealing toward one of them already from the lurkingplace that hid miss gwiltthe two sat down unconscious of the future with the book between them and applied themselves to the study of the law of marriage with a grave resolution to understand it which in two such students was nothing less than a burlesque in itself   find the place said neelie as soon as they were comfortably established we must manage this by what they call a division of labor you shall read and ill take notes  she produced forthwith a smart little pocketbook and pencil and opened the book in the middle where there was a blank page on the right hand and the left at the top of the righthand page she wrote the word good at the top of the lefthand page she wrote the word bad good means where the law is on our side she explained and bad means where the law is against us we will have good and bad opposite each other all down the two pages and when we get to the bottom well add them up and act accordingly they say girls have no heads for business havent they dont look at melook at blackstone and begin  would you mind giving one a kiss first asked allan  i should mind it very much in our serious situation when we have both got to exert our intellects i wonder you can ask for such a thing  thats why i asked for it said the unblushing allan i feel as if it would clear my head  oh if it would clear your head thats quite another thing i must clear your head of course at any sacrifice only one mind she whispered coquettishly and pray be careful of blackstone or youll lose the place  there was a pause in the conversation blackstone and the pocketbook both rolled on the ground together  if this happens again said neelie picking up the pocketbook with her eyes and her complexion at their brightest and best i shall sit with my back to you for the rest of the morning will you go on  allan found his place for the second time and fell headlong into the bottomless abyss of the english law  page 280 he began law of husband and wife heres a bit i dont understand to begin with it may be observed generally that the law considers marriage in the light of a contract what does that mean i thought a contract was the sort of a thing a builder signs when he promises to have the workmen out of the house in a given time and when the time comes as my poor mother used to say the workmen never go  is there nothing about love asked neelie look a little lower down  not a word he sticks to his confounded contract all the way through  then hes a brute go on to something else thats more in our way  heres a bit thats more in our way incapacities if any persons under legal incapacities come together it is a meretricious and not a matrimonial union blackstones a good one at long words isnt he i wonder what he means by meretricious the first of these legal disabilities is a prior marriage and having another husband or wife living  stop said neelie i must make a note of that she gravely made her first entry on the page headed good as follows i have no husband and allan has no wife we are both entirely unmarried at the present time  all right so far remarked allan looking over her shoulder  go on said neelie what next  the next disability proceeded allan is want of age the age for consent to matrimony is fourteen in males and twelve in females come cried allan cheerfully blackstone begins early enough at any rate  neelie was too businesslike to make any other remark on her side than the necessary remark in the pocketbook she made another entry under the head of good i am old enough to consent and so is allan too go on resumed neelie looking over the readers shoulder never mind all that prosing of blackstones about the husband being of years of discretion and the wife under twelve abominable wretch the wife under twelve skip to the third incapacity if there is one  the third incapacity allan went on is want of reason  neelie immediately made a third entry on the side of good allan and i are both perfectly reasonable skip to the next page  allan skipped a fourth incapacity is in respect of proximity of relationship  a fourth entry followed instantly on the cheering side of the pocketbook he loves me and i love himwithout our being in the slightest degree related to each other any more asked neelie tapping her chin impatiently with the end of the pencil  plenty more rejoined allan all in hieroglyphics look here marriage acts 4 geo iv c 76 and 6 and 7 will iv c 85 q blackstones intellect seems to be wandering here shall we take another skip and see if he picks himself up again on the next page  wait a little said neelie whats that i see in the middle she read for a minute in silence over allans shoulder and suddenly clasped her hands in despair i knew i was right she exclaimed oh heavens here it is  where asked allan i see nothing about languishing in prison and cropping a fellows hair close to his head unless its in the hieroglyphics is 4 geo iv short for lock him up and does c 85 q mean send for the haircutter  pray be serious remonstrated neelie we are both sitting on a volcano there she said pointing to the place read it if anything can bring you to a proper sense of our situation that will  allan cleared his throat and neelie held the point of her pencil ready on the depressing side of the accountotherwise the bad page of the pocketbook  and as it is the policy of our law allan began to prevent the marriage of persons under the age of twentyone without the consent of parents and guardiansneelie made her first entry on the side of bad im only seventeen next birthday and circumstances forbid me to confide my attachment to papait is provided that in the case of the publication of banns of a person under twentyone not being a widower or widow who are deemed emancipatedneelie made another entry on the depressing side allan is not a widower and i am not a widow consequently we are neither of us emancipatedif the parent or guardian openly signifies his dissent at the time the banns are publishedwhich papa would be certain to dosuch publication would be void ill take breath here if youll allow me said allan blackstone might put it in shorter sentences i think if he cant put it in fewer words cheer up neelie there must be other ways of marrying besides this roundabout way that ends in a publication and a void infernal gibberish i could write better english myself  we are not at the end of it yet said neelie the void is nothing to what is to come  whatever it is rejoined allan well treat it like a dose of physicwell take it at once and be done with it he went on reading and no license to marry without banns shall be granted unless oath shall be first made by one of the parties that he or she believes that there is no impediment of kindred or alliancewell i can take my oath of that with a safe conscience what next and one of the said parties must for the space of fifteen days immediately preceding such license have had his or her usual place of abode within the parish or chapelry within which such marriage is to be solemnized chapelry id live fifteen days in a dogkennel with the greatest pleasure i say neelie all this seems like plain sailing enough what are you shaking your head about go on and i shall see oh all right ill go on here we are and where one of the said parties not being a widower or widow shall be under the age of twentyone years oath must first be made that the consent of the person or persons whose consent is required has been obtained or that there is no person having authority to give such consent the consent required by this act is that of the father at those last formidable words allan came to a full stop the consent of the father he repeated with all needful seriousness of look and manner i couldnt exactly swear to that could i  neelie answered in expressive silence she handed him the pocketbook with the final entry completed on the side of bad in these terms our marriage is impossible unless allan commits perjury  the lovers looked at each other across the insuperable obstacle of blackstone in speechless dismay  shut up the book said neelie resignedly i have no doubt we should find the police and the prison and the haircuttingall punishments for perjury exactly as i told youif we looked at the next page but we neednt trouble ourselves to look we have found out quite enough already its all over with us i must go to school on saturday and you must manage to forget me as soon as you can perhaps we may meet in afterlife and you may be a widower and i may be a widow and the cruel law may consider us emancipated when its too late to be of the slightest use by that time no doubt i shall be old and ugly and you will naturally have ceased to care about me and it will all end in the grave and the sooner the better goodby concluded neelie rising mournfully with the tears in her eyes its only prolonging our misery to stop here unlessunless you have anything to propose  ive got something to propose cried the headlong allan its an entirely new idea would you mind trying the blacksmith at gretna green  no earthly consideration answered neelie indignantly would induce me to be married by a blacksmith  dont be offended pleaded allan i meant it for the best lots of people in our situation have tried the blacksmith and found him quite as good as a clergyman and a most amiable man i believe into the bargain never mind we must try another string to our bow  we havent got another to try said neelie  take my word for it persisted allan stoutly there must be ways and means of circumventing blackstone without perjury if we only knew of them its a matter of law and we must consult somebody in the profession i dare say its a risk but nothing venture nothing have what do you say to young pedgift hes a thorough good fellow im sure we could trust young pedgift to keep our secret  not for worlds exclaimed neelie you may be willing to trust your secrets to the vulgar little wretch i wont have him trusted with mine i hate him no she concluded with a mounting color and a peremptory stamp of her foot on the grass i positively forbid you to take any of the thorpe ambrose people into your confidence they would instantly suspect me and it would be all over the place in a moment my attachment may be an unhappy one remarked neelie with her handkerchief to her eyes and papa may nip it in the bud but i wont have it profaned by the town gossip  hush hush said allan i wont say a word at thorpe ambrose i wont indeed he paused and considered for a moment theres another way he burst out brightening up on the instant weve got the whole week before us ill tell you what ill do ill go to london  there was a sudden rustlingheard neither by one nor the otheramong the trees behind them that screened miss gwilt one more of the difficulties in her way the difficulty of getting allan to london now promised to be removed by an act of allans own will  to london repeated neelie looking up in astonishment  to london reiterated allan thats far enough away from thorpe ambrose surely wait a minute and dont forget that this is a question of law very well i know some lawyers in london who managed all my business for me when i first came in for this property they are just the men to consult and if they decline to be mixed up in it theres their head clerk who is one of the best fellows i ever met with in my life i asked him to go yachting with me i remember and though he couldnt go he said he felt the obligation all the same thats the man to help us blackstones a mere infant to him dont say its absurd dont say its exactly like me do pray hear me out i wont breathe your name or your fathers ill describe you as a young lady to whom i am devotedly attached and if my friend the clerk asks where you live ill say the north of scotland or the west of ireland or the channel islands or anywhere else you like my friend the clerk is a total stranger to thorpe ambrose and everybody in it which is one recommendation and in five minutes time hed put me up to what to do which is another if you only knew him hes one of those extraordinary men who appear once or twice in a centurythe sort of man who wont allow you to make a mistake if you try all i have got to say to him putting it short is my dear fellow i want to be privately married without perjury all he has got to say to me putting it short is you must do soandso and soandso and you must be careful to avoid this that and the other i have nothing in the world to do but to follow his directions and you have nothing in the world to do but what the bride always does when the bridegroom is ready and willing his arm stole round neelies waist and his lips pointed the moral of the last sentence with that inarticulate eloquence which is so uniformly successful in persuading a woman against her will  all neelies meditated objections dwindled in spite of her to one feeble little question suppose i allow you to go allan she whispered toying nervously with the stud in the bosom of his shirt shall you be very long away  ill be off today said allan by the eleven oclock train and ill be back tomorrow if i and my friend the clerk can settle it all in time if not by wednesday at latest  youll write to me every day pleaded neelie clinging a little closer to him i shall sink under the suspense if you dont promise to write to me every day  allan promised to write twice a day if she likedletterwriting which was such an effort to other men was no effort to him  and mind whatever those people may say to you in london proceeded neelie i insist on your coming back for me i positively decline to run away unless you promise to fetch me  allan promised for the second time on his sacred word of honor and at the full compass of his voice but neelie was not satisfied even yet she reverted to first principles and insisted on knowing whether allan was quite sure he loved her allan called heaven to witness how sure he was and got another question directly for his pains could he solemnly declare that he would never regret taking neelie away from home allan called heaven to witness again louder than ever all to no purpose the ravenous female appetite for tender protestations still hungered for more i know what will happen one of these days persisted neelie you will see some other girl who is prettier than i am and you will wish you had married her instead of me  as allan opened his lips for a final outburst of asseveration the stable clock at the great house was faintly audible in the distance striking the hour neelie started guiltily it was breakfasttime at the cottagein other words time to take leave at the last moment her heart went back to her father and her head sank on allans bosom as she tried to say goodby papa has always been so kind to me allan she whispered holding him back tremulously when he turned to leave her it seems so guilty and so heartless to go away from him and be married in secret oh do do think before you really go to london is there no way of making him a little kinder and juster to you the question was useless the majors resolutely unfavorable reception of allans letter rose in neelies memory and answered her as the words passed her lips with a girls impulsiveness she pushed allan away before he could speak and signed to him impatiently to go the conflict of contending emotions which she had mastered thus far burst its way outward in spite of her after he had waved his hand for the last time and had disappeared in the depths of the dell when she turned from the place on her side her longrestrained tears fell freely at last and made the lonely way back to the cottage the dimmest prospect that neelie had seen for many a long day past  as she hurried homeward the leaves parted behind her and miss gwilt stepped softly into the open space she stood there in triumph tall beautiful and resolute her lovely color brightened while she watched neelies retreating figure hastening lightly away from her over the grass  cry you little fool she said with her quiet clear tones and her steady smile of contempt cry as you have never cried yet you have seen the last of your sweetheart     xii a scandal at the station  an hour later the landlady at miss gwilts lodgings was lost in astonishment and the clamorous tongues of the children were in a state of ungovernable revolt unforeseen circumstances had suddenly obliged the tenant of the first floor to terminate the occupation of her apartments and to go to london that day by the eleven oclock train  please to have a fly at the door at halfpast ten said miss gwilt as the amazed landlady followed her upstairs and excuse me you good creature if i beg and pray not to be disturbed till the fly comes once inside the room she locked the door and then opened her writingdesk now for my letter to the major she said how shall i word it  a moments consideration apparently decided her searching through her collection of pens she carefully selected the worst that could be found and began the letter by writing the date of the day on a soiled sheet of notepaper in crooked clumsy characters which ended in a blot made purposely with the feather of the pen pausing sometimes to think a little sometimes to make another blot she completed the letter in these words   hond sirit is on my conscience to tell you something which i think you ought to know you ought to know of the goingson of miss your daughter with young mister armadale i wish you to make sure and what is more i advise you to be quick about it if she is going the way you want her to go when she takes her morning walk before breakfast i scorn to make mischief where there is true love on both sides but i dont think the young man means truly by miss what i mean is i think miss only has his fancy another person who shall be nameless betwixt us has his true heart please to pardon my not putting my name i am only a humble person and it might get me into trouble this is all at present dear sir from yours  a wellwisher   there said miss gwilt as she folded the letter up if i had been a professed novelist i could hardly have written more naturally in the character of a servant than that she wrote the necessary address to major milroy looked admiringly for the last time at the coarse and clumsy writing which her own delicate hand had produced and rose to post the letter herself before she entered next on the serious business of packing up curious she thought when the letter had been posted and she was back again making her traveling preparations in her own room here i am running headlong into a frightful riskand i never was in better spirits in my life  the boxes were ready when the fly was at the door and miss gwilt was equipped as becomingly as usual in her neat traveling costume the thick veil which she was accustomed to wear in london appeared on her country straw bonnet for the first time one meets such rude men occasionally in the railway she said to the landlady and though i dress quietly my hair is so very remarkable she was a little paler than usual but she had never been so sweettempered and engaging so gracefully cordial and friendly as now when the moment of departure had come the simple people of the house were quite moved at taking leave of her she insisted on shaking hands with the landlordon speaking to him in her prettiest way and sunning him in her brightest smiles come she said to the landlady you have been so kind you have been so like a mother to me you must give me a kiss at parting she embraced the children all together in a lump with a mixture of humor and tenderness delightful to see and left a shilling among them to buy a cake if i was only rich enough to make it a sovereign she whispered to the mother how glad i should be the awkward lad who ran on errands stood waiting at the fly door he was clumsy he was frowsy he had a gaping mouth and a turnup nose but the ineradicable female delight in being charming accepted him for all that in the character of a last chance you dear dingy john she said kindly at the carriage door i am so poor i have only sixpence to give youwith my very best wishes take my advice johngrow to be a fine man and find yourself a nice sweetheart thank you a thousand times she gave him a friendly little pat on the cheek with two of her gloved fingers and smiled and nodded and got into the fly  armadale next she said to herself as the carriage drove off  allans anxiety not to miss the train had brought him to the station in better time than usual after taking his ticket and putting his portmanteau under the porters charge he was pacing the platform and thinking of neelie when he heard the rustling of a ladys dress behind him and turning round to look found himself face to face with miss gwilt  there was no escaping her this time the station wall was on his right hand and the line was on his left a tunnel was behind him and miss gwilt was in front inquiring in her sweetest tones whether mr armadale was going to london  allan colored scarlet with vexation and surprise there he was obviously waiting for the train and there was his portmanteau close by with his name on it already labeled for london what answer but the true one could he make after that could he let the train go without him and lose the precious hours so vitally important to neelie and himself impossible allan helplessly confirmed the printed statement on his portmanteau and heartily wished himself at the other end of the world as he said the words  how very fortunate rejoined miss gwilt i am going to london too might i ask you mr armadale as you seem to be quite alone to be my escort on the journey  allan looked at the little assembly of travelers and travelers friends collected on the platform near the bookingoffice door they were all thorpe ambrose people he was probably known by sight and miss gwilt was probably known by sight to every one of them in sheer desperation hesitating more awkwardly than ever he produced his cigar case i should be delighted he said with an embarrassment which was almost an insult under the circumstances but iim what the people who get sick over a cigar call a slave to smoking  i delight in smoking said miss gwilt with undiminished vivacity and good humor its one of the privileges of the men which i have always envied im afraid mr armadale you must think i am forcing myself on you it certainly looks like it the real truth is i want particularly to say a word to you in private about mr midwinter  the train came up at the same moment setting midwinter out of the question the common decencies of politeness left allan no alternative but to submit after having been the cause of her leaving her situation at major milroys after having pointedly avoided her only a few days since on the highroad to have declined going to london in the same carriage with miss gwilt would have been an act of downright brutality which it was simply impossible to commit damn her said allan internally as he handed his traveling companion into an empty carriage officiously placed at his disposal before all the people at the station by the guard you shant be disturbed sir the man whispered confidentially with a smile and a touch of his hat allan could have knocked him down with the utmost pleasure stop he said from the window i dont want the carriage it was useless the guard was out of hearing the whistle blew and the train started for london  the select assembly of travelers friends left behind on the platform congregated in a circle on the spot with the stationmaster in the center  the stationmasterotherwise mr mackwas a popular character in the neighborhood he possessed two social qualifications which invariably impress the average english mindhe was an old soldier and he was a man of few words the conclave on the platform insisted on taking his opinion before it committed itself positively to an opinion of its own a brisk fire of remarks exploded as a matter of course on all sides but everybodys view of the subject ended interrogatively in a question aimed pointblank at the stationmasters ears  shes got him hasnt she shell come back mrs armadale wont she hed better have stuck to miss milroy hadnt he miss milroy stuck to him she paid him a visit at the great house didnt she nothing of the sort its a shame to take the girls character away she was caught in a thunderstorm close by he was obliged to give her shelter and shes never been near the place since miss gwilts been there if you like with no thunderstorm to force her in and miss gwilts off with him to london in a carriage all to themselves eh mr mack ah hes a soft one that armadale with all his money to take up with a redhaired woman a good eight or nine years older than he is shes thirty if shes a day thats what i say mr mack what do you say older or younger shell rule the roast at thorpe ambrose and i say for the sake of the place and for the sake of trade lets make the best of it and mr mack as a man of the world sees it in the same light as i do dont you sir  gentlemen said the stationmaster with his abrupt military accent and his impenetrable military manner shes a devilish fine woman and when i was mr armadales age its my opinion if her fancy had laid that way she might have married me  with that expression of opinion the stationmaster wheeled to the right and intrenched himself impregnably in the stronghold of his own office  the citizens of thorpe ambrose looked at the closed door and gravely shook their heads mr mack had disappointed them no opinion which openly recognizes the frailty of human nature is ever a popular opinion with mankind its as good as saying that any of us might have married her if we had been mr armadales age such was the general impression on the minds of the conclave when the meeting had been adjourned and the members were leaving the station  the last of the party to go was a slow old gentleman with a habit of deliberately looking about him pausing at the door this observant person stared up the platform and down the platform and discovered in the latter direction standing behind an angle of the wall an elderly man in black who had escaped the notice of everybody up to that time why bless my soul said the old gentleman advancing inquisitively by a step at a time it cant be mr bashwood  it was mr bashwoodmr bashwood whose constitutional curiosity had taken him privately to the station bent on solving the mystery of allans sudden journey to londonmr bashwood who had seen and heard behind his angle in the wall what everybody else had seen and heard and who appeared to have been impressed by it in no ordinary way he stood stiffly against the wall like a man petrified with one hand pressed on his bare head and the other holding his hathe stood with a dull flush on his face and a dull stare in his eyes looking straight into the black depths of the tunnel outside the station as if the train to london had disappeared in it but the moment before  is your head bad asked the old gentleman take my advice go home and lie down  mr bashwood listened mechanically with his usual attention and answered mechanically with his usual politeness  yes sir he said in a low lost tone like a man between dreaming and waking ill go home and lie down  thats right rejoined the old gentleman making for the door and take a pill mr bashwoodtake a pill  five minutes later the porter charged with the business of locking up the station found mr bashwood still standing bareheaded against the wall and still looking straight into the black depths of the tunnel as if the train to london had disappeared in it but a moment since  come sir said the porter i must lock up are you out of sorts anything wrong with your inside try a drop of ginandbitters  yes said mr bashwood answering the porter exactly as he had answered the old gentleman ill try a drop of ginandbitters  the porter took him by the arm and led him out youll get it there said the man pointing confidentially to a publichouse and youll get it good  i shall get it there echoed mr bashwood still mechanically repeating what was said to him and i shall get it good  his will seemed to be paralyzed his actions depended absolutely on what other people told him to do he took a few steps in the direction of the publichouse hesitated staggered and caught at the pillar of one of the station lamps near him  the porter followed and took him by the arm once more  why youve been drinking already exclaimed the man with a suddenly quickened interest in mr bashwoods case what was it beer  mr bashwood in his low lost tones echoed the last word  it was close on the porters dinnertime but when the lower orders of the english people believe they have discovered an intoxicated man their sympathy with him is boundless the porter let his dinner take its chance and carefully assisted mr bashwood to reach the publichouse ginandbitters will put you on your legs again whispered this samaritan setterright of the alcoholic disasters of mankind  if mr bashwood had really been intoxicated the effect of the porters remedy would have been marvelous indeed almost as soon as the glass was emptied the stimulant did its work the longweakened nervous system of the deputysteward prostrated for the moment by the shock that had fallen on it rallied again like a weary horse under the spur the dull flush on his cheeks the dull stare in his eyes disappeared simultaneously after a momentary effort he recovered memory enough of what had passed to thank the porter and to ask whether he would take something himself the worthy creature instantly accepted a dose of his own remedyin the capacity of a preventiveand went home to dinner as only those men can go home who are physically warmed by ginandbitters and morally elevated by the performance of a good action  still strangely abstracted but conscious now of the way by which he went mr bashwood left the publichouse a few minutes later in his turn he walked on mechanically in his dreary black garments moving like a blot on the white surface of the sunbrightened road as midwinter had seen him move in the early days at thorpe ambrose when they had first met arrived at the point where he had to choose between the way that led into the town and the way that led to the great house he stopped incapable of deciding and careless apparently even of making the attempt ill be revenged on her he whispered to himself still absorbed in his jealous frenzy of rage against the woman who had deceived him ill be revenged on her he repeated in louder tones if i spend every halfpenny ive got  some women of the disorderly sort passing on their way to the town heard him ah you old brute they called out with the measureless license of their class whatever she did she served you right  the coarseness of the voices startled him whether he comprehended the words or not he shrank away from more interruption and more insult into the quieter road that led to the great house  at a solitary place by the wayside he stopped and sat down he took off his hat and lifted his youthful wig a little from his bald old head and tried desperately to get beyond the one immovable conviction which lay on his mind like leadthe conviction that miss gwilt had been purposely deceiving him from the first it was useless no effort would free him from that one dominant impression and from the one answering idea that it had evokedthe idea of revenge he got up again and put on his hat and walked rapidly forward a little waythen turned without knowing why and slowly walked back again if i had only dressed a little smarter said the poor wretch helplessly if i had only been a little bolder with her she might have overlooked my being an old man the angry fit returned on him he clinched his clammy trembling hands and shook them fiercely in the empty air ill be revenged on her he reiterated ill be revenged on her if i spend every halfpenny ive got it was terribly suggestive of the hold she had taken on him that his vindictive sense of injury could not get far enough away from her to reach the man whom he believed to be his rival even yet in his rage as in his love he was absorbed body and soul by miss gwilt  in a moment more the noise of running wheels approaching from behind startled him he turned and looked round there was mr pedgift the elder rapidly overtaking him in the gig just as mr pedgift had overtaken him once already on that former occasion when he had listened under the window at the great house and when the lawyer had bluntly charged him with feeling a curiosity about miss gwilt  in an instant the inevitable association of ideas burst on his mind the opinion of miss gwilt which he had heard the lawyer express to allan at parting flashed back into his memory side by side with mr pedgifts sarcastic approval of anything in the way of inquiry which his own curiosity might attempt i may be even with her yet he thought if mr pedgift will help mestop sir he called out desperately as the gig came up with him if you please sir i want to speak to you  pedgift senior slackened the pace of his fasttrotting mare without pulling up come to the office in half an hour he said im busy now without waiting for an answer without noticing mr bashwoods bow he gave the mare the rein again and was out of sight in another minute  mr bashwood sat down once more in a shady place by the roadside he appeared to be incapable of feeling any slight but the one unpardonable slight put upon him by miss gwilt he not only declined to resent he even made the best of mr pedgifts unceremonious treatment of him half an hour he said resignedly time enough to compose myself and i want time very kind of mr pedgift though he mightnt have meant it  the sense of oppression in his head forced him once again to remove his hat he sat with it on his lap deep in thought his face bent low and the wavering fingers of one hand drumming absently on the crown of the hat if mr pedgift the elder seeing him as he sat now could only have looked a little way into the future the monotonously drumming hand of the deputysteward might have been strong enough feeble as it was to stop the lawyer by the roadside it was the worn weary miserable old hand of a worn weary miserable old man but it was for all that to use the language of mr pedgifts own parting prediction to allan the hand that was now destined to let the light in on miss gwilt     xiii an old mans heart  punctual to the moment when the half hours interval had expired mr bashwood was announced at the office as waiting to see mr pedgift by special appointment  the lawyer looked up from his papers with an air of annoyance he had totally forgotten the meeting by the roadside see what he wants said pedgift senior to pedgift junior working in the same room with him and if its nothing of importance put it off to some other time  pedgift junior swiftly disappeared and swiftly returned  well asked the father  well answered the son he is rather more shaky and unintelligible than usual i can make nothing out of him except that he persists in wanting to see you my own idea pursued pedgift junior with his usual sardonic gravity is that he is going to have a fit and that he wishes to acknowledge your uniform kindness to him by obliging you with a private view of the whole proceeding  pedgift senior habitually matched everybodyhis son includedwith their own weapons be good enough to remember augustus he rejoined that my room is not a court of law a bad joke is not invariably followed by roars of laughter here let mr bashwood come in  mr bashwood was introduced and pedgift junior withdrew you mustnt bleed him sir whispered the incorrigible joker as he passed the back of his fathers chair hotwater bottles to the soles of his feet and a mustard plaster on the pit of his stomachthats the modern treatment  sit down bashwood said pedgift senior when they were alone and dont forget that times money out with it whatever it is at the quickest possible rate and in the fewest possible words  these preliminary directions bluntly but not at all unkindly spoken rather increased than diminished the painful agitation under which mr bashwood was suffering he stammered more helplessly he trembled more continuously than usual as he made his little speech of thanks and added his apologies at the end for intruding on his patron in business hours  everybody in the place mr pedgift sir knows your time is valuable oh dear yes oh dear yes most valuable most valuable excuse me sir im coming out with it your goodnessor rather your businessno your goodness gave me half an hour to waitand i have thought of what i had to say and prepared it and put it short having got as far as that he stopped with a pained bewildered look he had put it away in his memory and now when the time came he was too confused to find it and there was mr pedgift mutely waiting his face and manner expressive alike of that silent sense of the value of his own time which every patient who has visited a great doctor every client who has consulted a lawyer in large practice knows so well have you heard the news sir stammered mr bashwood shifting his ground in despair and letting the uppermost idea in his mind escape him simply because it was the one idea in him that was ready to come out  does it concern me asked pedgift senior mercilessly brief and mercilessly straight in coming to the point  it concerns a lady sirno not a ladya young man i ought to say in whom you used to feel some interest oh mr pedgift sir what do you think mr armadale and miss gwilt have gone up to london together todayalone siralone in a carriage reserved for their two selves do you think hes going to marry her do you really think like the rest of them hes going to marry her  he put the question with a sudden flush in his face and a sudden energy in his manner his sense of the value of the lawyers time his conviction of the greatness of the lawyers condescension his constitutional shyness and timidityall yielded together to his one overwhelming interest in hearing mr pedgifts answer he was loud for the first time in his life in putting the question  after my experience of mr armadale said the lawyer instantly hardening in look and manner i believe him to be infatuated enough to marry miss gwilt a dozen times over if miss gwilt chose to ask him your news doesnt surprise me in the least bashwood im sorry for him i can honestly say that though he has set my advice at defiance and im more sorry still he continued softening again as his mind reverted to his interview with neelie under the trees of the parkim more sorry still for another person who shall be nameless but what have i to do with all this and what on earth is the matter with you he resumed noticing for the first time the abject misery in mr bashwoods manner the blank despair in mr bashwoods face which his answer had produced are you ill is there something behind the curtain that youre afraid to bring out i dont understand it have you come herehere in my private room in business hourswith nothing to tell me but that young armadale has been fool enough to ruin his prospects for life why i foresaw it all weeks since and what is more i as good as told him so at the last conversation i had with him in the great house  at those last words mr bashwood suddenly rallied the lawyers passing reference to the great house had led him back in a moment to the purpose that he had in view  thats it sir he said eagerly thats what i wanted to speak to you about thats what ive been preparing in my mind mr pedgift sir the last time you were at the great house when you came away in your gig youyou overtook me on the drive  i dare say i did remarked pedgift resignedly my mare happens to be a trifle quicker on her legs than you are on yours bashwood go on go on we shall come in time i suppose to what you are driving at  you stopped and spoke to me sir proceeded mr bashwood advancing more and more eagerly to his end you said you suspected me of feeling some curiosity about miss gwilt and you told me i remember the exact words siryou told me to gratify my curiosity by all means for you didnt object to it  pedgift senior began for the first time to look interested in hearing more  i remember something of the sort he replied and i also remember thinking it rather remarkable that you should happenwe wont put it in any more offensive wayto be exactly under mr armadales open window while i was talking to him it might have been accident of course but it looked rather more like curiosity i could only judge by appearances concluded pedgift pointing his sarcasm with a pinch of snuff and appearances bashwood were decidedly against you  i dont deny it sir i only mentioned the circumstance because i wished to acknowledge that i was curious and am curious about miss gwilt  why asked pedgift senior seeing something under the surface in mr bashwoods face and manner but utterly in the dark thus far as to what that something might be  there was silence for a moment the moment passed mr bashwood took the refuge usually taken by nervous unready men placed in his circumstances when they are at a loss for an answer he simply reiterated the assertion that he had just made i feel some curiosity sir he said with a strange mixture of doggedness and timidity about miss gwilt  there was another moment of silence in spite of his practiced acuteness and knowledge of the world the lawyer was more puzzled than ever the case of mr bashwood presented the one human riddle of all others which he was least qualified to solve though year after year witnesses in thousands and thousands of cases the remorseless disinheriting of nearest and dearest relations the unnatural breakingup of sacred family ties the deplorable severance of old and firm friendships due entirely to the intense selfabsorption which the sexual passion can produce when it enters the heart of an old man the association of love with infirmity and gray hairs arouses nevertheless all the world over no other idea than the idea of extravagant improbability or extravagant absurdity in the general mind if the interview now taking place in mr pedgifts consultingroom had taken place at his dinnertable instead when wine had opened his mind to humorous influences it is possible that he might by this time have suspected the truth but in his business hours pedgift senior was in the habit of investigating mens motives seriously from the business point of view and he was on that very account simply incapable of conceiving any improbability so startling any absurdity so enormous as the absurdity and improbability of mr bashwoods being in love  some men in the lawyers position would have tried to force their way to enlightenment by obstinately repeating the unanswered question pedgift senior wisely postponed the question until he had moved the conversation on another step well he resumed let us say you feel a curiosity about miss gwilt what next  the palms of mr bashwoods hands began to moisten under the influence of his agitation as they had moistened in the past days when he had told the story of his domestic sorrows to midwinter at the great house once more he rolled his handkerchief into a ball and dabbed it softly to and fro from one hand to the other  may i ask if i am right sir he began in believing that you have a very unfavorable opinion of miss gwilt you are quite convinced i think  my good fellow interrupted pedgift senior why need you be in any doubt about it you were under mr armadales open window all the while i was talking to him and your ears i presume were not absolutely shut  mr bashwood showed no sense of the interruption the little sting of the lawyers sarcasm was lost in the nobler pain that wrung him from the wound inflicted by miss gwilt  you are quite convinced i think sir he resumed that there are circumstances in this ladys past life which would be highly discreditable to her if they were discovered at the present time  the window was open at the great house bashwood and your ears i presume were not absolutely shut  still impenetrable to the sting mr bashwood persisted more obstinately than ever  unless i am greatly mistaken he said your long experience in such things has even suggested to you sir that miss gwilt might turn out to be known to the police  pedgift seniors patience gave way you have been over ten minutes in this room he broke out can you or can you not tell me in plain english what you want  in plain englishwith the passion that had transformed him the passion which in miss gwilts own words had made a man of him burning in his haggard cheeksmr bashwood met the challenge and faced the lawyer as the worried sheep faces the dog on his own ground  i wish to say sir he answered that your opinion in this matter is my opinion too i believe there is something wrong in miss gwilts past life which she keeps concealed from everybody and i want to be the man who knows it  pedgift senior saw his chance and instantly reverted to the question that he had postponed why he asked for the second time  for the second time mr bashwood hesitated  could he acknowledge that he had been mad enough to love her and mean enough to be a spy for her could he say she has deceived me from the first and she has deserted me now her object is served after robbing me of my happiness robbing me of my honor robbing me of my last hope left in life she has gone from me forever and left me nothing but my old mans longing slow and sly and strong and changeless for revenge revenge that i may have if i can poison her success by dragging her frailties into the public view revenge that i will buy for what is gold or what is life to me with the last farthing of my hoarded money and the last drop of my stagnant blood could he say that to the man who sat waiting for his answer no he could only crush it down and be silent  the lawyers expression began to harden once more  one of us must speak out he said and as you evidently wont i will i can only account for this extraordinary anxiety of yours to make yourself acquainted with miss gwilts secrets in one of two ways your motive is either an excessively mean one no offense bashwood i am only putting the case or an excessively generous one after my experience of your honest character and your creditable conduct it is only your due that i should absolve you at once of the mean motive i believe you are as incapable as i ami can say no moreof turning to mercenary account any discoveries you might make to miss gwilts prejudice in miss gwilts past life shall i go on any further or would you prefer on second thoughts opening your mind frankly to me of your own accord  i should prefer not interrupting you sir said mr bashwood  as you please pursued pedgift senior having absolved you of the mean motive i come to the generous motive next it is possible that you are an unusually grateful man and it is certain that mr armadale has been remarkably kind to you after employing you under mr midwinter in the stewards office he has had confidence enough in your honesty and your capacity now his friend has left him to put his business entirely and unreservedly in your hands its not in my experience of human naturebut it may be possible neverthelessthat you are so gratefully sensible of that confidence and so gratefully interested in your employers welfare that you cant see him in his friendless position going straight to his own disgrace and ruin without making an effort to save him to put it in two words is it your idea that mr armadale might be prevented from marrying miss gwilt if he could be informed in time of her real character and do you wish to be the man who opens his eyes to the truth if that is the case  he stopped in astonishment acting under some uncontrollable impulse mr bashwood had started to his feet he stood with his withered face lit up by a sudden irradiation from within which made him look younger than his age by a good twenty yearshe stood gasping for breath enough to speak and gesticulated entreatingly at the lawyer with both hands  say it again sir he burst out eagerly recovering his breath before pedgift senior had recovered his surprise the question about mr armadale sironly once moreonly once more mr pedgift please  with his practiced observation closely and distrustfully at work on mr bashwood s face pedgift senior motioned to him to sit down again and put the question for the second time  do i think said mr bashwood repeating the sense but not the words of the question that mr armadale might be parted from miss gwilt if she could be shown to him as she really is yes sir and do i wish to be the man who does it yes sir yes sir yes sir  its rather strange remarked the lawyer looking at him more and more distrustfully that you should be so violently agitated simply because my question happens to have hit the mark  the question happened to have hit a mark which pedgift little dreamed of it had released mr bashwoods mind in an instant from the dead pressure of his one dominant idea of revenge and had shown him a purpose to be achieved by the discovery of miss gwilts secrets which had never occurred to him till that moment the marriage which he had blindly regarded as inevitable was a marriage that might be stoppednot in allans interests but in his ownand the woman whom he believed that he had lost might yet in spite of circumstances be a woman won his brain whirled as he thought of it his own roused resolution almost daunted him by its terrible incongruity with all the familiar habits of his mind and all the customary proceedings of his life  finding his last remark unanswered pedgift senior considered a little before he said anything more  one thing is clear reasoned the lawyer with himself his true motive in this matter is a motive which he is afraid to avow my question evidently offered him a chance of misleading me and he has accepted it on the spot thats enough for me if i was mr armadales lawyer the mystery might be worth investigating as things are its no interest of mine to hunt mr bashwood from one lie to another till i run him to earth at last i have nothing whatever to do with it and i shall leave him free to follow his own roundabout courses in his own roundabout way having arrived at that conclusion pedgift senior pushed back his chair and rose briskly to terminate the interview  dont be alarmed bashwood he began the subject of our conversation is a subject exhausted so far as i am concerned i have only a few last words to say and its a habit of mine as you know to say my last words on my legs whatever else i may be in the dark about i have made one discovery at any rate i have found out what you really want with meat last you want me to help you  if you would be so very very kind sir stammered mr bashwood if you would only give me the great advantage of your opinion and advice  wait a bit bashwood we will separate those two things if you please a lawyer may offer an opinion like any other man but when a lawyer gives his adviceby the lord harry sir its professional youre welcome to my opinion in this matter i have disguised it from nobody i believe there have been events in miss gwilts career which if they could be discovered would even make mr armadale infatuated as he is afraid to marry hersupposing of course that he really is going to marry her for though the appearances are in favor of it so far it is only an assumption after all as to the mode of proceeding by which the blots on this womans character might or might not be brought to light in timeshe may be married by license in a fortnight if she likesthat is a branch of the question on which i positively decline to enter it implies speaking in my character as a lawyer and giving you what i decline positively to give you my professional advice  oh sir dont say that pleaded mr bashwood dont deny me the great favor the inestimable advantage of your advice i have such a poor head mr pedgift i am so old and so slow sir and i get so sadly startled and worried when im thrown out of my ordinary ways its quite natural you should be a little impatient with me for taking up your timei know that time is money to a clever man like you would you excuse mewould you please excuse me if i venture to say that i have saved a little something a few pounds sir and being quite lonely with nobody dependent on me im sure i may spend my savings as i please blind to every consideration but the one consideration of propitiating mr pedgift he took out a dingy ragged old pocketbook and tried with trembling fingers to open it on the lawyers table  put your pocketbook back directly said pedgift senior richer men than you have tried that argument with me and have found that there is such a thing off the stage as a lawyer who is not to be bribed i will have nothing to do with the case under existing circumstances if you want to know why i beg to inform you that miss gwilt ceased to be professionally interesting to me on the day when i ceased to be mr armadales lawyer i may have other reasons besides which i dont think it necessary to mention the reason already given is explicit enough go your own way and take your responsibility on your own shoulders you may venture within reach of miss gwilts claws and come out again without being scratched time will show in the meanwhile i wish you goodmorningand i own to my shame that i never knew till today what a hero you were  this time mr bashwood felt the sting without another word of expostulation or entreaty without even saying goodmorning on his side he walked to the door opened it softly and left the room  the parting look in his face and the sudden silence that had fallen on him were not lost on pedgift senior bashwood will end badly said the lawyer shuffling his papers and returning impenetrably to his interrupted work  the change in mr bashwoods face and manner to something dogged and selfcontained was so startlingly uncharacteristic of him that it even forced itself on the notice of pedgift junior and the clerks as he passed through the outer office accustomed to make the old man their butt they took a boisterously comic view of the marked alteration in him deaf to the merciless raillery with which he was assailed on all sides he stopped opposite young pedgift and looking him attentively in the face said in a quiet absent manner like a man thinking aloud i wonder whether you would help me  open an account instantly said pedgift junior to the clerks in the name of mr bashwood place a chair for mr bashwood with a footstool close by in case he wants it supply me with a quire of extra doublewove satin paper and a gross of picked quills to take notes of mr bashwoods case and inform my father instantly that i am going to leave him and set up in business for myself on the strength of mr bashwoods patronage take a seat sir pray take a seat and express your feelings freely  still impenetrably deaf to the raillery of which he was the object mr bashwood waited until pedgift junior had exhausted himself and then turned quietly away  i ought to have known better he said in the same absent manner as before he is his fathers son all overhe would make game of me on my deathbed he paused a moment at the door mechanically brushing his hat with his hand and went out into the street  the bright sunshine dazzled his eyes the passing vehicles and footpassengers startled and bewildered him he shrank into a bystreet and put his hand over his eyes id better go home he thought and shut myself up and think about it in my own room  his lodging was in a small house in the poor quarter of the town he let himself in with his key and stole softly upstairs the one little room he possessed met him cruelly look round it where he might with silent memorials of miss gwilt on the chimneypiece were the flowers she had given him at various times all withered long since and all preserved on a little china pedestal protected by a glass shade on the wall hung a wretched colored print of a woman which he had caused to be nicely framed and glazed because there was a look in it that reminded him of her face in his clumsy old mahogany writingdesk were the few letters brief and peremptory which she had written to him at the time when he was watching and listening meanly at thorpe ambrose to please her and when turning his back on these he sat down wearily on his sofabedsteadthere hanging over one end of it was the gaudy cravat of blue satin which he had bought because she had told him she liked bright colors and which he had never yet had the courage to wear though he had taken it out morning after morning with the resolution to put it on habitually quiet in his actions habitually restrained in his language he now seized the cravat as if it was a living thing that could feel and flung it to the other end of the room with an oath  the time passed and still though his resolution to stand between miss gwilt and her marriage remained unbroken he was as far as ever from discovering the means which might lead him to his end the more he thought and thought of it the darker and the darker his course in the future looked to him  he rose again as wearily as he had sat down and went to his cupboard im feverish and thirsty he said a cup of tea may help me he opened his canister and measured out his small allowance of tea less carefully than usual even my own hands wont serve me today he thought as he scraped together the few grains of tea that he had spilled and put them carefully back in the canister  in that fine summer weather the one fire in the house was the kitchen fire he went downstairs for the boiling water with his teapot in his hand  nobody but the landlady was in the kitchen she was one of the many english matrons whose path through this world is a path of thorns and who take a dismal pleasure whenever the opportunity is afforded them in inspecting the scratched and bleeding feet of other people in a like condition with themselves her one vice was of the lighter sortthe vice of curiosity and among the many counterbalancing virtues she possessed was the virtue of greatly respecting mr bashwood as a lodger whose rent was regularly paid and whose ways were always quiet and civil from one years end to another  what did you please to want sir asked the landlady boiling water is it did you ever know the water boil mr bashwood when you wanted it did you ever see a sulkier fire than that ill put a stick or two in if youll wait a little and give me the chance dear dear me youll excuse my mentioning it sir but how poorly you do look today  the strain on mr bashwoods mind was beginning to tell something of the helplessness which he had shown at the station appeared again in his face and manner as he put his teapot on the kitchen table and sat down  im in trouble maam he said quietly and i find trouble gets harder to bear than it used to be  ah you may well say that groaned the landlady im ready for the undertaker mr bashwood when my time comes whatever you may be youre too lonely sir when youre in trouble its some helpthough not muchto shift a share of it off on another persons shoulders if your good lady had only been alive now sir what a comfort you would have found her wouldnt you  a momentary spasm of pain passed across mr bashwoods face the landlady had ignorantly recalled him to the misfortunes of his married life he had been long since forced to quiet her curiosity about his family affairs by telling her that he was a widower and that his domestic circumstances had not been happy ones but he had taken her no further into his confidence than this the sad story which he had related to midwinter of his drunken wife who had ended her miserable life in a lunatic asylum was a story which he had shrunk from confiding to the talkative woman who would have confided it in her turn to every one else in the house  what i always say to my husband when hes low sir pursued the landlady intent on the kettle is what would you do now sam without me when his temper dont get the better of him it will boil directly mr bashwood he says elizabeth i could do nothing when his temper does get the better of him he says i should try the publichouse missus and ill try it now ah ive got my troubles a man with grownup sons and daughters tippling in a publichouse i dont call to mind mr bashwood whether you ever had any sons and daughters and yet now i think of it i seem to fancy you said yes you had daughters sir werent they and ah dear dear to be sure all dead  i had one daughter maam said mr bashwood patientlyonly one who died before she was a year old  only one repeated the sympathizing landlady its as near boiling as it ever will be sir give me the teapot only one ah it comes heavier dont it when its an only child you said it was an only child i think didnt you sir  for a moment mr bashwood looked at the woman with vacant eyes and without attempting to answer her after ignorantly recalling the memory of the wife who had disgraced him she was now as ignorantly forcing him back on the miserable remembrance of the son who had ruined and deserted him for the first time since he had told his story to midwinter at their introductory interview in the great house his mind reverted once more to the bitter disappointment and disaster of the past again he thought of the bygone days when he had become security for his son and when that sons dishonesty had forced him to sell everything he possessed to pay the forfeit that was exacted when the forfeit was due i have a son maam he said becoming conscious that the landlady was looking at him in mute and melancholy surprise i did my best to help him forward in the world and he has behaved very badly to me  did he now rejoined the landlady with an appearance of the greatest interest behaved badly to youalmost broke your heart didnt he ah it will come home to him sooner or later dont you fear honor your father and mother wasnt put on mosess tables of stone for nothing mr bashwood where may he be and what is he doing now sir  the question was in effect almost the same as the question which midwinter had put when the circumstances had been described to him as mr bashwood had answered it on the former occasion so in nearly the same words he answered it now  my son is in london maam for all i know to the contrary he was employed when i last heard of him in no very creditable way at the private inquiry office  at those words he suddenly checked himself his face flushed his eyes brightened he pushed away the cup which had just been filled for him and rose from his seat the landlady started back a step there was something in her lodgers face that she had never seen in it before  i hope ive not offended you sir said the woman recovering her selfpossession and looking a little too ready to take offense on her side at a moments notice  far from it maam far from it he rejoined in a strangely eager hurried way i have just remembered somethingsomething very important i must go upstairsits a letter a letter a letter ill come back to my tea maam i beg your pardon im much obliged to you youve been very kindill say goodby if youll allow me for the present to the landladys amazement he cordially shook hands with her and made for the door leaving tea and teapot to take care of themselves  the moment he reached his own room he locked himself in for a little while he stood holding by the chimneypiece waiting to recover his breath the moment he could move again he opened his writingdesk on the table that for you mr pedgift and son he said with a snap of his fingers as he sat down ive got a son too  there was a knock at the doora knock soft considerate and confidential the anxious landlady wished to know whether mr bashwood was ill and begged to intimate for the second time that she earnestly trusted she had given him no offense  no no he called through the door im quite wellim writing maam im writingplease to excuse me shes a good woman shes an excellent woman he thought when the landlady had retired ill make her a little present my minds so unsettled i might never have thought of it but for her oh if my boy is at the office still oh if i can only write a letter that will make him pity me  he took up his pen and sat thinking anxiously thinking long before he touched the paper slowly with many patient pauses to think and think again and with more than ordinary care to make his writing legible he traced these lines   my dear jamesyou will be surprised i am afraid to see my handwriting pray dont suppose i am going to ask you for money or to reproach you for having sold me out of house and home when you forfeited your security and i had to pay i am willing and anxious to let bygones be bygones and to forget the past  it is in your power if you are still at the private inquiry office to do me a great service i am in sore anxiety and trouble on the subject of a person in whom i am interested the person is a lady please dont make game of me for confessing this if you can help it if you knew what i am now suffering i think you would be more inclined to pity than to make game of me  i would enter into particulars only i know your quick temper and i fear exhausting your patience perhaps it may be enough to say that i have reason to believe the ladys past life has not been a very creditable one and that i am interestedmore interested than words can tellin finding out what her life has really been and in making the discovery within a fortnight from the present time  though i know very little about the ways of business in an office like yours i can understand that without first having the ladys present address nothing can be done to help me unfortunately i am not yet acquainted with her present address i only know that she went to town today accompanied by a gentleman in whose employment i now am and who as i believe will be likely to write to me for money before many days more are over his head  is this circumstance of a nature to help us i venture to say us because i count already my dear boy on your kind assistance and advice dont let money stand between us i have saved a little something and it is all freely at your disposal pray pray write to me by return of post if you will only try your best to end the dreadful suspense under which i am now suffering you will atone for all the grief and disappointment you caused me in times that are past and you will confer an obligation that he will never forget on  your affectionate father  felix bashwood   after waiting a little to dry his eyes mr bashwood added the date and address and directed the letter to his son at the private inquiry office shadyside place london that done he went out at once and posted his letter with his own hands it was then monday and if the answer was sent by return of post the answer would be received on wednesday morning  the interval day the tuesday was passed by mr bashwood in the stewards office at the great house he had a double motive for absorbing himself as deeply as might be in the various occupations connected with the management of the estate in the first place employment helped him to control the devouring impatience with which he looked for the coming of the next day in the second place the more forward he was with the business of the office the more free he would be to join his son in london without attracting suspicion to himself by openly neglecting the interests placed under his charge  toward the tuesday afternoon vague rumors of something wrong at the cottage found their way through major milroys servants to the servants at the great house and attempted ineffectually through this latter channel to engage the attention of mr bashwood impenetrably fixed on other things the major and miss neelie had been shut up together in mysterious conference and miss neelies appearance after the close of the interview plainly showed that she had been crying this had happened on the monday afternoon and on the next day that present tuesday the major had startled the household by announcing briefly that his daughter wanted a change to the air of the seaside and that he proposed taking her himself by the next train to lowestoft the two had gone away together both very serious and silent but both apparently very good friends for all that opinions at the great house attributed this domestic revolution to the reports current on the subject of allan and miss gwilt opinions at the cottage rejected that solution of the difficulty on practical grounds miss neelie had remained inaccessibly shut up in her own room from the monday afternoon to the tuesday morning when her father took her away the major during the same interval had not been outside the door and had spoken to nobody and mrs milroy at the first attempt of her new attendant to inform her of the prevailing scandal in the town had sealed the servants lips by flying into one of her terrible passions the instant miss gwilts name was mentioned something must have happened of course to take major milroy and his daughter so suddenly from home but that something was certainly not mr armadales scandalous elopement in broad daylight with miss gwilt  the afternoon passed and the evening passed and no other event happened but the purely private and personal event which had taken place at the cottage nothing occurred for nothing in the nature of things could occur to dissipate the delusion on which miss gwilt had countedthe delusion which all thorpe ambrose now shared with mr bashwood that she had gone privately to london with allan in the character of allans future wife  on the wednesday morning the postman entering the street in which mr bashwood lived was encountered by mr bashwood himself so eager to know if there was a letter for him that he had come out without his hat there was a letter for himthe letter that he longed for from his vagabond son  these were the terms in which bashwood the younger answered his fathers supplication for helpafter having previously ruined his fathers prospects for life   shadyside place tuesday july 29th  my dear dadwe have some little practice in dealing with mysteries at this office but the mystery of your letter beats me altogether are you speculating on the interesting hidden frailties of some charming woman or after your experience of matrimony are you actually going to give me a stepmother at this time of day whichever it is upon my life your letter interests me  i am not joking mindthough the temptation is not an easy one to resist on the contrary i have given you a quarter of an hour of my valuable time already the place you date from sounded somehow familiar to me i referred back to the memorandum book and found that i was sent down to thorpe ambrose to make private inquiries not very long since my employer was a lively old lady who was too sly to give us her right name and address as a matter of course we set to work at once and found out who she was her name is mrs oldershaw and if you think of her for my stepmother i strongly recommend you to think again before you make her mrs bashwood  if it is not mrs oldershaw then all i can do so far is to tell you how you may find out the unknown ladys address come to town yourself as soon as you get the letter you expect from the gentleman who has gone away with her i hope he is not a handsome young man for your sake and call here i will send somebody to help you in watching his hotel or lodgings and if he communicates with the lady or the lady with him you may consider her address discovered from that moment once let me identify her and know where she is and you shall see all her charming little secrets as plainly as you see the paper on which your affectionate son is now writing to you  a word more about the terms i am as willing as you are to be friends again but though i own you were out of pocket by me once i cant afford to be out of pocket by you it must be understood that you are answerable for all the expenses of the inquiry we may have to employ some of the women attached to this office if your lady is too wideawake or too nicelooking to be dealt with by a man there will be cab hire and postagestampsadmissions to public amusements if she is inclined that wayshillings for pewopeners if she is serious and takes our people into churches to hear popular preachers and so on my own professional services you shall have gratis but i cant lose by you as well only remember that and you shall have your way bygones shall be bygones and we will forget the past  your affectionate son  james bashwood   in the ecstasy of seeing help placed at last within his reach the father put his sons atrocious letter to his lips my good boy he murmured tenderlymy dear good boy  he put the letter down and fell into a new train of thought the next question to face was the serious question of time mr pedgift had told him miss gwilt might be married in a fortnight one day of the fourteen had passed already and another was passing he beat his hand impatiently on the table at his side wondering how soon the want of money would force allan to write to him from london tomorrow he asked himself or next day  the morrow passed and nothing happened the next day came and the letter arrived it was on business as he had anticipated it asked for money as he had anticipated and there at the end of it in a postscript was the address added concluding with the words you may count on my staying here till further notice  he gave one deep gasp of relief and instantly busied himselfthough there were nearly two hours to spare before the train started for londonin packing his bag the last thing he put in was his blue satin cravat she likes bright colors he said and she may see me in it yet     xiv miss gwilts diary  all saints terrace new road london july 28th monday nighti can hardly hold my head up i am so tired but in my situation i dare not trust anything to memory before i go to bed i must write my customary record of the events of the day  so far the turn of luck in my favor it was long enough before it took the turn seems likely to continue i succeeded in forcing armadalethe brute required nothing short of forcingto leave thorpe ambrose for london alone in the same carriage with me before all the people in the station there was a full attendance of dealers in small scandal all staring hard at us and all evidently drawing their own conclusions either i knew nothing of thorpe ambroseor the town gossip is busy enough by this time with mr armadale and miss gwilt  i had some difficulty with him for the first halfhour after we left the station the guard delightful man i felt so grateful to him had shut us up together in expectation of half a crown at the end of the journey armadale was suspicious of me and he showed it plainly little by little i tamed my wild beastpartly by taking care to display no curiosity about his journey to town and partly by interesting him on the subject of his friend midwinter dwelling especially on the opportunity that now offered itself for a reconciliation between them i kept harping on this string till i set his tongue going and made him amuse me as a gentleman is bound to do when he has the honor of escorting a lady on a long railway journey  what little mind he has was full of course of his own affairs and miss milroys no words can express the clumsiness he showed in trying to talk about himself without taking me into his confidence or mentioning miss milroys name  he was going to london he gravely informed me on a matter of indescribable interest to him it was a secret for the present but he hoped to tell it me soon it had made a great difference already in the way in which he looked at the slanders spoken of him in thorpe ambrose he was too happy to care what the scandalmongers said of him now and he should soon stop their mouths by appearing in a new character that would surprise them all so he blundered on with the firm persuasion that he was keeping me quite in the dark it was hard not to laugh when i thought of my anonymous letter on its way to the major but i managed to control myselfthough i must own with some difficulty as the time wore on i began to feel a terrible excitement the position was i think a little too much for me there i was alone with him talking in the most innocent easy familiar manner and having it in my mind all the time to brush his life out of my way when the moment comes as i might brush a stain off my gown it made my blood leap and my cheeks flush i caught myself laughing once or twice much louder than i ought and long before we got to london i thought it desirable to put my face in hiding by pulling down my veil  there was no difficulty on reaching the terminus in getting him to come in the cab with me to the hotel where midwinter is staying he was all eagerness to be reconciled with his dear friendprincipally i have no doubt because he wants the dear friend to lend a helping hand to the elopement the real difficulty lay of course with midwinter my sudden journey to london had allowed me no opportunity of writing to combat his superstitious conviction that he and his former friend are better apart i thought it wise to leave armadale in the cab at the door and to go into the hotel by myself to pave the way for him  fortunately midwinter had not gone out his delight at seeing me some days sooner than he had hoped had something infectious in it i suppose pooh i may own the truth to my own diary there was a moment when i forgot everything in the world but our two selves as completely as he did i felt as if i was back in my teensuntil i remembered the lout in the cab at the door and then i was fiveandthirty again in an instant  his face altered when he heard who was below and what it was i wanted of him he looked not angry but distressed he yielded however before long not to my reasons for i gave him none but to my entreaties his old fondness for his friend might possibly have had some share in persuading him against his will but my own opinion is that he acted entirely under the influence of his fondness for me  i waited in the sittingroom while he went down to the door so i knew nothing of what passed between them when they first saw each other again but oh the difference between the two men when the interval had passed and they came upstairs together and joined me  they were both agitated but in such different ways the hateful armadale so loud and red and clumsy the dear lovable midwinter so pale and quiet with such a gentleness in his voice when he spoke and such tenderness in his eyes every time they turned my way armadale overlooked me as completely as if i had not been in the room he referred to me over and over again in the conversation he constantly looked at me to see what i thought while i sat in my corner silently watching them he wanted to go with me and see me safe to my lodgings and spare me all trouble with the cabman and the luggage when i thanked him and declined armadale looked unaffectedly relieved at the prospect of seeing my back turned and of having his friend all to himself i left him with his awkward elbows half over the table scrawling a letter no doubt to miss milroy and shouting to the waiter that he wanted a bed at the hotel i had calculated on his staying as a matter of course where he found his friend staying it was pleasant to find my anticipations realized and to know that i have as good as got him now under my own eye  after promising to let midwinter know where he could see me tomorrow i went away in the cab to hunt for lodgings by myself  with some difficulty i have succeeded in getting an endurable sittingroom and bedroom in this house where the people are perfect strangers to me having paid a weeks rent in advance for i naturally preferred dispensing with a reference i find myself with exactly three shillings and ninepence left in my purse it is impossible to ask midwinter for money after he has already paid mrs oldershaws note of hand i must borrow something tomorrow on my watch and chain at the pawnbrokers enough to keep me going for a fortnight is all and more than all that i want in that time or in less than that time midwinter will have married me   july 29thtwo oclockearly in the morning i sent a line to midwinter telling him that he would find me here at three this afternoon that done i devoted the morning to two errands of my own one is hardly worth mentioningit was only to raise money on my watch and chain i got more than i expected and more even supposing i buy myself one or two little things in the way of cheap summer dress than i am at all likely to spend before the weddingday  the other errand was of a far more serious kind it led me into an attorneys office  i was well aware last night though i was too weary to put it down in my diary that i could not possibly see midwinter this morningin the position he now occupies toward mewithout at least appearing to take him into my confidence on the subject of myself and my circumstances excepting one necessary consideration which i must be careful not to overlook there is not the least difficulty in my drawing on my invention and telling him any story i pleasefor thus far i have told no story to anybody midwinter went away to london before it was possible to approach the subject as to the milroys having provided them with the customary reference i could fortunately keep them at armslength on all questions relating purely to myself and lastly when i affected my reconciliation with armadale on the drive in front of the house he was fool enough to be too generous to let me defend my character when i had expressed my regret for having lost my temper and threatened miss milroy and when i had accepted his assurance that my pupil had never done or meant to do me any injury he was too magnanimous to hear a word on the subject of my private affairs thus i am quite unfettered by any former assertions of my own and i may tell any story i pleasewith the one drawback hinted at already in the shape of a restraint whatever i may invent in the way of pure fiction i must preserve the character in which i have appeared at thorpe ambrose for with the notoriety that is attached to my other name i have no other choice but to marry midwinter in my maiden name as miss gwilt  this was the consideration that took me into the lawyers office i felt that i must inform myself before i saw midwinter later in the day of any awkward consequences that may follow the marriage of a widow if she conceals her widows name  knowing of no other professional person whom i could trust i went boldly to the lawyer who had my interests in his charge at that terrible past time in my life which i have more reason than ever to shrink from thinking of now he was astonished and as i could plainly detect by no means pleased to see me i had hardly opened my lips before he said he hoped i was not consulting him again with a strong emphasis on the word on my own account i took the hint and put the question i had come to ask in the interests of that accommodating personage on such occasionsan absent friend the lawyer evidently saw through it at once but he was sharp enough to turn my friend to good account on his side he said he would answer the question as a matter of courtesy toward a lady represented by myself but he must make it a condition that this consultation of him by deputy should go no further  i accepted his terms for i really respected the clever manner in which he contrived to keep me at armslength without violating the laws of goodbreeding in two minutes i heard what he had to say mastered it in my own mind and went out  short as it was the consultation told me everything i wanted to know i risk nothing by marrying midwinter in my maiden instead of my widows name the marriage is a good marriage in this way that it can only be set aside if my husband finds out the imposture and takes proceedings to invalidate our marriage in my lifetime that is the lawyers answer in the lawyers own words it relieves me at oncein this direction at any rateof all apprehension about the future the only imposture my husband will ever discoverand then only if he happens to be on the spotis the imposture that puts me in the place and gives me the income of armadales widow and by that time i shall have invalidated my own marriage forever  halfpast two midwinter will be here in half an hour i must go and ask my glass how i look i must rouse my invention and make up my little domestic romance am i feeling nervous about it something flutters in the place where my heart used to be at fiveandthirty too and after such a life as mine   six oclockhe has just gone the day for our marriage is a day determined on already  i have tried to rest and recover myself i cant rest i have come back to these leaves there is much to be written in them since midwinter has been here that concerns me nearly  let me begin with what i hate most to remember and so be the sooner done with itlet me begin with the paltry string of falsehoods which i told him about my family troubles  what can be the secret of this mans hold on me how is it that he alters me so that i hardly know myself again i was like myself in the railway carriage yesterday with armadale it was surely frightful to be talking to the living man through the whole of that long journey with the knowledge in me all the while that i meant to be his widowand yet i was only excited and fevered hour after hour i never shrunk once from speaking to armadale but the first trumpery falsehood i told midwinter turned me cold when i saw that he believed it i felt a dreadful hysterical choking in the throat when he entreated me not to reveal my troubles and oncei am horrified when i think of itonce when he said if i could love you more dearly i should love you more dearly now i was within a hairbreadth of turning traitor to myself i was on the very point of crying out to him lies all lies im a fiend in human shape marry the wretchedest creature that prowls the streets and you will marry a better woman than me yes the seeing his eyes moisten the hearing his voice tremble while i was deceiving him shook me in that way i have seen handsomer men by hundreds cleverer men by dozens what can this man have roused in me is it love i thought i had loved never to love again does a woman not love when the mans hardness to her drives her to drown herself a man drove me to that last despair in days gone by did all my misery at that time come from something which was not love have i lived to be fiveandthirty and am i only feeling now what love really isnow when it is too late ridiculous besides what is the use of asking what do i know about it what does any woman ever know the more we think of it the more we deceive ourselves i wish i had been born an animal my beauty might have been of some use to me thenit might have got me a good master  here is a whole page of my diary filled and nothing written yet that is of the slightest use to me my miserable madeup story must be told over again here while the incidents are fresh in my memoryor how am i to refer to it consistently on afteroccasions when i may be obliged to speak of it again  there was nothing new in what i told him it was the commonplace rubbish of the circulating libraries a dead father a lost fortune vagabond brothers whom i dread ever seeing again a bedridden mother dependent on my exertionsno i cant write it down i hate myself i despise myself when i remember that he believed it because i said itthat he was distressed by it because it was my story i will face the chances of contradicting myselfi will risk discovery and ruinanything rather than dwell on that contemptible deception of him a moment longer  my lies came to an end at last and then he talked to me of himself and of his prospects oh what a relief it was to turn to that at the time what a relief it is to come to it now  he has accepted the offer about which he wrote to me at thorpe ambrose and he is now engaged as occasional foreign correspondent to the new newspaper his first destination is naples i wish it had been some other place for i have certain past associations with naples which i am not at all anxious to renew it has been arranged that he is to leave england not later than the eleventh of next month by that time therefore i who am to go with him must go with him as his wife  there is not the slightest difficulty about the marriage all this part of it is so easy that i begin to dread an accident  the proposal to keep the thing strictly privatewhich it might have embarrassed me to makecomes from midwinter marrying me in his own namethe name that he has kept concealed from every living creature but myself and mr brockit is his interest that not a soul who knows him should be present at the ceremony his friend armadale least of all he has been a week in london already when another week has passed he proposes to get the license and to be married in the church belonging to the parish in which the hotel is situated these are the only necessary formalities i had but to say yes he told me and to feel no further anxiety about the future i said yes with such a devouring anxiety about the future that i was afraid he would see it what minutes the next few minutes were when he whispered delicious words to me while i hid my face on his breast  i recovered myself first and led him back to the subject of armadale having my own reasons for wanting to know what they said to each other after i had left them yesterday  the manner in which midwinter replied showed me that he was speaking under the restraint of respecting a confidence placed in him by his friend long before he had done i detected what the confidence was armadale had been consulting him exactly as i anticipated on the subject of the elopement although he appears to have remonstrated against taking the girl secretly away from her home midwinter seems to have felt some delicacy about speaking strongly remembering widely different as the circumstances are that he was contemplating a private marriage himself i gathered at any rate that he had produced very little effect by what he had said and that armadale had already carried out his absurd intention of consulting the headclerk in the office of his london lawyers  having got as far as this midwinter put the question which i felt must come sooner or later he asked if i objected to our engagement being mentioned in the strictest secrecy to his friend  i will answer he said for allans respecting any confidence that i place in him and i will undertake when the time comes so to use my influence over him as to prevent his being present at the marriage and discovering what he must never know that my name is the same as his own it would help me he went on to speak more strongly about the object that has brought him to london if i can requite the frankness with which he has spoken of his private affairs to me by the same frankness on my side  i had no choice but to give the necessary permission and i gave it it is of the utmost importance to me to know what course major milroy takes with his daughter and armadale after receiving my anonymous letter and unless i invite armadales confidence in some way i am nearly certain to be kept in the dark let him once be trusted with the knowledge that i am to be midwinters wife and what he tells his friend about his love affair he will tell me  when it had been understood between us that armadale was to be taken into our confidence we began to talk about ourselves again how the time flew what a sweet enchantment it was to forget everything in his arms how he loves meah poor fellow how he loves me  i have promised to meet him tomorrow morning in the regents park the less he is seen here the better the people in this house are strangers to me certainly but it may be wise to consult appearances as if i was still at thorpe ambrose and not to produce the impression even on their minds that midwinter is engaged to me if any afterinquiries are made when i have run my grand risk the testimony of my london landlady might be testimony worth having  that wretched old bashwood writing of thorpe ambrose reminds me of him what will he say when the town gossip tells him that armadale has taken me to london in a carriage reserved for ourselves it really is too absurd in a man of bashwoods age and appearance to presume to be in love   july 30thnews at last armadale has heard from miss milroy my anonymous letter has produced its effect the girl is removed from thorpe ambrose already and the whole project of the elopement is blown to the winds at once and forever this was the substance of what midwinter had to tell me when i met him in the park i affected to be excessively astonished and to feel the necessary feminine longing to know all the particulars not that i expect to have my curiosity satisfied i added for mr armadale and i are little better than mere acquaintances after all  you are far more than a mere acquaintance in allans eyes said midwinter having your permission to trust him i have already told him how near and dear you are to me  hearing this i thought it desirable before i put any questions about miss milroy to attend to my own interests first and to find out what effect the announcement of my coming marriage had produced on armadale it was possible that he might be still suspicious of me and that the inquiries he made in london at mrs milroys instigation might be still hanging on his mind  did mr armadale seem surprised i asked when you told him of our engagement and when you said it was to be kept a secret from everybody  he seemed greatly surprised said midwinter to hear that we were going to be married all he said when i told him it must be kept a secret was that he supposed there were reasons on your side for making the marriage a private one  what did you say i inquired when he made that remark  i said the reasons were on my side answered midwinter and i thought it right to addconsidering that allan had allowed himself to be misled by the ignorant distrust of you at thorpe ambrosethat you had confided to me the whole of your sad family story and that you had amply justified your unwillingness under any ordinary circumstances to speak of your private affairs  i breathed freely again he had said just what was wanted just in the right way  thank you i said for putting me right in your friends estimation does he wish to see me i added by way of getting back to the other subject of miss milroy and the elopement  he is longing to see you returned midwinter he is in great distress poor fellowdistress which i have done my best to soothe but which i believe would yield far more readily to a womans sympathy than to mine  where is he now i asked  he was at the hotel and to the hotel i instantly proposed that we should go it is a busy crowded place and with my veil down i have less fear of compromising myself there than at my quiet lodgings besides it is vitally important to me to know what armadale does next under this total change of circumstancesfor i must so control his proceedings as to get him away from england if i can we took a cab such was my eagerness to sympathize with the heartbroken lover that we took a cab  anything so ridiculous as armadales behavior under the double shock of discovering that his young lady has been taken away from him and that i am to be married to midwinter i never before witnessed in all my experience to say that he was like a child is a libel on all children who are not born idiots he congratulated me on my coming marriage and execrated the unknown wretch who had written the anonymous letter little thinking that he was speaking of one and the same person in one and the same breath now he submissively acknowledged that major milroy had his rights as a father and now he reviled the major as having no feeling for anything but his mechanics and his clock at one moment he started up with the tears in his eyes and declared that his darling neelie was an angel on earth at another he sat down sulkily and thought that a girl of her spirit might have run away on the spot and joined him in london after a good halfhour of this absurd exhibition i succeeded in quieting him and then a few words of tender inquiry produced what i had expressly come to the hotel to seemiss milroys letter  it was outrageously long and rambling and confused in short the letter of a fool i had to wade through plenty of vulgar sentiment and lamentation and to lose time and patience over maudlin outbursts of affection and nauseous kisses inclosed in circles of ink however i contrived to extract the information i wanted at last and here it is  the major on receipt of my anonymous warning appears to have sent at once for his daughter and to have shown her the letter you know what a hard life i lead with your mother dont make it harder still neelie by deceiving me that was all the poor old gentleman said i always did like the major and though he was afraid to show it i know he always liked me his appeal to his daughter if her account of it is to be believed cut her to the heart she burst out crying let her alone for crying at the right moment and confessed everything  after giving her time to recover herself if he had given her a good box on the ears it would have been more to the purpose the major seems to have put certain questions and to have become convinced as i was convinced myself that his daughters heart or fancy or whatever she calls it was really and truly set on armadale the discovery evidently distressed as well as surprised him he appears to have hesitated and to have maintained his own unfavorable opinion of miss neelies lover for some little time but his daughters tears and entreaties so like the weakness of the dear old gentleman shook him at last though he firmly refused to allow of any marriage engagement at present he consented to overlook the clandestine meetings in the park and to put armadales fitness to become his soninlaw to the test on certain conditions  these conditions are that for the next six months to come all communication is to be broken off both personally and by writing between armadale and miss milroy that space of time is to be occupied by the young gentleman as he himself thinks best and by the young lady in completing her education at school if when the six months have passed they are both still of the same mind and if armadales conduct in the interval has been such as to improve the majors opinion of him he will be allowed to present himself in the character of miss milroys suitor and in six months more if all goes well the marriage may take place  i declare i could kiss the dear old major if i was only within reach of him if i had been at his elbow and had dictated the conditions myself i could have asked for nothing better than this six months of total separation between armadale and miss milroy in half that timewith all communication cut off between the twoit must go hard with me indeed if i dont find myself dressed in the necessary mourning and publicly recognized as armadales widow  but i am forgetting the girls letter she gives her fathers reasons for making his conditions in her fathers own words the major seems to have spoken so sensibly and so feelingly that he left his daughter no decent alternativeand he leaves armadale no decent alternativebut to submit as well as i can remember he seems to have expressed himself to miss neelie in these or nearly in these terms  dont think i am behaving cruelly to you my dear i am merely asking you to put mr armadale to the proof it is not only right it is absolutely necessary that you should hold no communication with him for some time to come and i will show you why in the first place if you go to school the necessary rules in such placesnecessary for the sake of the other girlswould not permit you to see mr armadale or to receive letters from him and if you are to become mistress of thorpe ambrose to school you must go for you would be ashamed and i should be ashamed if you occupied the position of a lady of station without having the accomplishments which all ladies of station are expected to possess in the second place i want to see whether mr armadale will continue to think of you as he thinks now without being encouraged in his attachment by seeing you or reminded of it by hearing from you if i am wrong in thinking him flighty and unreliable and if your opinion of him is the right one this is not putting the young man to an unfair testtrue love survives much longer separations than a separation of six months and when that time is over and well over and when i have had him under my own eye for another six months and have learned to think as highly of him as you doeven then my dear after all that terrible delay you will still be a married woman before you are eighteen think of this neelie and show that you love me and trust me by accepting my proposal i will hold no communication with mr armadale myself i will leave it to you to write and tell him what has been decided on he may write back one letter and one only to acquaint you with his decision after that for the sake of your reputation nothing more is to be said and nothing more is to be done and the matter is to be kept strictly private until the six months interval is at an end  to this effect the major spoke his behavior to that little slut of a girl has produced a stronger impression on me than anything else in the letter it has set me thinking me of all the people in the world of what they call a moral difficulty we are perpetually told that there can be no possible connection between virtue and vice can there not here is major milroy doing exactly what an excellent father at once kind and prudent affectionate and firm would do under the circumstances and by that very course of conduct he has now smoothed the way for me as completely as if he had been the chosen accomplice of that abominable creature miss gwilt only think of my reasoning in this way but i am in such good spirits i can do anything today i have not looked so bright and so young as i look now for months past  to return to the letter for the last timeit is so excessively dull and stupid that i really cant help wandering away from it into reflections of my own as a mere relief  after solemnly announcing that she meant to sacrifice herself to her beloved fathers wishes the brazen assurance of her setting up for a martyr after what has happened exceeds anything i ever heard or read of miss neelie next mentioned that the major proposed taking her to the seaside for change of air during the few days that were still to elapse before she went to school armadale was to send his answer by return of post and to address her under cover to her father at lowestoft with this and with a last outburst of tender protestation crammed crookedly into a corner of the page the letter ended nbthe majors object in taking her to the seaside is plain enough he still privately distrusts armadale and he is wisely determined to prevent any more clandestine meetings in the park before the girl is safely disposed of at school  when i had done with the letteri had requested permission to read parts of it which i particularly admired for the second and third timewe all consulted together in a friendly way about what armadale was to do  he was fool enough at the outset to protest against submitting to major milroys conditions he declared with his odious red face looking the picture of brute health that he should never survive a six months separation from his beloved neelie midwinter as may easily be imagined seemed a little ashamed of him and joined me in bringing him to his senses we showed him what would have been plain enough to anybody but a booby that there was no honorable or even decent alternative left but to follow the example of submission set by the young lady wait and you will have her for your wife was what i said wait and you will force the major to alter his unjust opinion of you was what midwinter added with two clever people hammering common sense into his head at that rate it is needless to say that his head gave way and he submitted  having decided him to accept the majors conditions i was careful to warn him before he wrote to miss milroy that my engagement to midwinter was to be kept as strictly secret from her as from everybody else the next question we had to settle related to his future proceedings i was ready with the necessary arguments to stop him if he had proposed returning to thorpe ambrose but he proposed nothing of the sort on the contrary he declared of his own accord that nothing would induce him to go back the place and the people were associated with everything that was hateful to him there would be no miss milroy now to meet him in the park and no midwinter to keep him company in the solitary house id rather break stones on the road was the sensible and cheerful way in which he put it than go back to thorpe ambrose  the first suggestion after this came from midwinter the sly old clergyman who gave mrs oldershaw and me so much trouble has it seems been ill but has been latterly reported better why not go to somersetshire said midwinter and see your good friend and my good friend mr brock  armadale caught at the proposal readily enough he longed in the first place to see dear old brock and he longed in the second place to see his yacht after staying a few days more in london with midwinter he would gladly go to somersetshire but what after that  seeing my opportunity i came to the rescue this time you have got a yacht mr armadale i said and you know that midwinter is going to italy when you are tired of somersetshire why not make a voyage to the mediterranean and meet your friend and your friends wife at naples  i made the allusion to his friends wife with the most becoming modesty and confusion armadale was enchanted i had hit on the best of all ways of occupying the weary time he started up and wrung my hand in quite an ecstasy of gratitude how i do hate people who can only express their feelings by hurting other peoples hands  midwinter was as pleased with my proposal as armadale but he saw difficulties in the way of carrying it out he considered the yacht too small for a cruise to the mediterranean and he thought it desirable to hire a larger vessel his friend thought otherwise i left them arguing the question it was quite enough for me to have made sure in the first place that armadale will not return to thorpe ambrose and to have decided him in the second place on going abroad he may go how he likes i should prefer the small yacht myself for there seems to be a chance that the small yacht might do me the inestimable service of drowning him   five oclockthe excitement of feeling that i had got armadales future movements completely under my own control made me so restless when i returned to my lodgings that i was obliged to go out again and do something a new interest to occupy me being what i wanted i went to pimlico to have it out with mother oldershaw  i walked and made up my mind on the way that i would begin by quarreling with her  one of my notes of hand being paid already and midwinter being willing to pay the other two when they fall due my present position with the old wretch is as independent a one as i could desire i always get the better of her when it comes to a downright battle between us and find her wonderfully civil and obliging the moment i have made her feel that mine is the strongest will of the two in my present situation she might be of use to me in various ways if i could secure her assistance without trusting her with secrets which i am now more than ever determined to keep to myself that was my idea as i walked to pimlico upsetting mother oldershaws nerves in the first place and then twisting her round my little finger in the second promised me as i thought an interesting occupation for the rest of the afternoon  when i got to pimlico a surprise was in store for we the house was shut upnot only on mrs oldershaws side but on doctor downwards as well a padlock was on the shop door and a man was hanging about on the watch who might have been an ordinary idler certainly but who looked to my mind like a policeman in disguise  knowing the risks the doctor runs in his particular form of practice i suspected at once that something serious had happened and that even cunning mrs oldershaw was compromised this time without stopping or making any inquiry therefore i called the first cab that passed me and drove to the postoffice to which i had desired my letters to be forwarded if any came for me after i left my thorpe ambrose lodging  on inquiry a letter was produced for miss gwilt it was in mother oldershaws handwriting and it told me as i had supposed that the doctor had got into a serious difficultythat she was herself most unfortunately mixed up in the matter and that they were both in hiding for the present the letter ended with some sufficiently venomous sentences about my conduct at thorpe ambrose and with a warning that i have not heard the last of mrs oldershaw yet it relieved me to find her writing in this wayfor she would have been civil and cringing if she had had any suspicion of what i have really got in view i burned the letter as soon as the candles came up and there for the present is an end of the connection between mother jezebel and me i must do all my own dirty work now and i shall be all the safer perhaps for trusting nobodys hands to do it but my own   july 31stmore useful information for me i met midwinter again in the park on the pretext that my reputation might suffer if he called too often at my lodgings and heard the last news of armadale since i left the hotel yesterday  after he had written to miss milroy midwinter took the opportunity of speaking to him about the necessary business arrangements during his absence from the great house it was decided that the servants should be put on board wages and that mr bashwood should be left in charge somehow i dont like this reappearance of mr bashwood in connection with my present interests but there is no help for it the next questionthe question of moneywas settled at once by mr armadale himself all his available readymoney a large sum is to be lodged by mr bashwood in couttss bank and to be there deposited in armadales name this he said would save him the worry of any further letterwriting to his steward and would enable him to get what he wanted when he went abroad at a moments notice the plan thus proposed being certainly the simplest and the safest was adopted with midwinters full concurrence and here the business discussion would have ended if the everlasting mr bashwood had not turned up again in the conversation and prolonged it in an entirely new direction  on reflection it seems to have struck midwinter that the whole responsibility at thorpe ambrose ought not to rest on mr bashwoods shoulders without in the least distrusting him midwinter felt nevertheless that he ought to have somebody set over him to apply to in case of emergency armadale made no objection to this he only asked in his helpless way who the person was to be  the answer was not an easy one to arrive at  either of the two solicitors at thorpe ambrose might have been employed but armadale was on bad terms with both of them any reconciliation with such a bitter enemy as the elder lawyer mr darch was out of the question and reinstating mr pedgift in his former position implied a tacit sanction on armadales part of the lawyers abominable conduct toward me which was scarcely consistent with the respect and regard that he felt for a lady who was soon to be his friends wife after some further discussion midwinter hit on a new suggestion which appeared to meet the difficulty he proposed that armadale should write to a respectable solicitor at norwich stating his position in general terms and requesting that gentleman to act as mr bashwoods adviser and superintendent when occasion required norwich being within an easy railway ride of thorpe ambrose armadale saw no objection to the proposal and promised to write to the norwich lawyer fearing that he might make some mistake if he wrote without assistance midwinter had drawn him out a draft of the necessary letter and armadale was now engaged in copying the draft and also in writing to mr bashwood to lodge the money immediately in couttss bank  these details are so dry and uninteresting in themselves that i hesitated at first about putting them down in my diary but a little reflection has convinced me that they are too important to be passed over looked at from my point of view they mean thisthat armadales own act is now cutting him off from all communication with thorpe ambrose even by letter he is as good as dead already to everybody he leaves behind him the causes which have led to such a result as that are causes which certainly claim the best place i can give them in these pages   august 1stnothing to record but that i have had a long quiet happy day with midwinter he hired a carriage and we drove to richmond and dined there after todays experience it is impossible to deceive myself any longer come what may of it i love him  i have fallen into low spirits since he left me a persuasion has taken possession of my mind that the smooth and prosperous course of my affairs since i have been in london is too smooth and prosperous to last there is something oppressing me tonight which is more than the oppression of the heavy london air   august 2dthree oclockmy presentiments like other peoples have deceived me often enough but i am almost afraid that my presentiment of last night was really prophetic for once in a way  i went after breakfast to a milliners in this neighborhood to order a few cheap summer things and thence to midwinters hotel to arrange with him for another day in the country i drove to the milliners and to the hotel and part of the way back then feeling disgusted with the horrid close smell of the cab somebody had been smoking in it i suppose i got out to walk the rest of the way before i had been two minutes on my feet i discovered that i was being followed by a strange man  this may mean nothing but that an idle fellow has been struck by my figure and my appearance generally my face could have made no impression on him for it was hidden as usual by my veil whether he followed me in a cab of course from the milliners or from the hotel i cannot say nor am i quite certain whether he did or did not track me to this door i only know that i lost sight of him before i got back there is no help for it but to wait till events enlighten me if there is anything serious in what has happened i shall soon discover it   five oclockit is serious ten minutes since i was in my bedroom which communicates with the sittingroom i was just coming out when i heard a strange voice on the landing outsidea womans voice the next instant the sittingroom door was suddenly opened the womans voice said are these the apartments you have got to let and though the landlady behind her answered no higher up maam the woman came on straight to my bedroom as if she had not heard i had just time to slam the door in her face before she saw me the necessary explanations and apologies followed between the landlady and the stranger in the sittingroom and then i was left alone again  i have no time to write more it is plain that somebody has an interest in trying to identify me and that but for my own quickness the strange woman would have accomplished this object by taking me by surprise she and the man who followed me in the street are i suspect in league together and there is probably somebody in the background whose interests they are serving is mother oldershaw attacking me in the dark or who else can it be no matter who it is my present situation is too critical to be trifled with i must get away from this house tonight and leave no trace behind me by which i can be followed to another place   august 3dgary street tottenham court roadi got away last night after writing an excuse to midwinter in which my invalid mother figured as the allsufficient cause of my disappearance and i have found refuge here it has cost me some money but my object is attained nobody can possibly have traced me from all saints terrace to this address  after paying my landlady the necessary forfeit for leaving her without notice i arranged with her son that he should take my boxes in a cab to the cloakroom at the nearest railway station and send me the ticket in a letter to wait my application for it at the postoffice while he went his way in one cab i went mine in another with a few things for the night in my little handbag  i drove straight to the milliners shop which i had observed when i was there yesterday had a back entrance into a mews for the apprentices to go in and out by i went in at once leaving the cab waiting for me at the door a man is following me i said and i want to get rid of him here is my cab fare wait ten minutes before you give it to the driver and let me out at once by the back way in a moment i was out in the mews in another i was in the next street in a third i hailed a passing omnibus and was a free woman again  having now cut off all communication between me and my last lodgings the next precaution in case midwinter or armadale are watched is to cut off all communication for some days to come at least between me and the hotel i have written to midwintermaking my supposititious mother once more the excuseto say that i am tied to my nursing duties and that we must communicate by writing only for the present doubtful as i still am of who my hidden enemy really is i can do no more to defend myself than i have done now   august 4ththe two friends at the hotel had both written to me midwinter expresses his regret at our separation in the tenderest terms armadale writes an entreaty for help under very awkward circumstances a letter from major milroy has been forwarded to him from the great house and he incloses it in his letter to me  having left the seaside and placed his daughter safely at the school originally chosen for her in the neighborhood of ely the major appears to have returned to thorpe ambrose at the close of last week to have heard then for the first time the reports about armadale and me and to have written instantly to armadale to tell him so  the letter is stern and short major milroy dismisses the report as unworthy of credit because it is impossible for him to believe in such an act of coldblooded treachery as the scandal would imply if the scandal were true he simply writes to warn armadale that if he is not more careful in his actions for the future he must resign all pretensions to miss milroys hand i neither expect nor wish for an answer to this the letter ends for i desire to receive no mere protestations in words by your conduct and by your conduct alone i shall judge you as time goes on let me also add that i positively forbid you to consider this letter as an excuse for violating the terms agreed on between us by writing again to my daughter you have no need to justify yourself in her eyes for i fortunately removed her from thorpe ambrose before this abominable report had time to reach her and i shall take good care for her sake that she is not agitated and unsettled by hearing it where she is now  armadales petition to me under these circumstances entreats as i am the innocent cause of the new attack on his character that i will write to the major to absolve him of all indiscretion in the matter and to say that he could not in common politeness do otherwise than accompany me to london  i forgive the impudence of his request in consideration of the news that he sends me it is certainly another circumstance in my favor that the scandal at thorpe ambrose is not to be allowed to reach miss milroys ears with her temper if she did hear it she might do something desperate in the way of claiming her lover and might compromise me seriously as for my own course with armadale it is easy enough i shall quiet him by promising to write to major milroy and i shall take the liberty in my own private interests of not keeping my word  nothing in the least suspicious has happened today whoever my enemies are they have lost me and between this and the time when i leave england they shall not find me again i have been to the postoffice and have got the ticket for my luggage inclosed to me in a letter from all saints terrace as i directed the luggage itself i shall still leave at the cloakroom until i see the way before me more clearly than i see it now   august 5thtwo letters again from the hotel midwinter writes to remind me in the prettiest possible manner that he will have lived long enough in the parish by tomorrow to be able to get our marriagelicense and that he proposes applying for it in the usual way at doctors commons now if i am ever to say it is the time to say no i cant say no there is the plain truthand there is an end of it  armadales letter is a letter of farewell he thanks me for my kindness in consenting to write to the major and bids me goodby till we meet again at naples he has learned from his friend that there are private reasons which will oblige him to forbid himself the pleasure of being present at our marriage under these circumstances there is nothing to keep him in london he has made all his business arrangements he goes to somersetshire by tonights train and after staying some time with mr brock he will sail for the mediterranean from the bristol channel in spite of midwinters objections in his own yacht  the letter incloses a jewelers box with a ring in itarmadales present to me on my marriage it is a rubybut rather a small one and set in the worst possible taste he would have given miss milroy a ring worth ten times the money if it had been her marriage present there is no more hateful creature in my opinion than a miserly young man i wonder whether his trumpery little yacht will drown him  i am so excited and fluttered i hardly know what i am writing not that i shrink from what is comingi only feel as if i was being hurried on faster than i quite like to go at this rate if nothing happens midwinter will have married me by the end of the week and then   august 6thif anything could startle me now i should feel startled by the news that has reached me today  on his return to the hotel this morning after getting the marriagelicense midwinter found a telegram waiting for him it contained an urgent message from armadale announcing that mr brock had had a relapse and that all hope of his recovery was pronounced by the doctors to be at an end by the dying mans own desire midwinter was summoned to take leave of him and was entreated by armadale not to lose a moment in starting for the rectory by the first train  the hurried letter which tells me this tells me also that by the time i receive it midwinter will be on his way to the west he promises to write at greater length after he has seen mr brock by tonights post  this news has an interest for me which midwinter little suspects there is but one human creature besides myself who knows the secret of his birth and his name and that one is the old man who now lies waiting for him at the point of death what will they say to each other at the last moment will some chance word take them back to the time when i was in mrs armadales service at madeira will they speak of me   august 7ththe promised letter has just reached me no parting words have been exchanged between them it was all over before midwinter reached somersetshire armadale met him at the rectory gate with the news that mr brock was dead  i try to struggle against it but coming after the strange complication of circumstances that has been closing round me for weeks past there is something in this latest event of all that shakes my nerves but one last chance of detection stood in my way when i opened my diary yesterday when i open it today that chance is removed by mr brocks death it means something i wish i knew what  the funeral is to be on saturday morning midwinter will attend it as well as armadale but he proposes returning to london first and he writes word that he will call tonight in the hope of seeing me on his way from the station to the hotel even if there was any risk in it i should see him as things are now but there is no risk if he comes here from the station instead of coming from the hotel   five oclocki was not mistaken in believing that my nerves were all unstrung trifles that would not have cost me a second thought at other times weigh heavily on my mind now  two hours since in despair of knowing how to get through the day i bethought myself of the milliner who is making my summer dress i had intended to go and try it on yesterday but it slipped out of my memory in the excitement of hearing about mr brock so i went this afternoon eager to do anything that might help me to get rid of myself i have returned feeling more uneasy and more depressed than i felt when i went out for i have come back fearing that i may yet have reason to repent not having left my unfinished dress on the milliners hands  nothing happened to me this time in the street it was only in the tryingon room that my suspicions were roused and there it certainly did cross my mind that the attempt to discover me which i defeated at all saints terrace was not given up yet and that some of the shopwomen had been tampered with if not the mistress herself  can i give myself anything in the shape of a reason for this impression let me think a little  i certainly noticed two things which were out of the ordinary routine under the circumstances in the first place there were twice as many women as were needed in the tryingon room this looked suspicious and yet i might have accounted for it in more ways than one is it not the slack time now and dont i know by experience that i am the sort of woman about whom other women are always spitefully curious i thought again in the second place that one of the assistants persisted rather oddly in keeping me turned in a particular direction with my face toward the glazed and curtained door that led into the workroom but after all she gave a reason when i asked for it she said the light fell better on me that way and when i looked round there was the window to prove her right still these trifles produced such an effect on me at the time that i purposely found fault with the dress so as to have an excuse for trying it on again before i told them where i lived and had it sent home pure fancy i dare say pure fancy perhaps at the present moment i dont care i shall act on instinct as they say and give up the dress in plainer words still i wont go back   midnightmidwinter came to see me as he promised an hour has passed since we said goodnight and here i still sit with my pen in my hand thinking of him no words of mine can describe what has passed between us the end of it is all i can write in these pages and the end of it is that he has shaken my resolution for the first time since i saw the easy way to armadales life at thorpe ambrose i feel as if the man whom i have doomed in my own thoughts had a chance of escaping me  is it my love for midwinter that has altered me or is it his love for me that has taken possession not only of all i wish to give him but of all i wish to keep from him as well i feel as if i had lost myselflost myself i mean in himall through the evening he was in great agitation about what had happened in somersetshire and he made me feel as disheartened and as wretched about it as he did though he never confessed it in words i know that mr brocks death has startled him as an ill omen for our marriagei know it because i feel mr brocks death as an ill omen too the superstitionhis superstitiontook so strong a hold on me that when we grew calmer and he spoke of time futurewhen he told me that he must either break his engagement with his new employers or go abroad as he is pledged to go on monday nexti actually shrank at the thought of our marriage following close on mr brocks funeral i actually said to him in the impulse of the moment go and begin your new life alone go and leave me here to wait for happier times  he took me in his arms he sighed and kissed me with an angelic tenderness he saidoh so softly and so sadlyi have no life now apart from you as those words passed his lips the thought seemed to rise in my mind like an echo why not live out all the days that are left to me happy and harmless in a love like this i cant explain iti cant realize it that was the thought in me at the time and that is the thought in me still i see my own hand while i write the wordsand i ask myself whether it is really the hand of lydia gwilt  armadale  no i will never write i will never think of armadale again  yes let me write once morelet me think once more of him because it quiets me to know that he is going away and that the sea will have parted us before i am married his old home is home to him no longer now that the loss of his mother has been followed by the loss of his best and earliest friend when the funeral is over he has decided to sail the same day for the foreign seas we may or we may not meet at naples shall i be an altered woman if we do i wonder i wonder   august 8tha line from midwinter he has gone back to somersetshire to be in readiness for the funeral tomorrow and he will return here after bidding armadale goodby tomorrow evening  the last forms and ceremonies preliminary to our marriage have been complied with i am to be his wife on monday next the hour must not be later than halfpast tenwhich will give us just time when the service is over to get from the church door to the railway and to start on our journey to naples the same day  todaysaturdaysunday i am not afraid of the time the time will pass i am not afraid of myself if i can only keep all thoughts but one out of my mind i love him day and night till monday comes i will think of nothing but that i love him   four oclockother thoughts are forced into my mind in spite of me my suspicions of yesterday were no mere fancies the milliner has been tampered with my folly in going back to her house has led to my being traced here i am absolutely certain that i never gave the woman my address and yet my new gown was sent home to me at two oclock today  a man brought it with the bill and a civil message to say that as i had not called at the appointed time to try it on again the dress had been finished and sent to me he caught me in the passage i had no choice but to pay the bill and dismiss him any other proceeding as events have now turned out would have been pure folly the messenger not the man who followed me in the street but another spy sent to look at me beyond all doubt would have declared he knew nothing about it if i had spoken to him the milliner would tell me to my face if i went to her that i had given her my address the one useful thing to do now is to set my wits to work in the interests of my own security and to step out of the false position in which my own rashness has placed meif i can   seven oclockmy spirits have risen again i believe i am in a fair way of extricating myself already  i have just come back from a long round in a cab first to the cloakroom of the great western to get the luggage which i sent there from all saints terrace next to the cloakroom of the southeastern to leave my luggage labeled in midwinters name to wait for me till the starting of the tidal train on monday next to the general postoffice to post a letter to midwinter at the rectory which he will receive tomorrow morning lastly back again to this housefrom which i shall move no more till monday comes  my letter to midwinter will i have little doubt lead to his seconding quite innocently the precautions that i am taking for my own safety the shortness of the time at our disposal on monday will oblige him to pay his bill at the hotel and to remove his luggage before the marriage ceremony takes place all i ask him to do beyond this is to take the luggage himself to the southeastern so as to make any inquiries useless which may address themselves to the servants at the hoteland that done to meet me at the church door instead of calling for me here the rest concerns nobody but myself when sunday night or monday morning comes it will be hard indeedfreed as i am now from all incumbrancesif i cant give the people who are watching me the slip for the second time  it seems needless enough to have written to midwinter today when he is coming back to me tomorrow night but it was impossible to ask what i have been obliged to ask of him without making my false family circumstances once more the excuse and having this to doi must own the truthi wrote to him because after what i suffered on the last occasion i can never again deceive him to his face   august 9thtwo oclocki rose early this morning more depressed in spirits than usual the rebeginning of ones life at the rebeginning of every day has already been something weary and hopeless to me for years past i dreamed too all through the nightnot of midwinter and of my married life as i had hoped to dreambut of the wretched conspiracy to discover me by which i have been driven from one place to another like a hunted animal nothing in the shape of a new revelation enlightened me in my sleep all i could guess dreaming was what i had guessed waking that mother oldershaw is the enemy who is attacking me in the dark  my restless night has however produced one satisfactory result it has led to my winning the good graces of the servant here and securing all the assistance she can give me when the time comes for making my escape  the girl noticed this morning that i looked pale and anxious i took her into my confidence to the extent of telling her that i was privately engaged to be married and that i had enemies who were trying to part me from my sweetheart this instantly roused her sympathy and a present of a tenshilling piece for her kind services to me did the rest in the intervals of her housework she has been with me nearly the whole morning and i found out among other things that her sweetheart is a private soldier in the guards and that she expects to see him tomorrow i have got money enough left little as it is to turn the head of any private in the british army and if the person appointed to watch me tomorrow is a man i think it just possible that he may find his attention disagreeably diverted from miss gwilt in the course of the evening  when midwinter came here last from the railway he came at halfpast eight how am i to get through the weary weary hours between this and the evening i think i shall darken my bedroom and drink the blessing of oblivion from my bottle of drops   eleven oclockwe have parted for the last time before the day comes that makes us man and wife  he has left me as he left me before with an absorbing subject of interest to think of in his absence i noticed a change in him the moment he entered the room when he told me of the funeral and of his parting with armadale on board the yacht though he spoke with feelings deeply moved he spoke with a mastery over himself which is new to me in my experience of him it was the same when our talk turned next on our own hopes and prospects he was plainly disappointed when he found that my family embarrassments would prevent our meeting tomorrow and plainly uneasy at the prospect of leaving me to find my way by myself on monday to the church but there was a certain hopefulness and composure of manner underlying it all which produced so strong an impression on me that i was obliged to notice it  you know what odd fancies take possession of me sometimes i said shall i tell you the fancy that has taken possession of me now i cant help thinking that something has happened since we last saw each other which you have not told me yet  something has happened he answered and it is something which you ought to know  with those words he took out his pocketbook and produced two written papers from it one he looked at and put back the other he placed on the table  before i tell you what this is and how it came into my possession he said i must own something that i have concealed from you it is no more serious confession than the confession of my own weakness  he then acknowledged to me that the renewal of his friendship with armadale had been clouded through the whole period of their intercourse in london by his own superstitious misgivings he had obeyed the summons which called him to the rectors bedside with the firm intention of confiding his previsions of coming trouble to mr brock and he had been doubly confirmed in his superstition when he found that death had entered the house before him and had parted them in this world forever more than this he had traveled back to be present at the funeral with a secret sense of relief at the prospect of being parted from armadale and with a secret resolution to make the aftermeeting agreed on between us three at naples a meeting that should never take place with that purpose in his heart he had gone up alone to the room prepared for him on his arrival at the rectory and had opened a letter which he found waiting for him on the table the letter had only that day been discovereddropped and lostunder the bed on which mr brock had died it was in the rectors handwriting throughout and the person to whom it was addressed was midwinter himself  having told me this nearly in the words in which i have written it he gave me the written paper that lay on the table between us  read it he said and you will not need to be told that my mind is at peace again and that i took allans hand at parting with a heart that was worthier of allans love  i read the letter there was no superstition to be conquered in my mind there were no old feelings of gratitude toward armadale to be roused in my heart and yet the effect which the letter had had on midwinter was i firmly believe more than matched by the effect that the letter now produced on me  it was vain to ask him to leave it and to let me read it again as i wished when i was left by myself he is determined to keep it side by side with that other paper which i had seen him take out of his pocketbook and which contains the written narrative of armadales dream all i could do was to ask his leave to copy it and this he granted readily i wrote the copy in his presence and i now place it here in my diary to mark a day which is one of the memorable days in my life  boscombe rectory august 2d  my dear midwinterfor the first time since the beginning of my illness i found strength enough yesterday to look over my letters one among them is a letter from allan which has been lying unopened on my table for ten days past he writes to me in great distress to say that there has been dissension between you and that you have left him if you still remember what passed between us when you first opened your heart to me in the isle of man you will be at no loss to understand how i have thought over this miserable news through the night that has now passed and you will not be surprised to hear that i have roused myself this morning to make the effort of writing to you  i want no explanation of the circumstances which have parted you from your friend if my estimate of your character is not founded on an entire delusion the one influence which can have led to your estrangement from allan is the influence of that evil spirit of superstition which i have once already cast out of your heartwhich i will once again conquer please god if i have strength enough to make my pen speak my mind to you in this letter  it is no part of my design to combat the belief which i know you to hold that mortal creatures may be the objects of supernatural intervention in their pilgrimage through this world speaking as a reasonable man i own that i cannot prove you to be wrong speaking as a believer in the bible i am bound to go further and to admit that you possess a higher than any human warrant for the faith that is in you the one object which i have it at heart to attain is to induce you to free yourself from the paralyzing fatalism of the heathen and the savage and to look at the mysteries that perplex and the portents that daunt you from the christians point of view if i can succeed in this i shall clear your mind of the ghastly doubts that now oppress it and i shall reunite you to your friend never to be parted from him again  i have no means of seeing and questioning you i can only send this letter to allan to be forwarded if he knows or can discover your present address placed in this position toward you i am bound to assume all that can be assumed in your favor i will take it for granted that something has happened to you or to allan which to your mind has not only confirmed the fatalist conviction in which your father died but has added a new and terrible meaning to the warning which he sent you in his deathbed letter  on this common ground i meet you on this common ground i appeal to your higher nature and your better sense  preserve your present conviction that the events which have happened be they what they may are not to be reconciled with ordinary mortal coincidences and ordinary mortal laws and view your own position by the best and clearest light that your superstition can throw on it what are you you are a helpless instrument in the hands of fate you are doomed beyond all human capacity of resistance to bring misery and destruction blindfold on a man to whom you have harmlessly and gratefully united yourself in the bonds of a brothers love all that is morally firmest in your will and morally purest in your aspirations avails nothing against the hereditary impulsion of you toward evil caused by a crime which your father committed before you were born in what does that belief end it ends in the darkness in which you are now lost in the selfcontradictions in which you are now bewildered in the stubborn despair by which a man profanes his own soul and lowers himself to the level of the brutes that perish  look up my poor suffering brotherlook up my hardly tried my wellloved friend higher than this meet the doubts that now assail you from the blessed vantageground of christian courage and christian hope and your heart will turn again to allan and your mind will be at peace happen what may god is allmerciful god is allwise natural or supernatural it happens through him the mystery of evil that perplexes our feeble minds the sorrow and the suffering that torture us in this little life leave the one great truth unshaken that the destiny of man is in the hands of his creator and that gods blessed son died to make us worthier of it nothing that is done in unquestioning submission to the wisdom of the almighty is done wrong no evil exists out of which in obedience to his laws good may not come be true to what christ tells you is true encourage in yourself be the circumstances what they may all that is loving all that is grateful all that is patient all that is forgiving toward your fellowmen and humbly and trustfully leave the rest to the god who made you and to the saviour who loved you better than his own life  this is the faith in which i have lived by the divine help and mercy from my youth upward i ask you earnestly i ask you confidently to make it your faith too it is the mainspring of all the good i have ever done of all the happiness i have ever known it lightens my darkness it sustains my hope it comforts and quiets me lying here to live or die i know not which let it sustain comfort and enlighten you it will help you in your sorest need as it has helped me in mine it will show you another purpose in the events which brought you and allan together than the purpose which your guilty father foresaw strange things i do not deny it have happened to you already stranger things still may happen before long which i may not live to see remember if that time comes that i died firmly disbelieving in your influence over allan being other than an influence for good the great sacrifice of the atonementi say it reverentlyhas its mortal reflections even in this world if danger ever threatens allan you whose father took his fathers lifeyou and no other may be the man whom the providence of god has appointed to save him  come to me if i live go back to the friend who loves you whether i live or die  yours affectionately to the last  decimus brock  you and no other may be the man whom the providence of god has appointed to save him  those are the words which have shaken me to the soul those are the words which make me feel as if the dead man had left his grave and had put his hand on the place in my heart where my terrible secret lies hidden from every living creature but myself one part of the letter has come true already the danger that it foresees threatens armadale at this momentand threatens him from me  if the favoring circumstances which have driven me thus far drive me on to the end and if that old mans last earthly conviction is prophetic of the truth armadale will escape me do what i may and midwinter will be the victim who is sacrificed to save his life  it is horrible it is impossible it shall never be at the thinking of it only my hand trembles and my heart sinks i bless the trembling that unnerves me i bless the sinking that turns me faint i bless those words in the letter which have revived the relenting thoughts that first came to me two days since is it hard now that events are taking me smoothly and safely nearer and nearer to the endis it hard to conquer the temptation to go on no if there is only a chance of harm coming to midwinter the dread of that chance is enough to decide meenough to strengthen me to conquer the temptation for his sake i have never loved him yet never never never as i love him now   sunday august 10ththe eve of my weddingday i close and lock this book never to write in it never to open it again  i have won the great victory i have trampled my own wickedness under foot i am innocent i am happy again my love my angel when tomorrow gives me to you i will not have a thought in my heart which is not your thought as well as mine     xv the weddingday  the time was nine oclock in the morning the place was a private room in one of the oldfashioned inns which still remain on the borough side of the thames the date was monday the 11th of august and the person was mr bashwood who had traveled to london on a summons from his son and had taken up his abode at the inn on the previous day  he had never yet looked so pitiably old and helpless as he looked now the fever and chill of alternating hope and despair had dried and withered and wasted him the angles of his figure had sharpened the outline of his face had shrunk his dress pointed the melancholy change in him with a merciless and shocking emphasis never even in his youth had he worn such clothes as he wore now with the desperate resolution to leave no chance untried of producing an impression on miss gwilt he had cast aside his dreary black garments he had even mustered the courage to wear his blue satin cravat his coat was a ridingcoat of light gray he had ordered it with a vindictive subtlety of purpose to be made on the pattern of a coat that he had seen allan wear his waistcoat was white his trousers were of the gayest summer pattern in the largest check his wig was oiled and scented and brushed round on either side to hide the wrinkles on his temples he was an object to laugh at he was an object to weep over his enemies if a creature so wretched could have had enemies would have forgiven him on seeing him in his new dress his friendshad any of his friends been leftwould have been less distressed if they had looked at him in his coffin than if they had looked at him as he was now incessantly restless he paced the room from end to end now he looked at his watch now he looked out of the window now he looked at the wellfurnished breakfasttablealways with the same wistful uneasy inquiry in his eyes the waiter coming in with the urn of boiling water was addressed for the fiftieth time in the one form of words which the miserable creature seemed to be capable of uttering that morning my son is coming to breakfast my son is very particular i want everything of the besthot things and cold thingsand tea and coffeeand all the rest of it waiter all the rest of it for the fiftieth time he now reiterated those anxious words for the fiftieth time the impenetrable waiter had just returned his one pacifying answer all right sir you may leave it to mewhen the sound of leisurely footsteps was heard on the stairs the door opened and the longexpected son sauntered indolently into the room with a neat little black leather bag in his hand  well done old gentleman said bashwood the younger surveying his fathers dress with a smile of sardonic encouragement youre ready to be married to miss gwilt at a moments notice  the father took the sons hand and tried to echo the sons laugh  you have such good spirits jemmy he said using the name in its familiar form as he had been accustomed to use it in happier days you always had good spirits my dear from a child come and sit down ive ordered you a nice breakfast everything of the best everything of the best what a relief it is to see you oh dear dear what a relief it is to see you he stopped and sat down at the table his face flushed with the effort to control the impatience that was devouring him tell me about her he burst out giving up the effort with a sudden selfabandonment i shall die jemmy if i wait for it any longer tell me tell me tell me  one thing at a time said bashwood the younger perfectly unmoved by his fathers impatience well try the breakfast first and come to the lady afterward gently does it old gentlemangently does it  he put his leather bag on a chair and sat down opposite to his father composed and smiling and humming a little tune  no ordinary observation applying the ordinary rules of analysis would have detected the character of bashwood the younger in his face his youthful look aided by his light hair and his plump beardless cheeks his easy manner and his everready smile his eyes which met unshrinkingly the eyes of every one whom he addressed all combined to make the impression of him a favorable impression in the general mind no eye for reading character but such an eye as belongs to one person perhaps in ten thousand could have penetrated the smoothly deceptive surface of this man and have seen him for what he really wasthe vile creature whom the viler need of society has fashioned for its own use there he satthe confidential spy of modern times whose business is steadily enlarging whose private inquiry offices are steadily on the increase there he satthe necessary detective attendant on the progress of our national civilization a man who was in this instance at least the legitimate and intelligible product of the vocation that employed him a man professionally ready on the merest suspicion if the merest suspicion paid him to get under our beds and to look through gimletholes in our doors a man who would have been useless to his employers if he could have felt a touch of human sympathy in his fathers presence and who would have deservedly forfeited his situation if under any circumstances whatever he had been personally accessible to a sense of pity or a sense of shame  gently does it old gentleman he repeated lifting the covers from the dishes and looking under them one after the other all round the table gently does it  dont be angry with me jemmy pleaded his father try if you can to think how anxious i must be i got your letter so long ago as yesterday morning i have had to travel all the way from thorpe ambrosei have had to get through the dreadful long evening and the dreadful long nightwith your letter telling me that you had found out who she is and telling me nothing more suspense is very hard to bear jemmy when you come to my age what was it prevented you my dear from coming to me when i got here yesterday evening  a little dinner at richmond said bashwood the younger give me some tea  mr bashwood tried to comply with the request but the hand with which he lifted the teapot trembled so unmanageably that the tea missed the cup and streamed out on the cloth im very sorry i cant help trembling when im anxious said the old man as his son took the teapot out of his hand im afraid you bear me malice jemmy for what happened when i was last in town i own i was obstinate and unreasonable about going back to thorpe ambrose im more sensible now you were quite right in taking it all on yourself as soon as i showed you the veiled lady when we saw her come out of the hotel and you were quite right to send me back the same day to my business in the stewards office at the great house he watched the effect of these concessions on his son and ventured doubtfully on another entreaty if you wont tell me anything else just yet he said faintly will you tell me how you found her out do jemmy do  bashwood the younger looked up from his plate ill tell you that he said the reckoning up of miss gwilt has cost more money and taken more time than i expected and the sooner we come to a settlement about it the sooner we shall get to what you want to know  without a word of expostulation the father laid his dingy old pocketbook and his purse on the table before the son bashwood the younger looked into the purse observed with a contemptuous elevation of the eyebrows that it held no more than a sovereign and some silver and returned it intact the pocketbook on being opened next proved to contain four fivepound notes bashwood the younger transferred three of the notes to his own keeping and handed the pocketbook back to his father with a bow expressive of mock gratitude and sarcastic respect  a thousand thanks he said some of it is for the people at our office and the balance is for myself one of the few stupid things my dear sir that i have done in the course of my life was to write you word when you first consulted me that you might have my services gratis as you see i hasten to repair the error an hour or two at odd times i was ready enough to give you but this business has taken days and has got in the way of other jobs i told you i couldnt be out of pocket by youi put it in my letter as plain as words could say it  yes yes jemmy i dont complain my dear i dont complain never mind the moneytell me how you found her out  besides pursued bashwood the younger proceeding impenetrably with his justification of himself i have given you the benefit of my experience ive done it cheap it would have cost double the money if another man had taken this in hand another man would have kept a watch on mr armadale as well as miss gwilt i have saved you that expense you are certain that mr armadale is bent on marrying her very good in that case while we have our eye on her we have for all useful purposes got our eye on him know where the lady is and you know that the gentleman cant be far off  quite true jemmy but how was it miss gwilt came to give you so much trouble  shes a devilish clever woman said bashwood the younger thats how it was she gave us the slip at a milliners shop we made it all right with the milliner and speculated on the chance of her coming back to try on a gown she had ordered the cleverest women lose the use of their wits in nine cases out of ten where theres a new dress in the case and even miss gwilt was rash enough to go back that was all we wanted one of the women from our office helped to try on her new gown and put her in the right position to be seen by one of our men behind the door he instantly suspected who she was on the strength of what he had been told of her for shes a famous woman in her way of course we didnt trust to that we traced her to her new address and we got a man from scotland yard who was certain to know her if our own mans idea was the right one the man from scotland yard turned milliners lad for the occasion and took her gown home he saw her in the passage and identified her in an instant youre in luck i can tell you miss gwilts a public character if we had had a less notorious woman to deal with she might have cost us weeks of inquiry and you might have had to pay hundreds of pounds a day did it in miss gwilts case and another day put the whole story of her life in black and white into my hand there it is at the present moment old gentleman in my black bag  bashwood the father made straight for the bag with eager eyes and outstretched hand bashwood the son took a little key out of his waistcoat pocket winked shook his head and put the key back again  i havent done breakfast yet he said gently does it my dear sirgently does it  i cant wait cried the old man struggling vainly to preserve his selfcontrol its past nine its a fortnight today since she went to london with mr armadale she may be married to him in a fortnight she may be married to him this morning i cant wait i cant wait  theres no knowing what you can do till you try rejoined bashwood the younger try and youll find you can wait what has become of your curiosity he went on feeding the fire ingeniously with a stick at a time why dont you ask me what i mean by calling miss gwilt a public character why dont you wonder how i came to lay my hand on the story of her life in black and white if youll sit down again ill tell you if you wont i shall confine myself to my breakfast  mr bashwood sighed heavily and went back to his chair  i wish you were not so fond of your joke jemmy he said i wish my dear you were not quite so fond of your joke  joke repeated his son it would be serious enough in some peoples eyes i can tell you miss gwilt has been tried for her life and the papers in that black bag are the lawyers instructions for the defense do you call that a joke  the father started to his feet and looked straight across the table at the son with a smile of exultation that was terrible to see  shes been tried for her life he burst out with a deep gasp of satisfaction shes been tried for her life he broke into a low prolonged laugh and snapped his fingers exultingly ahahaha something to frighten mr armadale in that  scoundrel as he was the son was daunted by the explosion of pentup passion which burst on him in those words  dont excite yourself he said with a sullen suppression of the mocking manner in which he had spoken thus far  mr bashwood sat down again and passed his handkerchief over his forehead no he said nodding and smiling at his son no nono excitement as you sayi can wait now jemmy i can wait now  he waited with immovable patience at intervals he nodded and smiled and whispered to himself something to frighten mr armadale in that but he made no further attempt by word look or action to hurry his son  bashwood the younger finished his breakfast slowly out of pure bravado lit a cigar with the utmost deliberation looked at his father and seeing him still as immovably patient as ever opened the black bag at last and spread the papers on the table  how will you have it he asked long or short i have got her whole life here the counsel who defended her at the trial was instructed to hammer hard at the sympathies of the jury he went head over ears into the miseries of her past career and shocked everybody in court in the most workmanlike manner shall i take the same line do you want to know all about her from the time when she was in short frocks and frilled trousers or do you prefer getting on at once to her first appearance as a prisoner in the dock  i want to know all about her said his father eagerly the worst and the bestthe worst particularly dont spare my feelings jemmywhatever you do dont spare my feelings cant i look at the papers myself  no you cant they would be all greek and hebrew to you thank your stars that you have got a sharp son who can take the pith out of these papers and give it a smack of the right flavor in serving it up there are not ten men in england who could tell you this womans story as i can tell it its a gift old gentleman of the sort that is given to very few peopleand it lodges here  he tapped his forehead smartly and turned to the first page of the manuscript before him with an unconcealed triumph at the prospect of exhibiting his own cleverness which was the first expression of a genuine feeling of any sort that had escaped him yet   miss gwilts story begins said bashwood the younger in the marketplace at thorpe ambrose one day something like a quarter of a century ago a traveling quack doctor who dealt in perfumery as well as medicines came to the town with his cart and exhibited as a living example of the excellence of his washes and hairoils and so on a pretty little girl with a beautiful complexion and wonderful hair his name was oldershaw he had a wife who helped him in the perfumery part of his business and who carried it on by herself after his death she has risen in the world of late years and she is identical with that sly old lady who employed me professionally a short time since as for the pretty little girl you know who she was as well as i do while the quack was haranguing the mob and showing them the childs hair a young lady driving through the marketplace stopped her carriage to hear what it was all about saw the little girl and took a violent fancy to her on the spot the young lady was the daughter of mr blanchard of thorpe ambrose she went home and interested her father in the fate of the innocent little victim of the quack doctor the same evening the oldershaws were sent for to the great house and were questioned they declared themselves to be her uncle and aunta lie of courseand they were quite willing to let her attend the village school while they stayed at thorpe ambrose when the proposal was made to them the new arrangement was carried out the next day and the day after that the oldershaws had disappeared and had left the little girl on the squires hands she evidently hadnt answered as they expected in the capacity of an advertisement and that was the way they took of providing for her for life there is the first act of the play for you clear enough so far isnt it  clear enough jemmy to clever people but im old and slow i dont understand one thing whose child was she  a very sensible question sorry to inform you that nobody can answer itmiss gwilt herself included these instructions that im referring to are founded of course on her own statements sifted by her attorney all she could remember on being questioned was that she was beaten and half starved somewhere in the country by a woman who took in children at nurse the woman had a card with her stating that her name was lydia gwilt and got a yearly allowance for taking care of her paid through a lawyer till she was eight years old at that time the allowance stopped the lawyer had no explanation to offer nobody came to look after her nobody wrote the oldershaws saw her and thought she might answer to exhibit and the woman parted with her for a trifle to the oldershaws and the oldershaws parted with her for good and all to the blanchards thats the story of her birth parentage and education she may be the daughter of a duke or the daughter of a costermonger the circumstances may be highly romantic or utterly commonplace fancy anything you liketheres nothing to stop you when youve had your fancy out say the word and ill turn over the leaves and go on  please to go on jemmyplease to go on  the next glimpse of miss gwilt resumed bashwood the younger turning over the papers is a glimpse at a family mystery the deserted child was in lucks way at last she had taken the fancy of an amiable young lady with a rich father and she was petted and made much of at the great house in the character of miss blanchards last new plaything not long afterward mr blanchard and his daughter went abroad and took the girl with them in the capacity of miss blanchards little maid when they came back the daughter had married and become a widow in the interval and the pretty little maid instead of returning with them to thorpe ambrose turns up suddenly all alone as a pupil at a school in france there she was at a firstrate establishment with her maintenance and education secured until she married and settled in life on this understandingthat she never returned to england those were all the particulars she could be prevailed on to give the lawyer who drew up these instructions she declined to say what had happened abroad she declined even after all the years that had passed to mention her mistresss married name its quite clear of course that she was in possession of some family secret and that the blanchards paid for her schooling on the continent to keep her out of the way and its equally plain that she would never have kept her secret as she did if she had not seen her way to trading on it for her own advantage at some future time a clever woman as ive told you already a devilish clever woman who hasnt been knocked about in the world and seen the ups and downs of life abroad and at home for nothing  yes yes jemmy quite true how long did she stop please at the school in france  bashwood the younger referred to the papers she stopped at the french school he replied till she was seventeen at that time something happened at the school which i find mildly described in these papers as something unpleasant the plain fact was that the musicmaster attached to the establishment fell in love with miss gwilt he was a respectable middleaged man with a wife and family and finding the circumstances entirely hopeless he took a pistol and rashly assuming that he had brains in his head tried to blow them out the doctor saved his life but not his reason he ended where he had better have begun in an asylum miss gwilts beauty having been at the bottom of the scandal it was of course impossiblethough she was proved to have been otherwise quite blameless in the matterfor her to remain at the school after what had happened her friends the blanchards were communicated with and her friends transferred her to another school at brussels this timewhat are you sighing about whats wrong now  i cant help feeling a little for the poor musicmaster jemmy go on  according to her own account of it dad miss gwilt seems to have felt for him too she took a serious turn and was converted as they call it by the lady who had charge of her in the interval before she went to brussels the priest at the belgium school appears to have been a man of some discretion and to have seen that the girls sensibilities were getting into a dangerously excited state before he could quiet her down he fell ill and was succeeded by another priest who was a fanatic you will understand the sort of interest he took in the girl and the way in which he worked on her feelings when i tell you that she announced it as her decision after having been nearly two years at the school to end her days in a convent you may well stare miss gwilt in the character of a nun is the sort of female phenomenon you dont often set eyes on  did she go into the convent asked mr bashwood did they let her go in so friendless and so young with nobody to advise her for the best  the blanchards were consulted as a matter of form pursued bashwood the younger they had no objection to her shutting herself up in a convent as you may well imagine the pleasantest letter they ever had from her ill answer for it was the letter in which she solemnly took leave of them in this world forever the people at the convent were as careful as usual not to commit themselves their rules wouldnt allow her to take the veil till she had tried the life for a year first and then if she had any doubt for another year after that she tried the life for the first year accordingly and doubted she tried it for the second year and was wise enough by that time to give it up without further hesitation her position was rather an awkward one when she found herself at liberty again the sisters at the convent had lost their interest in her the mistress at the school declined to take her back as teacher on the ground that she was too nicelooking for the place the priest considered her to be possessed by the devil there was nothing for it but to write to the blanchards again and ask them to start her in life as a teacher of music on her own account she wrote to her former mistress accordingly her former mistress had evidently doubted the genuineness of the girls resolution to be a nun and had seized the opportunity offered by her entry into the convent to cut off all further communication between her exwaitingmaid and herself miss gwilts letter was returned by the postoffice she caused inquiries to be made and found that mr blanchard was dead and that his daughter had left the great house for some place of retirement unknown the next thing she did upon this was to write to the heir in possession of the estate the letter was answered by his solicitors who were instructed to put the law in force at the first attempt she made to extort money from any member of the family at thorpe ambrose the last chance was to get at the address of her mistresss place of retirement the family bankers to whom she wrote wrote back to say that they were instructed not to give the ladys address to any one applying for it without being previously empowered to do so by the lady herself that last letter settled the questionmiss gwilt could do nothing more with money at her command she might have gone to england and made the blanchards think twice before they carried things with too high a hand not having a halfpenny at command she was helpless without money and without friends you may wonder how she supported herself while the correspondence was going on she supported herself by playing the pianoforte at a low concertroom in brussels the men laid siege to her of course in all directions but they found her insensible as adamant one of these rejected gentlemen was a russian and he was the means of making her acquainted with a countrywoman of his whose name is unpronounceable by english lips let us give her her title and call her the baroness the two women liked each other at their first introduction and a new scene opened in miss gwilts life she became reader and companion to the baroness everything was right everything was smooth on the surface everything was rotten and everything was wrong under it  in what way jemmy please to wait a little and tell me in what way  in this way the baroness was fond of traveling and she had a select set of friends about her who were quite of her way of thinking they went from one city on the continent to another and were such charming people that they picked up acquaintances everywhere the acquaintances were invited to the baronesss receptions and cardtables were invariably a part of the baronesss furniture do you see it now or must i tell you in the strictest confidence that cards were not considered sinful on these festive occasions and that the luck at the end of the evening turned out to be almost invariably on the side of the baroness and her friends swindlers all of them and there isnt a doubt on my mind whatever there may be on yours that miss gwilts manners and appearance made her a valuable member of the society in the capacity of a decoy her own statement is that she was innocent of all knowledge of what really went on that she was quite ignorant of cardplaying that she hadnt such a thing as a respectable friend to turn to in the world and that she honestly liked the baroness for the simple reason that the baroness was a hearty good friend to her from first to last believe that or not as you please for five years she traveled about all over the continent with these cardsharpers in high life and she might have been among them at this moment for anything i know to the contrary if the baroness had not caught a tartar at naples in the shape of a rich traveling englishman named waldron aha that name startles you does it youve read the trial of the famous mrs waldron like the rest of the world and you know who miss gwilt is now without my telling you  he paused and looked at his father in sudden perplexity far from being overwhelmed by the discovery which had just burst on him mr bashwood after the first natural movement of surprise faced his son with a selfpossession which was nothing short of extraordinary under the circumstances there was a new brightness in his eyes and a new color in his face if it had been possible to conceive such a thing of a man in his position he seemed to be absolutely encouraged instead of depressed by what he had just heard go on jemmy he said quietly i am one of the few people who didnt read the trial i only heard of it  still wondering inwardly bashwood the younger recovered himself and went on  you always were and you always will be behind the age he said when we come to the trial i can tell you as much about it as you need know in the meantime we must go back to the baroness and mr waldron for a certain number of nights the englishman let the cardsharpers have it all their own way in other words he paid for the privilege of making himself agreeable to miss gwilt when he thought he had produced the necessary impression on her he exposed the whole confederacy without mercy the police interfered the baroness found herself in prison and miss gwilt was put between the two alternatives of accepting mr waldrons protection or being thrown on the world again she was amazingly virtuous or amazingly clever which you please to mr waldrons astonishment she told him that she could face the prospect of being thrown on the world and that he must address her honorably or leave her forever the end of it was what the end always is where the man is infatuated and the woman is determined to the disgust of his family and friends mr waldron made a virtue of necessity and married her  how old was he asked bashwood the elder eagerly  bashwood the younger burst out laughing he was about old enough daddy to be your son and rich enough to have burst that precious pocketbook of yours with thousandpound notes dont hang your head it wasnt a happy marriage though he was so young and so rich they lived abroad and got on well enough at first he made a new will of course as soon as he was married and provided handsomely for his wife under the tender pressure of the honeymoon but women wear out like other things with time and one fine morning mr waldron woke up with a doubt in his mind whether he had not acted like a fool he was an illtempered man he was discontented with himself and of course he made his wife feel it having begun by quarreling with her he got on to suspecting her and became savagely jealous of every male creature who entered the house they had no incumbrances in the shape of children and they moved from one place to another just as his jealousy inclined him till they moved back to england at last after having been married close on four years he had a lonely old house of his own among the yorkshire moors and there he shut his wife and himself up from every living creature except his servants and his dogs only one result could come of course of treating a highspirited young woman in that way it may be her fate or it may be chance but whenever a woman is desperate there is sure to be a man handy to take advantage of it the man in this case was rather a dark horse as they say on the turf he was a certain captain manuel a native of cuba and according to his own account an exofficer in the spanish navy he had met mr waldrons beautiful wife on the journey back to england had contrived to speak to her in spite of her husbands jealousy and had followed her to her place of imprisonment in mr waldrons house on the moors the captain is described as a clever determined fellowof the daring piratical sortwith the dash of mystery about him that women like  shes not the same as other women interposed mr bashwood suddenly interrupting his son did she his voice failed him and he stopped without bringing the question to an end  did she like the captain suggested bashwood the younger with another laugh according to her own account of it she adored him at the same time her conduct as represented by herself was perfectly innocent considering how carefully her husband watched her the statement incredible as it appears is probably true for six weeks or so they confined themselves to corresponding privately the cuban captain who spoke and wrote english perfectly having contrived to make a gobetween of one of the female servants in the yorkshire house how it might have ended we neednt trouble ourselves to inquiremr waldron himself brought matters to a crisis whether he got wind of the clandestine correspondence or not doesnt appear but this is certain that he came home from a ride one day in a fiercer temper than usual that his wife showed him a sample of that high spirit of hers which he had never yet been able to break and that it ended in his striking her across the face with his ridingwhip ungentlemanly conduct i am afraid we must admit but to all outward appearance the ridingwhip produced the most astonishing results from that moment the lady submitted as she had never submitted before for a fortnight afterward he did what he liked and she never thwarted him he said what he liked and she never uttered a word of protest some men might have suspected this sudden reformation of hiding something dangerous under the surface whether mr waldron looked at it in that light i cant tell you all that is known is that before the mark of the whip was off his wifes face he fell ill and that in two days afterward he was a dead man what do you say to that  i say he deserved it answered mr bashwood striking his hand excitedly on the table as his son paused and looked at him  the doctor who attended the dying man was not of your way of thinking remarked bashwood the younger dryly he called in two other medical men and they all three refused to certify the death the usual legal investigation followed the evidence of the doctors and the evidence of the servants pointed irresistibly in one and the same direction and mrs waldron was committed for trial on the charge of murdering her husband by poison a solicitor in firstrate criminal practice was sent for from london to get up the prisoners defense and these instructions took their form and shape accordinglywhats the matter what do you want now  suddenly rising from his chair mr bashwood stretched across the table and tried to take the papers from his son i want to look at them he burst out eagerly i want to see what they say about the captain from cuba he was at the bottom of it jemmyill swear he was at the bottom of it  nobody doubted that who was in the secret of the case at the time rejoined his son but nobody could prove it sit down again dad and compose yourself theres nothing here about captain manuel but the lawyers private suspicions of him for the counsel to act on or not at the counsels discretion from first to last she persisted in screening the captain at the outset of the business she volunteered two statements to the lawyerboth of which he suspected to be false in the first place she declared that she was innocent of the crime he wasnt surprised of course so far his clients were as a general rule in the habit of deceiving him in that way in the second place while admitting her private correspondence with the cuban captain she declared that the letters on both sides related solely to a proposed elopement to which her husbands barbarous treatment had induced her to consent the lawyer naturally asked to see the letters he has burned all my letters and i have burned all his was the only answer he got it was quite possible that captain manuel might have burned her letters when he heard there was a coroners inquest in the house but it was in her solicitors experience as it is in my experience too that when a woman is fond of a man in ninetynine cases out of a hundred risk or no risk she keeps his letters having his suspicions roused in this way the lawyer privately made some inquiries about the foreign captain and found that he was as short of money as a foreign captain could be at the same time he put some questions to his client about her expectations from her deceased husband she answered in high indignation that a will had been found among her husbands papers privately executed only a few days before his death and leaving her no more out of all his immense fortune than five thousand pounds was there an older will then says the lawyer which the new will revoked yes there was a will that he had given into her own possessiona will made when they were first married leaving his widow well provided for leaving her just ten times as much as the second will left her had she ever mentioned that first will now revoked to captain manuel she saw the trap set for her and said no never without an instants hesitation that reply confirmed the lawyers suspicions he tried to frighten her by declaring that her life might pay the forfeit of her deceiving him in this matter with the usual obstinacy of women she remained just as immovable as ever the captain on his side behaved in the most exemplary manner he confessed to planning the elopement he declared that he had burned all the ladys letters as they reached him out of regard for her reputation he remained in the neighborhood and he volunteered to attend before the magistrates nothing was discovered that could legally connect him with the crime or that could put him into court on the day of the trial in any other capacity than the capacity of a witness i dont believe myself that theres any moral doubt as they call it that manuel knew of the will which left her mistress of fifty thousand pounds and that he was ready and willing in virtue of that circumstance to marry her on mr waldrons death if anybody tempted her to effect her own release from her husband by making herself a widow the captain must have been the man and unless she contrived guarded and watched as she was to get the poison for herself the poison must have come to her in one of the captains letters  i dont believe she used it if it did come to her exclaimed mr bashwood i believe it was the captain himself who poisoned her husband  bashwood the younger without noticing the interruption folded up the instructions for the defense which had now served their purpose put them back in his bag and produced a printed pamphlet in their place  here is one of the published reports of the trial he said which you can read at your leisure if you like we neednt waste time now by going into details i have told you already how cleverly her counsel paved his way for treating the charge of murder as the crowning calamity of the many that had already fallen on an innocent woman the two legal points relied on for the defense after this preliminary flourish were first that there was no evidence to connect her with the possession of poison and secondly that the medical witnesses while positively declaring that her husband had died by poison differed in their conclusions as to the particular drug that had killed him both good points and both well worked but the evidence on the other side bore down everything before it the prisoner was proved to have had no less than three excellent reasons for killing her husband he had treated her with almost unexampled barbarity he had left her in a will unrevoked so far as she knew mistress of a fortune on his death and she was by her own confession contemplating an elopement with another man having set forth these motives the prosecution next showed by evidence which was never once shaken on any single point that the one person in the house who could by any human possibility have administered the poison was the prisoner at the bar what could the judge and jury do with such evidence before them as this the verdict was guilty as a matter of course and the judge declared that he agreed with it the female part of the audience was in hysterics and the male part was not much better the judge sobbed and the bar shuddered she was sentenced to death in such a scene as had never been previously witnessed in an english court of justice and she is alive and hearty at the present moment free to do any mischief she pleases and to poison at her own entire convenience any man woman or child that happens to stand in her way a most interesting woman keep on good terms with her my dear sir whatever you do for the law has said to her in the plainest possible english my charming friend i have no terrors for you  how was she pardoned asked mr bashwood breathlessly they told me at the time but i have forgotten was it the home secretary if it was i respect the home secretary i say the home secretary was deserving of his place  quite right old gentleman rejoined bashwood the younger the home secretary was the obedient humble servant of an enlightened free press and he was deserving of his place is it possible you dont know how she cheated the gallows if you dont i must tell you on the evening of the trial two or three of the young buccaneers of literature went down to two or three newspaper offices and wrote two or three heartrending leading articles on the subject of the proceedings in court the next morning the public caught light like tinder and the prisoner was tried over again before an amateur court of justice in the columns of the newspapers all the people who had no personal experience whatever on the subject seized their pens and rushed by kind permission of the editor into print doctors who had not attended the sick man and who had not been present at the examination of the body declared by dozens that he had died a natural death barristers without business who had not heard the evidence attacked the jury who had heard it and judged the judge who had sat on the bench before some of them were born the general public followed the lead of the barristers and the doctors and the young buccaneers who had set the thing going here was the law that they all paid to protect them actually doing its duty in dreadful earnest shocking shocking the british public rose to protest as one man against the working of its own machinery and the home secretary in a state of distraction went to the judge the judge held firm he had said it was the right verdict at the time and he said so still but suppose says the home secretary that the prosecution had tried some other way of proving her guilty at the trial than the way they did try what would you and the jury have done then of course it was quite impossible for the judge to say this comforted the home secretary to begin with and when he got the judges consent after that to having the conflict of medical evidence submitted to one great doctor and when the one great doctor took the merciful view after expressly stating in the first instance that he knew nothing practically of the merits of the case the home secretary was perfectly satisfied the prisoners deathwarrant went into the wastepaper basket the verdict of the law was reversed by general acclamation and the verdict of the newspapers carried the day but the best of it is to come you know what happened when the people found themselves with the pet object of their sympathy suddenly cast loose on their hands a general impression prevailed directly that she was not quite innocent enough after all to be let out of prison then and there punish her a littlethat was the state of the popular feelingpunish her a little mr home secretary on general moral grounds a small course of gentle legal medicine if you love us and then we shall feel perfectly easy on the subject to the end of our days  dont joke about it cried his father dont dont dont jemmy did they try her again they couldnt they dursnt nobody can be tried twice over for the same offense  pooh pooh she could be tried a second time for a second offense retorted bashwood the youngerand tried she was luckily for the pacification of the public mind she had rushed headlong into redressing her own grievances as women will when she discovered that her husband had cut her down from a legacy of fifty thousand pounds to a legacy of five thousand by a stroke of his pen the day before the inquest a locked drawer in mr waldrons dressingroom table which contained some valuable jewelry was discovered to have been opened and emptied and when the prisoner was committed by the magistrates the precious stones were found torn out of their settings and sewed up in her stays the lady considered it a case of justifiable selfcompensation the law declared it to be a robbery committed on the executors of the dead man the lighter offensewhich had been passed over when such a charge as murder was brought against herwas just the thing to revive to save appearances in the eyes of the public they had stopped the course of justice in the case of the prisoner at one trial and now all they wanted was to set the course of justice going again in the case of the prisoner at another she was arraigned for the robbery after having been pardoned for the murder and what is more if her beauty and her misfortunes hadnt made a strong impression on her lawyer she would not only have had to stand another trial but would have had even the five thousand pounds to which she was entitled by the second will taken away from her as a felon by the crown  i respect her lawyer i admire her lawyer exclaimed mr bashwood i should like to take his hand and tell him so  he wouldnt thank you if you did remarked bashwood the younger he is under a comfortable impression that nobody knows how he saved mrs waldrons legacy for her but himself  i beg your pardon jemmy interposed his father but dont call her mrs waldron speak of her please by her name when she was innocent and young and a girl at school would you mind for my sake calling her miss gwilt  not i it makes no difference to me what name i give her bother your sentiment lets go on with the facts this is what the lawyer did before the second trial came off he told her she would be found guilty again to a dead certainty and this time he said the public will let the law take its course have you got an old friend whom you can trust she hadnt such a thing as an old friend in the world very well then says the lawyer you must trust me sign this paper and you will have executed a fictitious sale of all your property to myself when the right time comes i shall first carefully settle with your husbands executors and i shall then reconvey the money to you securing it properly in case you ever marry again in your own possession the crown in other transactions of this kind frequently waives its right of disputing the validity of the sale and if the crown is no harder on you than on other people when you come out of prison you will have your five thousand pounds to begin the world with again neat of the lawyer when she was going to be tried for robbing the executors to put her up to a way of robbing the crown wasnt it ha ha what a world it is  the last effort of the sons sarcasm passed unheeded by the father in prison he said to himself oh me after all that misery in prison again  yes said bashwood the younger rising and stretching himself thats how it ended the verdict was guilty and the sentence was imprisonment for two years she served her time and came out as well as i can reckon it about three years since if you want to know what she did when she recovered her liberty and how she went on afterward i may be able to tell you something about itsay on another occasion when you have got an extra note or two in your pocketbook for the present all you need know you do know there isnt the shadow of a doubt that this fascinating lady has the double slur on her of having been found guilty of murder and of having served her term of imprisonment for theft theres your moneys worth for your moneywith the whole of my wonderful knack at stating a case clearly thrown in for nothing if you have any gratitude in you you ought to do something handsome one of these days for your son but for me ill tell you what you would have done old gentleman if you could have had your own way you would have married miss gwilt  mr bashwood rose to his feet and looked his son steadily in the face  if i could have my own way he said i would marry her now  bashwood the younger started back a step after all i have told you he asked in the blankest astonishment  after all you have told me  with the chance of being poisoned the first time you happened to offend her  with the chance of being poisoned answered mr bashwood in fourandtwenty hours  the spy of the private inquiry office dropped back into his chair cowed by his fathers words and his fathers looks  mad he said to himself stark mad by jingo  mr bashwood looked at his watch and hurriedly took his hat from a sidetable  i should like to hear the rest of it he said i should like to hear every word you have to tell me about her to the very last but the time the dreadful galloping time is getting on for all i know they may be on their way to be married at this very moment  what are you going to do asked bashwood the younger getting between his father and the door  i am going to the hotel said the old man trying to pass him i am going to see mr armadale  what for  to tell him everything you have told me he paused after making that reply the terrible smile of triumph which had once already appeared on his face overspread it again mr armadale is young mr armadale has all his life before him he whispered cunningly with his trembling fingers clutching his sons arm what doesnt frighten me will frighten him  wait a minute said bashwood the younger are you as certain as ever that mr armadale is the man  what man  the man who is going to marry her  yes yes yes let me go jemmylet me go  the spy set his back against the door and considered for a moment mr armadale was richmr armadale if he was not stark mad too might be made to put the right moneyvalue on information that saved him from the disgrace of marrying miss gwilt it may be a hundred pounds in my pocket if i work it myself thought bashwood the younger and it wont be a halfpenny if i leave it to my father he took up his hat and his leather bag can you carry it all in your own addled old head daddy he asked with his easiest impudence of manner not you ill go with you and help you what do you think of that  the father threw his arms in an ecstasy round the sons neck i cant help it jemmy he said in broken tones you are so good to me take the other note my dearill manage without ittake the other note  the son threw open the door with a flourish and magnanimously turned his back on the fathers offered pocketbook hang it old gentleman im not quite so mercenary as that he said with an appearance of the deepest feeling put up your pocketbook and lets be off if i took my respected parents last fivepound note he thought to himself as he led the way downstairs how do i know he mightnt cry halves when he sees the color of mr armadales money come along dad he resumed well take a cab and catch the happy bridegroom before he starts for the church  they hailed a cab in the street and started for the hotel which had been the residence of midwinter and allan during their stay in london the instant the door of the vehicle had closed mr bashwood returned to the subject of miss gwilt  tell me the rest he said taking his sons hand and patting it tenderly lets go on talking about her all the way to the hotel help me through the time jemmyhelp me through the time  bashwood the younger was in high spirits at the prospect of seeing the color of mr armadales money he trifled with his fathers anxiety to the very last  lets see if you remember what ive told you already he began theres a character in the story thats dropped out of it without being accounted for come can you tell me who it is  he had reckoned on finding his father unable to answer the question but mr bashwoods memory for anything that related to miss gwilt was as clear and ready as his sons the foreign scoundrel who tempted her and let her screen him at the risk of her own life he said without an instants hesitation dont speak of him jemmydont speak of him again  i must speak of him retorted the other you want to know what became of miss gwilt when she got out of prison dont you very goodim in a position to tell you she became mrs manuel its no use staring at me old gentleman i know it officially at the latter part of last year a foreign lady came to our place with evidence to prove that she had been lawfully married to captain manuel at a former period of his career when he had visited england for the first time she had only lately discovered that he had been in this country again and she had reason to believe that he had married another woman in scotland our people were employed to make the necessary inquiries comparison of dates showed that the scotch marriageif it was a marriage at all and not a shamhad taken place just about the time when miss gwilt was a free woman again and a little further investigation showed us that the second mrs manuel was no other than the heroine of the famous criminal trialwhom we didnt know then but whom we do know now to be identical with your fascinating friend miss gwilt  mr bashwoods head sank on his breast he clasped his trembling hands fast in each other and waited in silence to hear the rest  cheer up pursued his son she was no more the captains wife than you are and what is more the captain himself is out of your way now one foggy day in december last he gave us the slip and was off to the continent nobody knew where he had spent the whole of the second mrs manuels five thousand pounds in the time that had elapsed between two and three years since she had come out of prison and the wonder was where he had got the money to pay his traveling expenses it turned out that he had got it from the second mrs manuel herself she had filled his empty pockets and there she was waiting confidently in a miserable london lodging to hear from him and join him as soon as he was safely settled in foreign parts where had she got the money you may ask naturally enough nobody could tell at the time my own notion is now that her former mistress must have been still living and that she must have turned her knowledge of the blanchards family secret to profitable account at last this is mere guesswork of course but theres a circumstance that makes it likely guesswork to my mind she had an elderly female friend to apply to at the time who was just the woman to help her in ferreting out her mistresss address can you guess the name of the elderly female friend not you mrs oldershaw of course  mr bashwood suddenly looked up why should she go back he asked to the woman who had deserted her when she was a child  i cant say rejoined his son unless she went back in the interests of her own magnificent head of hair the prisonscissors i neednt tell you had made short work of it with miss gwilts lovelocks in every sense of the word and mrs oldershaw i beg to add is the most eminent woman in england as restorergeneral of the dilapidated heads and faces of the female sex put two and two together and perhaps youll agree with me in this case that they make four  yes yes two and two make four repeated his father impatiently but i want to know something else did she hear from him again did he send for her after he had gone away to foreign parts  the captain why what on earth can you be thinking of hadnt he spent every farthing of her money and wasnt he loose on the continent out of her reach she waited to hear from him i dare say for she persisted in believing in him but ill lay you any wager you like she never saw the sight of his handwriting again we did our best at the office to open her eyes we told her plainly that he had a first wife living and that she hadnt the shadow of a claim on him she wouldnt believe us though we met her with the evidence obstinate devilish obstinate i dare say she waited for months together before she gave up the last hope of ever seeing him again  mr bashwood looked aside quickly out of the cab window where could she turn for refuge next he said not to his son but to himself what in heavens name could she do  judging by my experience of women remarked bashwood the younger overhearing him i should say she probably tried to drown herself but thats only guesswork again its all guesswork at this part of her story you catch me at the end of my evidence dad when you come to miss gwilts proceedings in the spring and summer of the present year she might or she might not have been desperate enough to attempt suicide and she might or she might not have been at the bottom of those inquiries that i made for mrs oldershaw i dare say youll see her this morning and perhaps if you use your influence you may be able to make her finish her own story herself  mr bashwood still looking out of the cab window suddenly laid his hand on his sons arm  hush hush he exclaimed in violent agitation we have got there at last oh jemmy feel how my heart beats here is the hotel  bother your heart said bashwood the younger wait here while i make the inquiries  ill come with you cried his father i cant wait i tell you i cant wait  they went into the hotel together and asked for mr armadale  the answer after some little hesitation and delay was that mr armadale had gone away six days since a second waiter added that mr armadales friendmr midwinterhad only left that morning where had mr armadale gone somewhere into the country where had mr midwinter gone nobody knew  mr bashwood looked at his son in speechless and helpless dismay  stuff and nonsense said bashwood the younger pushing his father back roughly into the cab hes safe enough we shall find him at miss gwilts  the old man took his sons hand and kissed it thank you my dear he said gratefully thank you for comforting me  the cab was driven next to the second lodging which miss gwilt had occupied in the neighborhood of tottenham court road  stop here said the spy getting out and shutting his father into the cab i mean to manage this part of the business myself  he knocked at the house door i have got a note for miss gwilt he said walking into the passage the moment the door was opened  shes gone answered the servant she went away last night  bashwood the younger wasted no more words with the servant he insisted on seeing the mistress the mistress confirmed the announcement of miss gwilts departure on the previous evening where had she gone to the woman couldnt say how had she left on foot at what hour between nine and ten what had she done with her luggage she had no luggage had a gentleman been to see her on the previous day not a soul gentle or simple had come to the house to see miss gwilt  the fathers face pale and wild was looking out of the cab window as the son descended the house steps isnt she there jemmy he asked faintlyisnt she there  hold your tongue cried the spy with the native coarseness of his nature rising to the surface at last im not at the end of my inquiries yet  he crossed the road and entered a coffeeshop situated exactly opposite the house he had just left  in the box nearest the window two men were sitting talking together anxiously  which of you was on duty yesterday evening between nine and ten oclock asked bashwood the younger suddenly joining them and putting his question in a quick peremptory whisper  i was sir said one of the men unwillingly  did you lose sight of the houseyes i see you did  only for a minute sir an infernal blackguard of a soldier came in  that will do said bashwood the younger i know what the soldier did and who sent him to do it she has given us the slip again you are the greatest ass living consider yourself dismissed with those words and with an oath to emphasize them he left the coffeeshop and returned to the cab  shes gone cried his father oh jemmy jemmy i see it in your face he fell back into his own corner of the cab with a faint wailing cry theyre married he moaned to himself his hands falling helplessly on his knees his hat falling unregarded from his head stop them he exclaimed suddenly rousing himself and seizing his son in a frenzy by the collar of the coat  go back to the hotel shouted bashwood the younger to the cabman hold your noise he added turning fiercely on his father i want to think  the varnish of smoothness was all off him by this time his temper was roused his prideeven such a man has his pridewas wounded to the quick twice had he matched his wits against a womans and twice the woman had baffled him  he got out on reaching the hotel for the second time and privately tried the servants with the offer of money the result of the experiment satisfied him that they had in this instance really and truly no information to sell after a moments reflection he stopped before leaving the hotel to ask the way to the parish church the chance may be worth trying he thought to himself as he gave the address to the driver faster he called out looking first at his watch and then at his father the minutes are precious this morning and the old one is beginning to give in  it was true still capable of hearing and of understanding mr bashwood was past speaking by this time he clung with both hands to his sons grudging arm and let his head fall helplessly on his sons averted shoulder  the parish church stood back from the street protected by gates and railings and surrounded by a space of open ground shaking off his fathers hold bashwood the younger made straight for the vestry the clerk putting away the books and the clerks assistant hanging up a surplice were the only persons in the room when he entered it and asked leave to look at the marriage register for the day  the clerk gravely opened the book and stood aside from the desk on which it lay  the days register comprised three marriages solemnized that morning and the first two signatures on the page were allan armadale and lydia gwilt  even the spyignorant as he was of the truth unsuspicious as he was of the terrible future consequences to which the act of that morning might leadeven the spy started when his eye first fell on the page it was done come what might of it it was done now there in black and white was the registered evidence of the marriage which was at once a truth in itself and a lie in the conclusion to which it led therethrough the fatal similarity in the namesthere in midwinters own signature was the proof to persuade everybody that not midwinter but allan was the husband of miss gwilt  bashwood the younger closed the book and returned it to the clerk he descended the vestry steps with his hands thrust doggedly into his pockets and with a serious shock inflicted on his professional selfesteem  the beadle met him under the church wall he considered for a moment whether it was worth while to spend a shilling in questioning the man and decided in the affirmative if they could be traced and overtaken there might be a chance of seeing the color of mr armadales money even yet  how long is it he asked since the first couple married here this morning left the church  about an hour said the beadle  how did they go away  the beadle deferred answering that second question until he had first pocketed his fee  you wont trace them from here sir he said when he had got his shilling they went away on foot  and that is all you know about it  that sir is all i know about it  left by himself even the detective of the private inquiry office paused for a moment before he returned to his father at the gate he was roused from his hesitation by the sudden appearance within the church inclosure of the driver of the cab  im afraid the old gentleman is going to be taken ill sir said the man  bashwood the younger frowned angrily and walked back to the cab as he opened the door and looked in his father leaned forward and confronted him with lips that moved speechlessly and with a white stillness over all the rest of his face  shes done us said the spy they were married here this morning  the old mans body swayed for a moment from one side to the other the instant after his eyes closed and his head fell forward toward the front seat of the cab drive to the hospital cried his son hes in a fit this is what comes of putting myself out of my way to please my father he muttered sullenly raising mr bashwoods head and loosening his cravat a nice mornings work upon my soul a nice mornings work  the hospital was near and the house surgeon was at his post  will he come out of it asked bashwood the younger roughly  who are you asked the surgeon sharply on his side  i am his son  i shouldnt have thought it rejoined the surgeon taking the restoratives that were handed to him by the nurse and turning from the son to the father with an air of relief which he was at no pains to conceal yes he added after a minute or two your father will come out of it this time  when can he be moved away from here  he can be moved from the hospital in an hour or two  the spy laid a card on the table ill come back for him or send for him he said i suppose i can go now if i leave my name and address with those words he put on his hat and walked out  hes a brute said the nurse  no said the surgeon quietly hes a man          between nine and ten oclock that night mr bashwood awoke in his bed at the inn in the borough he had slept for some hours since he had been brought back from the hospital and his mind and body were now slowly recovering together  a light was burning on the bedside table and a letter lay on it waiting for him till he was awake it was in his sons handwriting and it contained these words   my dear dadhaving seen you safe out of the hospital and back at your hotel i think i may fairly claim to have done my duty by you and may consider myself free to look after my own affairs business will prevent me from seeing you tonight and i dont think it at all likely i shall be in your neighborhood tomorrow morning my advice to you is to go back to thorpe ambrose and to stick to your employment in the stewards office wherever mr armadale may be he must sooner or later write to you on business i wash my hands of the whole matter mind so far as i am concerned from this time forth but if you like to go on with it my professional opinion is though you couldnt hinder his marriage you may part him from his wife  pray take care of yourself  your affectionate son  james bashwood  the letter dropped from the old mans feeble hands i wish jemmy could have come to see me tonight he thought but its very kind of him to advise me all the same  he turned wearily on the pillow and read the letter a second time yes he said theres nothing left for me but to go back im too poor and too old to hunt after them all by myself he closed his eyes the tears trickled slowly over his wrinkled cheeks ive been a trouble to jemmy he murmured faintly ive been a sad trouble im afraid to poor jemmy in a minute more his weakness overpowered him and he fell asleep again  the clock of the neighboring church struck it was ten as the bell tolled the hour the tidal trainwith midwinter and his wife among the passengerswas speeding nearer and nearer to paris as the bell tolled the hour the watch on board allans outwardbound yacht had sighted the lighthouse off the lands end and had set the course of the vessel for ushant and finisterre  the end of the third book     book the fourth     i miss gwilts diary  naples october 10thit is two months today since i declared that i had closed my diary never to open it again  why have i broken my resolution why have i gone back to this secret friend of my wretchedest and wickedest hours because i am more friendless than ever because i am more lonely than ever though my husband is sitting writing in the next room to me my misery is a womans misery and it will speakhere rather than nowhere to my second self in this book if i have no one else to hear me  how happy i was in the first days that followed our marriage and how happy i made him only two months have passed and that time is a bygone time already i try to think of anything i might have said or done wrongly on my sideof anything he might have said or done wrongly on his and i can remember nothing unworthy of my husband nothing unworthy of myself i cannot even lay my finger on the day when the cloud first rose between us  i could bear it if i loved him less dearly than i do i could conquer the misery of our estrangement if he only showed the change in him as brutally as other men would show it  but this never has happenednever will happen it is not in his nature to inflict suffering on others not a hard word not a hard look escapes him it is only at night when i hear him sighing in his sleep and sometimes when i see him dreaming in the morning hours that i know how hopelessly i am losing the love he once felt for me he hides or tries to hide it in the day for my sake he is all gentleness all kindness but his heart is not on his lips when he kisses me now his hand tells me nothing when it touches mine day after day the hours that he gives to his hateful writing grow longer and longer day after day he becomes more and more silent in the hours that he gives to me  and with all this there is nothing that i can complain ofnothing marked enough to justify me in noticing it his disappointment shrinks from all open confession his resignation collects itself by such fine degrees that even my watchfulness fails to see the growth of it fifty times a day i feel the longing in me to throw my arms round his neck and say for gods sake do anything to me rather than treat me like this and fifty times a day the words are forced back into my heart by the cruel considerateness of his conduct which gives me no excuse for speaking them i thought i had suffered the sharpest pain that i could feel when my first husband laid his whip across my face i thought i knew the worst that despair could do on the day when i knew that the other villain the meaner villain still had cast me off live and learn there is sharper pain than i felt under waldrons whip there is bitterer despair than the despair i knew when manuel deserted me  am i too old for him surely not yet have i lost my beauty not a man passes me in the street but his eyes tell me i am as handsome as ever  ah no no the secret lies deeper than that i have thought and thought about it till a horrible fancy has taken possession of me he has been noble and good in his past life and i have been wicked and disgraced who can tell what a gap that dreadful difference may make between us unknown to him and unknown to me it is folly it is madness but when i lie awake by him in the darkness i ask myself whether any unconscious disclosure of the truth escapes me in the close intimacy that now unites us is there an unutterable something left by the horror of my past life which clings invisibly to me still and is he feeling the influence of it sensibly and yet incomprehensibly to himself oh me is there no purifying power in such love as mine are there plaguespots of past wickedness on my heart which no afterrepentance can wash out  who can tell there is something wrong in our married lifei can only come back to that there is some adverse influence that neither he nor i can trace which is parting us further and further from each other day by day well i suppose i shall be hardened in time and learn to bear it  an open carriage has just driven by my window with a nicely dressed lady in it she had her husband by her side and her children on the seat opposite at the moment when i saw her she was laughing and talking in high spiritsa sparkling lighthearted happy woman ah my lady when you were a few years younger if you had been left to yourself and thrown on the world like me   october 11ththe eleventh day of the month was the day two months since when we were married he said nothing about it to me when we woke nor i to him but i thought i would make it the occasion at breakfasttime of trying to win him back  i dont think i ever took such pains with my toilet before i dont think i ever looked better than i looked when i went downstairs this morning he had breakfasted by himself and i found a little slip of paper on the table with an apology written on it the post to england he said went out that day and his letter to the newspaper must be finished in his place i would have let fifty posts go out rather than breakfast without him i went into his room there he was immersed body and soul in his hateful writing cant you give me a little time this morning i asked he got up with a start certainly if you wish it he never even looked at me as he said the words the very sound of his voice told me that all his interest was centered in the pen that he had just laid down i see you are occupied i said i dont wish it before i had closed the door on him he was back at his desk i have often heard that the wives of authors have been for the most part unhappy women and now i know why  i suppose as i said yesterday i shall learn to bear it what stuff bytheby i seem to have written yesterday how ashamed i should be if anybody saw it but myself i hope the trumpery newspaper he writes for wont succeed i hope his rubbishing letter will be well cut up by some other newspaper as soon as it gets into print  what am i to do with myself all the morning i cant go out its raining if i open the piano i shall disturb the industrious journalist who is scribbling in the next room oh dear it was lonely enough in my lodging in thorpe ambrose but how much lonelier it is here shall i read no books dont interest me i hate the whole tribe of authors i think i shall look back through these pages and live my life over again when i was plotting and planning and finding a new excitement to occupy me in every new hour of the day  he might have looked at me though he was so busy with his writinghe might have said how nicely you are dressed this morning he might have rememberednever mind what all he remembers is the newspaper   twelve oclocki have been reading and thinking and thanks to my diary i have got through an hour  what a time it waswhat a life it was at thorpe ambrose i wonder i kept my senses it makes my heart beat it makes my face flush only to read about it now  the rain still falls and the journalist still scribbles i dont want to think the thoughts of that past time over again and yet what else can i do  supposingi only say supposingi felt now as i felt when i traveled to london with armadale and when i saw my way to his life as plainly as i saw the man himself all through the journey  ill go and look out of the window ill go and count the people as they pass by  a funeral has gone by with the penitents in their black hoods and the wax torches sputtering in the wet and the little bell ringing and the priests droning their monotonous chant a pleasant sight to meet me at the window i shall go back to my diary  supposing i was not the altered woman i ami only say supposinghow would the grand risk that i once thought of running look now i have married midwinter in the name that is really his own and by doing that i have taken the first of those three steps which were once to lead me through armadales life to the fortune and the station of armadales widow no matter how innocent my intentions might have been on the weddingdayand they were innocentthis is one of the unalterable results of the marriage well having taken the first step then whether i would or no howsupposing i meant to take the second step which i donthow would present circumstances stand toward me would they warn me to draw back i wonder or would they encourage me to go on  it will interest me to calculate the chances and i can easily tear the leaf out and destroy it if the prospect looks too encouraging  we are living here for economys sake far away from the expensive english quarter in a suburb of the city on the portici side we have made no traveling acquaintances among our own country people our poverty is against us midwinters shyness is against us and with the women my personal appearance is against us the men from whom my husband gets his information for the newspaper meet him at the cafe and never come here i discourage his bringing any strangers to see me for though years have passed since i was last at naples i cannot be sure that some of the many people i once knew in this place may not be living still the moral of all this is as the childrens storybooks say that not a single witness has come to this house who could declare if any afterinquiry took place in england that midwinter and i had been living here as man and wife so much for present circumstances as they affect me  armadale next has any unforeseen accident led him to communicate with thorpe ambrose has he broken the conditions which the major imposed on him and asserted himself in the character of miss milroys promised husband since i saw him last  nothing of the sort has taken place no unforeseen accident has altered his positionhis tempting positiontoward myself i know all that has happened to him since he left england through the letters which he writes to midwinter and which midwinter shows to me  he has been wrecked to begin with his trumpery little yacht has actually tried to drown him after all and has failed it happened as midwinter warned him it might happen with so small a vessel in a sudden storm they were blown ashore on the coast of portugal the yacht went to pieces but the lives and papers and so on were saved the men have been sent back to bristol with recommendations from their master which have already got them employment on board an outwardbound ship and the master himself is on his way here after stopping first at lisbon and next at gibraltar and trying ineffectually in both places to supply himself with another vessel his third attempt is to be made at naples where there is an english yacht laid up as they call it to be had for sale or hire he has had no occasion to write home since the wreck for he took away from couttss the whole of the large sum of money lodged there for him in circular notes and he has felt no inclination to go back to england himself for with mr brock dead miss milroy at school and midwinter here he has not a living creature in whom he is interested to welcome him if he returned to see us and to see the new yacht are the only two present objects he has in view midwinter has been expecting him for a week past and he may walk into this very room in which i am writing at this very moment for all i know to the contrary  tempting circumstances thesewith all the wrongs i have suffered at his mothers hands and at his still alive in my memory with miss milroy confidently waiting to take her place at the head of his household with my dream of living happy and innocent in midwinters love dispelled forever and with nothing left in its place to help me against myself i wish it wasnt raining i wish i could go out  perhaps something may happen to prevent armadale from coming to naples when he last wrote he was waiting at gibraltar for an english steamer in the mediterranean trade to bring him on here he may get tired of waiting before the steamer comes or he may hear of a yacht at some other place than this a little bird whispers in my ear that it may possibly be the wisest thing he ever did in his life if he breaks his engagement to join us at naples  shall i tear out the leaf on which all these shocking things have been written no my diary is so nicely boundit would be positive barbarity to tear out a leaf let me occupy myself harmlessly with something else what shall it be my dressingcasei will put my dressingcase tidy and polish up the few little things in it which my misfortunes have still left in my possession  i have shut up the dressingcase again the first thing i found in it was armadales shabby present to me on my marriagethe rubbishing little ruby ring that irritated me to begin with the second thing that turned up was my bottle of drops i caught myself measuring the doses with my eye and calculating how many of them would be enough to take a living creature over the borderland between sleep and death why i should have locked the dressingcase in a fright before i had quite completed my calculation i dont know but i did lock it and here i am back again at my diary with nothing absolutely nothing to write about oh the weary day the weary day will nothing happen to excite me a little in this horrible place   october 12thmidwinters allimportant letter to the newspaper was dispatched by the post last night i was foolish enough to suppose that i might be honored by having some of his spare attention bestowed on me today nothing of the sort he had a restless night after all his writing and got up with his head aching and his spirits miserably depressed when he is in this state his favorite remedy is to return to his old vagabond habits and go roaming away by himself nobody knows where he went through the form this morning knowing i had no riding habit of offering to hire a little brokenkneed brute of a pony for me in case i wished to accompany him i preferred remaining at home i will have a handsome horse and a handsome habit or i wont ride at all he went away without attempting to persuade me to change my mind i wouldnt have changed it of course but he might have tried to persuade me all the same  i can open the piano in his absencethat is one comfort and i am in a fine humor for playingthat is another there is a sonata of beethovens i forget the number which always suggests to me the agony of lost spirits in a place of torment come my fingers and thumbs and take me among the lost spirits this morning   october 13thour windows look out on the sea at noon today we saw a steamer coming in with the english flag flying midwinter has gone to the port on the chance that this may be the vessel from gibraltar with armadale on board  two oclockit is the vessel from gibraltar armadale has added one more to the long list of his blunders he has kept his engagement to join us at naples  how will it end now  who knows   october 16thtwo days missed out of my diary i can hardly tell why unless it is that armadale irritates me beyond all endurance the mere sight of him takes me back to thorpe ambrose i fancy i must have been afraid of what i might write about him in the course of the last two days if i indulged myself in the dangerous luxury of opening these pages  this morning i am afraid of nothing and i take up my pen again accordingly  is there any limit i wonder to the brutish stupidity of some men i thought i had discovered armadales limit when i was his neighbor in norfolk but my later experience at naples shows me that i was wrong he is perpetually in and out of this house crossing over to us in a boat from the hotel at santa lucia where he sleeps and he has exactly two subjects of conversationthe yacht for sale in the harbor here and miss milroy yes he selects me as the confidante of his devoted attachment to the majors daughter its so nice to talk to a woman about it that is all the apology he has thought it necessary to make for appealing to my sympathiesmy sympathieson the subject of his darling neelie fifty times a day he is evidently persuaded if he thinks about it at all that i have forgotten as completely as he has forgotten all that once passed between us when i was first at thorpe ambrose such an utter want of the commonest delicacy and the commonest tact in a creature who is to all appearance possessed of a skin and not a hide and who does unless my ears deceive me talk and not bray is really quite incredible when one comes to think of it but it is for all that quite true he asked mehe actually asked me last nighthow many hundreds a year the wife of a rich man could spend on her dress dont put it too low the idiot added with his intolerable grin neelie shall be one of the bestdressed women in england when i have married her and this to me after having had him at my feet and then losing him again through miss milroy this to me with an alpaca gown on and a husband whose income must be helped by a newspaper  i had better not dwell on it any longer i had better think and write of something else  the yacht as a relief from hearing about miss milroy i declare the yacht in the harbor is quite an interesting subject to me she the men call a vessel she and i suppose if the women took an interest in such things they would call a vessel heshe is a beautiful model and her topsides whatever they may be are especially distinguished by being built of mahogany but with these merits she has the defect on the other hand of being oldwhich is a sad drawbackand the crew and the sailingmaster have been paid off and sent home to englandwhich is additionally distressing still if a new crew and a new sailingmaster can be picked up here such a beautiful creature with all her drawbacks is not to be despised it might answer to hire her for a cruise and to see how she behaves if she is of my mind her behavior will rather astonish her new master the cruise will determine what faults she has and what repairs through the unlucky circumstance of her age she really stands in need of and then it will be time to settle whether to buy her outright or not such is armadales conversation when he is not talking of his darling neelie and midwinter who can steal no time from his newspaper work for his wife can steal hours for his friend and can offer them unreservedly to my irresistible rival the new yacht  i shall write no more today if so ladylike a person as i am could feel a tigerish tingling all over her to the very tips of her fingers i should suspect myself of being in that condition at the present moment but with my manners and accomplishments the thing is of course out of the question we all know that a lady has no passions   october 17tha letter for midwinter this morning from the slaveownersi mean the newspaper people in londonwhich has set him at work again harder than ever a visit at luncheontime and another visit at dinnertime from armadale conversation at luncheon about the yacht conversation at dinner about miss milroy i have been honored in regard to that young lady by an invitation to go with armadale tomorrow to the toledo and help him to buy some presents for the beloved object i didnt fly out at himi only made an excuse can words express the astonishment i feel at my own patience no words can express it   october 18tharmadale came to breakfast this morning by way of catching midwinter before he shuts himself up over his work  conversation the same as yesterdays conversation at lunch armadale has made his bargain with the agent for hiring the yacht the agent compassionating his total ignorance of the language has helped him to find an interpreter but cant help him to find a crew the interpreter is civil and willing but doesnt understand the sea midwinters assistance is indispensable and midwinter is requested and consents to work harder than ever so as to make time for helping his friend when the crew is found the merits and defects of the vessel are to be tried by a cruise to sicily with midwinter on board to give his opinion lastly in case she should feel lonely the ladies cabin is most obligingly placed at the disposal of midwinters wife all this was settled at the breakfasttable and it ended with one of armadales neatlyturned compliments addressed to myself i mean to take neelie sailing with me when we are married and you have such good taste you will be able to tell me everything the ladies cabin wants between that time and this  if some women bring such men as this into the world ought other women to allow them to live it is a matter of opinion i think not  what maddens me is to see as i do see plainly that midwinter finds in armadales company and in armadales new yacht a refuge from me he is always in better spirits when armadale is here he forgets me in armadale almost as completely as he forgets me in his work and i bear it what a pattern wife what an excellent christian i am   october 19thnothing new yesterday over again   october 20thone piece of news midwinter is suffering from nervous headache and is working in spite of it to make time for his holiday with his friend   october 21stmidwinter is worse angry and wild and unapproachable after two bad nights and two uninterrupted days at his desk under any other circumstances he would take the warning and leave off but nothing warns him now he is still working as hard as ever for armadales sake how much longer will my patience last   october 22dsigns last night that midwinter is taxing his brains beyond what his brains will bear when he did fall asleep he was frightfully restless groaning and talking and grinding his teeth from some of the words i heard he seemed at one time to be dreaming of his life when he was a boy roaming the country with the dancing dogs at another time he was back again with armadale imprisoned all night on the wrecked ship toward the early morning hours he grew quieter i fell asleep and waking after a short interval found myself alone my first glance round showed me a light burning in midwinters dressingroom i rose softly and went to look at him  he was seated in the great ugly oldfashioned chair which i ordered to be removed into the dressingroom out of the way when we first came here his head lay back and one of his hands hung listlessly over the arm of the chair the other hand was on his lap i stole a little nearer and saw that exhaustion had overpowered him while he was either reading or writing for there were books pens ink and paper on the table before him what had he got up to do secretly at that hour of the morning i looked closer at the papers on the table they were all neatly folded as he usually keeps them with one exception and that exception lying open on the rest was mr brocks letter  i looked round at him again after making this discovery and then noticed for the first time another written paper lying under the hand that rested on his lap there was no moving it away without the risk of waking him part of the open manuscript however was not covered by his hand i looked at it to see what he had secretly stolen away to read besides mr brocks letter and made out enough to tell me that it was the narrative of armadales dream  that second discovery sent me back at once to my bedwith something serious to think of  traveling through france on our way to this place midwinters shyness was conquered for once by a very pleasant manan irish doctorwhom we met in the railway carriage and who quite insisted on being friendly and sociable with us all through the days journey finding that midwinter was devoting himself to literary pursuits our traveling companion warned him not to pass too many hours together at his desk your face tells me more than you think the doctor said if you are ever tempted to overwork your brain you will feel it sooner than most men when you find your nerves playing you strange tricks dont neglect the warningdrop your pen  after my last nights discovery in the dressingroom it looks as if midwinters nerves were beginning already to justify the doctors opinion of them if one of the tricks they are playing him is the trick of tormenting him again with his old superstitious terrors there will be a change in our lives here before long i shall wait curiously to see whether the conviction that we two are destined to bring fatal danger to armadale takes possession of midwinters mind once more if it does i know what will happen he will not stir a step toward helping his friend to find a crew for the yacht and he will certainly refuse to sail with armadale or to let me sail with him on the trial cruise   october 23dmr brocks letter has apparently not lost its influence yet midwinter is working again today and is as anxious as ever for the holidaytime that he is to pass with his friend  two oclockarmadale here as usual eager to know when midwinter will be at his service no definite answer to be given to the question yet seeing that it all depends on midwinters capacity to continue at his desk armadale sat down disappointed he yawned and put his great clumsy hands in his pockets i took up a book the brute didnt understand that i wanted to be left alone he began again on the unendurable subject of miss milroy and of all the fine things she was to have when he married her her own ridinghorse her own ponycarriage her own beautiful little sittingroom upstairs at the great house and so on all that i might have had once miss milroy is to have nowif i let her   six oclockmore of the everlasting armadale half an hour since midwinter came in from his writing giddy and exhausted i had been pining all day for a little music and i knew they were giving norma at the theater here it struck me that an hour or two at the opera might do midwinter good as well as me and i said why not take a box at the san carlo tonight he answered in a dull uninterested manner that he was not rich enough to take a box armadale was present and flourished his wellfilled purse in his usual insufferable way im rich enough old boy and it comes to the same thing with those words he took up his hat and trampled out on his great elephants feet to get the box i looked after him from the window as he went down the street your widow with her twelve hundred a year i thought to myself might take a box at the san carlo whenever she pleased without being beholden to anybody the emptyheaded wretch whistled as he went his way to the theater and tossed his loose silver magnificently to every beggar who ran after him        midnighti am alone again at last have i nerve enough to write the history of this terrible evening just as it has passed i have nerve enough at any rate to turn to a new leaf and try     ii the diary continued   we went to the san carlo armadales stupidity showed itself even in such a simple matter as taking a box he had confounded an opera with a play and had chosen a box close to the stage with the idea that ones chief object at a musical performance is to see the faces of the singers as plainly as possible fortunately for our ears bellinis lovely melodies are for the most part tenderly and delicately accompaniedor the orchestra might have deafened us  i sat back in the box at first well out of sight for it was impossible to be sure that some of my old friends of former days at naples might not be in the theater but the sweet music gradually tempted me out of my seclusion i was so charmed and interested that i leaned forward without knowing it and looked at the stage  i was made aware of my own imprudence by a discovery which for the moment literally chilled my blood one of the singers among the chorus of druids was looking at me while he sang with the rest his head was disguised in the long white hair and the lower part of his face was completely covered with the flowing white beard proper to the character but the eyes with which he looked at me were the eyes of the one man on earth whom i have most reason to dread ever seeing againmanuel  if it had not been for my smellingbottle i believe i should have lost my senses as it was i drew back again into the shadow even armadale noticed the sudden change in me he as well as midwinter asked if i was ill i said i felt the heat but hoped i should be better presently and then leaned back in the box and tried to rally my courage i succeeded in recovering selfpossession enough to be able to look again at the stage without showing myself the next time the chorus appeared there was the man again but to my infinite relief he never looked toward our box a second time this welcome indifference on his part helped to satisfy me that i had seen an extraordinary accidental resemblance and nothing more i still hold to this conclusion after having had leisure to think but my mind would be more completely at ease than it is if i had seen the rest of the mans face without the stage disguises that hid it from all investigation  when the curtain fell on the first act there was a tiresome ballet to be performed according to the absurd italian custom before the opera went on though i had got over my first fright i had been far too seriously startled to feel comfortable in the theater i dreaded all sorts of impossible accidents and when midwinter and armadale put the question to me i told them i was not well enough to stay through the rest of the performance  at the door of the theater armadale proposed to say goodnight but midwinterevidently dreading the evening with measked him to come back to supper if i had no objection i said the necessary words and we all three returned together to this house  ten minutes quiet in my own room assisted by a little dose of eaudecologne and water restored me to myself i joined the men at the suppertable they received my apologies for taking them away from the opera with the complimentary assurance that i had not cost either of them the slightest sacrifice of his own pleasure midwinter declared that he was too completely worn out to care for anything but the two great blessings unattainable at the theater of quiet and fresh air armadale saidwith an englishmans exasperating pride in his own stupidity wherever a matter of art is concernedthat he couldnt make head or tail of the performance the principal disappointment he was good enough to add was mine for i evidently understood foreign music and enjoyed it ladies generally did his darling little neelie  i was in no humor to be persecuted with his darling neelie after what i had gone through at the theater it might have been the irritated state of my nerves or it might have been the eaudecologne flying to my head but the bare mention of the girl seemed to set me in a flame i tried to turn armadales attention in the direction of the suppertable he was much obliged but he had no appetite for more i offered him wine next the wine of the country which is all that our poverty allows us to place on the table he was much obliged again the foreign wine was very little more to his taste than the foreign music but he would take some because i asked him and he would drink my health in the oldfashioned way with his best wishes for the happy time when we should all meet again at thorpe ambrose and when there would be a mistress to welcome me at the great house  was he mad to persist in this way no his face answered for him he was under the impression that he was making himself particularly agreeable to me  i looked at midwinter he might have seen some reason for interfering to change the conversation if he had looked at me in return but he sat silent in his chair irritable and overworked with his eyes on the ground thinking  i got up and went to the window still impenetrable to a sense of his own clumsiness armadale followed me if i had been strong enough to toss him out of the window into the sea i should certainly have done it at that moment not being strong enough i looked steadily at the view over the bay and gave him a hint the broadest and rudest i could think of to go  a lovely night for a walk i said if you are tempted to walk back to the hotel  i doubt if he heard me at any rate i produced no sort of effect on him he stood staring sentimentally at the moonlight andthere is really no other word to express itblew a sigh i felt a presentiment of what was coming unless i stopped his mouth by speaking first  with all your fondness for england i said you must own that we have no such moonlight as that at home  he looked at me vacantly and blew another sigh  i wonder whether it is fine tonight in england as it is here he said i wonder whether my dear little girl at home is looking at the moonlight and thinking of me  i could endure it no longer i flew out at him at last  good heavens mr armadale i exclaimed is there only one subject worth mentioning in the narrow little world you live in im sick to death of miss milroy do pray talk of something else  his great broad stupid face colored up to the roots of his hideous yellow hair i beg your pardon he stammered with a kind of sulky surprise i didnt suppose he stopped confusedly and looked from me to midwinter i understood what the look meant i didnt suppose she could be jealous of miss milroy after marrying you that is what he would have said to midwinter if i had left them alone together in the room  as it was midwinter had heard us before i could speak againbefore armadale could add another wordhe finished his friends uncompleted sentence in a tone that i now heard and with a look that i now saw for the first time  you didnt suppose allan he said that a ladys temper could be so easily provoked  the first bitter word of irony the first hard look of contempt i had ever had from him and armadale the cause of it  my anger suddenly left me something came in its place which steadied me in an instant and took me silently out of the room  i sat down alone in the bedroom i had a few minutes of thought with myself which i dont choose to put into words even in these secret pages i got up and unlockednever mind what i went round to midwinters side of the bed and tookno matter what i took the last thing i did before i left the room was to look at my watch it was halfpast ten armadales usual time for leaving us i went back at once and joined the two men again  i approached armadale goodhumoredly and said to him  no on second thoughts i wont put down what i said to him or what i did afterward im sick of armadale he turns up at every second word i write i shall pass over what happened in the course of the next hourthe hour between halfpast ten and halfpast elevenand take up my story again at the time when armadale had left us can i tell what took place as soon as our visitors back was turned between midwinter and me in our own room why not pass over what happened in that case as well as in the other why agitate myself by writing it down i dont know why do i keep a diary at all why did the clever thief the other day in the english newspaper keep the very thing to convict him in the shape of a record of everything he stole why are we not perfectly reasonable in all that we do why am i not always on my guard and never inconsistent with myself like a wicked character in a novel why why why  i dont care why i must write down what happened between midwinter and me tonight because i must theres a reason that nobody can answermyself included          it was halfpast eleven armadale had gone i had put on my dressinggown and had just sat down to arrange my hair for the night when i was surprised by a knock at the door and midwinter came in  he was frightfully pale his eyes looked at me with a terrible despair in them he never answered when i expressed my surprise at his coming in so much sooner than usual he wouldnt even tell me when i asked the question if he was ill pointing peremptorily to the chair from which i had risen on his entering the room he told me to sit down again and then after a moment added these words i have something serious to say to you  i thought of what i had doneor no of what i had tried to doin that interval between halfpast ten and halfpast eleven which i have left unnoticed in my diaryand the deadly sickness of terror which i never felt at the time came upon me now i sat down again as i had been told without speaking to midwinter and without looking at him  he took a turn up and down the room and then came and stood over me  if allan comes here tomorrow he began and if you see him  his voice faltered and he said no more there was some dreadful grief at his heart that was trying to master him but there are times when his will is a will of iron he took another turn in the room and crushed it down he came back and stood over me again  when allan comes here tomorrow he resumed let him come into my room if he wants to see me i shall tell him that i find it impossible to finish the work i now have on hand as soon as i had hoped and that he must therefore arrange to find a crew for the yacht without any assistance on my part if he comes in his disappointment to appeal to you give him no hope of my being free in time to help him if he waits encourage him to take the best assistance he can get from strangers and to set about manning the yacht without any further delay the more occupation he has to keep him away from this house and the less you encourage him to stay here if he does come the better i shall be pleased dont forget that and dont forget one last direction which i have now to give you when the vessel is ready for sea and when allan invites us to sail with him it is my wish that you should positively decline to go he will try to make you change your mind for i shall of course decline on my side to leave you in this strange house and in this foreign country by yourself no matter what he says let nothing persuade you to alter your decision refuse positively and finally refuse i insist on it to set your foot on the new yacht  he ended quietly and firmly with no faltering in his voice and no signs of hesitation or relenting in his face the sense of surprise which i might otherwise have felt at the strange words he had addressed to me was lost in the sense of relief that they brought to my mind the dread of those other words that i had expected to hear from him left me as suddenly as it had come i could look at him i could speak to him once more  you may depend i answered on my doing exactly what you order me to do must i obey you blindly or may i know your reason for the extraordinary directions you have just given to me  his face darkened and he sat down on the other side of my dressingtable with a heavy hopeless sigh  you may know the reason he said if you wish it he waited a little and considered you have a right to know the reason he resumed for you yourself are concerned in it he waited a little again and again went on i can only explain the strange request i have just made to you in one way he said i must ask you to recall what happened in the next room before allan left us tonight  he looked at me with a strange mixture of expressions in his face at one moment i thought he felt pity for me at another it seemed more like horror of me i began to feel frightened again i waited for his next words in silence  i know that i have been working too hard lately he went on and that my nerves are sadly shaken it is possible in the state i am in now that i may have unconsciously misinterpreted or distorted the circumstances that really took place you will do me a favor if you will test my recollection of what has happened by your own if my fancy has exaggerated anything if my memory is playing me false anywhere i entreat you to stop me and tell me of it  i commanded myself sufficiently to ask what the circumstances were to which he referred and in what way i was personally concerned in them  you were personally concerned in them in this way he answered the circumstances to which i refer began with your speaking to allan about miss milroy in what i thought a very inconsiderate and very impatient manner i am afraid i spoke just as petulantly on my side and i beg your pardon for what i said to you in the irritation of the moment you left the room after a short absence you came back again and made a perfectly proper apology to allan which he received with his usual kindness and sweetness of temper while this went on you and he were both standing by the suppertable and allan resumed some conversation which had already passed between you about the neapolitan wine he said he thought he should learn to like it in time and he asked leave to take another glass of the wine we had on the table am i right so far  the words almost died on my lips but i forced them out and answered him that he was right so far  you took the flask out of allans hand he proceeded you said to him goodhumoredly you know you dont really like the wine mr armadale let me make you something which may be more to your taste i have a recipe of my own for lemonade will you favor me by trying it in those words you made your proposal to him and he accepted it did he also ask leave to look on and learn how the lemonade was made and did you tell him that he would only confuse you and that you would give him the recipe in writing if he wanted it  this time the words did really die on my lips i could only bow my head and answer yes mutely in that way midwinter went on  allan laughed and went to the window to look out at the bay and i went with him after a while allan remarked jocosely that the mere sound of the liquids you were pouring out made him thirsty when he said this i turned round from the window i approached you and said the lemonade took a long time to make you touched me as i was walking away again and handed me the tumbler filled to the brim at the same time allan turned round from the window and i in my turn handed the tumbler to himis there any mistake so far  the quick throbbing of my heart almost choked me i could just shake my headi could do no more  i saw allan raise the tumbler to his lipsdid you see it i saw his face turn white in an instantdid you i saw the glass fall from his hand on the floor i saw him stagger and caught him before he fell are these things true for gods sake search your memory and tell meare these things true  the throbbing at my heart seemed for one breathless instant to stop the next moment something fiery something maddening flew through me i started to my feet with my temper in a flame reckless of all consequences desperate enough to say anything  your questions are an insult your looks are an insult i burst out do you think i tried to poison him  the words rushed out of my lips in spite of me they were the last words under heaven that any woman in such a situation as mine ought to have spoken and yet i spoke them  he rose in alarm and gave me my smellingbottle hush hush he said you too are overwroughtyou too are overexcited by all that has happened tonight you are talking wildly and shockingly good god how can you have so utterly misunderstood me compose yourselfpray compose yourself  he might as well have told a wild animal to compose herself having been mad enough to say the words i was mad enough next to return to the subject of the lemonade in spite of his entreaties to me to be silent  i told you what i had put in the glass the moment mr armadale fainted i went on insisting furiously on defending myself when no attack was made on me i told you i had taken the flask of brandy which you kept at your bedside and mixed some of it with the lemonade how could i know that he had a nervous horror of the smell and taste of brandy didnt he say to me himself when he came to his senses its my fault i ought to have warned you to put no brandy in it didnt he remind you afterward of the time when you and he were in the isle of man together and when the doctor there innocently made the same mistake with him that i made tonight  i laid a great stress on my innocenceand with some reason too whatever else i may be i pride myself on not being a hypocrite i was innocentso far as the brandy was concerned i had put it into the lemonade in pure ignorance of armadales nervous peculiarity to disguise the taste ofnever mind what another of the things i pride myself on is that i never wander from my subject what midwinter said next is what i ought to be writing about now  he looked at me for a moment as if he thought i had taken leave of my senses then he came round to my side of the table and stood over me again  if nothing else will satisfy you that you are entirely misinterpreting my motives he said and that i havent an idea of blaming you in the matterread this  he took a paper from the breastpocket of his coat and spread it open under my eyes it was the narrative of armadales dream  in an instant the whole weight on my mind was lifted off it i felt mistress of myself againi understood him at last  do you know what this is he asked do you remember what i said to you at thorpe ambrose about allans dream i told you then that two out of the three visions had already come true i tell you now that the third vision has been fulfilled in this house tonight  he turned over the leaves of the manuscript and pointed to the lines that he wished me to read  i read these or nearly read these words from the narrative of the dream as midwinter had taken it down from armadales own lips  the darkness opened for the third time and showed me the shadow of the man and the shadow of the woman together the manshade was the nearest the womanshadow stood back from where she stood i heard a sound like the pouring out of a liquid softly i saw her touch the shadow of the man with one hand and give him a glass with the other he took the glass and handed it to me at the moment when i put it to my lips a deadly faintness overcame me when i recovered my senses again the shadows had vanished and the vision was at an end  for the moment i was as completely staggered by this extraordinary coincidence as midwinter himself  he put one hand on the open narrative and laid the other heavily on my arm  now do you understand my motive in coming here he asked now do you see that the last hope i had to cling to was the hope that your memory of the nights events might prove my memory to be wrong now do you know why i wont help allan why i wont sail with him why i am plotting and lying and making you plot and lie too to keep my best and dearest friend out of the house  have you forgotten mr brocks letter i asked  he struck his hand passionately on the open manuscript if mr brook had lived to see what we have seen tonight he would have felt what i feel he would have said what i say his voice sank mysteriously and his great black eyes glittered at me as he made that answer thrice the shadows of the vision warned allan in his sleep he went on and thrice those shadows have been embodied in the aftertime by you and by me you and no other stood in the womans place at the pool i and no other stood in the mans place at the window and you and i together when the last vision showed the shadows together stand in the mans place and the womans place still for this the miserable day dawned when you and i first met for this your influence drew me to you when my better angel warned me to fly the sight of your face there is a curse on our lives there is a fatality in our footsteps allans future depends on his separation from us at once and forever drive him from the place we live in and the air we breathe force him among strangersthe worst and wickedest of them will be more harmless to him than we are let his yacht sail though he goes on his knees to ask us without you and without me and let him know how i loved him in another world than this where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest  his grief conquered him his voice broke into a sob when he spoke those last words he took the narrative of the dream from the table and left me as abruptly as he had come in  as i heard his door locked between us my mind went back to what he had said to me about myself in remembering the miserable day when we first saw each other and the better angel that had warned him to fly the sight of my face i forgot all else it doesnt matter what i felti wouldnt own it even if i had a friend to speak to who cares for the misery of such a woman as i am who believes in it besides he spoke under the influence of a mad superstition that has got possession of him again there is every excuse for himthere is no excuse for me if i cant help being fond of him through it all i must take the consequences and suffer i deserve to suffer i deserve neither love nor pity from anybodygood heavens what a fool i am and how unnatural all this would be if it was written in a book  it has struck one i can hear midwinter still pacing to and fro in his room  he is thinking i suppose well i can think too what am i to do next i shall wait and see events take odd turns sometimes and events may justify the fatalism of the amiable man in the next room who curses the day when he first saw my face he may live to curse it for other reasons than he has now if i am the woman pointed at in the dream there will be another temptation put in my way before long and there will be no brandy in armadales lemonade if i mix it for him a second time   october 24thbarely twelve hours have passed since i wrote my yesterdays entry and that other temptation has come tried amid conquered me already  this time there was no alternative instant exposure and ruin stared me in the face i had no choice but to yield in my own defense in plainer words still it was no accidental resemblance that startled me at the theater last night the chorussinger at the opera was manuel himself  not ten minutes after midwinter had left the sittingroom for his study the woman of the house came in with a dirty little threecornered note in her hand one look at the writing on the address was enough he had recognized me in the box and the ballet between the acts of the opera had given him time to trace me home i drew that plain conclusion in the moment that elapsed before i opened the letter it informed me in two lines that he was waiting in a bystreet leading to the beach and that if i failed to make my appearance in ten minutes he should interpret my absence as my invitation to him to call at the house  what i went through yesterday must have hardened me i suppose at any rate after reading the letter i felt more like the woman i once was than i have felt for months past i put on my bonnet and went downstairs and left the house as if nothing had happened  he was waiting for me at the entrance to the street  in the instant when we stood face to face all my wretched life with him came back to me i thought of my trust that he had betrayed i thought of the cruel mockery of a marriage that he had practiced on me when he knew that he had a wife living i thought of the time when i had felt despair enough at his desertion of me to attempt my own life when i recalled all this and when the comparison between midwinter and the mean miserable villain whom i had once believed in forced itself into my mind i knew for the first time what a woman feels when every atom of respect for herself has left her if he had personally insulted me at that moment i believe i should have submitted to it  but he had no idea of insulting me in the more brutal meaning of the word he had me at his mercy and his way of making me feel it was to behave with an elaborate mockery of penitence and respect i let him speak as he pleased without interrupting him without looking at him a second time without even allowing my dress to touch him as we walked together toward the quieter part of the beach i had noticed the wretched state of his clothes and the greedy glitter in his eyes in my first look at him and i knew it would endas it did endin a demand on me for money  yes after taking from me the last farthing i possessed of my own and the last farthing i could extort for him from my old mistress he turned on me as we stood by the margin of the sea and asked if i could reconcile it to my conscience to let him be wearing such a coat as he then had on his back and earning his miserable living as a chorussinger at the opera  my disgust rather than my indignation roused me into speaking to him at last  you want money i said suppose i am too poor to give it to you  in that case he replied i shall be forced to remember that you are a treasure in yourself and i shall be under the painful necessity of pressing my claim to you on the attention of one of those two gentlemen whom i saw with you at the operathe gentleman of course who is now honored by your preference and who lives provisionally in the light of your smiles  i made him no answer for i had no answer to give disputing his right to claim me from anybody would have been a mere waste of words he knew as well as i did that he had not the shadow of a claim on me but the mere attempt to raise it would as he was well aware lead necessarily to the exposure of my whole past life  still keeping silence i looked out over the sea i dont know why except that i instinctively looked anywhere rather than look at him  a little sailingboat was approaching the shore the man steering was hidden from me by the sail but the boat was so near that i thought i recognized the flag on the mast i looked at my watch yes it was armadale coming over from santa lucia at his usual time to visit us in his usual way  before i had put my watch back in my belt the means of extricating myself from the frightful position i was placed in showed themselves to me as plainly as i see them now  i turned and led the way to the higher part of the beach where some fishingboats were drawn up which completely screened us from the view of any one landing on the shore below seeing probably that i had a purpose of some kind manuel followed me without uttering a word as soon as we were safely under the shelter of the boats i forced myself in my own defense to look at him again  what should you say i asked if i was rich instead of poor what should you say if i could afford to give you a hundred pounds  he started i saw plainly that he had not expected so much as half the sum i had mentioned it is needless to add that his tongue lied while his face spoke the truth and that when he replied to me the answer was nothing like enough  suppose i went on without taking any notice of what he had said that i could show you a way of helping yourself to twice as muchthree times as muchfive times as much as a hundred pounds are you bold enough to put out your hand and take it  the greedy glitter came into his eyes once more his voice dropped low in breathless expectation of my next words  who is the person he asked and what is the risk  i answered him at once in the plainest terms i threw armadale to him as i might have thrown a piece of meat to a wild beast who was pursuing me  the person is a rich young englishman i said he has just hired the yacht called the dorothea in the harbor here and he stands in need of a sailingmaster and a crew you were once an officer in the spanish navyyou speak english and italian perfectlyyou are thoroughly well acquainted with naples and all that belongs to it the rich young englishman is ignorant of the language and the interpreter who assists him knows nothing of the sea he is at his wits end for want of useful help in this strange place he has no more knowledge of the world than that child who is digging holes with a stick there in the sand and he carries all his money with him in circular notes so much for the person as for the risk estimate it for yourself  the greedy glitter in his eyes grew brighter and brighter with every word i said he was plainly ready to face the risk before i had done speaking  when can i see the englishman he asked eagerly  i moved to the seaward end of the fishingboat and saw that armadale was at that moment disembarking on the shore  you can see him now i answered and pointed to the place  after a long look at armadale walking carelessly up the slope of the beach manuel drew back again under the shelter of the boat he waited a moment considering something carefully with himself and put another question to me in a whisper this time  when the vessel is manned he said and the englishman sails from naples how many friends sail with him  he has but two friends here i replied that other gentleman whom you saw with me at the opera and myself he will invite us both to sail with him and when the time comes we shall both refuse  do you answer for that  i answer for it positively  he walked a few steps away and stood with his face hidden from me thinking again all i could see was that he took off his hat and passed his handkerchief over his forehead all i could hear was that he talked to himself excitedly in his own language  there was a change in him when he came back his face had turned to a livid yellow and his eyes looked at me with a hideous distrust  one last question he said and suddenly came closer to me suddenly spoke with a marked emphasis on his next words what is your interest in this  i started back from him the question reminded me that i had an interest in the matter which was entirely unconnected with the interest of keeping manuel and midwinter apart thus far i had only remembered that midwinters fatalism had smoothed the way for me by abandoning armadale beforehand to any stranger who might come forward to help him thus far the sole object i had kept in view was to protect myself by the sacrifice of armadale from the exposure that threatened me i tell no lies to my diary i dont affect to have felt a moments consideration for the interests of armadales purse or the safety of armadales life i hated him too savagely to care what pitfalls my tongue might be the means of opening under his feet but i certainly did not see until that last question was put to me that in serving his own designs manuel mightif he dared go all lengths for the moneybe serving my designs too the one overpowering anxiety to protect myself from exposure before midwinter had i suppose filled all my mind to the exclusion of everything else  finding that i made no reply for the moment manuel reiterated his question putting it in a new form  you have cast your englishman at me he said like the sop to cerberus would you have been quite so ready to do that if you had not had a motive of your own i repeat my question you have an interest in thiswhat is it  i have two interests i answered the interest of forcing you to respect my position here and the interest of ridding myself of the sight of you at once and forever i spoke with a boldness he had not yet heard from me the sense that i was making the villain an instrument in my hands and forcing him to help my purpose blindly while he was helping his own roused my spirits and made me feel like myself again  he laughed strong language on certain occasions is a ladys privilege he said you may or may not rid yourself of the sight of me at once and forever we will leave that question to be settled in the future but your other interest in this matter puzzles me you have told me all i need know about the englishman and his yacht and you have made no conditions before you opened your lips pray how are you to force me as you say to respect your position here  i will tell you how i rejoined you shall hear my conditions first i insist on your leaving me in five minutes more i insist on your never again coming near the house where i live and i forbid your attempting to communicate in any way either with me or with that other gentleman whom you saw with me at the theater  and suppose i say no he interposed in that case what will you do  in that case i answered i shall say two words in private to the rich young englishman and you will find yourself back again among the chorus at the opera  you are a bold woman to take it for granted that i have my designs on the englishman already and that i am certain to succeed in them how do you know  i know you i said and that is enough  there was a moments silence between us he looked at me and i looked at him we understood each other  he was the first to speak the villainous smile died out of his face and his voice dropped again distrustfully to its lowest tones  i accept your terms he said as long as your lips are closed my lips shall be closed tooexcept in the event of my finding that you have deceived me in which case the bargain is at an end and you will see me again i shall present myself to the englishman tomorrow with the necessary credentials to establish me in his confidence tell me his name  i told it  give me his address  i gave it and turned to leave him before i had stepped out of the shelter of the boats i heard him behind me again  one last word he said accidents sometimes happen at sea have you interest enough in the englishmanif an accident happens in his caseto wish to know what has become of him  i stopped and considered on my side i had plainly failed to persuade him that i had no secret to serve in placing armadales money and as a probable consequence armadales life at his mercy and it was now equally clear that he was cunningly attempting to associate himself with my private objects whatever they might be by opening a means of communication between us in the future there could be no hesitation about how to answer him under such circumstances as these if the accident at which he hinted did really happen to armadale i stood in no need of manuels intervention to give me the intelligence of it an easy search through the obituary columns of the english papers would tell me the newswith the great additional advantage that the papers might be relied on in such a matter as this to tell the truth i formally thanked manuel and declined to accept his proposal having no interest in the englishman i said i have no wish whatever to know what becomes of him  he looked at me for a moment with steady attention and with an interest in me which he had not shown yet  what the game you are playing may be he rejoined speaking slowly and significantly i dont pretend to know but i venture on a prophecy neverthelessyou will win it if we ever meet again remember i said that he took off his hat and bowed to me gravely go your way madam and leave me to go mine  with those words he released me from the sight of him i waited a minute alone to recover myself in the air and then returned to the house  the first object that met my eyes on entering the sittingroom wasarmadale himself  he was waiting on the chance of seeing me to beg that i would exert my influence with his friend i made the needful inquiry as to what he meant and found that midwinter had spoken as he had warned me he would speak when he and armadale next met he had announced that he was unable to finish his work for the newspaper as soon as he had hoped and he had advised armadale to find a crew for the yacht without waiting for any assistance on his part  all that it was necessary for me to do on hearing this was to perform the promise i had made to midwinter when he gave me my directions how to act in the matter armadales vexation on finding me resolved not to interfere expressed itself in the form of all others that is most personally offensive to me he declined to believe my reiterated assurances that i possessed no influence to exert in his favor if i was married to neelie he said she could do anything she liked with me and i am sure when you choose you can do anything you like with midwinter if the infatuated fool had actually tried to stifle the last faint struggles of remorse and pity left stirring in my heart he could have said nothing more fatally to the purpose than this i gave him a look which effectually silenced him so far as i was concerned he went out of the room grumbling and growling to himself its all very well to talk about manning the yacht i dont speak a word of their gibberish here and the interpreter thinks a fisherman and a sailor means the same thing hang me if i know what to do with the vessel now i have got her  he will probably know by tomorrow and if he only comes here as usual i shall know too   october 25thten at nightmanuel has got him  he has just left us after staying here more than an hour and talking the whole time of nothing but his own wonderful luck in finding the very help he wanted at the time when he needed it most  at noon today he was on the mole it seems with his interpreter trying vainly to make himself understood by the vagabond population of the waterside just as he was giving it up in despair a stranger standing by manuel had followed him i suppose to the mole from his hotel kindly interfered to put things right he said i speak your language and their language sir i know naples well and i have been professionally accustomed to the sea can i help you the inevitable result followed armadale shifted all his difficulties on to the shoulders of the polite stranger in his usual helpless headlong way his new friend however insisted in the most honorable manner on complying with the customary formalities before he would consent to take the matter into his own hands he begged leave to wait on mr armadale with his testimonials to character and capacity the same afternoon he had come by appointment to the hotel with all his papers and with the saddest story of his sufferings and privations as a political refugee that armadale had ever heard the interview was decisive manuel left the hotel commissioned to find a crew for the yacht and to fill the post of sailingmaster on the trial cruise  i watched midwinter anxiously while armadale was telling us these particulars and afterward when he produced the new sailingmasters testimonials which he had brought with him for his friend to see  for the moment midwinters superstitious misgivings seemed to be all lost in his natural anxiety for his friend he examined the strangers papersafter having told me that the sooner armadale was in the hands of strangers the betterwith the closest scrutiny and the most businesslike distrust it is needless to say that the credentials were as perfectly regular and satisfactory as credentials could be when midwinter handed them back his color rose he seemed to feel the inconsistency of his conduct and to observe for the first time that i was present noticing it there is nothing to object to in the testimonials allan i am glad you have got the help you want at last that was all he said at parting as soon as armadales back was turned i saw no more of him he has locked himself up again for the night in his own room  there is nowso far as i am concernedbut one anxiety left when the yacht is ready for sea and when i decline to occupy the ladys cabin will midwinter hold to his resolution and refuse to sail without me   october 26thwarnings already of the coming ordeal a letter from armadale to midwinter which midwinter has just sent in to me here it is  dear midi am too busy to come today get on with your work for heavens sake the new sailingmaster is a man of ten thousand he has got an englishman whom he knows to serve as mate on board already and he is positively certain of getting the crew together in three or four days time i am dying for a whiff of the sea and so are you or you are no sailor the rigging is set up the stores are coming on board and we shall bend the sails tomorrow or next day i never was in such spirits in my life remember me to your wife and tell her she will be doing me a favor if she will come at once and order everything she wants in the ladys cabin yours affectionately a a  under this was written in midwinters hand remember what i told you write it will break it to him more gently in that way and beg him to accept your apologies and to excuse you from sailing on the trial cruise  i have written without a moments loss of time the sooner manuel knows which he is certain to do through armadale that the promise not to sail in the yacht is performed already so far as i am concerned the safer i shall feel   october 27tha letter from armadale in answer to mine he is full of ceremonious regrets at the loss of my company on the cruise and he politely hopes that midwinter may yet induce me to alter my mind wait a little till he finds that midwinter wont sail with him either  october 30thnothing new to record until today today the change in our lives here has come at last  armadale presented himself this morning in his noisiest high spirits to announce that the yacht was ready for sea and to ask when midwinter would be able to go on board i told him to make the inquiry himself in midwinters room he left me with a last request that i would consider my refusal to sail with him i answered by a last apology for persisting in my resolution and then took a chair alone at the window to wait the event of the interview in the next room  my whole future depended now on what passed between midwinter and his friend everything had gone smoothly up to this time the one danger to dread was the danger of midwinters resolution or rather of midwinters fatalism giving way at the last moment if he allowed himself to be persuaded into accompanying armadale on the cruise manuels exasperation against me would hesitate at nothinghe would remember that i had answered to him for armadales sailing from naples alone and he would be capable of exposing my whole past life to midwinter before the vessel left the port as i thought of this and as the slow minutes followed each other and nothing reached my ears but the hum of voices in the next room my suspense became almost unendurable it was vain to try and fix my attention on what was going on in the street i sat looking mechanically out of the window and seeing nothing  suddenlyi cant say in how long or how short a timethe hum of voices ceased the door opened and armadale showed himself on the threshold alone  i wish you goodby he said roughly and i hope when i am married my wife may never cause midwinter the disappointment that midwinters wife has caused me  he gave me an angry look and made me an angry bow and turning sharply left the room  i saw the people in the street again i saw the calm sea and the masts of the shipping in the harbor where the yacht lay i could think i could breathe freely once more the words that saved me from manuelthe words that might be armadales sentence of deathhad been spoken the yacht was to sail without midwinter as well as without me  my first feeling of exultation was almost maddening but it was the feeling of a moment only my heart sank in me again when i thought of midwinter alone in the next room  i went out into the passage to listen and heard nothing i tapped gently at his door and got no answer i opened the door and looked in he was sitting at the table with his face hidden in his hands i looked at him in silence and saw the glistening of the tears as they trickled through his fingers  leave me he said without moving his hands i must get over it by myself  i went back into the sittingroom who can understand women we dont even understand ourselves his sending me away from him in that manner cut me to the heart i dont believe the most harmless and most gentle woman living could have felt it more acutely than i felt it and this after what i have been doing this after what i was thinking of the moment before i went into his room who can account for it nobodyi least of all  half an hour later his door opened and i heard him hurrying down the stairs i ran on without waiting to think and asked if i might go with him he neither stopped nor answered i went back to the window and saw him pass walking rapidly away with his back turned on naples and the sea  i can understand now that he might not have heard me at the time i thought him inexcusably and brutally unkind to me i put on my bonnet in a frenzy of rage with him i sent out for a carriage and told the man to take me where he liked he took me as he took other strangers to the museum to see the statues and the pictures i flounced from room to room with my face in a flame and the people all staring at me i came to myself again i dont know how i returned to the carriage and made the man drive me back in a violent hurry i dont know why i tossed off my cloak and bonnet and sat down once more at the window the sight of the sea cooled me i forgot midwinter and thought of armadale and his yacht there wasnt a breath of wind there wasnt a cloud in the sky the wide waters of the bay were as smooth as the surface of a glass  the sun sank the short twilight came and went i had some tea and sat at the table thinking and dreaming over it when i roused myself and went back to the window the moon was up but the quiet sea was as quiet as ever  i was still looking out when i saw midwinter in the street below coming back i was composed enough by this time to remember his habits and to guess that he had been trying to relieve the oppression on his mind by one of his long solitary walks when i heard him go into his own room i was too prudent to disturb him again i waited his pleasure where i was  before long i heard his window opened and i saw him from my window step into the balcony and after a look at the sea hold up his hand to the air i was too stupid for the moment to remember that he had once been a sailor and to know what this meant i waited and wondered what would happen next  he went in again and after an interval came out once more and held up his hand as before to the air this time he waited leaning on the balcony rail and looking out steadily with all his attention absorbed by the sea  for a long long time he never moved then on a sudden i saw him start the next moment he sank on his knees with his clasped hands resting on the balcony rail god almighty bless and keep you allan he said fervently goodby forever  i looked out to the sea a soft steady breeze was blowing and the rippled surface of the water was sparkling in the quiet moonlight i looked again and there passed slowly between me and the track of the moon a long black vessel with tall shadowy ghostlike sails gliding smooth and noiseless through the water like a snake  the wind had come fair with the night and armadales yacht had sailed on the trial cruise     iii the diary broken off  london november 19thi am alone again in the great city alone for the first time since our marriage nearly a week since i started on my homeward journey leaving midwinter behind me at turin  the days have been so full of events since the month began and i have been so harassed in mind and body both for the greater part of the time that my diary has been wretchedly neglected a few notes written in such hurry and confusion that i can hardly understand them myself are all that i possess to remind me of what has happened since the night when armadales yacht left naples let me try if i can set this right without more loss or time let me try if i can recall the circumstances in their order as they have followed each other from the beginning of the month  on the 3d of novemberbeing then still at naplesmidwinter received a hurried letter from armadale date messina the weather he said had been lovely and the yacht had made one of the quickest passages on record the crew were rather a rough set to look at but captain manuel and his english mate the latter described as the best of good fellows managed them admirably after this prosperous beginning armadale had arranged as a matter of course to prolong the cruise and at the sailingmasters suggestion he had decided to visit some of the ports in the adriatic which the captain had described as full of character and well worth seeing  a postscript followed explaining that armadale had written in a hurry to catch the steamer to naples and that he had opened his letter again before sending it off to add something that he had forgotten on the day before the yacht sailed he had been at the bankers to get a few hundreds in gold and he believed he had left his cigarcase there it was an old friend of his and he begged that midwinter would oblige him by endeavoring recover it and keeping it for him till they met again  that was the substance of the letter  i thought over it carefully when midwinter had left me alone again after reading it my idea was then and is still that manuel had not persuaded armadale to cruise in a sea like the adriatic so much less frequented by ships than the mediterranean for nothing the terms too in which the trifling loss of the cigarcase was mentioned struck me as being equally suggestive of what was coming i concluded that armadales circular notes had not been transformed into those few hundreds in gold through any forethought or business knowledge of his own manuels influence i suspected had been exerted in this matter also and once more not without reason at intervals through the wakeful night these considerations came back again and again to me and time after time they pointed obstinately so far as my next movements were concerned in one and the same waythe way back to england  how to get there and especially how to get there unaccompanied by midwinter was more than i had wit enough to discover that night i tried and tried to meet the difficulty and fell asleep exhausted toward the morning without having met it  some hours later as soon as i was dressed midwinter came in with news received by that mornings post from his employers in london the proprietors of the newspaper had received from the editor so favorable a report of his correspondence from naples that they had determined on advancing him to a place of greater responsibility and greater emolument at turin his instructions were inclosed in the letter and he was requested to lose no time in leaving naples for his new post  on hearing this i relieved his mind before he could put the question of all anxiety about my willingness to remove turin had the great attraction in my eyes of being on the road to england i assured him at once that i was ready to travel as soon as he pleased  he thanked me for suiting myself to his plans with more of his old gentleness and kindness than i had seen in him for some time past the good news from armadale on the previous day seemed to have roused him a little from the dull despair in which he had been sunk since the sailing of the yacht and now the prospect of advancement in his profession and more than that the prospect of leaving the fatal place in which the third vision of the dream had come true had as he owned himself additionally cheered and relieved him he asked before he went away to make the arrangements for our journey whether i expected to hear from my family in england and whether he should give instructions for the forwarding of my letters with his own to the poste restante at turin i instantly thanked him and accepted the offer his proposal had suggested to me the moment he made it that my fictitious family circumstances might be turned to good account once more as a reason for unexpectedly summoning me from italy to england  on the ninth of the month we were installed at turin  on the thirteenth midwinterbeing then very busyasked if i would save him a loss of time by applying for any letters which might have followed us from naples i had been waiting for the opportunity he now offered me and i determined to snatch at it without allowing myself time to hesitate there were no letters at the poste restante for either of us but when he put the question on my return i told him that there had been a letter for me with alarming news from home my mother was dangerously ill and i was entreated to lose no time in hurrying back to england to see her  it seems quite unaccountablenow that i am away from himbut it is none the less true that i could not even yet tell him a downright premeditated falsehood without a sense of shrinking and shame which other people would think and which i think myself utterly inconsistent with such a character as mine inconsistent or not i felt it and what is strangerperhaps i ought to say madderstill if he had persisted in his first resolution to accompany me himself to england rather than allow me to travel alone i firmly believe i should have turned my back on temptation for the second time and have lulled myself to rest once more in the old dream of living out my life happy and harmless in my husbands love  am i deceiving myself in this it doesnt matteri dare say i am never mind what might have happened what did happen is the only thing of any importance now  it ended in midwinters letting me persuade him that i was old enough to take care of myself on the journey to england and that he owed it to the newspaper people who had trusted their interests in his hands not to leave turin just as he was established there he didnt suffer at taking leave of me as he suffered when he saw the last of his friend i saw that and set down the anxiety he expressed that i should write to him at its proper value i have quite got over my weakness for him at last no man who really loved me would have put what he owed to a peck of newspaper people before what he owed to his wife i hate him for letting me convince him i believe he was glad to get rid of me i believe he has seen some woman whom he likes at turin well let him follow his new fancy if he pleases i shall be the widow of mr armadale of thorpe ambrose before long and what will his likes or dislikes matter to me then  the events on the journey were not worth mentioning and my arrival in london stands recorded already on the top of the new page  as for today the one thing of any importance that i have done since i got to the cheap and quiet hotel at which i am now staying has been to send for the landlord and ask him to help me to a sight of the back numbers of the times newspaper he has politely offered to accompany me himself tomorrow morning to some place in the city where all the papers are kept as he calls it in file till tomorrow then i must control my impatience for news of armadale as well as i can and so goodnight to the pretty reflection of myself that appears in these pages   november 20thnot a word of news yet either in the obituary column or in any other part of the paper i looked carefully through each number in succession dating from the day when armadales letter was written at messina to this present 20th of the month and i am certain whatever may have happened that nothing is known in england as yet patience the newspaper is to meet me at the breakfasttable every morning till further notice and any day now may show me what i most want to see   november 21stno news again i wrote to midwinter today to keep up appearances  when the letter was done i fell into wretchedly low spiritsi cant imagine whyand felt such a longing for a little company that in despair of knowing where else to go i actually went to pimlico on the chance that mother oldershaw might have returned to her old quarters  there were changes since i had seen the place during my former stay in london doctor downwards side of the house was still empty but the shop was being brightened up for the occupation of a milliner and dressmaker the people when i went in to make inquiries were all strangers to me they showed however no hesitation in giving me mrs oldershaws address when i asked for itfrom which i infer that the little difficulty which forced her to be in hiding in august last is at an end so far as she is concerned as for the doctor the people at the shop either were or pretended to be quite unable to tell me what had become of him  i dont know whether it was the sight of the place at pimlico that sickened me or whether it was my own perversity or what but now that i had got mrs oldershaws address i felt as if she was the very last person in the world that i wanted to see i took a cab and told the man to drive to the street she lived in and then told him to drive back to the hotel i hardly know what is the matter with meunless it is that i am getting more impatient every hour for information about armadale when will the future look a little less dark i wonder tomorrow is saturday will tomorrows newspaper lift the veil   november 22dsaturdays newspaper has lifted the veil words are vain to express the panic of astonishment in which i write i never once anticipated it i cant believe it or realize it now it has happened the winds and waves themselves have turned my accomplices the yacht has foundered at sea and every soul on board has perished  here is the account cut out of this mornings newspaper  disaster at seaintelligence has reached the royal yacht squadron and the insurers which leaves no reasonable doubt we regret to say of the total loss on the fifth of the present month of the yacht dorothea with every soul on board the particulars are as follows at daylight on the morning of the sixth the italian brig speranza bound from venice to marsala for orders encountered some floating objects off cape spartivento at the southernmost extremity of italy which attracted the curiosity of the people of the brig the previous day had been marked by one of the most severe of the sudden and violent storms peculiar to these southern seas which has been remembered for years the speranza herself having been in danger while the gale lasted the captain and crew concluded that they were on the traces of a wreck and a boat was lowered for the purpose of examining the objects in the water a hencoop some broken spars and fragments of shattered plank were the first evidences discovered of the terrible disaster that had happened some of the lighter articles of cabin furniture wrenched and shattered were found next and lastly a memento of melancholy interest turned up in the shape of a lifebuoy with a corked bottle attached to it these latter objects with the relics of cabin furniture were brought on board the speranza on the buoy the name of the vessel was painted as follows dorothea r y s meaning royal yacht squadron the bottle on being uncorked contained a sheet of notepaper on which the following lines were hurriedly traced in pencil off cape spartivento two days out from messina nov 5th 4 pm being the hour at which the log of the italian brig showed the storm to have been at its height both our boats are stove in by the sea the rudder is gone and we have sprung a leak astern which is more than we can stop the lord help us allwe are sinking signed john mitchenden mate on reaching marsala the captain of the brig made his report to the british consul and left the objects discovered in that gentlemans charge inquiry at messina showed that the illfated vessel had arrived there from naples at the latter port it was ascertained that the dorothea had been hired from the owners agent by an english gentleman mr armadale of thorpe ambrose norfolk whether mr armadale had any friends on board with him has not been clearly discovered but there is unhappily no doubt that the illfated gentleman himself sailed in the yacht from naples and that he was also on board of the vessel when she left messina  such is the story of the wreck as the newspaper tells it in the plainest and fewest words my head is in a whirl my confusion is so great that i think of fifty different things in trying to think of one i must waita day more or less is of no consequence nowi must wait till i can face my new position without feeling bewildered by it   november 23deight in the morningi rose an hour ago and saw my way clearly to the first step that i must take under present circumstances  it is of the utmost importance to me to know what is doing at thorpe ambrose and it would be the height of rashness while i am quite in the dark in this matter to venture there myself the only other alternative is to write to somebody on the spot for news and the only person i can write to isbashwood  i have just finished the letter it is headed private and confidential and signed lydia armadale there is nothing in it to compromise me if the old fool is mortally offended by my treatment of him and if he spitefully shows my letter to other people but i dont believe he will do this a man at his age forgives a woman anything if the woman only encourages him i have requested him as a personal favor to keep our correspondence for the present strictly private i have hinted that my married life with my deceased husband has not been a happy one and that i feel the injudiciousness of having married a young man in the postscript i go further still and venture boldly on these comforting words i can explain dear mr bashwood what may have seemed fake and deceitful in my conduct toward you when you give me a personal opportunity if he was on the right side of sixty i should feel doubtful of results but he is on the wrong side of sixty and i believe he will give me my personal opportunity   ten oclocki have been looking over the copy of my marriage certificate with which i took care to provide myself on the weddingday and i have discovered to my inexpressible dismay an obstacle to my appearance in the character of armadales widow which i now see for the first time  the description of midwinter under his own name which the certificate presents answers in every important particular to what would have been the description of armadale of thorpe ambrose if i had really married him name and surnameallan armadale agetwentyone instead of twentytwo which might easily pass for a mistake conditionbachelor rank or professiongentleman residence at the time of marriagefrants hotel darley street fathers name and surnameallan armadale rank or profession of fathergentleman every particular except the years difference in their two ages which answers for the one answers for the other but suppose when i produce my copy of the certificate that some meddlesome lawyer insists on looking at the original register midwinters writing is as different as possible from the writing of his dead friend the hand in which he has written allan armadale in the book has not a chance of passing for the hand in which armadale of thorpe ambrose was accustomed to sign his name  can i move safely in the matter with such a pitfall as i see here open under my feet how can i tell where can i find an experienced person to inform me i must shut up my diary and think   seven oclockmy prospects have changed again since i made my last entry i have received a warning to be careful in the future which i shall not neglect and i have i believe succeeded in providing myself with the advice and assistance of which i stand in need  after vainly trying to think of some better person to apply to in the difficulty which embarrassed me i made a virtue of necessity and set forth to surprise mrs oldershaw by a visit from her darling lydia it is almost needless to add that i determined to sound her carefully and not to let any secret of importance out of my own possession  a sour and solemn old maidservant admitted me into the house when i asked for her mistress i was reminded with the bitterest emphasis that i had committed the impropriety of calling on a sunday mrs oldershaw was at home solely in consequence of being too unwell to go to church the servant thought it very unlikely that she would see me i thought it highly probable on the contrary that she would honor me with an interview in her own interests if i sent in my name as miss gwiltand the event proved that i was right after being kept waiting some minutes i was shown into the drawingroom  there sat mother jezebel with the air of a woman resting on the highroad to heaven dressed in a slatecolored gown with gray mittens on her hands a severely simple cap on her head and a volume of sermons on her lap she turned up the whites of her eyes devoutly at the sight of me and the first words she said wereoh lydia lydia why are you not at church  if i had been less anxious the sudden presentation of mrs oldershaw in an entirely new character might have amused me but i was in no humor for laughing and my notes of hand being all paid i was under no obligation to restrain my natural freedom of speech stuff and nonsense i said put your sunday face in your pocket i have got some news for you since i last wrote from thorpe ambrose  the instant i mentioned thorpe ambrose the whites of the old hypocrites eyes showed themselves again and she flatly refused to hear a word more from me on the subject of my proceedings in norfolk i insisted but it was quite useless mother oldershaw only shook her head and groaned and informed me that her connection with the pomps and vanities of the world was at an end forever i have been born again lydia said the brazen old wretch wiping her eyes nothing will induce me to return to the subject of that wicked speculation of yours on the folly of a rich young man  after hearing this i should have left her on the spot but for one consideration which delayed me a moment longer  it was easy to see by this time that the circumstances whatever they might have been which had obliged mother oldershaw to keep in hiding on the occasion of my former visit to london had been sufficiently serious to force her into giving up or appearing to give up her old business and it was hardly less plain that she had found it to her advantageeverybody in england finds it to their advantage in some way to cover the outer side of her character carefully with a smooth varnish of cant this was however no business of mine and i should have made these reflections outside instead of inside the house if my interests had not been involved in putting the sincerity of mother oldershaws reformation to the testso far as it affected her past connection with myself at the time when she had fitted me out for our enterprise i remembered signing a certain business document which gave her a handsome pecuniary interest in my success if i became mrs armadale of thorpe ambrose the chance of turning this mischievous morsel of paper to good account in the capacity of a touchstone was too tempting to be resisted i asked my devout friends permission to say one last word before i left the house  as you have no further interest in my wicked speculation at thorpe ambrose i said perhaps you will give me back the written paper that i signed when you were not quite such an exemplary person as you are now  the shameless old hypocrite instantly shut her eyes and shuddered  does that mean yes or no i asked  on moral and religious grounds lydia said mrs oldershaw it means no  on wicked and worldly grounds i rejoined i beg to thank you for showing me your hand  there could indeed be no doubt now about the object she really had in view she would run no more risks and lend no more money she would leave me to win or lose singlehanded if i lost she would not be compromised if i won she would produce the paper i had signed and profit by it without remorse in my present situation it was mere waste of time and words to prolong the matter by any useless recrimination on my side i put the warning away privately in my memory for future use and got up to go  at the moment when i left my chair there was a sharp double knock at the street door mrs oldershaw evidently recognized it she rose in a violent hurry and rang the bell i am too unwell to see anybody she said when the servant appeared wait a moment if you please she added turning sharply on me when the woman had left us to answer the door  it was small very small spitefulness on my part i know but the satisfaction of thwarting mother jezebel even in a trifle was not to be resisted i cant wait i said you reminded me just now that i ought to be at church before she could answer i was out of the room  as i put my foot on the first stair the street door was opened and a mans voice inquired whether mrs oldershaw was at home  i instantly recognized the voice doctor downward  the doctor repeated the servants message in a tone which betrayed unmistakable irritation at finding himself admitted no further than the door  your mistress is not well enough to see visitors give her that card said the doctor and say i expect her the next time i call to be well enough to see me  if his voice had not told me plainly that he felt in no friendly mood toward mrs oldershaw i dare say i should have let him go without claiming his acquaintance but as things were i felt an impulse to speak to him or to anybody who had a grudge against mother jezebel there was more of my small spitefulness in this i suppose anyway i slipped downstairs and following the doctor out quietly overtook him in the street  i had recognized his voice and i recognized his back as i walked behind him but when i called him by his name and when he turned round with a start and confronted me i followed his example and started on my side the doctors face was transformed into the face of a perfect stranger his baldness had hidden itself under an artfully grizzled wig he had allowed his whiskers to grow and had dyed them to match his new head of hair hideous circular spectacles bestrode his nose in place of the neat double eyeglass that he used to carry in his hand and a black neckerchief surmounted by immense shirtcollars appeared as the unworthy successor of the clerical white cravat of former times nothing remained of the man i once knew but the comfortable plumpness of his figure and the confidential courtesy and smoothness of his manner and his voice  charmed to see you again said the doctor looking about him a little anxiously and producing his cardcase in a very precipitate manner but my dear miss gwilt permit me to rectify a slight mistake on your part doctor downward of pimlico is dead and buried and you will infinitely oblige me if you will never on any consideration mention him again  i took the card he offered me and discovered that i was now supposed to be speaking to doctor le doux of the sanitarium fairweather vale hampstead  you seem to have found it necessary i said to change a great many things since i last saw you your name your residence your personal appearance  and my branch of practice interposed the doctor i have purchased of the original possessor a person of feeble enterprise and no resources a name a diploma and a partially completed sanitarium for the reception of nervous invalids we are open already to the inspection of a few privileged friendscome and see us are you walking my way pray take my arm and tell me to what happy chance i am indebted for the pleasure of seeing you again  i told him the circumstances exactly as they had happened and i added with a view to making sure of his relations with his former ally at pimlico that i had been greatly surprised to hear mrs oldershaws door shut on such an old friend as himself cautious as he was the doctors manner of receiving my remark satisfied me at once that my suspicions of an estrangement were well founded his smile vanished and he settled his hideous spectacles irritably on the bridge of his nose  pardon me if i leave you to draw your own conclusions he said the subject of mrs oldershaw is i regret to say far from agreeable to me under existing circumstancesa business difficulty connected with our late partnership at pimlico entirely without interest for a young and brilliant woman like yourself tell me your news have you left your situation at thorpe ambrose are you residing in london is there anything professional or otherwise that i can do for you  that last question was a more important one than he supposed before i answered it i felt the necessity of parting company with him and of getting a little time to think  you have kindly asked me doctor to pay you a visit i said in your quiet house at hampstead i may possibly have something to say to you which i cant say in this noisy street when are you at home at the sanitarium should i find you there later in the day  the doctor assured me that he was then on his way back and begged that i would name my own hour i said toward the afternoon and pleading an engagement hailed the first omnibus that passed us dont forget the address said the doctor as he handed me in i have got your card i answered and so we parted  i returned to the hotel and went up into my room and thought over it very anxiously  the serious obstacle of the signature on the marriage register still stood in my way as unmanageably as ever all hope of getting assistance from mrs oldershaw was at an end i could only regard her henceforth as an enemy hidden in the darkthe enemy beyond all doubt now who had had me followed and watched when i was last in london to what other counselor could i turn for the advice which my unlucky ignorance of law and business obliged me to seek from some one more experienced than myself could i go to the lawyer whom i consulted when i was about to marry midwinter in my maiden name impossible to say nothing of his cold reception of me when i had last seen him the advice i wanted this time related disguise the facts as i might to commission of a frauda fraud of the sort that no prosperous lawyer would consent to assist if he had a character to lose was there any other competent person i could think of there was one and one onlythe doctor who had died at pimlico and had revived again at hampstead  i knew him to be entirely without scruples to have the business experience that i wanted myself and to be as cunning as clever and as farseeing a man as could be found in all london beyond this i had made two important discoveries in connection with him that morning in the first place he was on bad terms with mrs oldershaw which would protect me from all danger of the two leaguing together against me if i trusted him in the second place circumstances still obliged him to keep his identity carefully disguised which gave me a hold over him in no respect inferior to any hold that i might give him over me in every way he was the right man the only man for my purpose and yet i hesitated at going to himhesitated for a full hour and more without knowing why  it was two oclock before i finally decided on paying the doctor a visit having after this occupied nearly another hour in determining to a hairbreadth how far i should take him into my confidence i sent for a cab at last and set off toward three in the afternoon for hampstead  i found the sanitarium with some little difficulty  fairweather vale proved to be a new neighborhood situated below the high ground of hampstead on the southern side the day was overcast and the place looked very dreary we approached it by a new road running between trees which might once have been the park avenue of a country house at the end we came upon a wilderness of open ground with halffinished villas dotted about and a hideous litter of boards wheelbarrows and building materials of all sorts scattered in every direction at one corner of this scene of desolation stood a great overgrown dismal house plastered with drabcolored stucco and surrounded by a naked unfinished garden without a shrub or a flower in it frightful to behold on the open iron gate that led into this inclosure was a new brass plate with sanitarium inscribed on it in great black letters the bell when the cabman rang it pealed through the empty house like a knell and the pallid withered old manservant in black who answered the door looked as if he had stepped up out of his grave to perform that service he let out on me a smell of damp plaster and new varnish and he let in with me a chilling draft of the damp november air i didnt notice it at the time but writing of it now i remember that i shivered as i crossed the threshold  i gave my name to the servant as mrs armadale and was shown into the waitingroom the very fire itself was dying of damp in the grate the only books on the table were the doctors works in sober drab covers and the only object that ornamented the walls was the foreign diploma handsomely framed and glazed of which the doctor had possessed himself by purchase along with the foreign name  after a moment or two the proprietor of the sanitarium came in and held up his hands in cheerful astonishment at the sight of me  i hadnt an idea who mrs armadale was he said my dear lady have you changed your name too how sly of you not to tell me when we met this morning come into my private snuggeryi cant think of keeping an old and dear friend like you in the patients waitingroom  the doctors private snuggery was at the back of the house looking out on fields and trees doomed but not yet destroyed by the builder horrible objects in brass and leather and glass twisted and turned as if they were sentient things writhing in agonies of pain filled up one end of the room a great bookcase with glass doors extended over the whole of the opposite wall and exhibited on its shelves long rows of glass jars in which shapeless dead creatures of a dull white color floated in yellow liquid above the fireplace hung a collection of photographic portraits of men and women inclosed in two large frames hanging side by side with a space between them the lefthand frame illustrated the effects of nervous suffering as seen in the face the righthand frame exhibited the ravages of insanity from the same point of view while the space between was occupied by an elegantly illuminated scroll bearing inscribed on it the timehonored motto prevention is better than cure  here i am with my galvanic apparatus and my preserved specimens and all the rest of it said the doctor placing me in a chair by the fireside and there is my system mutely addressing you just above your head under a form of exposition which i venture to describe as frankness itself this is no madhouse my dear lady let other men treat insanity if they likei stop it no patients in the house as yet but we live in an age when nervous derangement parent of insanity is steadily on the increase and in due time the sufferers will come i can wait as harvey waited as jenner waited and now do put your feet up on the fender and tell me about yourself you are married of course and what a pretty name accept my best and most heartfelt congratulations you have the two greatest blessings that can fall to a womans lot the two capital hs as i call themhusband and home  i interrupted the genial flow of the doctors congratulations at the first opportunity  i am married but the circumstances are by no means of the ordinary kind i said seriously my present position includes none of the blessings that are usually supposed to fall to a womans lot i am already in a situation of very serious difficulty and before long i may be in a situation of very serious danger as well  the doctor drew his chair a little nearer to me and fell at once into his old professional manner and his old confidential tone  if you wish to consult me he said softly you know that i have kept some dangerous secrets in my time and you also know that i possess two valuable qualities as an adviser i am not easily shocked and i can be implicitly trusted  i hesitated even now at the eleventh hour sitting alone with him in his own room it was so strange to me to be trusting to anybody but myself and yet how could i help trusting another person in a difficulty which turned on a matter of law  just as you please you know added the doctor i never invite confidences i merely receive them  there was no help for it i had come there not to hesitate but to speak i risked it and spoke  the matter on which i wish to consult you i said is not as you seem to think within your experience as a professional man but i believe you may be of assistance to me if i trust myself to your larger experience as a man of the world i warn you beforehand that i shall certainly surprise and possibly alarm you before i have done  with that preface i entered on my story telling him what i had settled to tell him and no more  i made no secret at the outset of my intention to personate armadales widow and i mentioned without reserve knowing that the doctor could go to the office and examine the will for himself the handsome income that would be settled on me in the event of my success some of the circumstances that followed next in succession i thought it desirable to alter or conceal i showed him the newspaper account of the loss of the yacht but i said nothing about events at naples i informed him of the exact similarity of the two names leaving him to imagine that it was accidental i told him as an important element in the matter that my husband had kept his real name a profound secret from everybody but myself but to prevent any communication between them i carefully concealed from the doctor what the assumed name under which midwinter had lived all his life really was i acknowledged that i had left my husband behind me on the continent but when the doctor put the question i allowed him to concludei couldnt with all my resolution tell him positivelythat midwinter knew of the contemplated fraud and that he was staying away purposely so as not to compromise me by his presence this difficulty smoothed overor as i feel it now this baseness committedi reverted to myself and came back again to the truth one after another i mentioned all the circumstances connected with my private marriage and with the movements of armadale and midwinter which rendered any discovery of the false personation through the evidence of other people a downright impossibility so much i said in conclusion for the object in view the next thing is to tell you plainly of a very serious obstacle that stands in my way  the doctor who had listened thus far without interrupting me begged permission here to say a few words on his side before i went on  the few words proved to be all questionsclever searching suspicious questionswhich i was however able to answer with little or no reserve for they related in almost every instance to the circumstances under which i had been married and to the chances for and against my lawful husband if he chose to assert his claim to me at any future time  my replies informed the doctor in the first place that i had so managed matters at thorpe ambrose as to produce a general impression that armadale intended to marry me in the second place that my husbands early life had not been of a kind to exhibit him favorably in the eyes of the world in the third place that we had been married without any witnesses present who knew us at a large parish church in which two other couples had been married the same morning to say nothing of the dozens on dozens of other couples confusing all remembrance of us in the minds of the officiating people who had been married since when i had put the doctor in possession of these factsand when he had further ascertained that midwinter and i had gone abroad among strangers immediately after leaving the church and that the men employed on board the yacht in which armadale had sailed from somersetshire before my marriage were now away in ships voyaging to the other end of the worldhis confidence in my prospects showed itself plainly in his face so far as i can see he said your husbands claim to you after you have stepped into the place of the dead mr armadales widow would rest on nothing but his own bare assertion and that i think you may safely set at defiance excuse my apparent distrust of the gentleman but there might be a misunderstanding between you in the future and it is highly desirable to ascertain beforehand exactly what he could or could not do under those circumstances and now that we have done with the main obstacle that i see in the way of your success let us by all means come to the obstacle that you see next  i was willing enough to come to it the tone in which he spoke of midwinter though i myself was responsible for it jarred on me horribly and roused for the moment some of the old folly of feeling which i fancied i had laid asleep forever i rushed at the chance of changing the subject and mentioned the discrepancy in the register between the hand in which midwinter had signed the name of allan armadale and the hand in which armadale of thorpe ambrose had been accustomed to write his name with an eagerness which it quite diverted the doctor to see  is that all he asked to my infinite surprise and relief when i had done my dear lady pray set your mind at ease if the late mr armadales lawyers want a proof of your marriage they wont go to the churchregister for it i can promise you  what i exclaimed in astonishment do you mean to say that the entry in the register is not a proof of my marriage  it is a proof said the doctor that you have been married to somebody but it is no proof that you have been married to mr armadale of thorpe ambrose jack nokes or tom styles excuse the homeliness of the illustration might have got the license and gone to the church to be married to you under mr armadales name and the register how could it do otherwise must in that case have innocently assisted the deception i see i surprise you my dear madam when you opened this interesting business you surprised mei may own it nowby laying so much stress on the curious similarity between the two names you might have entered on the very daring and romantic enterprise in which you are now engaged without necessarily marrying your present husband any other man would have done just as well provided he was willing to take mr armadales name for the purpose  i felt my temper going at this any other man would not have done just as well i rejoined instantly but for the similarity of the names i should never have thought of the enterprise at all  the doctor admitted that he had spoken too hastily that personal view of the subject had i confess escaped me he said however let us get back to the matter in hand in the course of what i may term an adventurous medical life i have been brought more than once into contact with the gentlemen of the law and have had opportunities of observing their proceedings in cases of let us say domestic jurisprudence i am quite sure i am correct in informing you that the proof which will be required by mr armadales representatives will be the evidence of a witness present at the marriage who can speak to the identity of the bride and bridegroom from his own personal knowledge  but i have already told you i said that there was no such person present  precisely rejoined the doctor in that case what you now want before you can safely stir a step in the matter isif you will pardon me the expressiona readymade witness possessed of rare moral and personal resources who can be trusted to assume the necessary character and to make the necessary declaration before a magistrate do you know of any such person asked the doctor throwing himself back in his chair and looking at me with the utmost innocence  i only know you i said  the doctor laughed softly so like a woman he remarked with the most exasperating good humor the moment she sees her object she dashes at it headlong the nearest way oh the sex the sex  never mind the sex i broke out impatiently i want a serious answeryes or no  the doctor rose and waved his hand with great gravity and dignity all round the room you see this vast establishment he began you can possibly estimate to some extent the immense stake i have in its prosperity and success your excellent natural sense will tell you that the principal of this sanitarium must be a man of the most unblemished character  why waste so many words i said when one word will do you mean no  the principal of the sanitarium suddenly relapsed into the character of my confidential friend  my dear lady he said it isnt yes and it isnt no at a moments notice give me till tomorrow afternoon by that time i engage to be ready to do one of two thingseither to withdraw myself from this business at once or to go into it with you heart and soul do you agree to that very good we may drop the subject then till tomorrow where can i call on you when i have decided what to do  there was no objection to my trusting him with my address at the hotel i had taken care to present myself there as mrs armadale and i had given midwinter an address at the neighboring postoffice to write to when he answered my letters we settled the hour at which the doctor was to call on me and that matter arranged i rose to go resisting all offers of refreshment and all proposals to show me over the house his smooth persistence in keeping up appearances after we had thoroughly understood each other disgusted me i got away from him as soon as i could and came back to my diary and my own room  we shall see how it ends tomorrow my own idea is that my confidential friend will say yes   november 24ththe doctor has said yes as i supposed but on terms which i never anticipated the condition on which i have secured his services amounts to nothing less than the payment to him on my stepping into the place of armadales widow of half my first years incomein other words six hundred pounds  i protested against this extortionate demand in every way i could think of all to no purpose the doctor met me with the most engaging frankness nothing he said but the accidental embarrassment of his position at the present time would have induced him to mix himself up in the matter at all he would honestly confess that he had exhausted his own resources and the resources of other persons whom he described as his backers in the purchase and completion of the sanitarium under those circumstances six hundred pounds in prospect was an object to him for that sum he would run the serious risk of advising and assisting me not a farthing less would tempt him and there he left it with his best and friendliest wishes in my hands  it ended in the only way in which it could end i had no choice but to accept the terms and to let the doctor settle things on the spot as he pleased the arrangement once made between us i must do him the justice to say that he showed no disposition to let the grass grow under his feet he called briskly for pen ink and paper and suggested opening the campaign at thorpe ambrose by tonights post  we agreed on a form of letter which i wrote and which he copied on the spot i entered into no particulars at starting i simply asserted that i was the widow of the deceased mr armadale that i had been privately married to him that i had returned to england on his sailing in the yacht from naples and that i begged to inclose a copy of my marriage certificate as a matter of form with which i presumed it was customary to comply the letter was addressed to the representatives of the late allan armadale esq thorpe ambrose norfolk and the doctor himself carried it away and put it in the post  i am not so excited and so impatient for results as i expected to be now that the first step is taken the thought of midwinter haunts me like a ghost i have been writing to him againas before to keep up appearances it will be my last letter i think my courage feels shaken my spirits get depressed when my thoughts go back to turin i am no more capable of facing the consideration of midwinter at this moment than i was in the bygone time the day of reckoning with him once distant and doubtful is a day that may come to me now i know not how soon and here i am trusting myself blindly to the chapter of accidents still   november 25that two oclock today the doctor called again by appointment he has been to his lawyers of course without taking them into our confidence to put the case simply of proving my marriage the result confirms what he has already told me the pivot on which the whole matter will turn if my claim is disputed will be the question of identity and it may be necessary for the witness to make his declaration in the magistrates presence before the week is out  in this position of affairs the doctor thinks it important that we should be within easy reach of each other and proposes to find a quiet lodging for me in his neighborhood i am quite willing to go anywhere for among the other strange fancies that have got possession of me i have an idea that i shall feel more completely lost to midwinter if i move out of the neighborhood in which his letters are addressed to me i was awake and thinking of him again last night this morning i have finally decided to write to him no more  after staying half an hour the doctor left me having first inquired whether i would like to accompany him to hampstead to look for lodgings i informed him that i had some business of my own which would keep me in london he inquired what the business was you will see i said tomorrow or next day  i had a moments nervous trembling when i was by myself again my business in london besides being a serious business in a womans eyes took my mind back to midwinter in spite of me the prospect of removing to my new lodging had reminded me of the necessity of dressing in my new character the time had come now for getting my widows weeds  my first proceeding after putting my bonnet on was to provide myself with money i got what i wanted to fit me out for the character of armadales widow by nothing less than the sale of armadales own present to me on my marriagethe ruby ring it proved to be a more valuable jewel than i had supposed i am likely to be spared all money anxieties for some time to come  on leaving the jewelers i went to the great mourning shop in regent street in fourandtwenty hours if i can give them no more they have engaged to dress me in my widows costume from head to foot i had another feverish moment when i left the shop and by way of further excitement on this agitating day i found a surprise in store for me on my return to the hotel an elderly gentleman was announced to be waiting to see me i opened my sittingroom door and there was old bashwood  he had got my letter that morning and had started for london by the next train to answer it in person i had expected a great deal from him but i had certainly not expected that it flattered me for the moment i declare it flattered me  i pass over the wretched old creatures raptures and reproaches and groans and tears and weary long prosings about the lonely months he had passed at thorpe ambrose brooding over my desertion of him he was quite eloquent at times but i dont want his eloquence here it is needless to say that i put myself right with him and consulted his feelings before i asked him for his news what a blessing a womans vanity is sometimes i almost forgot my risks and responsibilities in my anxieties to be charming for a minute or two i felt a warm little flutter of triumph and it was a triumpheven with an old man in a quarter of an hour i had him smirking and smiling hanging on my lightest words in an ecstasy and answering all the questions i put to him like a good little child  here is his account of affairs at thorpe ambrose as i gently extracted it from him bit by bit  in the first place the news of armadales death has reached miss milroy it has so completely overwhelmed her that her father has been compelled to remove her from the school she is back at the cottage and the doctor is in daily attendance do i pity her yes i pity her exactly as much as she once pitied me  in the next place the state of affairs at the great house which i expected to find some difficulty in comprehending turns out to be quite intelligible and certainly not discouraging so far only yesterday the lawyers on both sides came to an understanding mr darch the family solicitor of the blanchards and armadales bitter enemy in past times represents the interests of miss blanchard who in the absence of any male heir is next heir to the estate and who has it appears been in london for some time past mr smart of norwich originally employed to overlook bashwood represents the deceased armadale and this is what the two lawyers have settled between them  mr darch acting for miss blanchard has claimed the possession of the estate and the right of receiving the rents at the christmas audit in her name mr smart on his side has admitted that there is great weight in the family solicitors application he cannot see his way as things are now to contesting the question of armadales death and he will consent to offer no resistance to the application if mr darch will consent on his side to assume the responsibility of taking possession in miss blanchards name this mr darch has already done and the estate is now virtually in miss blanchards possession  one result of this course of proceeding will be as bashwood thinks to put mr darch in the position of the person who really decides on my claim to the widows place and the widows money the income being charged on the estate it must come out of miss blanchards pocket and the question of paying it would appear therefore to be a question for miss blanchards lawyer tomorrow will probably decide whether this view is the right one for my letter to armadales representatives will have been delivered at the great house this morning  so much for what old bashwood had to tell me having recovered my influence over him and possessed myself of all his information so far the next thing to consider was the right use to turn him to in the future he was entirely at my disposal for his place at the stewards office has been already taken by miss blanchards man of business and he pleaded hard to be allowed to stay and serve my interests in london there would not have been the least danger in letting him stay for i had as a matter of course left him undisturbed in his conviction that i really am the widow of armadale of thorpe ambrose but with the doctors resources at my command i wanted no assistance of any sort in london and it occurred to me that i might make bashwood more useful by sending him back to norfolk to watch events there in my interests  he looked sorely disappointed having had an eye evidently to paying his court to me in my widowed condition when i told him of the conclusion at which i had arrived but a few words of persuasion and a modest hint that he might cherish hopes in the future if he served me obediently in the present did wonders in reconciling him to the necessity of meeting my wishes he asked helplessly for instructions when it was time for him to leave me and travel back by the evening train i could give him none for i had no idea as yet of what the legal people might or might not do but suppose something happens he persisted that i dont understand what am i to do so far away from you i could only give him one answer do nothing i said whatever it is hold your tongue about it and write or come up to london immediately to consult me with those parting directions and with an understanding that we were to correspond regularly i let him kiss my hand and sent him off to the train  now that i am alone again and able to think calmly of the interview between me and my elderly admirer i find myself recalling a certain change in old bashwoods manner which puzzled me at the time and which puzzles me still  even in his first moments of agitation at seeing me i thought that his eyes rested on my face with a new kind of interest while i was speaking to him besides this he dropped a word or two afterward in telling me of his lonely life at thorpe ambrose which seemed to imply that he had been sustained in his solitude by a feeling of confidence about his future relations with me when we next met if he had been a younger and a bolder man and if any such discovery had been possible i should almost have suspected him of having found out something about my past life which had made him privately confident of controlling me if i showed any disposition to deceive and desert him again but such an idea as this in connection with old bashwood is simply absurd perhaps i am overexcited by the suspense and anxiety of my present position perhaps the merest fancies and suspicions are leading me astray let this be as it may i have at any rate more serious subjects than the subject of old bashwood to occupy me now tomorrows post may tell me what armadales representatives think of the claim of armadales widow   november 26ththe answer has arrived this morning in the form as bashwood supposed of a letter from mr darch the crabbed old lawyer acknowledges my letter in three lines before he takes any steps or expresses any opinion on the subject he wants evidence of identity as well as the evidence of the certificate and he ventures to suggest that it may be desirable before we go any further to refer him to my legal advisers  two oclockthe doctor called shortly after twelve to say that he had found a lodging for me within twenty minutes walk of the sanitarium in return for his news i showed him mr darchs letter he took it away at once to his lawyers and came back with the necessary information for my guidance i have answered mr darch by sending him the address of my legal advisersotherwise the doctors lawyerswithout making any comment on the desire that he has expressed for additional evidence of the marriage this is all that can be done today tomorrow will bring with it events of greater interest for tomorrow the doctor is to make his declaration before the magistrate and tomorrow i am to move to my new lodging in my widows weeds   november 27thfairweather vale villasthe declaration has been made with all the necessary formalities and i have taken possession in my widows costume of my new rooms  i ought to be excited by the opening of this new act in the drama and by the venturesome part that i am playing in it myself strange to say i am quiet and depressed the thought of midwinter has followed me to my new abode and is pressing on me heavily at this moment i have no fear of any accident happening in the interval that must still pass before i step publicly into the place of armadales widow but when that time comes and when midwinter finds me as sooner or later find me he must figuring in my false character and settled in the position that i have usurpedthen i ask myself what will happen the answer still comes as it first came to me this morning when i put on my widows dress now as then the presentiment is fixed in my mind that he will kill me if it was not too late to draw backabsurd i shall shut up my journal   november 28ththe lawyers have heard from mr darch and have sent him the declaration by return of post  when the doctor brought me this news i asked him whether his lawyers were aware of my present address and finding that he had not yet mentioned it to them i begged that he would continue to keep it a secret for the future the doctor laughed are you afraid of mr darchs stealing a march on us and coming to attack you personally he asked i accepted the imputation as the easiest way of making him comply with my request yes i said i am afraid of mr darch  my spirits have risen since the doctor left me there is a pleasant sensation of security in feeling that no strangers are in possession of my address i am easy enough in my mind today to notice how wonderfully well i look in my widows weeds and to make myself agreeable to the people of the house  midwinter disturbed me a little again last night but i have got over the ghastly delusion which possessed me yesterday i know better now than to dread violence from him when he discovers what i have done and there is still less fear of his stooping to assert his claim to a woman who has practiced on him such a deception as mine the one serious trial that i shall be put to when the day of reckoning comes will be the trial of preserving my false character in his presence i shall be safe in his loathing and contempt for me after that on the day when i have denied him to his face i shall have seen the last of him forever  shall i be able to deny him to his face shall i be able to look at him and speak to him as if he had never been more to me than a friend how do i know till the time comes was there ever such an infatuated fool as i am to be writing of him at all when writing only encourages me to think of him i will make a new resolution from this time forth his name shall appear no more in these pages   monday december 1stthe last month of the wornout old year 1851 if i allowed myself to look back what a miserable year i should see added to all the other miserable years that are gone but i have made my resolution to look forward only and i mean to keep it  i have nothing to record of the last two days except that on the twentyninth i remembered bashwood and wrote to tell him of my new address this morning the lawyers heard again from mr darch he acknowledges the receipt of the declaration but postpones stating the decision at which he has arrived until he has communicated with the trustees under the late mr blanchards will and has received his final instructions from his client miss blanchard the doctors lawyers declare that this last letter is a mere device for gaining timewith what object they are of course not in a position to guess the doctor himself says facetiously it is the usual lawyers object of making a long bill my own idea is that mr darch has his suspicions of something wrong and that his purpose in trying to gain time        ten at nighti had written as far as that last unfinished sentence toward four in the afternoon when i was startled by hearing a cab drive up to the door i went to the window and got there just in time to see old bashwood getting out with an activity of which i should never have supposed him capable so little did i anticipate the tremendous discovery that was going to burst on me in another minute that i turned to the glass and wondered what the susceptible old gentleman would say to me in my widows cap  the instant he entered the room i saw that some serious disaster had happened his eyes were wild his wig was awry he approached me with a strange mixture of eagerness and dismay ive done as you told me he whispered breathlessly ive held my tongue about it and come straight to you he caught me by the hand before i could speak with a boldness quite new in my experience of him oh how can i break it to you he burst out im beside myself when i think of it  when you can speak i said putting him into a chair speak out i see in your face that you bring me news i dont look for from thorpe ambrose  he put his hand into the breastpocket of his coat and drew out a letter he looked at the letter and looked at me newnewnews you dont look for he stammered but not from thorpe ambrose  not from thorpe ambrose  no from the sea  the first dawning of the truth broke on me at those words i couldnt speaki could only hold out my hand to him for the letter  he still shrank from giving it to me i darent i darent he said to himself vacantly the shock of it might be the death of her  i snatched the letter from him one glance at the writing on the address was enough my hands fell on my lap with the letter fast held in them i sat petrified without moving without speaking without hearing a word of what bashwood was saying to me and slowly realized the terrible truth the man whose widow i had claimed to be was a living man to confront me in vain i had mixed the drink at naplesin vain i had betrayed him into manuels hands twice i had set the deadly snare for him and twice armadale had escaped me i came to my sense of outward things again and found bashwood on his knees at my feet crying  you look angry he murmured helplessly are you angry with me oh if you only knew what hopes i had when we last saw each other and how cruelly that letter has dashed them all to the ground  i put the miserable old creature back from me but very gently hush i said dont distress me now i want composure i want to read the letter  he went away submissively to the other end of the room as soon as my eye was off him i heard him say to himself with impotent malignity if the sea had been of my mind the sea would have drowned him  one by one i slowly opened the folds of the letter feeling while i did so the strangest incapability of fixing my attention on the very lines that i was burning to read but why dwell any longer on sensations which i cant describe it will be more to the purpose if i place the letter itself for future reference on this page of my journal  fiume illyria november 21 1851  mr bashwoodthe address i date from will surprise you and you will be more surprised still when you hear how it is that i come to write to you from a port on the adriatic sea  i have been the victim of a rascally attempt at robbery and murder the robbery has succeeded and it is only through the mercy of god that the murder did not succeed too  i hired a yacht rather more than a month ago at naples and sailed i am glad to think now without any friend with me for messina from messina i went for a cruise in the adriatic two days out we were caught in a storm storms get up in a hurry and go down in a hurry in those parts the vessel behaved nobly i declare i feel the tears in my eyes now when i think of her at the bottom of the sea toward sunset it began to moderate and by midnight except for a long smooth swell the sea was as quiet as need be i went below a little tired having helped in working the yacht while the gale lasted and fell asleep in five minutes about two hours after i was woke by something falling into my cabin through a chink of the ventilator in the upper part of the door i jumped up and found a bit of paper with a key wrapped in it and with writing on the inner side in a hand which it was not very easy to read  up to this time i had not had the ghost of a suspicion that i was alone at sea with a gang of murderous vagabonds excepting one only who would stick at nothing i had got on very well with my sailingmaster the worst scoundrel of the lot and better still with his english mate the sailors being all foreigners i had very little to say to they did their work and no quarrels and nothing unpleasant happened if anybody had told me before i went to bed on the night after the storm that the sailingmaster and the crew and the mate who had been no better than the rest of them at starting were all in a conspiracy to rob me of the money i had on board and then to drown me in my own vessel afterward i should have laughed in his face just remember that and then fancy for yourself for im sure i cant tell you what i must have thought when i opened the paper round the key and read what i now copy from the mates writing as follows  sirstay in your bed till you hear a boat shove off from the starboard side or you are a dead man your money is stolen and in five minutes time the yacht will be scuttled and the cabin hatch will be nailed down on you dead men tell no tales and the sailingmasters notion is to leave proofs afloat that the vessel has foundered with all on board it was his doing to begin with and we were all in it i cant find it in my heart not to give you a chance for your life its a bad chance but i can do no more i should be murdered myself if i didnt seem to go with the rest the key of your cabin door is thrown back to you inside this dont be alarmed when you hear the hammer above i shall do it and i shall have short nails in my hand as well as long and use the short ones only wait till you hear the boat with all of us shove off and then pry up the cabin hatch with your back the vessel will float a quarter of an hour after the holes are bored in her slip into the sea on the port side and keep the vessel between you and the boat you will find plenty of loose lumber wrenched away on purpose drifting about to hold on by its a fine night and a smooth sea and theres a chance that a ship may pick you up while theres life left in you i can do no moreyours truly j m   as i came to those last words i heard the hammering down of the hatch over my head i dont suppose im more of a coward than most people but there was a moment when the sweat poured down me like rain i got to be my own man again before the hammering was done and found myself thinking of somebody very dear to me in england i said to myself ill have a try for my life for her sake though the chances are dead against me  i put a letter from that person i have mentioned into one of the stoppered bottles of my dressingcase along with the mates warning in case i lived to see him again i hung this and a flask of whisky in a sling round my neck and after first dressing myself in my confusion thought better of it and stripped again for swimming to my shirt and drawers by the time i had done that the hammering was over and there was such a silence that i could hear the water bubbling into the scuttled vessel amidships the next noise was the noise of the boat and the villains in her always excepting my friend the mate shoving off from the starboard side i waited for the splash of the oars in the water and then got my back under the hatch the mate had kept his promise i lifted it easilycrept across the deck under cover of the bulwarks on all foursand slipped into the sea on the port side lots of things were floating about i took the first thing i came toa hencoopand swam away with it about a couple of hundred yards keeping the yacht between me and the boat having got that distance i was seized with a shivering fit and i stopped fearing the cramp next to take a pull at my flask when i had closed the flask again i turned for a moment to look back and saw the yacht in the act of sinking in a minute more there was nothing between me and the boat but the pieces of wreck that had been purposely thrown out to float the moon was shining and if they had had a glass in the boat i believe they might have seen my head though i carefully kept the hencoop between me and them  as it was they laid on their oars and i heard loud voices among them disputing after what seemed an age to me i discovered what the dispute was about the boats head was suddenly turned my way some cleverer scoundrel than the rest the sailingmaster i dare say had evidently persuaded them to row back over the place where the yacht had gone down and make quite sure that i had gone down with her  they were more than halfway across the distance that separated us and i had given myself up for lost when i heard a cry from one of them and saw the boats progress suddenly checked in a minute or two more the boats head was turned again and they rowed straight away from me like men rowing for their lives  i looked on one side toward the land and saw nothing i looked on the other toward the sea and discovered what the boats crew had discovered before mea sail in the distance growing steadily brighter and bigger in the moonlight the longer i looked at it in a quarter of an hour more the vessel was within hail of me and the crew had got me on board  they were all foreigners and they quite deafened me by their jabber i tried signs but before i could make them understand me i was seized with another shivering fit and was carried below the vessel held on her course i have no doubt but i was in no condition to know anything about it before morning i was in a fever and from that time i can remember nothing clearly till i came to my senses at this place and found myself under the care of a hungarian merchant the consignee as they call it of the coasting vessel that had picked me up he speaks english as well or better than i do and he has treated me with a kindness which i can find no words to praise when he was a young man he was in england himself learning business and he says he has remembrances of our country which make his heart warm toward an englishman he has fitted me out with clothes and has lent me the money to travel with as soon as the doctor allows me to start for home supposing i dont get a relapse i shall be fit to travel in a weeks time from this if i can catch the mail at trieste and stand the fatigue i shall be back again at thorpe ambrose in a week or ten days at most after you get my letter you will agree with me that it is a terribly long letter but i cant help that i seem to have lost my old knack at putting things short and finishing on the first page however i am near the end now for i have nothing left to mention but the reason why i write about what has happened to me instead of waiting till i get home and telling it all by word of mouth  i fancy my head is still muddled by my illness at any rate it only struck me this morning that there is barely a chance of some vessel having passed the place where the yacht foundered and having picked up the furniture and other things wrenched out of her and left to float some false report of my being drowned may in that case have reached england if this has happened which i hope to god may be an unfounded fear on my part go directly to major milroy at the cottage show him this letteri have written it quite as much for his eye as for yoursand then give him the inclosed note and ask him if he doesnt think the circumstances justify me in hoping he will send it to miss milroy i cant explain why i dont write directly to the major or to miss milroy instead of to you i can only say there are considerations i am bound in honor to respect which oblige me to act in this roundabout way  i dont ask you to answer this for i shall be on my way home i hope long before your letter could reach me in this outoftheway place whatever you do dont lose a moment in going to major milroy go on second thoughts whether the loss of the yacht is known in england or not  yours truly allan armadale   i looked up when i had come to the end of the letter and saw for the first time that bashwood had left his chair and had placed himself opposite to me he was intently studying my face with the inquiring expression of a man who was trying to read my thoughts his eyes fell guiltily when they met mine and he shrank away to his chair believing as he did that i was really married to armadale was he trying to discover whether the news of armadales rescue from the sea was good news or bad news in my estimation it was no time then for entering into explanations with him the first thing to be done was to communicate instantly with the doctor i called bashwood back to me and gave him my hand  you have done me a service i said which makes us closer friends than ever i shall say more about this and about other matters of some interest to both of us later in the day i want you now to lend me mr armadales letter which i promise to bring back and to wait here till i return will you do that for me mr bashwood  he would do anything i asked him he said i went into the bedroom and put on my bonnet and shawl  let me be quite sure of the facts before i leave you i resumed when i was ready to go out you have not shown this letter to anybody but me  not a living soul has seen it but our two selves  what have you done with the note inclosed to miss milroy  he produced it from his pocket i ran it over rapidlysaw that there was nothing in it of the slightest importanceand put it in the fire on the spot that done i left bashwood in the sittingroom and went to the sanitarium with armadales letter in my hand  the doctor had gone out and the servant was unable to say positively at what time he would be back i went into his study and wrote a line preparing him for the news i had brought with me which i sealed up with armadales letter in an envelope to await his return having told the servant i would call again in an hour i left the place  it was useless to go back to my lodgings and speak to bashwood until i knew first what the doctor meant to do i walked about the neighborhood up and down new streets and crescents and squares with a kind of dull numbed feeling in me which prevented not only all voluntary exercise of thought but all sensation of bodily fatigue i remembered the same feeling overpowering me years ago on the morning when the people of the prison came to take me into court to be tried for my life all that frightful scene came back again to my mind in the strangest manner as if it had been a scene in which some other person had figured once or twice i wondered in a heavy senseless way why they had not hanged me  when i went back to the sanitarium i was informed that the doctor had returned half an hour since and that he was in his own room anxiously waiting to see me  i went into the study and found him sitting close by the fire with his head down and his hands on his knees on the table near him beside armadales letter and my note i saw in the little circle of light thrown by the readinglamp an open railway guide was he meditating flight it was impossible to tell from his face when he looked up at me what he was meditating or how the shock had struck him when he first discovered that armadale was a living man  take a seat near the fire he said its very raw and cold today  i took a chair in silence in silence on his side the doctor sat rubbing his knees before the fire  have you nothing to say to me i asked  he rose and suddenly removed the shade from the readinglamp so that the light fell on my face  you are not looking well he said whats the matter  my head feels dull and my eyes are heavy and hot i replied the weather i suppose  it was strange how we both got further and further from the one vitally important subject which we had both come together to discuss  i think a cup of tea would do you good remarked the doctor  i accepted his suggestion and he ordered the tea while it was coming he walked up and down the room and i sat by the fire and not a word passed between us on either side  the tea revived me and the doctor noticed a change for the better in my face he sat down opposite to me at the table and spoke out at last  if i had ten thousand pounds at this moment he began i would give the whole of it never to have compromised myself in your desperate speculation on mr armadales death  he said those words with an abruptness almost with a violence which was strangely uncharacteristic of his ordinary manner was he frightened himself or was he trying to frighten me i determined to make him explain himself at the outset so far as i was concerned wait a moment doctor i said do you hold me responsible for what has happened  certainly not he replied stiffly neither you nor anybody could have foreseen what has happened when i say i would give ten thousand pounds to be out of this business i am blaming nobody but myself and when i tell you next that i for one wont allow mr armadales resurrection from the sea to be the ruin of me without a fight for it i tell you my dear madam one of the plainest truths i ever told to man or woman in the whole course of my life dont suppose i am invidiously separating my interests from yours in the common danger that now threatens us both i simply indicate the difference in the risk that we have respectively run you have not sunk the whole of your resources in establishing a sanitarium and you have not made a false declaration before a magistrate which is punishable as perjury by the law  i interrupted him again his selfishness did me more good than his tea it roused my temper effectually suppose we let your risk and my risk alone and come to the point i said what do you mean by making a fight for it i see a railway guide on your table does making a fight for it meanrunning away  running away repeated the doctor you appear to forget that every farthing i have in the world is embarked in this establishment  you stop here then i said  unquestionably  and what do you mean to do when mr armadale comes to england  a solitary fly the last of his race whom the winter had spared was buzzing feebly about the doctors face he caught it before he answered me and held it out across the table in his closed hand  if this flys name was armadale he said and if you had got him as i have got him now what would you do  his eyes fixed on my face up to this time turned significantly as he ended this question to my widows dress i too looked at it when he looked a thrill of the old deadly hatred and the old deadly determination ran through me again  i should kill him i said  the doctor started to his feet with the fly still in his hand and looked at mea little too theatricallywith an expression of the utmost horror  kill him repeated the doctor in a paroxysm of virtuous alarm violencemurderous violencein my sanitarium you take my breath away  i caught his eye while he was expressing himself in this elaborately indignant manner scrutinizing me with a searching curiosity which was to say the least of it a little at variance with the vehemence of his language and the warmth of his tone he laughed uneasily when our eyes met and recovered his smoothly confidential manner in the instant that elapsed before he spoke again  i beg a thousand pardons he said i ought to have known better than to take a lady too literally at her word permit me to remind you however that the circumstances are too serious for anything in the nature oflet us say an exaggeration or a joke you shall hear what i propose without further preface he paused and resumed his figurative use of the fly imprisoned in his hand here is mr armadale i can let him out or keep him in just as i pleaseand he knows it i say to him continued the doctor facetiously addressing the fly give me proper security mr armadale that no proceedings of any sort shall be taken against either this lady or myself and i will let you out of the hollow of my hand refuseand be the risk what it may i will keep you in can you doubt my dear madam what mr armadales answer is sooner or later certain to be can you doubt said the doctor suiting the action to the word and letting the fly go that it will end to the entire satisfaction of all parties in this way  i wont say at present i answered whether i doubt or not let me make sure that i understand you first you propose if i am not mistaken to shut the doors of this place on mr armadale and not to let him out again until he has agreed to the terms which it is our interest to impose on him may i ask in that case how you mean to make him walk into the trap that you have set for him here  i propose said the doctor with his hand on the railway guide ascertaining first at what time during every evening of this month the tidal trains from dover and folkestone reach the london bridge terminus and i propose next posting a person whom mr armadale knows and whom you and i can trust to wait the arrival of the trains and to meet our man at the moment when he steps out of the railway carriage  have you thought i inquired of who the person is to be  i have thought said the doctor taking up armadales letter of the person to whom this letter is addressed  the answer startled me was it possible that he and bashwood knew one another i put the question immediately  until today i never so much as heard of the gentlemans name said the doctor i have simply pursued the inductive process of reasoning for which we are indebted to the immortal bacon how does this very important letter come into your possession i cant insult you by supposing it to have been stolen consequently it has come to you with the leave and license of the person to whom it is addressed consequently that person is in your confidence consequently he is the first person i think of you see the process very good permit me a question or two on the subject of mr bashwood before we go on any further  the doctors questions went as straight to the point as usual my answers informed him that mr bashwood stood toward armadale in the relation of steward that he had received the letter at thorpe ambrose that morning and had brought it straight to me by the first train that he had not shown it or spoken of it before leaving to major milroy or to any one else that i had not obtained this service at his hands by trusting him with my secret that i had communicated with him in the character of armadales widow that he had suppressed the letter under those circumstances solely in obedience to a general caution i had given him to keep his own counsel if anything strange happened at thorpe ambrose until he had first consulted me and lastly that the reason why he had done as i told him in this matter was that in this matter and in all others mr bashwood was blindly devoted to my interests  at that point in the interrogatory the doctors eyes began to look at me distrustfully behind the doctors spectacles  what is the secret of this blind devotion of mr bashwoods to your interests he asked  i hesitated for a momentin pity to bashwood not in pity to myself if you must know i answered mr bashwood is in love with me  ay ay exclaimed the doctor with an air of relief i begin to understand now is he a young man  he is an old man  the doctor laid himself back in his chair and chuckled softly better and better he said here is the very man we want who so fit as mr armadales steward to meet mr armadale on his return to london and who so capable of influencing mr bashwood in the proper way as the charming object of mr bashwoods admiration  there could be no doubt that bashwood was the man to serve the doctors purpose and that my influence was to be trusted to make him serve it the difficulty was not here the difficulty was in the unanswered question that i had put to the doctor a minute since i put it to him again  suppose mr armadales steward meets his employer at the terminus i said may i ask once more how mr armadale is to be persuaded to come here  dont think me ungallant rejoined the doctor in his gentlest manner if i ask on my side how are men persuaded to do ninetenths of the foolish acts of their lives they are persuaded by your charming sex the weak side of every man is the womans side of him we have only to discover the womans side of mr armadaleto tickle him on it gentlyand to lead him our way with a silken string i observe here pursued the doctor opening armadales letter a reference to a certain young lady which looks promising where is the note that mr armadale speaks of as addressed to miss milroy  instead of answering him i started in a sudden burst of excitement to my feet the instant he mentioned miss milroys name all that i had heard from bashwood of her illness and of the cause of it rushed back into my memory i saw the means of decoying armadale into the sanitarium as plainly as i saw the doctor on the other side of the table wondering at the extraordinary change in me what a luxury it was to make miss milroy serve my interests at last  never mind the note i said its burned for fear of accidents i can tell you all and more than the note could have told you miss milroy cuts the knot miss milroy ends the difficulty she is privately engaged to him she has heard the false report of his death and she has been seriously ill at thorpe ambrose ever since when bashwood meets him at the station the very first question he is certain to ask  i see exclaimed the doctor anticipating me mr bashwood has nothing to do but to help the truth with a touch of fiction when he tells his master that the false report has reached miss milroy he has only to add that the shock has affected her head and that she is here under medical care perfect perfect we shall have him at the sanitarium as fast as the fastest cabhorse in london can bring him to us and mind no riskno necessity for trusting other people this is not a madhouse this is not a licensed establishment no doctors certificates are necessary here my dear lady i congratulate you i congratulate myself permit me to hand you the railway guide with my best compliments to mr bashwood and with the page turned down for him as an additional attention at the right place  remembering how long i had kept bashwood waiting for me i took the book at once and wished the doctor goodevening without further ceremony as he politely opened the door for me he reverted without the slightest necessity for doing so and without a word from me to lead to it to the outburst of virtuous alarm which had escaped him at the earlier part of our interview  i do hope he said that you will kindly forget and forgive my extraordinary want of tact and perception whenin short when i caught the fly i positively blush at my own stupidity in putting a literal interpretation on a ladys little joke violence in my sanitarium exclaimed the doctor with his eyes once more fixed attentively on my faceviolence in this enlightened nineteenth century was there ever anything so ridiculous do fasten your cloak before you go out it is so cold and raw shall i escort you shall i send my servant ah you were always independent always if i may say so a host in yourself may i call tomorrow morning and hear what you have settled with mr bashwood  i said yes and got away from him at last in a quarter of an hour more i was back at my lodgings and was informed by the servant that the elderly gentleman was still waiting for me  i have not got the heart or the patiencei hardly know whichto waste many words on what passed between me and bashwood it was so easy so degradingly easy to pull the strings of the poor old puppet in any way i pleased i met none of the difficulties which i should have been obliged to meet in the case of a younger man or of a man less infatuated with admiration for me i left the allusions to miss milroy in armadales letter which had naturally puzzled him to be explained at a future time i never even troubled myself to invent a plausible reason for wishing him to meet armadale at the terminus and to entrap him by a stratagem into the doctors sanitarium all that i found it necessary to do was to refer to what i had written to mr bashwood on my arrival in london and to what i had afterward said to him when he came to answer my letter personally at the hotel  you know already i said that my marriage has not been a happy one draw your own conclusions from that and dont press me to tell you whether the news of mr armadales rescue from the sea is or is not the welcome news that it ought to be to his wife that was enough to put his withered old face in a glow and to set his withered old hopes growing again i had only to add if you will do what i ask you to do no matter how incomprehensible and how mysterious my request may seem to be and if you will accept my assurances that you shall run no risk yourself and that you shall receive the proper explanations at the proper time you will have such a claim on my gratitude and my regard as no man living has ever had yet i had only to say those words and to point them by a look and a stolen pressure of his hand and i had him at my feet blindly eager to obey me if he could have seen what i thought of myself but that doesnt matter he saw nothing  hours have passed since i sent him away pledged to secrecy possessed of his instructions and provided with his timetable to the hotel near the terminus at which he is to stay till armadale appears on the railway platform the excitement of the earlier part of the evening has all worn off and the dull numbed sensation has got me again are my energies wearing out i wonder just at the time when i most want them or is some foreshadowing of disaster creeping over me which i dont yet understand  i might be in a humor to sit here for some time longer thinking thoughts like these and letting them find their way into words at their own will and pleasure if my diary would only let me but my idle pen has been busy enough to make its way to the end of the volume i have reached the last morsel of space left on the last page and whether i like it or not i must close the book this time for good and all when i close it tonight  goodby my old friend and companion of many a miserable day having nothing else to be fond of i half suspect myself of having been unreasonably fond of you  what a fool i am  the end of the fourth book     book the last     i at the terminus   on the night of the 2d of december mr bashwood took up his post of observation at the terminus of the southeastern railway for the first time it was an earlier date by six days than the date which allan had himself fixed for his return but the doctor taking counsel of his medical experience had considered it just probable that mr armadale might be perverse enough at his enviable age to recover sooner than his medical advisers might have anticipated for cautions sake therefore mr bashwood was instructed to begin watching the arrival of the tidal trains on the day after he had received his employers letter  from the 2d to the 7th of december the steward waited punctually on the platform saw the trains come in and satisfied himself evening after evening that the travelers were all strangers to him from the 2d to the 7th of december miss gwilt to return to the name under which she is best known in these pages received his daily report sometimes delivered personally sometimes sent by letter the doctor to whom the reports were communicated received them in his turn with unabated confidence in the precautions that had been adopted up to the morning of the 8th on that date the irritation of continued suspense had produced a change for the worse in miss gwilts variable temper which was perceptible to every one about her and which strangely enough was reflected by an equally marked change in the doctors manner when he came to pay his usual visit by a coincidence so extraordinary that his enemies might have suspected it of not being a coincidence at all the morning on which miss gwilt lost her patience proved to be also the morning on which the doctor lost his confidence for the first time  no news of course he said sitting down with a heavy sigh well well  miss gwilt looked up at him irritably from her work  you seem strangely depressed this morning she said what are you afraid of now  the imputation of being afraid madam answered the doctor solemnly is not an imputation to cast rashly on any maneven when he belongs to such an essentially peaceful profession as mine i am not afraid i am as you more correctly put it in the first instance strangely depressed my nature is as you know naturally sanguine and i only see today what but for my habitual hopefulness i might have seen and ought to have seen a week since  miss gwilt impatiently threw down her work if words cost money she said the luxury of talking would be rather an expensive luxury in your case  which i might have seen and ought to have seen reiterated the doctor without taking the slightest notice of the interruption a week since to put it plainly i feel by no means so certain as i did that mr armadale will consent without a struggle to the terms which it is my interest and in a minor degree yours to impose on him observe i dont question our entrapping him successfully into the sanitarium i only doubt whether he will prove quite as manageable as i originally anticipated when we have got him there say remarked the doctor raising his eyes for the first time and fixing them in steady inquiry on miss gwiltsay that he is bold obstinate what you please and that he holds outholds out for weeks together for months together as men in similar situations to his have held out before him what follows the risk of keeping him forcibly in concealmentof suppressing him if i may so express myselfincreases at compound interest and becomes enormous my house is at this moment virtually ready for patients patients may present themselves in a weeks time patients may communicate with mr armadale or mr armadale may communicate with patients a note may be smuggled out of the house and may reach the commissioners in lunacy even in the case of an unlicensed establishment like mine those gentlemenno those chartered despots in a land of libertyhave only to apply to the lord chancellor for an order and to enter by heavens to enter my sanitarium and search the house from top to bottom at a moments notice i dont wish to despond i dont wish to alarm you i dont pretend to say that the means we are taking to secure your own safety are any other than the best means at our disposal all i ask you to do is to imagine the commissioners in the houseand then to conceive the consequences the consequences repeated the doctor getting sternly on his feet and taking up his hat as if he meant to leave the room  have you anything more to say asked miss gwilt  have you any remarks rejoined the doctor to offer on your side  he stood hat in hand waiting for a full minute the two looked at each other in silence  miss gwilt spoke first  i think i understand you she said suddenly recovering her composure  i beg your pardon returned the doctor with his hand to his ear what did you say  nothing  nothing  if you happened to catch another fly this morning said miss gwilt with a bitterly sarcastic emphasis on the words i might be capable of shocking you by another little joke  the doctor held up both hands in polite deprecation and looked as if he was beginning to recover his good humor again  hard he murmured gently not to have forgiven me that unlucky blunder of mine even yet  what else have you to say i am waiting for you said miss gwilt she turned her chair to the window scornfully and took up her work again as she spoke  the doctor came behind her and put his hand on the back of her chair  i have a question to ask in the first place he said and a measure of necessary precaution to suggest in the second if you will honor me with your attention i will put the question first  i am listening  you know that mr armadale is alive pursued the doctor and you know that he is coming back to england why do you continue to wear your widows dress  she answered him without an instants hesitation steadily going on with her work  because i am of a sanguine disposition like you i mean to trust to the chapter of accidents to the very last mr armadale may die yet on his way home  and suppose he gets home alivewhat then  then there is another chance still left  what is it pray  he may die in your sanitarium  madam remonstrated the doctor in the deep bass which he reserved for his outbursts of virtuous indignation wait you spoke of the chapter of accidents he resumed gliding back into his softer conversational tones yes yes of course i understand you this time even the healing art is at the mercy of accidents even such a sanitarium as mine is liable to be surprised by death just so just so said the doctor conceding the question with the utmost impartiality there is the chapter of accidents i admitif you choose to trust to it mind i say emphatically if you choose to trust to it  there was another moment of silencesilence so profound that nothing was audible in the room but the rapid click of miss gwilts needle through her work  go on she said you havent done yet  true said the doctor having put my question i have my measure of precaution to impress on you next you will see my dear madam that i am not disposed to trust to the chapter of accidents on my side reflection has convinced me that you and i are not logically speaking so conveniently situated as we might be in case of emergency cabs are as yet rare in this rapidly improving neighborhood i am twenty minutes walk from you you are twenty minutes walk from me i know nothing of mr armadales character you know it well it might be necessaryvitally necessaryto appeal to your superior knowledge of him at a moments notice and how am i to do that unless we are within easy reach of each other under the same roof in both our interests i beg to invite you my dear madam to become for a limited period an inmate of my sanitarium  miss gwilts rapid needle suddenly stopped i understand you she said again as quietly as before  i beg your pardon said the doctor with another attack of deafness and with his hand once more at his ear  she laughed to herselfa low terrible laugh which startled even the doctor into taking his hand off the back of her chair  an inmate of your sanitarium she repeated you consult appearances in everything else do you propose to consult appearances in receiving me into your house  most assuredly replied the doctor with enthusiasm i am surprised at your asking me the question did you ever know a man of any eminence in my profession who set appearances at defiance if you honor me by accepting my invitation you enter my sanitarium in the most unimpeachable of all possible charactersin the character of a patient  when do you want my answer  can you decide today  tomorrow  yes have you anything more to say  nothing more  leave me then i dont keep up appearances i wish to be alone and i say so goodmorning  oh the sex the sex said the doctor with his excellent temper in perfect working order again so delightfully impulsive so charmingly reckless of what they say or how they say it oh woman in our hours of ease uncertain coy and hard to please there there there goodmorning  miss gwilt rose and looked after him contemptuously from the window when the street door had closed and he had left the house  armadale himself drove me to it the first time she said manuel drove me to it the second timeyou cowardly scoundrel shall i let you drive me to it for the third time and the last  she turned from the window and looked thoughtfully at her widows dress in the glass  the hours of the day passedand she decided nothing the night cameand she hesitated still the new morning dawnedand the terrible question was still unanswered  by the early post there came a letter for her it was mr bashwoods usual report again he had watched for allans arrival and again in vain  ill have more time she determined passionately no man alive shall hurry me faster than i like  at breakfast that morning the morning of the 9th the doctor was surprised in his study by a visit from miss gwilt  i want another day she said the moment the servant had closed the door on her  the doctor looked at her before he answered and saw the danger of driving her to extremities plainly expressed in her face  the time is getting on he remonstrated in his most persuasive manner for all we know to the contrary mr armadale may be here tonight  i want another day she repeated loudly and passionately  granted said the doctor looking nervously toward the door dont be too loudthe servants may hear you mind he added i depend on your honor not to press me for any further delay  you had better depend on my despair she said and left him  the doctor chipped the shell of his egg and laughed softly  quite right my dear he thought i remember where your despair led you in past times and i think i may trust it to lead you the same way now  at a quarter to eight oclock that night mr bashwood took up his post of observation as usual on the platform of the terminus at london bridge he was in the highest good spirits he smiled and smirked in irrepressible exultation the sense that he held in reserve a means of influence over miss gwilt in virtue of his knowledge of her past career had had no share in effecting the transformation that now appeared in him it had upheld his courage in his forlorn life at thorpe ambrose and it had given him that increased confidence of manner which miss gwilt herself had noticed but from the moment when he had regained his old place in her favor it had vanished as a motive power in him annihilated by the electric shock of her touch and her look his vanitythe vanity which in men at his age is only despair in disguisehad now lifted him to the seventh heaven of fatuous happiness once more he believed in her again as he believed in the smart new winter overcoat that he woreas he believed in the dainty little cane appropriate to the dawning dandyism of lads in their teens that he flourished in his hand he hummed the wornout old creature who had not sung since his childhood hummed as he paced the platform the few fragments he could remember of a wornout old song  the train was due as early as eight oclock that night at five minutes past the hour the whistle sounded in less than five minutes more the passengers were getting out on the platform  following the instructions that had been given to him mr bashwood made his way as well as the crowd would let him along the line of carriages and discovering no familiar face on that first investigation joined the passengers for a second search among them in the customhouse waitingroom next  he had looked round the room and had satisfied himself that the persons occupying it were all strangers when he heard a voice behind him exclaiming can that be mr bashwood he turned in eager expectation and found himself face to face with the last man under heaven whom he had expected to see  the man was midwinter     ii in the house   noticing mr bashwoods confusion after a moments glance at the change in his personal appearance midwinter spoke first  i see i have surprised you he said you are looking i suppose for somebody else have you heard from allan is he on his way home again already  the inquiry about allan though it would naturally have suggested itself to any one in midwinters position at that moment added to mr bashwoods confusion not knowing how else to extricate himself from the critical position in which he was placed he took refuge in simple denial  i know nothing about mr armadaleoh dear no sir i know nothing about mr armadale he answered with needless eagerness and hurry welcome back to england sir he went on changing the subject in his nervously talkative manner i didnt know you had been abroad its so long since we have had the pleasuresince i have had the pleasure have you enjoyed yourself sir in foreign parts such different manners from oursyes yes yessuch different manners from ours do you make a long stay in england now you have come back  i hardly know said midwinter i have been obliged to alter my plans and to come to england unexpectedly he hesitated a little his manner changed and he added in lower tones a serious anxiety has brought me back i cant say what my plans will be until that anxiety is set at rest  the light of a lamp fell on his face while he spoke and mr bashwood observed for the first time that he looked sadly worn and changed  im sorry sirim sure im very sorry if i could be of any use suggested mr bashwood speaking under the influence in some degree of his nervous politeness and in some degree of his remembrance of what midwinter had done for him at thorpe ambrose in the bygone time  midwinter thanked him and turned away sadly i am afraid you can be of no use mr bashwoodbut i am obliged to you for your offer all the same he stopped and considered a little suppose she should not be ill suppose some misfortune should have happened he resumed speaking to himself and turning again toward the steward if she has left her mother some trace of her might be found by inquiring at thorpe ambrose  mr bashwoods curiosity was instantly aroused the whole sex was interesting to him now for the sake of miss gwilt  a lady sir he inquired are you looking for a lady  i am looking said midwinter simply for my wife  married sir exclaimed mr bashwood married since i last had the pleasure of seeing you might i take the liberty of asking  midwinters eyes dropped uneasily to the ground  you knew the lady in former times he said i have married miss gwilt  the steward started back as he might have started back from a loaded pistol leveled at his head his eyes glared as if he had suddenly lost his senses and the nervous trembling to which he was subject shook him from head to foot  whats the matter said midwinter there was no answer what is there so very startling he went on a little impatiently in miss gwilts being my wife  your wife repeated mr bashwood helplessly mrs armadale he checked himself by a desperate effort and said no more  the stupor of astonishment which possessed the steward was instantly reflected in midwinters face the name in which he had secretly married his wife had passed the lips of the last man in the world whom he would have dreamed of admitting into his confidence he took mr bashwood by the arm and led him away to a quieter part of the terminus than the part of it in which they had hitherto spoken to each other  you referred to my wife just now he said and you spoke of mrs armadale in the same breath what do you mean by that  again there was no answer utterly incapable of understanding more than that he had involved himself in some serious complication which was a complete mystery to him mr bashwood struggled to extricate himself from the grasp that was laid on him and struggled in vain  midwinter sternly repeated the question i ask you again he said what do you mean by it  nothing sir i give you my word of honor i meant nothing he felt the hand on his arm tightening its grasp he saw even in the obscurity of the remote corner in which they stood that midwinters fiery temper was rising and was not to be trifled with the extremity of his danger inspired him with the one ready capacity that a timid man possesses when he is compelled by main force to face an emergencythe capacity to lie i only meant to say sir he burst out with a desperate effort to look and speak confidently that mr armadale would be surprised  you said mrs armadale  no siron my word of honor on my sacred word of honor you are mistakenyou are indeed i said mr armadalehow could i say anything else please to let me go sirim pressed for time i do assure you im dreadfully pressed for time  for a moment longer midwinter maintained his hold and in that moment he decided what to do  he had accurately stated his motive for returning to england as proceeding from anxiety about his wifeanxiety naturally caused after the regular receipt of a letter from her every other or every third day by the sudden cessation of the correspondence between them on her side for a whole week the first vaguely terrible suspicion of some other reason for her silence than the reason of accident or of illness to which he had hitherto attributed it had struck through him like a sudden chill the instant he heard the steward associate the name of mrs armadale with the idea of his wife little irregularities in her correspondence with him which he had thus far only thought strange now came back on his mind and proclaimed themselves to be suspicions as well he had hitherto believed the reasons she had given for referring him when he answered her letters to no more definite address than an address at a postoffice now he suspected her reasons of being excuses for the first time he had hitherto resolved on reaching london to inquire at the only place he knew of at which a clew to her could be foundthe address she had given him as the address at which her mother lived now with a motive which he was afraid to define even to himself but which was strong enough to overbear every other consideration in his mind he determined before all things to solve the mystery of mr bashwoods familiarity with a secret which was a marriage secret between himself and his wife any direct appeal to a man of the stewards disposition in the stewards present state of mind would be evidently useless the weapon of deception was in this case a weapon literally forced into midwinters hands he let go of mr bashwoods arm and accepted mr bashwoods explanation  i beg your pardon he said i have no doubt you are right pray attribute my rudeness to overanxiety and overfatigue i wish you goodevening  the station was by this time almost a solitude the passengers by the train being assembled at the examination of their luggage in the customhouse waitingroom it was no easy matter ostensibly to take leave of mr bashwood and really to keep him in view but midwinters early life with the gypsy master had been of a nature to practice him in such stratagems as he was now compelled to adopt he walked away toward the waitingroom by the line of empty carriages opened the door of one of them as if to look after something that he had left behind and detected mr bashwood making for the cabrank on the opposite side of the platform in an instant midwinter had crossed and had passed through the long row of vehicles so as to skirt it on the side furthest from the platform he entered the second cab by the lefthand door the moment after mr bashwood had entered the first cab by the righthand door double your fare whatever it is he said to the driver if you keep the cab before you in view and follow it wherever it goes in a minute more both vehicles were on their way out of the station  the clerk sat in the sentrybox at the gate taking down the destinations of the cabs as they passed midwinter heard the man who was driving him call out hampstead as he went by the clerks window  why did you say hampstead he asked when they had left the station  because the man before me said hampstead sir answered the driver  over and over again on the wearisome journey to the northwestern suburb midwinter asked if the cab was still in sight over and over again the man answered right in front of us  it was between nine and ten oclock when the driver pulled up his horse at last midwinter got out and saw the cab before them waiting at a house door as soon as he had satisfied himself that the driver was the man whom mr bashwood had hired he paid the promised reward and dismissed his own cab  he took a turn backward and forward before the door the vaguely terrible suspicion which had risen in his mind at the terminus had forced itself by this time into a definite form which was abhorrent to him without the shadow of an assignable reason for it he found himself blindly distrusting his wifes fidelity and blindly suspecting mr bashwood of serving her in the capacity of gobetween in sheer horror of his own morbid fancy he determined to take down the number of the house and the name of the street in which it stood and then in justice to his wife to return at once to the address which she had given him as the address at which her mother lived he had taken out his pocketbook and was on his way to the corner of the street when he observed the man who had driven mr bashwood looking at him with an expression of inquisitive surprise the idea of questioning the cabdriver while he had the opportunity instantly occurred to him he took a halfcrown from his pocket and put it into the mans ready hand  has the gentleman whom you drove from the station gone into that house he asked  yes sir  did you hear him inquire for anybody when the door was opened  he asked for a lady sir mrs the man hesitated it wasnt a common name sir i should know it again if i heard it  was it midwinter  no sir  armadale  thats it sir mrs armadale  are you sure it was mrs and not mr  im as sure as a man can be who hasnt taken any particular notice sir  the doubt implied in that last answer decided midwinter to investigate the matter on the spot he ascended the house steps as he raised his hand to the bell at the side of the door the violence of his agitation mastered him physically for the moment a strange sensation as of something leaping up from his heart to his brain turned his head wildly giddy he held by the house railings and kept his face to the air and resolutely waited till he was steady again then he rang the bell  ishe tried to ask for mrs armadale when the maidservant had opened the door but not even his resolution could force the name to pass his lipsis your mistress at home he asked  yes sir  the girl showed him into a back parlor and presented him to a little old lady with an obliging manner and a bright pair of eyes  there is some mistake said midwinter i wished to see once more he tried to utter the name and once more he failed to force it to his lips  mrs armadale suggested the little old lady with a smile  yes  show the gentleman upstairs jenny  the girl led the way to the drawingroom floor  any name sir  no name   mr bashwood had barely completed his report of what had happened at the terminus mr bashwoods imperious mistress was still sitting speechless under the shock of the discovery that had burst on herwhen the door of the room opened and without a word of warning to proceed him midwinter appeared on the threshold he took one step into the room and mechanically pushed the door to behind him he stood in dead silence and confronted his wife with a scrutiny that was terrible in its unnatural selfpossession and that enveloped her steadily in one comprehensive look from head to foot  in dead silence on her side she rose from her chair in dead silence she stood erect on the hearthrug and faced her husband in widows weeds  he took one step nearer to her and stopped again he lifted his hand and pointed with his lean brown finger at her dress  what does that mean he asked without losing his terrible selfpossession and without moving his outstretched hand  at the sound of his voice the quick rise and fall of her bosomwhich had been the one outward betrayal thus far of the inner agony that tortured hersuddenly stopped she stood impenetrably silent breathlessly stillas if his question had struck her dead and his pointing hand had petrified her  he advanced one step nearer and reiterated his words in a voice even lower and quieter than the voice in which he had spoken first  one moment more of silence one moment more of inaction might have been the salvation of her but the fatal force of her character triumphed at the crisis of her destiny and his white and still and haggard and old she met the dreadful emergency with a dreadful courage and spoke the irrevocable words which renounced him to his face  mr midwinter she said in tones unnaturally hard and unnaturally clear our acquaintance hardly entitles you to speak to me in that manner those were her words she never lifted her eyes from the ground while she spoke them when she had done the last faint vestige of color in her cheeks faded out  there was a pause still steadily looking at her he set himself to fix the language she had used to him in his mind she calls me mr midwinter he said slowly in a whisper she speaks of our acquaintance he waited a little and looked round the room his wandering eyes encountered mr bashwood for the first time he saw the steward standing near the fireplace trembling and watching him  i once did you a service he said and you once told me you were not an ungrateful man are you grateful enough to answer me if i ask you something  he waited a little again mr bashwood still stood trembling at the fireplace silently watching him  i see you looking at me he went on is there some change in me that i am not conscious of myself am i seeing things that you dont see am i hearing words that you dont hear am i looking or speaking like a man out of his senses  again he waited and again the silence was unbroken his eyes began to glitter and the savage blood that he had inherited from his mother rose dark and slow in his ashy cheeks  is that woman he asked the woman whom you once knew whose name was miss gwilt  once more his wife collected her fatal courage once more his wife spoke her fatal words  you compel me to repeat she said that you are presuming on our acquaintance and that you are forgetting what is due to me  he turned upon her with a savage suddenness which forced a cry of alarm from mr bashwoods lips  are you or are you not my wife he asked through his set teeth  she raised her eyes to his for the first time her lost spirit looked at him steadily defiant out of the hell of its own despair  i am not your wife she said  he staggered back with his hands groping for something to hold by like the hands of a man in the dark he leaned heavily against the wall of the room and looked at the woman who had slept on his bosom and who had denied him to his face  mr bashwood stole panicstricken to her side go in there he whispered trying to draw her toward the foldingdoors which led into the next room for gods sake be quick hell kill you  she put the old man back with her hand she looked at him with a sudden irradiation of her blank face she answered him with lips that struggled slowly into a frightful smile  let him kill me she said  as the words passed her lips he sprang forward from the wall with a cry that rang through the house the frenzy of a maddened man flashed at her from his glassy eyes and clutched at her in his threatening hands he came on till he was within armslength of herand suddenly stood still the black flush died out of his face in the instant when he stopped his eyelids fell his outstretched hands wavered and sank helpless he dropped as the dead drop he lay as the dead lie in the arms of the wife who had denied him  she knelt on the floor and rested his head on her knee she caught the arm of the steward hurrying to help her with a hand that closed round it like a vise go for a doctor she said and keep the people of the house away till he comes there was that in her eye there was that in her voice which would have warned any man living to obey her in silence in silence mr bashwood submitted and hurried out of the room  the instant she was alone she raised him from her knee with both arms clasped round him the miserable woman lifted his lifeless face to hers and rocked him on her bosom in an agony of tenderness beyond all relief in tears in a passion of remorse beyond all expression in words in silence she held him to her breast in silence she devoured his forehead his cheeks his lips with kisses not a sound escaped her till she heard the trampling footsteps outside hurrying up the stairs then a low moan burst from her lips as she looked her last at him and lowered his head again to her knee before the strangers came in  the landlady and the steward were the first persons whom she saw when the door was opened the medical man a surgeon living in the street followed the horror and the beauty of her face as she looked up at him absorbed the surgeons attention for the moment to the exclusion of everything else she had to beckon to him she had to point to the senseless man before she could claim his attention for his patient and divert it from herself  is he dead she asked  the surgeon carried midwinter to the sofa and ordered the windows to be opened it is a fainting fit he said nothing more  at that answer her strength failed her for the first time she drew a deep breath of relief and leaned on the chimneypiece for support mr bashwood was the only person present who noticed that she was overcome he led her to the opposite end of the room where there was an easychair leaving the landlady to hand the restoratives to the surgeon as they were wanted  are you going to wait here till he recovers whispered the steward looking toward the sofa and trembling as he looked  the question forced her to a sense of her positionto a knowledge of the merciless necessities which that position now forced her to confront with a heavy sigh she looked toward the sofa considered with herself for a moment and answered mr bashwoods inquiry by a question on her side  is the cab that brought you here from the railway still at the door  yes  drive at once to the gates of the sanitarium and wait there till i join you  mr bashwood hesitated she lifted her eyes to his and with a look sent him out of the room  the gentleman is coming to maam said the landlady as the steward closed the door he has just breathed again  she bowed in mute reply rose and considered with herself once morelooked toward the sofa for the second timethen passed through the foldingdoors into her own room  after a short lapse of time the surgeon drew back from the sofa and motioned to the landlady to stand aside the bodily recovery of the patient was assured there was nothing to be done now but to wait and let his mind slowly recall its sense of what had happened  where is she were the first words he said to the surgeon and the landlady anxiously watching him  the landlady knocked at the foldingdoors and received no answer she went in and found the room empty a sheet of notepaper was on the dressingtable with the doctors fee placed on it the paper contained these lines evidently written in great agitation or in great haste it is impossible for me to remain here tonight after what has happened i will return tomorrow to take away my luggage and to pay what i owe you  where is she midwinter asked again when the landlady returned alone to the drawingroom  gone sir  i dont believe it  the old ladys color rose if you know her handwriting sir she answered handing him the sheet of notepaper perhaps you may believe that  he looked at the paper i beg your pardon maam he said as he handed it backi beg your pardon with all my heart  there was something in his face as he spoke those words which more than soothed the old ladys irritation it touched her with a sudden pity for the man who had offended her i am afraid there is some dreadful trouble sir at the bottom of all this she said simply do you wish me to give any message to the lady when she comes back  midwinter rose and steadied himself for a moment against the sofa i will bring my own message tomorrow he said i must see her before she leaves your house  the surgeon accompanied his patient into the street can i see you home he said kindly you had better not walk if it is far you mustnt overexert yourself you mustnt catch a chill this cold night  midwinter took his hand and thanked him i have been used to hard walking and cold nights sir he said and i am not easily worn out even when i look so broken as i do now if you will tell me the nearest way out of these streets i think the quiet of the country and the quiet of the night will help me i have something serious to do tomorrow he added in a lower tone and i cant rest or sleep till i have thought over it tonight  the surgeon understood that he had no common man to deal with he gave the necessary directions without any further remark and parted with his patient at his own door  left by himself midwinter paused and looked up at the heavens in silence the night had cleared and the stars were outthe stars which he had first learned to know from his gypsy master on the hillside for the first time his mind went back regretfully to his boyish days oh for the old life he thought longingly i never knew till now how happy the old life was  he roused himself and went on toward the open country his face darkened as he left the streets behind him and advanced into the solitude and obscurity that lay beyond  she has denied her husband tonight he said she shall know her master tomorrow     iii the purple flask   the cab was waiting at the gates as miss gwilt approached the sanitarium mr bashwood got out and advanced to meet her she took his arm and led him aside a few steps out of the cabmans hearing  think what you like of me she said keeping her thick black veil down over her face but dont speak to me tonight drive back to your hotel as if nothing had happened meet the tidal train tomorrow as usual and come to me afterward at the sanitarium go without a word and i shall believe there is one man in the world who really loves me stay and ask questions and i shall bid you goodby at once and forever  she pointed to the cab in a minute more it had left the sanitarium and was taking mr bashwood back to his hotel  she opened the iron gate and walked slowly up to the house door a shudder ran through her as she rang the bell she laughed bitterly shivering again she said to herself who would have thought i had so much feeling left in me  for once in her life the doctors face told the truth when the study door opened between ten and eleven at night and miss gwilt entered the room  mercy on me he exclaimed with a look of the blankest bewilderment what does this mean  it means she answered that i have decided tonight instead of deciding tomorrow you who know women so well ought to know that they act on impulse i am here on an impulse take me or leave me just as you like  take you or leave you repeated the doctor recovering his presence of mind my dear lady what a dreadful way of putting it your room shall be got ready instantly where is your luggage will you let me send for it no you can do without your luggage tonight what admirable fortitude you will fetch it yourself tomorrow what extraordinary independence do take off your bonnet do draw in to the fire what can i offer you  offer me the strongest sleeping draught you ever made in your life she replied and leave me alone till the time comes to take it i shall be your patient in earnest she added fiercely as the doctor attempted to remonstrate i shall be the maddest of the mad if you irritate me tonight  the principal of the sanitarium became gravely and briefly professional in an instant  sit down in that dark corner he said not a soul shall disturb you in half an hour you will find your room ready and your sleeping draught on the tableits been a harder struggle for her than i anticipated he thought as he left the room and crossed to his dispensary on the opposite side of the hall good heavens what business has she with a conscience after such a life as hers has been  the dispensary was elaborately fitted up with all the latest improvements in medical furniture but one of the four walls of the room was unoccupied by shelves and here the vacant space was filled by a handsome antique cabinet of carved wood curiously out of harmony as an object with the unornamented utilitarian aspect of the place generally on either side of the cabinet two speakingtubes were inserted in the wall communicating with the upper regions of the house and labeled respectively resident dispenser and head nurse into the second of these tubes the doctor spoke on entering the room an elderly woman appeared took her orders for preparing mrs armadales bedchamber courtesied and retired  left alone again in the dispensary the doctor unlocked the center compartment of the cabinet and disclosed a collection of bottles inside containing the various poisons used in medicine after taking out the laudanum wanted for the sleeping draught and placing it on the dispensary table he went back to the cabinet looked into it for a little while shook his head doubtfully and crossed to the open shelves on the opposite side of the room  here after more consideration he took down one out of the row of large chemical bottles before him filled with a yellow liquid placing the bottle on the table he returned to the cabinet and opened a side compartment containing some specimens of bohemian glasswork after measuring it with his eye he took from the specimens a handsome purple flask high and narrow in form and closed by a glass stopper this he filled with the yellow liquid leaving a small quantity only at the bottom of the bottle and locking up the flask again in the place from which he had taken it the bottle was next restored to its place after having been filled up with water from the cistern in the dispensary mixed with certain chemical liquids in small quantities which restored it so far as appearances went to the condition in which it had been when it was first removed from the shelf having completed these mysterious proceedings the doctor laughed softly and went back to his speakingtubes to summon the resident dispenser next  the resident dispenser made his appearance shrouded in the necessary white apron from his waist to his feet the doctor solemnly wrote a prescription for a composing draught and handed it to his assistant  wanted immediately benjamin he said in a soft and melancholy voice a lady patientmrs armadale room no 1 second floor ah dear dear groaned the doctor absently an anxious case benjaminan anxious case he opened the brandnew ledger of the establishment and entered the case at full length with a brief abstract of the prescription have you done with the laudanum put it back and lock the cabinet and give me the key is the draught ready label it to be taken at bedtime and give it to the nurse benjamingive it to the nurse  while the doctors lips were issuing these directions the doctors hands were occupied in opening a drawer under the desk on which the ledger was placed he took out some gayly printed cards of admission to view the sanitarium between the hours of two and four pm and filled them up with the date of the next day december 10th when a dozen of the cards had been wrapped up in a dozen lithographed letters of invitation and inclosed in a dozen envelopes he next consulted a list of the families resident in the neighborhood and directed the envelopes from the list ringing a bell this time instead of speaking through a tube he summoned the manservant and gave him the letters to be delivered by hand the first thing the next morning i think it will do said the doctor taking a turn in the dispensary when the servant had gone outi think it will do while he was still absorbed in his own reflections the nurse reappeared to announce that the ladys room was ready and the doctor thereupon formally returned to the study to communicate the information to miss gwilt  she had not moved since he left her she rose from her dark corner when he made his announcement and without speaking or raising her veil glided out of the room like a ghost  after a brief interval the nurse came downstairs again with a word for her masters private ear  the lady has ordered me to call her tomorrow at seven oclock sir she said she means to fetch her luggage herself and she wants to have a cab at the door as soon as she is dressed what am i to do  do what the lady tells you said the doctor she may be safely trusted to return to the sanitarium  the breakfast hour at the sanitarium was halfpast eight oclock by that time miss gwilt had settled everything at her lodgings and had returned with her luggage in her own possession the doctor was quite amazed at the promptitude of his patient  why waste so much energy he asked when they met at the breakfasttable why be in such a hurry my dear lady when you had all the morning before you  mere restlessness she said briefly the longer i live the more impatient i get  the doctor who had noticed before she spoke that her face looked strangely pale and old that morning observed when she answered him that her expressionnaturally mobile in no ordinary degreeremained quite unaltered by the effort of speaking there was none of the usual animation on her lips none of the usual temper in her eyes he had never seen her so impenetrably and coldly composed as he saw her now she has made up her mind at last he thought i may say to her this morning what i couldnt say to her last night  he prefaced the coming remarks by a warning look at her widows dress  now you have got your luggage he began gravely permit me to suggest putting that cap away and wearing another gown  why  do you remember what you told me a day or two since asked the doctor you said there was a chance of mr armadales dying in my sanitarium  i will say it again if you like  a more unlikely chance pursued the doctor deaf as ever to all awkward interruptions it is hardly possible to imagine but as long as it is a chance at all it is worth considering say then that he diesdies suddenly and unexpectedly and makes a coroners inquest necessary in the house what is our course in that case our course is to preserve the characters to which we have committed ourselvesyou as his widow and i as the witness of your marriageand in those characters to court the fullest inquiry in the entirely improbable event of his dying just when we want him to die my ideai might even say my resolutionis to admit that we knew of his resurrection from the sea and to acknowledge that we instructed mr bashwood to entrap him into this house by means of a false statement about miss milroy when the inevitable questions follow i propose to assert that he exhibited symptoms of mental alienation shortly after your marriage that his delusion consisted in denying that you were his wife and in declaring that he was engaged to be married to miss milroy that you were in such terror of him on this account when you heard he was alive and coming back as to be in a state of nervous agitation that required my care that at your request and to calm that nervous agitation i saw him professionally and got him quietly into the house by a humoring of his delusion perfectly justifiable in such a case and lastly that i can certify his brain to have been affected by one of those mysterious disorders eminently incurable eminently fatal in relation to which medical science is still in the dark such a course as this in the remotely possible event which we are now supposing would be in your interests and mine unquestionably the right course to take and such a dress as that is just as certainly under existing circumstances the wrong dress to wear  shall i take it off at once she asked rising from the breakfasttable without a word of remark on what had just been said to her  anytime before two oclock today will do said the doctor  she looked at him with a languid curiositynothing more why before two she inquired  because this is one of my visitors days and the visitors time is from two to four  what have i to do with your visitors  simply this i think it important that perfectly respectable and perfectly disinterested witnesses should see you in my house in the character of a lady who has come to consult me  your motive seems rather farfetched is it the only motive you have in the matter  my dear dear lady remonstrated the doctor have i any concealments from you surely you ought to know me better than that  yes she said with a weary contempt its dull enough of me not to understand you by this time send word upstairs when i am wanted she left him and went back to her room   two oclock came and in a quarter of an hour afterward the visitors had arrived short as the notice had been cheerless as the sanitarium looked to spectators from without the doctors invitation had been largely accepted nevertheless by the female members of the families whom he had addressed in the miserable monotony of the lives led by a large section of the middle classes of england anything is welcome to the women which offers them any sort of harmless refuge from the established tyranny of the principle that all human happiness begins and ends at home while the imperious needs of a commercial country limited the representatives of the male sex among the doctors visitors to one feeble old man and one sleepy little boy the women poor souls to the number of no less than sixteenold and young married and singlehad seized the golden opportunity of a plunge into public life harmoniously united by the two common objects which they all had in viewin the first place to look at each other and in the second place to look at the sanitariumthey streamed in neatly dressed procession through the doctors dreary iron gates with a thin varnish over them of assumed superiority to all unladylike excitement most significant and most pitiable to see  the proprietor of the sanitarium received his visitors in the hall with miss gwilt on his arm the hungry eyes of every woman in the company overlooked the doctor as if no such person had existed and fixing on the strange lady devoured her from head to foot in an instant  my first inmate said the doctor presenting miss gwilt this lady only arrived late last night and she takes the present opportunity the only one my mornings engagements have allowed me to give her of going over the sanitariumallow me maam he went on releasing miss gwilt and giving his arm to the eldest lady among the visitors shattered nervesdomestic anxiety he whispered confidentially sweet woman sad case he sighed softly and led the old lady across the hall  the flock of visitors followed miss gwilt accompanying them in silence and walking aloneamong them but not of themthe last of all  the grounds ladies and gentlemen said the doctor wheeling round and addressing his audience from the foot of the stairs are as you have seen in a partially unfinished condition under any circumstances i should lay little stress on the grounds having hampstead heath so near at hand and carriage exercise and horse exercise being parts of my system in a lesser degree it is also necessary for me to ask your indulgence for the basement floor on which we now stand the waitingroom and study on that side and the dispensary on the other to which i shall presently ask your attention are completed but the large drawingroom is still in the decorators hands in that room when the walls are drynot a moment before my inmates will assemble for cheerful society nothing will be spared that can improve elevate and adorn life at these happy little gatherings every evening for example there will be music for those who like it  at this point there was a faint stir among the visitors a mother of a family interrupted the doctor she begged to know whether music every evening included sunday evening and if so what music was performed  sacred music of course maam said the doctor handel on sunday eveningand haydn occasionally when not too cheerful but as i was about to say music is not the only entertainment offered to my nervous inmates amusing reading is provided for those who prefer books  there was another stir among the visitors another mother of a family wished to know whether amusing reading meant novels  only such novels as i have selected and perused myself in the first instance said the doctor nothing painful maam there may be plenty that is painful in real life but for that very reason we dont want it in books the english novelist who enters my house no foreign novelist will be admitted must understand his art as the healthyminded english reader understands it in our time he must know that our purer modern taste our higher modern morality limits him to doing exactly two things for us when he writes us a book all we want of him isoccasionally to make us laugh and invariably to make us comfortable  there was a third stir among the visitorscaused plainly this time by approval of the sentiments which they had just heard the doctor wisely cautious of disturbing the favorable impression that he had produced dropped the subject of the drawingroom and led the way upstairs as before the company followed and as before miss gwilt walked silently behind them last of all one after another the ladies looked at her with the idea of speaking and saw something in her face utterly unintelligible to them which checked the wellmeant words on their lips the prevalent impression was that the principal of the sanitarium had been delicately concealing the truth and that his first inmate was mad  the doctor led the waywith intervals of breathingtime accorded to the old lady on his armstraight to the top of the house having collected his visitors in the corridor and having waved his hand indicatively at the numbered doors opening out of it on either side he invited the company to look into any or all of the rooms at their own pleasure  numbers one to four ladies and gentlemen said the doctor include the dormitories of the attendants numbers four to eight are rooms intended for the accommodation of the poorer class of patients whom i receive on terms which simply cover my expenditurenothing more in the cases of these poorer persons among my suffering fellow creatures personal piety and the recommendation of two clergymen are indispensable to admission those are the only conditions i make but those i insist on pray observe that the rooms are all ventilated and the bedsteads all iron and kindly notice as we descend again to the second floor that there is a door shutting off all communication between the second story and the top story when necessary the rooms on the second floor which we have now reached are with the exception of my own room entirely devoted to the reception of ladyinmatesexperience having convinced me that the greater sensitiveness of the female constitution necessitates the higher position of the sleeping apartment with a view to the greater purity and freer circulation of the air here the ladies are established immediately under my care while my assistantphysician whom i expect to arrive in a weeks time looks after the gentlemen on the floor beneath observe again as we descend to this lower or first floor a second door closing all communication at night between the two stories to every one but the assistant physician and myself and now that we have reached the gentlemans part of the house and that you have observed for yourselves the regulations of the establishment permit me to introduce you to a specimen of my system of treatment next i can exemplify it practically by introducing you to a room fitted up under my own direction for the accommodation of the most complicated cases of nervous suffering and nervous delusion that can come under my care  he threw open the door of a room at one extremity of the corridor numbered four look in ladies and gentlemen he said and if you see anything remarkable pray mention it  the room was not very large but it was well lit by one broad window comfortably furnished as a bedroom it was only remarkable among other rooms of the same sort in one way it had no fireplace the visitors having noticed this were informed that the room was warmed in winter by means of hot water and were then invited back again into the corridor to make the discoveries under professional direction which they were unable to make for themselves  a word ladies and gentlemen said the doctor literally a word on nervous derangement first what is the process of treatment when let us say mental anxiety has broken you down and you apply to your doctor he sees you hears you and gives you two prescriptions one is written on paper and made up at the chemists the other is administered by word of mouth at the propitious moment when the fee is ready and consists in a general recommendation to you to keep your mind easy that excellent advice given your doctor leaves you to spare yourself all earthly annoyances by your own unaided efforts until he calls again here my system steps in and helps you when i see the necessity of keeping your mind easy i take the bull by the horns and do it for you i place you in a sphere of action in which the ten thousand trifles which must and do irritate nervous people at home are expressly considered and provided against i throw up impregnable moral intrenchments between worry and you find a door banging in this house if you can catch a servant in this house rattling the teathings when he takes away the tray discover barking dogs crowing cocks hammering workmen screeching children hereand i engage to close my sanitarium tomorrow are these nuisances laughing matters to nervous people ask them can they escape these nuisances at home ask them will ten minutes irritation from a barking dog or a screeching child undo every atom of good done to a nervous sufferer by a months medical treatment there isnt a competent doctor in england who will venture to deny it on those plain grounds my system is based i assert the medical treatment of nervous suffering to be entirely subsidiary to the moral treatment of it that moral treatment of it you find here that moral treatment sedulously pursued throughout the day follows the sufferer into his room at night and soothes helps and cures him without his own knowledgeyou shall see how  the doctor paused to take breath and looked for the first time since the visitors had entered the house at miss gwilt for the first time on her side she stepped forward among the audience and looked at him in return after a momentary obstruction in the shape of a cough the doctor went on  say ladies and gentlemen he proceeded that my patient has just come in his mind is one mass of nervous fancies and caprices which his friends with the best possible intentions have been ignorantly irritating at home they have been afraid of him for instance at night they have forced him to have somebody to sleep in the room with him or they have forbidden him in case of accidents to lock his door he comes to me the first night and says mind i wont have anybody in my roomcertainly noti insist on locking my doorby all means in he goes and locks his door and there he is soothed and quieted predisposed to confidence predisposed to sleep by having his own way this is all very well you may say but suppose something happens suppose he has a fit in the night what then you shall see hallo my young friend cried the doctor suddenly addressing the sleepy little boy lets have a game you shall be the poor sick man and ill be the good doctor go into that room and lock the door theres a brave boy have you locked it very good do you think i cant get at you if i like i wait till youre asleepi press this little white button hidden here in the stencilled pattern of the outer wallthe mortise of the lock inside falls back silently against the doorpostand i walk into the room whenever i like the same plan is pursued with the window my capricious patient wont open it at night when he ought i humor him again shut it dear sir by all means as soon as he is asleep i pull the black handle hidden here in the corner of the wall the window of the room inside noiselessly opens as you see say the patients caprice is the other wayhe persists in opening the window when he ought to shut it let him by all means let him i pull a second handle when he is snug in his bed and the window noiselessly closes in a moment nothing to irritate him ladies and gentlemenabsolutely nothing to irritate him but i havent done with him yet epidemic disease in spite of all my precautions may enter this sanitarium and may render the purifying of the sickroom necessary or the patients case may be complicated by other than nervous maladysay for instance asthmatic difficulty of breathing in the one case fumigation is necessary in the other additional oxygen in the air will give relief the epidemic nervous patient says i wont be smoked under my own nose the asthmatic nervous patient gasps with terror at the idea of a chemical explosion in his room i noiselessly fumigate one of them i noiselessly oxygenize the other by means of a simple apparatus fixed outside in the corner here it is protected by this wooden casing it is locked with my own key and it communicates by means of a tube with the interior of the room look at it  with a preliminary glance at miss gwilt the doctor unlocked the lid of the wooden casing and disclosed inside nothing more remarkable than a large stone jar having a glass funnel and a pipe communicating with the wall inserted in the cork which closed the mouth of it with another look at miss gwilt the doctor locked the lid again and asked in the blandest manner whether his system was intelligible now  i might introduce you to all sorts of other contrivances of the same kind he resumed leading the way downstairs but it would be only the same thing over and over again a nervous patient who always has his own way is a nervous patient who is never worried and a nervous patient who is never worried is a nervous patient cured there it is in a nutshell come and see the dispensary ladies the dispensary and the kitchen next  once more miss gwilt dropped behind the visitors and waited alonelooking steadfastly at the room which the doctor had opened and at the apparatus which the doctor had unlocked again without a word passing between them she had understood him she knew as well as if he had confessed it that he was craftily putting the necessary temptation in her way before witnesses who could speak to the superficially innocent acts which they had seen if anything serious happened the apparatus originally constructed to serve the purpose of the doctors medical crotchets was evidently to be put to some other use of which the doctor himself had probably never dreamed till now and the chances were that before the day was over that other use would be privately revealed to her at the right moment in the presence of the right witness armadale will die this time she said to herself as she went slowly down the stairs the doctor will kill him by my hands  the visitors were in the dispensary when she joined them all the ladies were admiring the beauty of the antique cabinet and as a necessary consequence all the ladies were desirous of seeing what was inside the doctorafter a preliminary look at miss gwiltgoodhumoredly shook his head there is nothing to interest you inside he said nothing but rows of little shabby bottles containing the poisons used in medicine which i keep under lock and key come to the kitchen ladies and honor me with your advice on domestic matters below stairs he glanced again at miss gwilt as the company crossed the hall with a look which said plainly wait here  in another quarter of an hour the doctor had expounded his views on cookery and diet and the visitors duly furnished with prospectuses were taking leave of him at the door quite an intellectual treat they said to each other as they streamed out again in neatly dressed procession through the iron gates and what a very superior man  the doctor turned back to the dispensary humming absently to himself and failing entirely to observe the corner of the hall in which miss gwilt stood retired after an instants hesitation she followed him the assistant was in the room when she entered itsummoned by his employer the moment before  doctor she said coldly and mechanically as if she was repeating a lesson i am as curious as the other ladies about that pretty cabinet of yours now they are all gone wont you show the inside of it to me  the doctor laughed in his pleasantest manner  the old story he said bluebeards locked chamber and female curiosity dont go benjamin dont go my dear lady what interest can you possibly have in looking at a medical bottle simply because it happens to be a bottle of poison  she repeated her lesson for the second time  i have the interest of looking at it she said and of thinking if it got into some peoples hands of the terrible things it might do  the doctor glanced at his assistant with a compassionate smile  curious benjamin he said the romantic view taken of these drugs of ours by the unscientific mind my dear lady he added turning to miss gwilt if that is the interest you attach to looking at poisons you neednt ask me to unlock my cabinetyou need only look about you round the shelves of this room there are all sorts of medical liquids and substances in those bottlesmost innocent most useful in themselveswhich in combination with other substances and other liquids become poisons as terrible and as deadly as any that i have in my cabinet under lock and key  she looked at him for a moment and creased to the opposite side of the room  show me one she said  still smiling as goodhumoredly as ever the doctor humored his nervous patient he pointed to the bottle from which he had privately removed the yellow liquid on the previous day and which he had filled up again with a carefullycolored imitation in the shape of a mixture of his own  do you see that bottle he saidthat plump round comfortablelooking bottle never mind the name of what is beside it let us stick to the bottle and distinguish it if you like by giving it a name of our own suppose we call it our stout friend very good our stout friend by himself is a most harmless and useful medicine he is freely dispensed every day to tens of thousands of patients all over the civilized world he has made no romantic appearances in courts of law he has excited no breathless interest in novels he has played no terrifying part on the stage there he is an innocent inoffensive creature who troubles nobody with the responsibility of locking him up but bring him into contact with something elseintroduce him to the acquaintance of a certain common mineral substance of a universally accessible kind broken into fragments provide yourself with say six doses of our stout friend and pour those doses consecutively on the fragments i have mentioned at intervals of not less than five minutes quantities of little bubbles will rise at every pouring collect the gas in those bubbles and convey it into a closed chamberand let samson himself be in that closed chamber our stout friend will kill him in half an hour will kill him slowly without his seeing anything without his smelling anything without his feeling anything but sleepiness will kill him and tell the whole college of surgeons nothing if they examine him after death but that he died of apoplexy or congestion of the lungs what do you think of that my dear lady in the way of mystery and romance is our harmless stout friend as interesting now as if he rejoiced in the terrible popular fame of the arsenic and the strychnine which i keep locked up there dont suppose i am exaggerating dont suppose im inventing a story to put you off with as the children say ask benjamin there said the doctor appealing to his assistant with his eyes fixed on miss gwilt ask benjamin he repeated with the steadiest emphasis on the next words if six doses from that bottle at intervals of five minutes each would not under the conditions i have stated produce the results i have described  the resident dispenser modestly admiring miss gwilt at a distance started and colored up he was plainly gratified by the little attention which had included him in the conversation  the doctor is quite right maam he said addressing miss gwilt with his best bow the production of the gas extended over half an hour would be quite gradual enough and added the dispenser silently appealing to his employer to let him exhibit a little chemical knowledge on his own account the volume of the gas would be sufficient at the end of the timeif i am not mistaken sirto be fatal to any person entering the room in less than five minutes  unquestionably benjamin rejoined the doctor but i think we have had enough of chemistry for the present he added turning to miss gwilt with every desire my dear lady to gratify every passing wish you may form i venture to propose trying a more cheerful subject suppose we leave the dispensary before it suggests any more inquiries to that active mind of yours no you want to see an experiment you want to see how the little bubbles are made well well there is no harm in that we will let mrs armadale see the bubbles continued the doctor in the tone of a parent humoring a spoiled child try if you can find a few of those fragments that we want benjamin i dare say the workmen slovenly fellows have left something of the sort about the house or the grounds  the resident dispenser left the room  as soon as his back was turned the doctor began opening and shutting drawers in various parts of the dispensary with the air of a man who wants something in a hurry and does not know where to find it bless my soul he exclaimed suddenly stopping at the drawer from which he had taken his cards of invitation on the previous day whats this a key a duplicate key as im alive of my fumigating apparatus upstairs oh dear dear how careless i get said the doctor turning round briskly to miss gwilt i hadnt the least idea that i possessed this second key i should never have missed it i do assure you i should never have missed it if anybody had taken it out of the drawer he bustled away to the other end of the roomwithout closing the drawer and without taking away the duplicate key  in silence miss gwilt listened till he had done in silence she glided to the drawer in silence she took the key and hid it in her apron pocket  the dispenser came back with the fragments required of him collected in a basin thank you benjamin said the doctor kindly cover them with water while i get the bottle down  as accidents sometimes happen in the most perfectly regulated families so clumsiness sometimes possesses itself of the most perfectly disciplined hands in the process of its transfer from the shelf to the doctor the bottle slipped and fell smashed to pieces on the floor  oh my fingers and thumbs cried the doctor with an air of comic vexation what in the world do you mean by playing me such a wicked trick as that well well wellit cant be helped have we got any more of it benjamin  not a drop sir  not a drop echoed the doctor my dear madam what excuses can i offer you my clumsiness has made our little experiment impossible for today remind me to order some more tomorrow benjamin and dont think of troubling yourself to put that mess to rights ill send the man here to mop it all up our stout friend is harmless enough now my dear ladyin combination with a boarded floor and a coming mop im so sorry i really am so sorry to have disappointed you with those soothing words he offered his arm and led miss gwilt out of the dispensary  have you done with me for the present she asked when they were in the hall  oh dear dear what a way of putting it exclaimed the doctor dinner at six he added with his politest emphasis as she turned from him in disdainful silence and slowly mounted the stairs to her own room   a clock of the noiseless sortincapable of offending irritable nerveswas fixed in the wall above the firstfloor landing at the sanitarium at the moment when the hands pointed to a quarter before six the silence of the lonely upper regions was softly broken by the rustling of miss gwilts dress she advanced along the corridor of the first floorpaused at the covered apparatus fixed outside the room numbered fourlistened for a momentand then unlocked the cover with the duplicate key  the open lid cast a shadow over the inside of the casing all she saw at first was what she had seen alreadythe jar and the pipe and glass funnel inserted in the cork she removed the funnel and looking about her observed on the windowsill close by a waxtipped wand used for lighting the gas she took the wand and introducing it through the aperture occupied by the funnel moved it to and fro in the jar the faint splash of some liquid and the grating noise of certain hard substances which she was stirring about were the two sounds that caught her ear she drew out the wand and cautiously touched the wet left on it with the tip of her tongue caution was quite needless in this case the liquid waswater  in putting the funnel back in its place she noticed something faintly shining in the obscurely lit vacant space at the side of the jar she drew it out and produced a purple flask the liquid with which it was filled showed dark through the transparent coloring of the glass and fastened at regular intervals down one side of the flask were six thin strips of paper which divided the contents into six equal parts  there was no doubt now that the apparatus had been secretly prepared for herthe apparatus of which she alone besides the doctor possessed the key  she put back the flask and locked the cover of the casing for a moment she stood looking at it with the key in her hand on a sudden her lost color came back on a sudden its natural animation returned for the first time that day to her face she turned and hurried breathlessly upstairs to her room on the second floor with eager hands she snatched her cloak out of the wardrobe and took her bonnet from the box im not in prison she burst out impetuously ive got the use of my limbs i can gono matter where as long as i am out of this house  with her cloak on her shoulders with her bonnet in her hand she crossed the room to the door a moment moreand she would have been out in the passage in that moment the remembrance flashed back on her of the husband whom she had denied to his face she stopped instantly and threw the cloak and bonnet from her on the bed no she said the gulf is dug between usthe worst is done  there was a knock at the door the doctors voice outside politely reminded her that it was six oclock  she opened the door and stopped him on his way downstairs  what time is the train due tonight she asked in a whisper  at ten answered the doctor in a voice which all the world might hear and welcome  what room is mr armadale to have when he comes  what room would you like him to have  number four  the doctor kept up appearances to the very last  number four let it be he said graciously provided of course that number four is unoccupied at the time        the evening wore on and the night came  at a few minutes before ten mr bashwood was again at his post once more on the watch for the coming of the tidal train  the inspector on duty who knew him by sight and who had personally ascertained that his regular attendance at the terminus implied no designs on the purses and portmanteaus of the passengers noticed two new circumstances in connection with mr bashwood that night in the first place instead of exhibiting his customary cheerfulness he looked anxious and depressed in the second place while he was watching for the train he was to all appearance being watched in his turn by a slim dark undersized man who had left his luggage marked with the name of midwinter at the customhouse department the evening before and who had returned to have it examined about half an hour since  what had brought midwinter to the terminus and why was he too waiting for the tidal train  after straying as far as hendon during his lonely walk of the previous night he had taken refuge at the village inn and had fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion toward those later hours of the morning which were the hours that his wifes foresight had turned to account when he returned to the lodging the landlady could only inform him that her tenant had settled everything with her and had left for what destination neither she nor her servant could tell more than two hours since  having given some little time to inquiries the result of which convinced him that the clew was lost so far midwinter had quitted the house and had pursued his way mechanically to the busier and more central parts of the metropolis with the light now thrown on his wifes character to call at the address she had given him as the address at which her mother lived would be plainly useless he went on through the streets resolute to discover her and trying vainly to see the means to his end till the sense of fatigue forced itself on him once more stopping to rest and recruit his strength at the first hotel he came to a chance dispute between the waiter and a stranger about a lost portmanteau reminded him of his own luggage left at the terminus and instantly took his mind back to the circumstances under which he and mr bashwood had met in a moment more the idea that he had been vainly seeking on his way through the streets flashed on him in a moment more he had determined to try the chance of finding the steward again on the watch for the person whose arrival he had evidently expected by the previous evenings train  ignorant of the report of allans death at sea uninformed at the terrible interview with his wife of the purpose which her assumption of a widows dress really had in view midwinters first vague suspicions of her fidelity had now inevitably developed into the conviction that she was false he could place but one interpretation on her open disavowal of him and on her taking the name under which he had secretly married her her conduct forced the conclusion on him that she was engaged in some infamous intrigue and that she had basely secured herself beforehand in the position of all others in which she knew it would be most odious and most repellent to him to claim his authority over her with that conviction he was now watching mr bashwood firmly persuaded that his wifes hidingplace was known to the vile servant of his wifes vices and darkly suspecting as the time wore on that the unknown man who had wronged him and the unknown traveler for whose arrival the steward was waiting were one and the same  the train was late that night and the carriages were more than usually crowded when they arrived at last midwinter became involved in the confusion on the platform and in the effort to extricate himself he lost sight of mr bashwood for the first time  a lapse of some few minutes had passed before he again discovered the steward talking eagerly to a man in a loose shaggy coat whose back was turned toward him forgetful of all the cautions and restraints which he had imposed on himself before the train appeared midwinter instantly advanced on them mr bashwood saw his threatening face as he came on and fell back in silence the man in the loose coat turned to look where the steward was looking and disclosed to midwinter in the full light of the stationlamp allans face  for the moment they both stood speechless hand in hand looking at each other allan was the first to recover himself  thank god for this he said fervently i dont ask how you came here its enough for me that you have come miserable news has met me already midwinter nobody but you can comfort me and help me to bear it his voice faltered over those last words and he said no more  the tone in which he had spoken roused midwinter to meet the circumstances as they were by appealing to the old grateful interest in his friend which had once been the foremost interest of his life he mastered his personal misery for the first time since it had fallen on him and gently taking allan aside asked what had happened  the answerafter informing him of his friends reported death at seaannounced on mr bashwoods authority that the news had reached miss milroy and that the deplorable result of the shock thus inflicted had obliged the major to place his daughter in the neighborhood of london under medical care  before saying a word on his side midwinter looked distrustfully behind him mr bashwood had followed them mr bashwood was watching to see what they did next  was he waiting your arrival here to tell you this about miss milroy asked midwinter looking again from the steward to allan  yes said allan he has been kindly waiting here night after night to meet me and break the news to me  midwinter paused once more the attempt to reconcile the conclusion he had drawn from his wifes conduct with the discovery that allan was the man for whose arrival mr bashwood had been waiting was hopeless the one present chance of discovering a truer solution of the mystery was to press the steward on the one available point in which he had laid himself open to attack he had positively denied on the previous evening that he knew anything of allans movements or that he had any interest in allans return to england having detected mr bashwood in one lie told to himself midwinter instantly suspected him of telling another to allan he seized the opportunity of sifting the statement about miss milroy on the spot  how have you become acquainted with this sad news he inquired turning suddenly on mr bashwood  through the major of course said allan before the steward could answer  who is the doctor who has the care of miss milroy persisted midwinter still addressing mr bashwood  for the second time the steward made no reply for the second time allan answered for him  he is a man with a foreign name said allan he keeps a sanitarium near hampstead what did you say the place was called mr bashwood  fairweather vale sir said the steward answering his employer as a matter of necessity but answering very unwillingly  the address of the sanitarium instantly reminded midwinter that he had traced his wife to fairweather vale villas the previous night he began to see light through the darkness dimly for the first time the instinct which comes with emergency before the slower process of reason can assert itself brought him at a leap to the conclusion that mr bashwoodwho had been certainly acting under his wifes influence the previous daymight be acting again under his wifes influence now he persisted in sifting the stewards statement with the conviction growing firmer and firmer in his mind that the statement was a lie and that his wife was concerned in it  is the major in norfolk he asked or is he near his daughter in london  in norfolk said mr bashwood having answered allans look of inquiry instead of midwinters spoken question in those words he hesitated looked midwinter in the face for the first time and added suddenly i object if you please to be crossexamined sir i know what i have told mr armadale and i know no more  the words and the voice in which they were spoken were alike at variance with mr bashwoods usual language and mr bashwoods usual tone there was a sullen depression in his facethere was a furtive distrust and dislike in his eyes when they looked at midwinter which midwinter himself now noticed for the first time before he could answer the stewards extraordinary outbreak allan interfered  dont think me impatient he said but its getting late its a long way to hampstead im afraid the sanitarium will be shut up  midwinter started you are not going to the sanitarium tonight he exclaimed  allan took his friends hand and wrung it hard if you were as fond of her as i am he whispered you would take no rest you could get no sleep till you had seen the doctor and heard the best and the worst he had to tell you poor dear little soul who knows if she could only see me alive and well the tears came into his eyes and he turned away his head in silence  midwinter looked at the steward stand back he said i want to speak to mr armadale there was something in his eye which it was not safe to trifle with mr bashwood drew back out of hearing but not out of sight midwinter laid his hand fondly on his friends shoulder  allan he said i have reasons he stopped could the reasons be given before he had fairly realized them himself at that time too and under those circumstances impossible i have reasons he resumed for advising you not to believe too readily what mr bashwood may say dont tell him this but take the warning  allan looked at his friend in astonishment it was you who always liked mr bashwood he exclaimed it was you who trusted him when he first came to the great house  perhaps i was wrong allan and perhaps you were right will you only wait till we can telegraph to major milroy and get his answer will you only wait over the night  i shall go mad if i wait over the night said allan you have made me more anxious than i was before if i am not to speak about it to bashwood i must and will go to the sanitarium and find out whether she is or is not there from the doctor himself  midwinter saw that it was useless in allans interests there was only one other course left to take will you let me go with you he asked  allans face brightened for the first time you dear good fellow he exclaimed it was the very thing i was going to beg of you myself  midwinter beckoned to the steward mr armadale is going to the sanitarium he said and i mean to accompany him get a cab and come with us  he waited to see whether mr bashwood would comply having been strictly ordered when allan did arrive not to lose sight of him and having in his own interests midwinters unexpected appearance to explain to miss gwilt the steward had no choice but to comply in sullen submission he did as he had been told the keys of allans baggage was given to the foreign traveling servant whom he had brought with him and the man was instructed to wait his masters orders at the terminus hotel in a minute more the cab was on its way out of the stationwith midwinter and allan inside and mr bashwood by the driver on the box        between eleven and twelve oclock that night miss gwilt standing alone at the window which lit the corridor of the sanitarium on the second floor heard the roll of wheels coming toward her the sound gathering rapidly in volume through the silence of the lonely neighborhood stopped at the iron gates in another minute she saw the cab draw up beneath her at the house door  the earlier night had been cloudy but the sky was clearing now and the moon was out she opened the window to see and hear more clearly by the light of the moon she saw allan get out of the cab and turn round to speak to some other person inside the answering voice told her before he appeared in his turn that armadales companion was her husband  the same petrifying influence that had fallen on her at the interview with him of the previous day fell on her now she stood by the window white and still and haggard and oldas she had stood when she first faced him in her widows weeds  mr bashwood stealing up alone to the second floor to make his report knew the instant he set eyes on her that the report was needless its not my fault was all he said as she slowly turned her head and looked at him they met together and there was no parting them  she drew a long breath and motioned him to be silent wait a little she said i know all about it  turning from him at those words she slowly paced the corridor to its furthest end turned and slowly came back to him with frowning brow and drooping headwith all the grace and beauty gone from her but the inbred grace and beauty in the movement of her limbs  do you wish to speak to me she asked her mind far away from him and her eyes looking at him vacantly as she put the question  he roused his courage as he had never roused it in her presence yet  dont drive me to despair he cried with a startling abruptness dont look at me in that way now i have found it out  what have you found out she asked with a momentary surprise on her face which faded from it again before he could gather breath enough to go on  mr armadale is not the man who took you away from me he answered mr midwinter is the man i found it out in your face yesterday i see it in your face now why did you sign your name armadale when you wrote to me why do you call yourself mrs armadale still  he spoke those bold words at long intervals with an effort to resist her influence over him pitiable and terrible to see  she looked at him for the first time with softened eyes i wish i had pitied you when we first met she said gently as i pity you now  he struggled desperately to go on and say the words to her which he had strung himself to the pitch of saying on the drive from the terminus they were words which hinted darkly at his knowledge of her past life words which warned herdo what else she might commit what crimes she pleasedto think twice before she deceived and deserted him again in those terms he had vowed to himself to address her he had the phrases picked and chosen he had the sentences ranged and ordered in his mind nothing was wanting but to make the one crowning effort of speaking themand even now after all he had said and all he had dared the effort was more than he could compass in helpless gratitude even for so little as her pity he stood looking at her and wept the silent womanish tears that fall from old mens eyes  she took his hand and spoke to himwith marked forbearance but without the slightest sign of emotion on her side  you have waited already at my request she said wait till tomorrow and you will know all if you trust nothing else that i have told you you may trust what i tell you now it will end tonight  as she said the words the doctors step was heard on the stairs mr bashwood drew back from her with his heart beating fast in unutterable expectation it will end tonight he repeated to himself under his breath as he moved away toward the far end of the corridor  dont let me disturb you sir said the doctor cheerfully as they met i have nothing to say to mrs armadale but what you or anybody may hear  mr bashwood went on without answering to the far end of the corridor still repeating to himself it will end tonight the doctor passing him in the opposite direction joined miss gwilt  you have heard no doubt he began in his blandest manner and his roundest tones that mr armadale has arrived permit me to add my dear lady that there is not the least reason for any nervous agitation on your part he has been carefully humored and he is as quiet and manageable as his best friends could wish i have informed him that it is impossible to allow him an interview with the young lady tonight but that he may count on seeing her with the proper precautions at the earliest propitious hour after she is awake tomorrow morning as there is no hotel near and as the propitious hour may occur at a moments notice it was clearly incumbent on me under the peculiar circumstances to offer him the hospitality of the sanitarium he has accepted it with the utmost gratitude and has thanked me in a most gentlemanly and touching manner for the pains i have taken to set his mind at ease perfectly gratifying perfectly satisfactory so far but there has been a little hitchnow happily got overwhich i think it right to mention to you before we all retire for the night  having paved the way in those words and in mr bashwoods hearing for the statement which he had previously announced his intention of making in the event of allans dying in the sanitarium the doctor was about to proceed when his attention was attracted by a sound below like the trying of a door  he instantly descended the stairs and unlocked the door of communication between the first and second floors which he had locked behind him on his way up but the person who had tried the doorif such a person there really had beenwas too quick for him he looked along the corridor and over the staircase into the hall and discovering nothing returned to miss gwilt after securing the door of communication behind him once more  pardon me he resumed i thought i heard something downstairs with regard to the little hitch that i adverted to just now permit me to inform you that mr armadale has brought a friend here with him who bears the strange name of midwinter do you know the gentleman at all asked the doctor with a suspicious anxiety in his eyes which strangely belied the elaborate indifference of his tone  i know him to be an old friend of mr armadales she said does he her voice failed her and her eyes fell before the doctors steady scrutiny she mastered the momentary weakness and finished her question does he too stay here tonight  mr midwinter is a person of coarse manners and suspicious temper rejoined the doctor steadily watching her he was rude enough to insist on staying here as soon as mr armadale had accepted my invitation  he paused to note the effect of those words on her left utterly in the dark by the caution with which she had avoided mentioning her husbands assumed name to him at their first interview the doctors distrust of her was necessarily of the vaguest kind he had heard her voice fail herhe had seen her color change he suspected her of a mental reservation on the subject of midwinterand of nothing more  did you permit him to have his way she asked in your place i should have shown him the door  the impenetrable composure of her tone warned the doctor that her selfcommand was not to be further shaken that night he resumed the character of mrs armadales medical referee on the subject of mr armadales mental health  if i had only had my own feelings to consult he said i dont disguise from you that i should as you say have shown mr midwinter the door but on appealing to mr armadale i found he was himself anxious not to be parted from his friend under those circumstances but one alternative was leftthe alternative of humoring him again the responsibility of thwarting himto say nothing added the doctor drifting for a moment toward the truth of my natural apprehension with such a temper as his friends of a scandal and disturbance in the housewas not to be thought of for a moment mr midwinter accordingly remains here for the night and occupies i ought to say insists on occupying the next room to mr armadale advise me my dear madam in this emergency concluded the doctor with his loudest emphasis what rooms shall we put them in on the first floor  put mr armadale in number four  and his friend next to him in number three said the doctor well well well perhaps they are the most comfortable rooms ill give my orders immediately dont hurry away mr bashwood he called out cheerfully as he reached the top of the staircase i have left the assistant physicians key on the windowsill yonder and mrs armadale can let you out at the staircase door whenever she pleases dont sit up late mrs armadale yours is a nervous system that requires plenty of sleep tired natures sweet restorer balmy sleep grand line god bless yougoodnight  mr bashwood came back from the far end of the corridorstill pondering in unutterable expectation on what was to come with the night  am i to go now he asked  no you are to stay i said you should know all if you waited till the morning wait here  he hesitated and looked about him the doctor he faltered i thought the doctor said  the doctor will interfere with nothing that i do in this house tonight i tell you to stay there are empty rooms on the floor above this take one of them  mr bashwood felt the trembling fit coming on him again as he looked at her may i ask he began  ask nothing i want you  will you please to tell me  i will tell you nothing till the night is over and the morning has come  his curiosity conquered his fear he persisted  is it something dreadful he whispered too dreadful to tell me  she stamped her foot with a sudden outbreak of impatience go she said snatching the key of the staircase door from the windowsill you do quite right to distrust meyou do quite right to follow me no further in the dark go before the house is shut up i can do without you she led the way to the stairs with the key in one hand and the candle in the other  mr bashwood followed her in silence no one knowing what he knew of her earlier life could have failed to perceive that she was a woman driven to the last extremity and standing consciously on the brink of a crime in the first terror of the discovery he broke free from the hold she had on him he thought and acted like a man who had a will of his own again  she put the key in the door and turned to him before she opened it with the light of the candle on her face forget me and forgive me she said we meet no more  she opened the door and standing inside it after he had passed her gave him her hand he had resisted her look he had resisted her words but the magnetic fascination of her touch conquered him at the final moment i cant leave you he said holding helplessly by the hand she had given him what must i do  come and see she answered without allowing him an instant to reflect  closing her hand firmly on his she led him along the first floor corridor to the room numbered four notice that room she whispered after a look over the stairs to see that they were alone she retraced her steps with him to the opposite extremity of the corridor here facing the window which lit the place at the other end was one little room with a narrow grating in the higher part of the door intended for the sleeping apartment of the doctors deputy from the position of this room the grating commanded a view of the bedchambers down each side of the corridor and so enabled the deputyphysician to inform himself of any irregular proceedings on the part of the patients under his care with little or no chance of being detected in watching them miss gwilt opened the door and led the way into the empty room  wait here she said while i go back upstairs and lock yourself in if you like you will be in the dark but the gas will be burning in the corridor keep at the grating and make sure that mr armadale goes into the room i have just pointed out to you and that he doesnt leave it afterward if you lose sight of the room for a single moment before i come back you will repent it to the end of your life if you do as i tell you you shall see me tomorrow and claim your own reward quick with your answer is it yes or no  he could make no reply in words he raised her hand to his lips and kissed it rapturously she left him in the room from his place at the grating he saw her glide down the corridor to the staircase door she passed through it and locked it then there was silence  the next sound was the sound of the womenservants voices two of them came up to put the sheets on the beds in number three and number four the women were in high goodhumor laughing and talking to each other through the open doors of the rooms the masters customers were coming in at last they said with a vengeance the house would soon begin to look cheerful if things went on like this  after a little the beds were got ready and the women returned to the kitchen floor on which the sleepingrooms of the domestic servants were all situated then there was silence again  the next sound was the sound of the doctors voice he appeared at the end of the corridor showing allan and midwinter the way to their rooms they all went together into number four after a little the doctor came out first he waited till midwinter joined him and pointed with a formal bow to the door of number three midwinter entered the room without speaking and shut himself in the doctor left alone withdrew to the staircase door and unlocked it then waited in the corridor whistling to himself softly under his breath  voices pitched cautiously low became audible in a minute more in the hall the resident dispenser and the head nurse appeared on their way to the dormitories of the attendants at the top of the house the man bowed silently and passed the doctor the woman courtesied silently and followed the man the doctor acknowledged their salutations by a courteous wave of his hand and once more left alone paused a moment still whistling softly to himself then walked to the door of number four and opened the case of the fumigating apparatus fixed near it in the corner of the wall as he lifted the lid and looked in his whistling ceased he took a long purple bottle out examined it by the gaslight put it back and closed the case this done he advanced on tiptoe to the open staircase door passed through it and secured it on the inner side as usual  mr bashwood had seen him at the apparatus mr bashwood had noticed the manner of his withdrawal through the staircase door again the sense of an unutterable expectation throbbed at his heart a terror that was slow and cold and deadly crept into his hands and guided them in the dark to the key that had been left for him in the inner side of the door he turned it in vague distrust of what might happen next and waited  the slow minutes passed and nothing happened the silence was horrible the solitude of the lonely corridor was a solitude of invisible treacheries he began to count to keep his mind employedto keep his own growing dread away from him the numbers as he whispered them followed each other slowly up to a hundred and still nothing happened he had begun the second hundred he had got on to twentywhen without a sound to betray that he had been moving in his room midwinter suddenly appeared in the corridor  he stood for a moment and listened he went to the stairs and looked over into the hall beneath then for the second time that night he tried the staircase door and for the second time found it fast after a moments reflection he tried the doors of the bedrooms on his right hand next looked into one after the other and saw that they were empty then came to the door of the end room in which the steward was concealed here again the lock resisted him he listened and looked up at the grating no sound was to be heard no light was to be seen inside shall i break the door in he said to himself and make sure no it would be giving the doctor an excuse for turning me out of the house he moved away and looked into the two empty rooms in the row occupied by allan and himself then walked to the window at the staircase end of the corridor here the case of the fumigating apparatus attracted his attention after trying vainly to open it his suspicion seemed to be aroused he searched back along the corridor and observed that no object of a similar kind appeared outside any of the other bedchambers again at the window he looked again at the apparatus and turned away from it with a gesture which plainly indicated that he had tried and failed to guess what it might be  baffled at all points he still showed no sign of returning to his bedchamber he stood at the window with his eyes fixed on the door of allans room thinking if mr bashwood furtively watching him through the grating could have seen him at that moment in the mind as well as in the body mr bashwoods heart might have throbbed even faster than it was throbbing now in expectation of the next event which midwinters decision of the next minute was to bring forth  on what was his mind occupied as he stood alone at the dead of night in the strange house  his mind was occupied in drawing its disconnected impressions together little by little to one point convinced from the first that some hidden danger threatened allan in the sanitarium his distrustvaguely associated thus far with the place itself with his wife whom he firmly believed to be now under the same roof with him with the doctor who was as plainly in her confidence as mr bashwood himselfnow narrowed its range and centered itself obstinately in allans room resigning all further effort to connect his suspicion of a conspiracy against his friend with the outrage which had the day before been offered to himselfan effort which would have led him if he could have maintained it to a discovery of the fraud really contemplated by his wifehis mind clouded and confused by disturbing influences instinctively took refuge in its impressions of facts as they had shown themselves since he had entered the house everything that he had noticed below stairs suggested that there was some secret purpose to be answered by getting allan to sleep in the sanitarium everything that he had noticed above stairs associated the lurkingplace in which the danger lay hid with allans room to reach this conclusion and to decide on baffling the conspiracy whatever it might be by taking allans place was with midwinter the work of an instant confronted by actual peril the great nature of the man intuitively freed itself from the weaknesses that had beset it in happier and safer times not even the shadow of the old superstition rested on his mind nowno fatalist suspicion of himself disturbed the steady resolution that was in him the one last doubt that troubled him as he stood at the window thinking was the doubt whether he could persuade allan to change rooms with him without involving himself in an explanation which might lead allan to suspect the truth  in the minute that elapsed while he waited with his eyes on the room the doubt was resolvedhe found the trivial yet sufficient excuse of which he was in search mr bashwood saw him rouse himself and go to the door mr bashwood heard him knock softly and whisper allan are you in bed  no answered the voice inside come in  he appeared to be on the point of entering the room when he checked himself as if he had suddenly remembered something wait a minute he said through the door and turning away went straight to the end room if there is anybody watching us in there he said aloud let him watch us through this he took out his handkerchief and stuffed it into the wires of the grating so as completely to close the aperture having thus forced the spy inside if there was one either to betray himself by moving the handkerchief or to remain blinded to all view of what might happen next midwinter presented himself in allans room  you know what poor nerves i have he said and what a wretched sleeper i am at the best of times i cant sleep tonight the window in my room rattles every time the wind blows i wish it was as fast as your window here  my dear fellow cried allan i dont mind a rattling window lets change rooms nonsense why should you make excuses to me dont i know how easily trifles upset those excitable nerves of yours now the doctor has quieted my mind about my poor little neelie i begin to feel the journey and ill answer for sleeping anywhere till tomorrow comes he took up his travelingbag we must be quick about it he added pointing to his candle they havent left me much candle to go to bed by  be very quiet allan said midwinter opening the door for him we mustnt disturb the house at this time of night  yes yes returned allan in a whisper goodnight i hope youll sleep as well as i shall  midwinter saw him into number three and noticed that his own candle which he had left there was as short as allans goodnight he said and came out again into the corridor  he went straight to the grating and looked and listened once more the handkerchief remained exactly as he had left it and still there was no sound to be heard within he returned slowly along the corridor and thought of the precautions he had taken for the last time was there no other way than the way he was trying now there was none any openly avowed posture of defensewhile the nature of the danger and the quarter from which it might come were alike unknownwould be useless in itself and worse than useless in the consequences which it might produce by putting the people of the house on their guard without a fact that could justify to other minds his distrust of what might happen with the night incapable of shaking allans ready faith in the fair outside which the doctor had presented to him the one safeguard in his friends interests that midwinter could set up was the safeguard of changing the roomsthe one policy he could follow come what might of it was the policy of waiting for events i can trust to one thing he said to himself as he looked for the last time up and down the corridori can trust myself to keep awake  after a glance at the clock on the wall opposite he went into number four the sound of the closing door was heard the sound of the turning lock followed it then the dead silence fell over the house once more  little by little the stewards horror of the stillness and the darkness overcame his dread of moving the handkerchief he cautiously drew aside one corner of it waited looked and took courage at last to draw the whole handkerchief through the wires of the grating after first hiding it in his pocket he thought of the consequences if it was found on him and threw it down in a corner of the room he trembled when he had cast it from him as he looked at his watch and placed himself again at the grating to wait for miss gwilt  it was a quarter to one the moon had come round from the side to the front of the sanitarium from time to time her light gleamed on the window of the corridor when the gaps in the flying clouds let it through the wind had risen and sung its mournful song faintly as it swept at intervals over the desert ground in front of the house  the minute hand of the clock traveled on halfway round the circle of the dial as it touched the quarterpast one miss gwilt stepped noiselessly into the corridor let yourself out she whispered through the grating and follow me she returned to the stairs by which she had just descended pushed the door to softly after mr bashwood had followed her and led the way up to the landing of the second floor there she put the question to him which she had not ventured to put below stairs  was mr armadale shown into number four she asked  he bowed his head without speaking  answer me in words has mr armadale left the room since  he answered no  have you never lost sight of number four since i left you  he answered never  something strange in his manner something unfamiliar in his voice as he made that last reply attracted her attention she took her candle from a table near on which she had left it and threw its light on him his eyes were staring his teeth chattered there was everything to betray him to her as a terrified man there was nothing to tell her that the terror was caused by his consciousness of deceiving her for the first time in his life to her face if she had threatened him less openly when she placed him on the watch if she had spoken less unreservedly of the interview which was to reward him in the morning he might have owned the truth as it was his strongest fears and his dearest hopes were alike interested in telling her the fatal lie that he had now toldthe fatal lie which he reiterated when she put her question for the second time  she looked at him deceived by the last man on earth whom she would have suspected of deceptionthe man whom she had deceived herself  you seem to be overexcited she said quietly the night has been too much for you go upstairs and rest you will find the door of one of the rooms left open that is the room you are to occupy goodnight  she put the candle which she had left burning for him on the table and gave him her hand he held her back by it desperately as she turned to leave him his horror of what might happen when she was left by herself forced the words to his lips which he would have feared to speak to her at any other time  dont he pleaded in a whisper oh dont dont dont go downstairs tonight  she released her hand and signed to him to take the candle you shall see me tomorrow she said not a word more now  her stronger will conquered him at that last moment as it had conquered him throughout he took the candle and waited following her eagerly with his eyes as she descended the stairs the cold of the december night seemed to have found its way to her through the warmth of the house she had put on a long heavy black shawl and had fastened it close over her breast the plaited coronet in which she wore her hair seemed to have weighed too heavily on her head she had untwisted it and thrown it back over her shoulders the old man looked at her flowing hair as it lay red over the black shawlat her supple longfingered hand as it slid down the banistersat the smooth seductive grace of every movement that took her further and further away from him the night will go quickly he said to himself as she passed from his view i shall dream of her till the morning comes   she secured the staircase door after she had passed through itlistened and satisfied herself that nothing was stirringthen went on slowly along the corridor to the window leaning on the windowsill she looked out at the night the clouds were over the moon at that moment nothing was to be seen through the darkness but the scattered gaslights in the suburb turning from the window she looked at the clock it was twenty minutes past one  for the last time the resolution that had come to her in the earlier night with the knowledge that her husband was in the house forced itself uppermost in her mind for the last time the voice within her said think if there is no other way  she pondered over it till the minutehand of the clock pointed to the halfhour no she said still thinking of her husband the one chance left is to go through with it to the end he will leave the thing undone which he has come here to do he will leave the words unspoken which he has come here to saywhen he knows that the act may make me a public scandal and that the words may send me to the scaffold her color rose and she smiled with a terrible irony as she looked for the first time at the door of the room i shall be your widow she said in half an hour  she opened the case of the apparatus and took the purple flask in her hand after marking the time by a glance at the clock she dropped into the glass funnel the first of the six separate pourings that were measured for her by the paper slips  when she had put the flask back she listened at the mouth of the funnel not a sound reached her ear the deadly process did its work in the silence of death itself when she rose and looked up the moon was shining in at the window and the moaning wind was quiet  oh the time the time if it could only have been begun and ended with the first pouring  she went downstairs into the hall she walked to and fro and listened at the open door that led to the kitchen stairs she came up again she went down again the first of the intervals of five minutes was endless the time stood still the suspense was maddening  the interval passed as she took the flask for the second time and dropped in the second pouring the clouds floated over the moon and the night view through the window slowly darkened  the restlessness that had driven her up and down the stairs and backward and forward in the hall left her as suddenly as it had come she waited through the second interval leaning on the windowsill and staring without conscious thought of any kind into the black night the howling of a belated dog was borne toward her on the wind at intervals from some distant part of the suburb she found herself following the faint sound as it died away into silence with a dull attention and listening for its coming again with an expectation that was duller still her arms lay like lead on the windowsill her forehead rested against the glass without feeling the cold it was not till the moon struggled out again that she was startled into sudden selfremembrance she turned quickly and looked at the clock seven minutes had passed since the second pouring  as she snatched up the flask and fed the funnel for the third time the full consciousness of her position came back to her the feverheat throbbed again in her blood and flushed fiercely in her cheeks swift smooth and noiseless she paced from end to end of the corridor with her arms folded in her shawl and her eye moment after moment on the clock  three out of the next five minutes passed and again the suspense began to madden her the space in the corridor grew too confined for the illimitable restlessness that possessed her limbs she went down into the hall again and circled round and round it like a wild creature in a cage at the third turn she felt something moving softly against her dress the housecat had come up through the open kitchen doora large tawny companionable cat that purred in high good temper and followed her for company she took the animal up in her armsit rubbed its sleek head luxuriously against her chin as she bent her face over it armadale hates cats she whispered in the creatures ear come up and see armadale killed the next moment her own frightful fancy horrified her she dropped the cat with a shudder she drove it below again with threatening hands for a moment after she stood still then in headlong haste suddenly mounted the stairs her husband had forced his way back again into her thoughts her husband threatened her with a danger which had never entered her mind till now what if he were not asleep what if he came out upon her and found her with the purple flask in her hand  she stole to the door of number three and listened the slow regular breathing of a sleeping man was just audible after waiting a moment to let the feeling of relief quiet her she took a step toward number four and checked herself it was needless to listen at that door the doctor had told her that sleep came first as certainly as death afterward in the poisoned air she looked aside at the clock the time had come for the fourth pouring  her hand began to tremble violently as she fed the funnel for the fourth time the fear of her husband was back again in her heart what if some noise disturbed him before the sixth pouring what if he woke on a sudden as she had often seen him wake without any noise at all she looked up and down the corridor the end room in which mr bashwood had been concealed offered itself to her as a place of refuge i might go in there she thought has he left the key she opened the door to look and saw the handkerchief thrown down on the floor was it mr bashwoods handkerchief left there by accident she examined it at the corners in the second corner she found her husbands name  her first impulse hurried her to the staircase door to rouse the steward and insist on an explanation the next moment she remembered the purple flask and the danger of leaving the corridor she turned and looked at the door of number three her husband on the evidence of the handkerchief had unquestionably been out of his roomand mr bashwood had not told her was he in his room now in the violence of her agitation as the question passed through her mind she forgot the discovery which she had herself made not a minute before again she listened at the door again she heard the slow regular breathing of the sleeping man the first time the evidence of her ears had been enough to quiet her this time in the tenfold aggravation of her suspicion and her alarm she was determined to have the evidence of her eyes as well all the doors open softly in this house she said to herself theres no fear of my waking him noiselessly by an inch at a time she opened the unlocked door and looked in the moment the aperture was wide enough in the little light she had let into the room the sleepers head was just visible on the pillow was it quite as dark against the white pillow as her husbands head looked when he was in bed was the breathing as light as her husbands breathing when he was asleep  she opened the door more widely and looked in by the clearer light  there lay the man whose life she had attempted for the third time peacefully sleeping in the room that had been given to her husband and in the air that could harm nobody  the inevitable conclusion overwhelmed her on the instant with a frantic upward action of her hands she staggered back into the passage the door of allans room fell to but not noisily enough to wake him she turned as she heard it close for one moment she stood staring at it like a woman stupefied the next her instinct rushed into action before her reason recovered itself in two steps she was at the door of number four  the door was locked  she felt over the wall with both hands wildly and clumsily for the button which she had seen the doctor press when he was showing the room to the visitors twice she missed it the third time her eyes helped her hands she found the button and pressed on it the mortise of the lock inside fell back and the door yielded to her  without an instants hesitation she entered the room though the door was openthough so short a time had elapsed since the fourth pouring that but little more than half the contemplated volume of gas had been produced as yetthe poisoned air seized her like the grasp of a hand at her throat like the twisting of a wire round her head she found him on the floor at the foot of the bed his head and one arm were toward the door as if he had risen under the first feeling of drowsiness and had sunk in the effort to leave the room with the desperate concentration of strength of which women are capable in emergencies she lifted him and dragged him out into the corridor her brain reeled as she laid him down and crawled back on her knees to the room to shut out the poisoned air from pursuing them into the passage after closing the door she waited without daring to look at him the while for strength enough to rise and get to the window over the stairs when the window was opened when the keen air of the early winter morning blew steadily in she ventured back to him and raised his head and looked for the first time closely at his face  was it death that spread the livid pallor over his forehead and his cheeks and the dull leaden hue on his eyelids and his lips  she loosened his cravat and opened his waistcoat and bared his throat and breast to the air with her hand on his heart with her bosom supporting his head so that he fronted the window she waited the event a time passed a time short enough to be reckoned by minutes on the clock and yet long enough to take her memory back over all her married life with himlong enough to mature the resolution that now rose in her mind as the one result that could come of the retrospect as her eyes rested on him a strange composure settled slowly on her face she bore the look of a woman who was equally resigned to welcome the chance of his recovery or to accept the certainty of his death  not a cry or a tear had escaped her yet not a cry or a tear escaped her when the interval had passed and she felt the first faint fluttering of his heart and heard the first faint catching of the breath of his lips she silently bent over him and kissed his forehead when she looked up again the hard despair had melted from her face there was something softly radiant in her eyes which lit her whole countenance as with an inner light and made her womanly and lovely once more  she laid him down and taking off her shawl made a pillow of it to support his head it might have been hard love she said as she felt the faint pulsation strengthening at his heart you have made it easy now  she rose and turning from him noticed the purple flask in the place where she had left it since the fourth pouring ah she thought quietly i had forgotten my best friendi had forgotten that there is more to pour in yet  with a steady hand with a calm attentive face she fed the funnel for the fifth time five minutes more she said when she had put the flask back after a look at the clock  she fell into thoughtthought that only deepened the grave and gentle composure of her face shall i write him a farewell word she asked herself shall i tell him the truth before i leave him forever  her little gold pencilcase hung with the other toys at her watchchain after looking about her for a moment she knelt over her husband and put her hand into the breastpocket of his coat  his pocketbook was there some papers fell from it as she unfastened the clasp one of them was the letter which had come to him from mr brocks deathbed she turned over the two sheets of notepaper on which the rector had written the words that had now come true and found the last page of the last sheet a blank on that page she wrote her farewell words kneeling at her husbands side   i am worse than the worst you can think of me you have saved armadale by changing rooms with him tonight and you have saved him from me you can guess now whose widow i should have claimed to be if you had not preserved his life and you will know what a wretch you married when you married the woman who writes these lines still i had some innocent moments and then i loved you dearly forget me my darling in the love of a better woman than i am i might perhaps have been that better woman myself if i had not lived a miserable life before you met with me it matters little now the one atonement i can make for all the wrong i have done you is the atonement of my death it is not hard for me to die now i know you will live even my wickedness has one meritit has not prospered i have never been a happy woman   she folded the letter again and put it into his hand to attract his attention in that way when he came to himself as she gently closed his fingers on the paper and looked up the last minute of the last interval faced her recorded on the clock  she bent over him and gave him her farewell kiss  live my angel live she murmured tenderly with her lips just touching his all your life is before youa happy life and an honored life if you are freed from me  with a last lingering tenderness she parted the hair back from his forehead it is no merit to have loved you she said you are one of the men whom women all like she sighed and left him it was her last weakness she bent her head affirmatively to the clock as if it had been a living creature speaking to her and fed the funnel for the last time to the last drop left in the flask  the waning moon shone in faintly at the window with her hand on the door of the room she turned and looked at the light that was slowly fading out of the murky sky  oh god forgive me she said oh christ bear witness that i have suffered  one moment more she lingered on the threshold lingered for her last look in this worldand turned that look on him  goodby she said softly  the door of the room opened and closed on her there was an interval of silence  then a sound came dull and sudden like the sound of a fall  then there was silence again        the hands of the clock following their steady course reckoned the minutes of the morning as one by one they lapsed away it was the tenth minute since the door of the room had opened and closed before midwinter stirred on his pillow and struggling to raise himself felt the letter in his hand  at the same moment a key was turned in the staircase door and the doctor looking expectantly toward the fatal room saw the purple flask on the windowsill and the prostrate man trying to raise himself from the floor     epilogue     i news from norfolk  from mr pedgift senior thorpe ambrose to mr pedgift junior paris  high street december 20th  my dear augustusyour letter reached me yesterday you seem to be making the most of your youth as you call it with a vengeance well enjoy your holiday i made the most of my youth when i was your age and wonderful to relate i havent forgotten it yet  you ask me for a good budget of news and especially for more information about that mysterious business at the sanitarium  curiosity my dear boy is a quality which in our profession especially sometimes leads to great results i doubt however if you will find it leading to much on this occasion all i know of the mystery of the sanitarium i know from mr armadale and he is entirely in the dark on more than one point of importance i have already told you how they were entrapped into the house and how they passed the night there to this i can now add that something did certainly happen to mr midwinter which deprived him of consciousness and that the doctor who appears to have been mixed up in the matter carried things with a high hand and insisted on taking his own course in his own sanitarium there is not the least doubt that the miserable woman however she might have come by her death was found deadthat a coroners inquest inquired into the circumstancesthat the evidence showed her to have entered the house as a patientand that the medical investigation ended in discovering that she had died of apoplexy my idea is that mr midwinter had a motive of his own for not coming forward with the evidence that he might have given i have also reason to suspect that mr armadale out of regard for him followed his lead and that the verdict at the inquest attaching no blame to anybody proceeded like many other verdicts of the same kind from an entirely superficial investigation of the circumstances  the key to the whole mystery is to be found i firmly believe in that wretched womans attempt to personate the character of mr armadales widow when the news of his death appeared in the papers but what first set her on this and by what inconceivable process of deception she can have induced mr midwinter to marry her as the certificate proves under mr armadales name is more than mr armadale himself knows the point was not touched at the inquest for the simple reason that the inquest only concerned itself with the circumstances attending her death mr armadale at his friends request saw miss blanchard and induced her to silence old darch on the subject of the claim that had been made relating to the widows income as the claim had never been admitted even our stiffnecked brother practitioner consented for once to do as he was asked the doctors statement that his patient was the widow of a gentleman named armadale was accordingly left unchallenged and so the matter has been hushed up she is buried in the great cemetery near the place where she died nobody but mr midwinter and mr armadale who insisted on going with him followed her to the grave and nothing has been inscribed on the tombstone but the initial letter of her christian name and the date of her death so after all the harm she has done she rests at last and so the two men whom she has injured have forgiven her  is there more to say on this subject before we leave it on referring to your letter i find you have raised one other point which may be worth a moments notice  you ask if there is reason to suppose that the doctor comes out of the matter with hands which are really as clean as they look my dear augustus i believe the doctor to have been at the bottom of more of this mischief than we shall ever find out and to have profited by the selfimposed silence of mr midwinter and mr armadale as rogues perpetually profit by the misfortunes and necessities of honest men it is an ascertained fact that he connived at the false statement about miss milroy which entrapped the two gentlemen into his house and that one circumstance after my old bailey experience is enough for me as to evidence against him there is not a jot and as to retribution overtaking him i can only say i heartily hope retribution may prove in the long run to be the more cunning customer of the two there is not much prospect of it at present the doctors friends and admirers are i understand about to present him with a testimonial expressive of their sympathy under the sad occurrence which has thrown a cloud over the opening of his sanitarium and of their undiminished confidence in his integrity and ability as a medical man we live augustus in an age eminently favorable to the growth of all roguery which is careful enough to keep up appearances in this enlightened nineteenth century i look upon the doctor as one of our rising men  to turn now to pleasanter subjects than sanitariums i may tell you that miss neelie is as good as well again and is in my humble opinion prettier than ever she is staying in london under the care of a female relative and mr armadale satisfies her of the fact of his existence in case she should forget it regularly every day they are to be married in the spring unless mrs milroys death causes the ceremony to be postponed the medical men are of opinion that the poor lady is sinking at last it may be a question of weeks or a question of months they can say no more she is greatly alteredquiet and gentle and anxiously affectionate with her husband and her child but in her case this happy change is it seems a sign of approaching dissolution from the medical point of view there is a difficulty in making the poor old major understand this he only sees that she has gone back to the likeness of her better self when he first married her and he sits for hours by her bedside now and tells her about his wonderful clock  mr midwinter of whom you will next expect me to say something is improving rapidly after causing some anxiety at first to the medical men who declared that he was suffering from a serious nervous shock produced by circumstances about which their patients obstinate silence kept them quite in the dark he has rallied as only men of his sensitive temperament to quote the doctors again can rally he and mr armadale are together in a quiet lodging i saw him last week when i was in london his face showed signs of wear and tear very sad to see in so young a man but he spoke of himself and his future with a courage and hopefulness which men of twice his years if he has suffered as i suspect him to have suffered might have envied if i know anything of humanity this is no common man and we shall hear of him yet in no common way  you will wonder how i came to be in london i went up with a return ticket from saturday to monday about that matter in dispute at our agents we had a tough fight but curiously enough a point occurred to me just as i got up to go and i went back to my chair and settled the question in no time of course i stayed at our hotel in covent garden william the waiter asked after you with the affection of a father and matilda the chambermaid said you almost persuaded her that last time to have the hollow tooth taken out of her lower jaw i had the agents second son the young chap you nicknamed mustapha when he made that dreadful mess about the turkish securities to dine with me on sunday a little incident happened in the evening which may be worth recording as it connected itself with a certain old lady who was not at home when you and mr armadale blundered on that house in pimlico in the bygone time  mustapha was like all the rest of you young men of the present dayhe got restless after dinner lets go to a public amusement mr pedgift says he public amusement why its sunday evening says i all right sir says mustapha they stop acting on the stage i grant you on sunday eveningbut they dont stop acting in the pulpit come and see the last new sunday performer of our time as he wouldnt have any more wine there was nothing else for it but to go  we went to a street at the west end and found it blocked up with carriages if it hadnt been sunday night i should have thought we were going to the opera what did i tell you says mustapha taking me up to an open door with a gas star outside and a bill of the performance i had just time to notice that i was going to one of a series of sunday evening discourses on the pomps and vanities of the world by a sinner who has served them when mustapha jogged my elbow and whispered half a crown is the fashionable tip i found myself between two demure and silent gentlemen with plates in their hands uncommonly well filled already with the fashionable tip mustapha patronized one plate and i the other we passed through two doors into a long room crammed with people and there on a platform at the further end holding forth to the audience wasnot a man as i had expectedbut a woman and that woman mother oldershaw you never listened to anything more eloquent in your life as long as i heard her she was never once at a loss for a word anywhere i shall think less of oratory as a human accomplishment for the rest of my days after that sunday evening as for the matter of the sermon i may describe it as a narrative of mrs oldershaws experience among dilapidated women profusely illustrated in the pious and penitential style you will ask what sort of audience it was principally women augustusand as i hope to be saved all the old harridans of the world of fashion whom mother oldershaw had enameled in her time sitting boldly in the front places with their cheeks ruddled with paint in a state of devout enjoyment wonderful to see i left mustapha to hear the end of it and i thought to myself as i went out of what shakespeare says somewhere lord what fools we mortals be  have i anything more to tell you before i leave off only one thing that i can remember  that wretched old bashwood has confirmed the fears i told you i had about him when he was brought back here from london there is no kind of doubt that he has really lost all the little reason he ever had he is perfectly harmless and perfectly happy and he would do very well if we could only prevent him from going out in his last new suit of clothes smirking and smiling and inviting everybody to his approaching marriage with the handsomest woman in england it ends of course in the boys pelting him and in his coming here crying to me covered with mud the moment his clothes are cleaned again he falls back into his favorite delusion and struts about before the church gates in the character of a bridegroom waiting for miss gwilt we must get the poor wretch taken care of somewhere for the rest of the little time he has to live who would ever have thought of a man at his age falling in love and who would ever have believed that the mischief that womans beauty has done could have reached as far in the downward direction as our superannuated old clerk  goodby for the present my dear boy if you see a particularly handsome snuffbox in paris rememberthough your father scorns testimonialshe doesnt object to receive a present from his son  yours affectionately  a pedgift sen  postscripti think it likely that the account you mention in the french papers of a fatal quarrel among some foreign sailors in one of the lipari islands and of the death of their captain among others may really have been a quarrel among the scoundrels who robbed mr armadale and scuttled his yacht those fellows luckily for society cant always keep up appearances and in their case rogues and retribution do occasionally come into collision with each other     ii midwinter  the spring had advanced to the end of april it was the eve of allans weddingday midwinter and he had sat talking together at the great house till far into the nighttill so far that it had struck twelve long since and the wedding day was already some hours old  for the most part the conversation had turned on the bridegrooms plans and projects it was not till the two friends rose to go to rest that allan insisted on making midwinter speak of himself  we have had enough and more than enough of my future he began in his bluntly straightforward way lets say something now midwinter about yours you have promised me i know that if you take to literature it shant part us and that if you go on a seavoyage you will remember when you come back that my house is your home but this is the last chance we have of being together in our old way and i own i should like to know his voice faltered and his eyes moistened a little he left the sentence unfinished  midwinter took his hand and helped him as he had often helped him to the words that he wanted in the bygone time  you would like to know allan he said that i shall not bring an aching heart with me to your wedding day if you will let me go back for a moment to the past i think i can satisfy you  they took their chairs again allan saw that midwinter was moved why distress yourself he asked kindlywhy go back to the past  for two reasons allan i ought to have thanked you long since for the silence you have observed for my sake on a matter that must have seemed very strange to you you know what the name is which appears on the register of my marriage and yet you have forborne to speak of it from the fear of distressing me before you enter on your new life let us come to a first and last understanding about this i ask youas one more kindness to meto accept my assurance strange as the thing may seem to you that i am blameless in this matter and i entreat you to believe that the reasons i have for leaving it unexplained are reasons which if mr brock was living mr brock himself would approve in those words he kept the secret of the two names and left the memory of allans mother what he had found it a sacred memory in the heart of her son  one word more he went ona word which will take us this time from past to future it has been said and truly said that out of evil may come good out of the horror and the misery of that night you know of has come the silencing of a doubt which once made my life miserable with groundless anxiety about you and about myself no clouds raised by my superstition will ever come between us again i cant honestly tell you that i am more willing now than i was when we were in the isle of man to take what is called the rational view of your dream though i know what extraordinary coincidences are perpetually happening in the experience of all of us still i cannot accept coincidences as explaining the fulfillment of the visions which our own eyes have seen all i can sincerely say for myself is what i think it will satisfy you to know that i have learned to view the purpose of the dream with a new mind i once believed that it was sent to rouse your distrust of the friendless man whom you had taken as a brother to your heart i now know that it came to you as a timely warning to take him closer still does this help to satisfy you that i too am standing hopefully on the brink of a new life and that while we live brother your love and mine will never be divided again  they shook hands in silence allan was the first to recover himself he answered in the few words of kindly assurance which were the best words that he could address to his friend  i have heard all i ever want to hear about the past he said and i know what i most wanted to know about the future everybody says midwinter you have a career before you and i believe that everybody is right who knows what great things may happen before you and i are many years older  who need know said midwinter calmly happen what may god is allmerciful god is allwise in those words your dear old friend once wrote to me in that faith i can look back without murmuring at the years that are past and can look on without doubting to the years that are to come  he rose and walked to the window while they had been speaking together the darkness had passed the first light of the new day met him as he looked out and rested tenderly on his face     appendix   notemy readers will perceive that i have purposely left them with reference to the dream in this story in the position which they would occupy in the case of a dream in real life they are free to interpret it by the natural or the supernatural theory as the bent of their own minds may incline them persons disposed to take the rational view may under these circumstances be interested in hearing of a coincidence relating to the present story which actually happened and which in the matter of extravagant improbability sets anything of the same kind that a novelist could imagine at flat defiance  in november 1865 that is to say when thirteen monthly parts of armadale had been published and i may add when more than a year and a half had elapsed since the end of the story as it now appears was first sketched in my notebooka vessel lay in the huskisson dock at liverpool which was looked after by one man who slept on board in the capacity of shipkeeper on a certain day in the week this man was found dead in the deckhouse on the next day a second man who had taken his place was carried dying to the northern hospital on the third day a third shipkeeper was appointed and was found dead in the deckhouse which had already proved fatal to the other two the name of that ship was the armadale and the proceedings at the inquest proved that the three men had been all suffocated by sleeping in poisoned air  i am indebted for these particulars to the kindness of the reporters at liverpool who sent me their statement of the facts the case found its way into most of the newspapers it was noticedto give two instances in which i can cite the datesin the times of november 30th 1865 and was more fully described in the daily news of november 28th in the same year  before taking leave of armadale i may perhaps be allowed to mention for the benefit of any readers who may be curious on such points that the norfolk broads are here described after personal investigation of them in this as in other cases i have spared no pains to instruct myself on matters of fact wherever the story touches on questions connected with law medicine or chemistry it has been submitted before publication to the experience of professional men the kindness of a friend supplied me with a plan of the doctors apparatus and i saw the chemical ingredients at work before i ventured on describing the action of them in the closing scenes of this book
