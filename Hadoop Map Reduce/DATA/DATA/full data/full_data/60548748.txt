aberyswith was a ladynot too young   with a perfect taste in dresses and a badlybitted tongue   with a thirst for information and a greater thirst for praise   and a little house in simla in the prehistoric days    by reason of her marriage to a gentleman in power   delilah was acquainted with the gossip of the hour   and many little secrets of the halfofficial kind   were whispered to delilah and she bore them all in mind    she patronized extensively a man ulysses gunne   whose mode of earning money was a low and shameful one   he wrote for certain papers which as everybody knows   is worse than serving in a shop or scaring off the crows    he praised her queenly beauty first and later on he hinted   at the vastness of her intellect with compliment unstinted   he went with her ariding and his love for her was such   that he lent her all his horses andshe galled them very much    one day they brewed a secret of a fine financial sort   it related to appointments to a man and a report   twas almost worth the keepingonly seven people knew it   and gunne rose up to seek the truth and patiently pursue it    it was a viceroys secret butperhaps the wine was red   perhaps an aged councillor had lost his aged head   perhaps delilahs eyes were brightdelilahs whispers sweet   the aged member told her what twere treason to repeat    ulysses went ariding and they talked of love and flowers   ulysses went acalling and he called for several hours   ulysses went awaltzing and delilah helped him dance   ulysses let the waltzes go and waited for his chance    the summer sun was setting and the summer air was still   the couple went awalking in the shade of summer hill   the wasteful sunset faded out in turkishgreen and gold   ulysses pleaded softly and that bad delilah told    next morn a startled empire learnt the allimportant news   next week the aged councillor was shaking in his shoes   next month i met delilah and she did not show the least   hesitation in affirming that ulysses was a beast                               we have another viceroy now those days are dead and done   of delilah aberyswith and most mean ulysses gunne     what happened

  on the eve of the fancy ball   so a kiss or two was nothing to you     or any one else at all    jenny would go in a domino     pretty and pink but warm   while i attended clad in a splendid     austrian uniform    now we had arranged through notes exchanged     early that afternoon   at number four to waltz no more     but to sit in the dusk and spoon    i wish you to see that jenny and me     had barely exchanged our troth   so a kiss or two was strictly due     by from and between us both    when three was over an eager lover     i fled to the gloom outside   and a domino came out also     whom i took for my future bride    that is to say in a casual way     i slipped my arm around her   with a kiss or two which is nothing to you     and ready to kiss i found her    she turned her head and the name she said     was certainly not my own   but ere i could speak with a smothered shriek     she fled and left me alone    then jenny came and i saw with shame     shed doffed her domino   and i had embraced an alien waist     but i did not tell her so    next morn i knew that there were two     dominoes pink and one   had cloaked the spouse of sir julian house     our big political gun    sir j was old and her hair was gold     and her eye was a blue cerulean   and the name she said when she turned her head     was not in the least like julian     the man who could

binks of hezabad           well drains and sewageoutfalls are             my own peculiar fad            i learnt a lesson once it ran           thus quoth that most veracious man    it was an august evening and in snowy garments clad   i paid a round of visits in the lines of hezabad   when presently my waler saw and did not like at all   a commissariat elephant careering down the mall    i couldnt see the driver and across my mind it rushed   that that commissariat elephant had suddenly gone musth    i didnt care to meet him and i couldnt well get down   so i let the waler have it and we headed for the town    the buggy was a new one and praise dykes it stood the strain   till the waler jumped a bullock just above the city drain   and the next that i remember was a hurricane of squeals   and the creature making toothpicks of my fivefoot patent wheels    he seemed to want the owner so i fled distraught with fear   to the main drain sewageoutfall while he snorted in my ear   reached the fourfoot drainhead safely and in darkness and despair   felt the brutes proboscis fingering my terrorstiffened hair    heard it trumpet on my shouldertried to crawl a little higher   found the main drain sewage outfall blocked some eight feet up with mire   and for twenty reeking minutes sir my very marrow froze   while the trunk was feeling blindly for a purchase on my toes    it missed me by a fraction but my hair was turning grey   before they called the drivers up and dragged the brute away    then i sought the city elders and my words were very plain   they flushed that fourfoot drainhead andit never choked again    you may hold with surfacedrainage and the sunforgarbage cure   till youve been a periwinkle shrinking coyly up a sewer    i believe in wellflushed culverts                                      this is why the deathrates small   and if you dont believe me get shikarred yourself thats all     a code of morals             lest you should think this story true            i merely mention i            evolved it lately tis a most            unmitigated misstatement    now jones had left his newwed bride to keep his house in order   and hied away to the hurrum hills above the afghan border   to sit on a rock with a heliograph but ere he left he taught   his wife the working of the code that sets the miles at naught    and love had made him very sage as nature made her fair   so cupid and apollo linked per heliograph the pair   at dawn across the hurrum hills he flashed her counsel wise   at een the dying sunset bore her husbands homilies    he warned her gainst seductive youths in scarlet clad and gold   as much as gainst the blandishments paternal of the old   but kept his gravest warnings for hereby the ditty hangs   that snowyhaired lothario lieutenantgeneral bangs    twas general bangs with aide and staff who tittupped on the way   when they beheld a heliograph tempestuously at play   they thought of border risings

earth    kamal is out with twenty men to raise the borderside   and he has lifted the colonels mare that is the colonels pride   he has lifted her out of the stabledoor between the dawn and the day   and turned the calkins upon her feet and ridden her far away    then up and spoke the colonels son that led a troop of the guides   is there never a man of all my men can say where kamal hides   then

the colonels son  do good to bird and beast   but count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast    if there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away   belike the price of a jackals meal were more than a thief could pay    they will feed their horse on the standing crop their men on the garnered   grain   the thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are   slain   but if thou thinkest the price be fairthy brethren wait to sup   the hound is kin to the jackalspawnhowl dog and call them up   and if thou thinkest the price be high in steer and gear and stack   give me my fathers mare again and ill fight my own way back    kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet   no talk shall be of dogs said he when wolf and gray wolf

in one of the rajpoot states his wives   disregarding the orders of the english against suttee would have broken   out of the palace had not the gates been barred    but one of them disguised as the kings favourite dancinggirl passed   through the line of guards and reached the pyre  there her courage   failing she prayed her cousin a baron of the court to kill her  this   he did not knowing who she was     udai chand lay sick to death       in his hold by gungra hill   all night we heard the deathgongs ring   for the soul of the dying rajpoot king   all night beat up from the womens wing       a cry that we could not still    all night the barons came and went       the lords of the outer guard   all night the cressets glimmered pale   on ulwar sabre and tonk jezail   mewar headstall and marwar mail       that clinked in the palace yard    in the golden room on the palace roof       all night he fought for air   and there was sobbing behind the screen   rustle and whisper of women unseen   and the hungry eyes of the boondi queen       on the death she might not share    he passed at dawnthe deathfire leaped       from ridge to riverhead   from the malwa plains to the abu scars   and wail upon wail went up to the stars   behind the grim zenanabars       when they knew that the king was dead    the dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth       and robe him for the pyre   the boondi queen beneath us cried   see now that we die as our mothers died   in the bridalbed by our masters side       out womento the fire    we drove the great gates home apace       white hands were on the sill   but ere the rush of the unseen feet   had reached the turn to the open street   the bars shot down the guarddrum beat       we held the dovecot still    a face looked down in the gathering day       and laughing spoke from the wall   ohe they mourn here  let me by   azizun the  lucknow nautchgirl i   when the house is rotten the rats must fly       and i seek another thrall    for i ruled the king as neer did queen       tonight the queens rule me   guard them safely but let me go   or ever they pay the debt they owe   in scourge and torture  she leaped below       and the grim guard watched her flee    they knew that the king had spent his soul       on a northbred dancinggirl   that he prayed to a flatnosed lucknow god   and kissed the ground where her feet had trod   and doomed to death at her drunken nod       and swore by her lightest curl    we bore the king to his fathers place       where the tombs of the sunborn stand   where the gray apes swing and the peacocks preen   on fretted pillar and jewelled screen   and the wild boar couch in the house of the queen       on the drift of the desert sand    the herald read his titles forth       we set the logs aglow   friend of the english free from fear   baron of luni to jeysulmeer   lord of the desert of bikaneer       king of the junglego    all night the red flame stabbed the sky       with wavering windtossed spears   and out of a shattered temple crept   a woman who veiled her head and wept   and called on the kingbut the great king slept       and turned not for her tears    small thought had he to mark the strife       cold fear with hot desire   when thrice she leaped from the leaping flame   and thrice she beat her breast for shame   and thrice like a wounded dove she came       and moaned about the fire    one watched a bowshot from the blaze       the silent streets between   who had stood by the king in sport and fray   to blade in ambush or boar at bay   and he was a baron old and gray       and kin to the boondi queen    he said o shameless put aside       the veil upon thy brow   who held the king and all his land   to the wanton will of a harlots hand   will the white ash rise from the blistered brand       stoop down and call him now    then she  by the faith of my tarnished soul       all things i did not well   i had hoped to clear ere the fire died   and lay me down by my masters side   to rule in heaven his only bride       while the others howl in hell    but i have felt the fires breath       and hard it is to die   yet if i may pray a rajpoot lord   to sully the steel of a thakurs sword   with baseborn blood of a trade abhorred       and the thakur answered ay    he drew and struck  the straight blade drank       the life beneath the breast    i had looked for the queen to face the flame   but the harlot dies for the rajpoot dame   sister of mine pass free from shame       pass with thy king to rest    the black log crashed above the white       the little flames and lean   red as slaughter and blue as steel   that whistled and fluttered from head to heel   leaped up anew for they found their meal       on the heart ofthe boondi queen     the ballad of the kings mercy      abdhur rahman the durani chief       of him is the story told     his mercy fills the khyber hills       his grace is manifold     he has taken toll of the north and the south       his glory reacheth far     and they tell the tale of his charity       from balkh to kandahar     before the old peshawur gate where kurd and kaffir meet   the governor of kabul dealt the justice of the street   and that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife   tho he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life     there was a hound of hindustan had struck a euzufzai   wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die    it chanced the king went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife   the kaffir grovelled underhoof and clamoured for his life     then said the king  have hope o friend  yea death disgraced is hard   much honour shall be thine and called the captain of the guard   yar khan a bastard of the blood so citybabble saith   and he was honoured of the kingthe which is salt to death   and he was son of daoud shah the reiver of the plains   and blood of old durani lords ran fire in his veins   and twas to tame an afghan pride nor hell nor heaven could bind   the king would make him butcher to a yelping cur of hind     strike said the king kings blood art thouhis death shall be his   pride   then louder that the crowd might catch  fear nothis arms are tied   yar khan drew clear the khyber knife and struck and sheathed again   o man thy will is done quoth he a king this dog hath slain      abdhur rahman the durani chief       to the north and the south is sold     the north and the south shall open their mouth       to a ghilzai flag unrolled     when the big guns speak to the khyber peak       and his dogheratis fly     ye have heard the songhow long how long       wolves of the abazai    that night before the watch was set when all the streets were clear   the governor of kabul spoke  my king hast

who there be in kabul now that clamour for thy head    that night when all the gates were shut to city and to throne   within a little gardenhouse the king lay down alone    before the sinking of the moon which is the night of night   yar khan came softly to the king to make his honour white   the children of the town had mocked beneath his horses hoofs   the harlots of the town had hailed him butcher from their roofs    but as he groped against the wall two hands upon him fell   the king behind his shoulder spake  dead man thou dost not well   tis ill to jest with kings by day and seek a boon by night   and that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write    but three days hence if god be good and if thy strength remain   thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain   for i am merciful to all and most of all to thee    my butcher of the shambles restno knife hast thou for me      abdhur rahman the durani chief       holds hard by the south and the north     but the ghilzai knows ere the melting snows       when the swollen banks break forth     when the redcoats crawl to the sungar wall       and his usbeg lances fail     ye have heard the songhow long how long       wolves of the zuka kheyl    they stoned him in the rubbishfield when dawn was in the sky   according to the written word see that he do not die    they stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain   and those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again     one watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered   thing   and him the king with laughter called the herald of the king     it was upon the second night the night of ramazan   the watcher leaning earthward heard the message of yar khan    from shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath   creature of god deliver me from agony of death    they sought the king among his girls and risked their lives thereby   protector of the pitiful give orders that he die    bid him endure until the day a lagging answer came   the night is short and he can pray and learn to bless my name    before the dawn three times he spoke and on the day once more   creature of god deliver me and bless the king therefor    they shot him at the morning prayer to ease him of his pain   and when he heard the matchlocks clink he blessed the king again    which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing   so that the outer seas may know the mercy of the king      abdhur rahman the durani chief       of him is the story told     he has opened his mouth to the north and the south       they have stuffed his mouth with gold      ye know the truth of his tender ruth       and sweet his favours are     ye have heard the songhow long how long       from balkh to kandahar     the ballad of the kings jest    when springtime flushes the desert grass   our kafilas wind through the khyber pass    lean are the camels but fat the frails   light are the purses but heavy the bales   as the snowbound trade of the north comes down   to the marketsquare of peshawur town    in a turquoise twilight crisp and chill   a kafila camped at the foot of the hill    then blue smokehaze of the cooking rose   and tentpeg answered to hammernose   and the picketed ponies shag and wild   strained at their ropes as the feed was piled   and the bubbling camels beside the load   sprawled for a furlong adown the road   and the persian pussycats brought for sale   spat at the dogs from the camelbale   and the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food   and the campfires twinkled by fort jumrood   and there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk   a savour of camels and carpets and musk   a murmur of voices a reek of smoke   to tell us the trade of the khyber woke    the lid of the fleshpot chattered high   the knives were whetted andthen came i   to mahbub ali the muleteer   patching his bridles and counting his gear   crammed with the gossip of half a year    but mahbub ali the kindly said   better is speech when the belly is fed   so we plunged the hand to the midwrist deep   in a cinnamon stew of the fattailed sheep   and he who never hath tasted the food   by allah he knoweth not bad from good    we cleansed our beards of the muttongrease   we lay on the mats and were filled with peace   and the talk slid north and the talk slid south   with the sliding puffs from the hookahmouth    four things greater than all things are   women and horses and power and war    we spake of them all but the last the most   for i sought a word of a russian post   of a shifty promise an unsheathed sword   and a graycoat guard on the helmund ford    then mahbub ali lowered his eyes   in the fashion of one who is weaving lies    quoth he of the russians who can say   when the night is gathering all is gray   but we look that the gloom of the night shall die   in the morning flush of a bloodred sky    friend of my heart is it meet or wise   to warn a king of his enemies   we know what heaven or hell may bring   but no man knoweth the mind of the king    that unsought counsel is cursed of god   attesteth the story of wali dad    his sire was leaky of tongue and pen   his dam was a clucking khuttuck hen   and the colt bred close to the vice of each   for he carried the curse of an unstanched speech    therewith madnessso that he sought   the favour of kings at the kabul court   and travelled in hope of honour far   to the line where the graycoat squadrons are    there have i journeyed toobut i   saw naught said naught anddid not die   he harked to rumour and snatched at a breath   of this one knoweth and that one saith   legends that ran from mouth to mouth   of a graycoat coming and sack of the south    these have i also heardthey pass   with each new spring and the winter grass    hotfoot southward forgotten of god   back to the city ran wali dad   even to kabulin full durbar   the king held talk with his chief in war    into the press of the crowd he broke   and what he had heard of the coming spoke     then gholam hyder the red chief smiled   as a mother might on a babbling child   but those who would laugh restrained their breath   when the face of the king showed dark as death    evil it is in full durbar   to cry to a ruler of gathering war   slowly he led to a peachtree small   that grew by a cleft of the city wall    and he said to the boy they shall praise thy zeal   so long as the red spurt follows the steel    and the russ is upon us even now   great is thy prudenceawait them thou   watch from the tree  thou art young and strong   surely thy vigil is not for long    the russ is upon us thy clamour ran   surely an hour shall bring their van   wait and watch  when the host is near   shout aloud that my men may hear    friend of my heart is it meet or wise   to warn a king of his enemies   a guard was set that he might not flee   a score of bayonets ringed the tree    the peachbloom fell in showers of snow   when he shook at his death as he looked below   by the power of god who alone is great   till the seventh day he fought with his fate    then madness took him and men declare   he mowed in the branches as ape and bear   and last as a sloth ere his body failed   and he hung as a bat in the forks and wailed   and sleep the cord of his hands untied   and he fell and was caught on the points and died    heart of my heart is it meet or wise   to warn a king of his enemies   we know what heaven or hell may bring   but no man knoweth the mind of the king    of the graycoat coming who can say   when the night is gathering all is gray    to things greater than all things are   the first is love and the second war    and since we know not how war may prove   heart of my heart let us talk of love     the ballad of boh da thone              this is the ballad of boh da thone             erst a pretender to theebaws throne             who harried the district of alalone             how he met with his fate and the vpp              at the hand of harendra mukerji             senior gomashta gbt    boh da thone was a warrior bold   his sword and his snider were bossed with gold    and the peacock banner his henchmen bore   was stiff with bullion but stiffer with gore    he shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak   from the salween scrub to the chindwin teak    he crucified noble he sacrificed mean   he filled old ladies with kerosene    while over the water the papers cried   the patriot fights for his countryside    but little they cared for the native press   the worn white soldiers in khaki dress    who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre   who died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire    who gave up their lives at the queens command   for the pride of their race and the peace of the land    now first of the foemen of boh da thone   was captain oneil of the black tyrone   and his was a company seventy strong   who hustled that dissolute chief along    there were lads from galway and louth and meath   who went to their death with a joke in their teeth   and worshipped with fluency fervour and zeal   the mud on the bootheels of crook oneil    but ever a blight on their labours lay   and ever their quarry would vanish away   till the sundried boys of the black tyrone   took a brotherly interest in boh da thone   and sooth if pursuit in possession ends   the boh and his trackers were best of friends    the word of a scouta march by night   a rush through the mista scattering fight   a volley from covera corpse in the clearing   the glimpse of a loincloth and heavy jade earring   the flare of a villagethe tally of slain   andthe boh was abroad on the raid again    they cursed their luck as the irish will   they gave him credit for cunning and skill   they buried their dead they bolted their beef   and started anew on the track of the thief   till in place of the kalends of greece men said   when crook and his darlings come back with the head    they had hunted the boh from the hills to the plain   he doubled and broke for the hills again   they had crippled his power for rapine and raid   they had routed him out of his pet stockade   and at last they came when the day star tired   to a camp deserteda village fired    a black cross blistered the morninggold   and the body upon it was stark and cold   the wind of the dawn went merrily past   the high grass bowed her plumes to the blast    and out of the grass on a sudden broke   a spirtle of fire a whorl of smoke    and captain oneil of the black tyrone   was blessed with a slug in the ulnarbone   the gift of his enemy boh da thone    now a slug that is hammered from telegraphwire   is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire                   the shotwound festeredas shotwounds may   in a steaming barrack at mandalay    the left arm throbbed and the captain swore   id like to be after the boh once more   the fever held himthe captain said   id give a hundred to look at his head    the hospital punkahs creaked and whirred   but babu harendra gomashta heard    he thought of the canebrake green and dank   that girdled his home by the dacca tank   he thought of his wife and his high school son   he thoughtbut abandoned the thoughtof a gun   his sleep was broken by visions dread   of a shining boh with a silver head    he kept his counsel and went his way   and swindled the cartmen of half their pay                    and the months went on as the worst must do   and the boh returned to the raid anew    but the captain had quitted the longdrawn strife   and in far simoorie had taken a wife   and she was a damsel of delicate mould   with hair like the sunshine and heart of gold    and little she knew the arms that embraced   had cloven a man from the brow to the waist   and little she knew that the loving lips   had ordered a quivering lifes eclipse    and the eye that lit at her lightest breath   had glared unawed in the gates of death    for these be matters a man would hide   as a general rule from an innocent bride    and little the captain thought of the past   and of all men babu harendra last                    but slow in the sludge of the kathun road   the government bullock train toted its load   speckless and spotless and shining with ghee   in the rearmost cart sat the babujee    and ever a phantom before him fled   of a scowling boh with a silver head    then the leadcart stuck though the coolies slaved   and the cartmen flogged and the escort raved   and out of the jungle with yells and squeals   pranced boh da thone and his gang at his heels    then belching blunderbuss answered back   the sniders snarl and the carbines crack   and the blithe revolver began to sing   to the blade that twanged on the lockingring   and the brown flesh blued where the baynet kissed   as the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist   and the great white bullocks with onyx eyes   watched the souls of the dead arise   and over the smoke of the fusillade   the peacock banner staggered and swayed    oh gayest of scrimmages man may see   is a wellworked rush on the gbt    the babu shook at the horrible sight   and girded his ponderous loins for flight   but fate had ordained that the boh should start   on a lonehand raid of the rearmost cart   and out of that cart with a bellow of woe   the babu fellflat on the top of the boh    for years had harendra served the state   to the growth of his purse and the girth of his pet    there were twenty stone as the tallyman knows   on the broad of the chest of this best of bohs   and twenty stone from a height discharged   are bad for a boh with a spleen enlarged    oh short was the strugglesevere was the shock   he dropped like a bullockhe lay like a block   and the babu above him convulsed with fear   heard the labouring lifebreath hissed out in his ear    and thus in a fashion undignified   the princely pest of the chindwin died                   turn now to simoorie where lapped in his ease   the captain is petting the bride on his knees   where the whit of the bullet the wounded mans scream   are mixed as the mist of some devilish dream   forgotten forgotten the sweat of the shambles   where the hilldaisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols   from the swordbelt set free and released from the steel   the peace of the lord is with captain oneil                   up the hill to simooriemost patient of drudges   the bags on his shoulder the mailrunner trudges    for captain oneil sahib  one hundred and ten   rupees to collect on

for the whisper of love   from the arms of the bride ironvisaged and slow   the captain bent down to the head of the boh    and een as he looked on the thing where it lay   twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins array   the freed mind fled back to the longago days   the handtohand scufflethe smoke and the blaze   the forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn   the banjo at twilight the burial ere morn   the stench of the marshesthe raw piercing smell   when the overhand stabbingcut silenced the yell   the oaths of his irish that surged when they stood   where the black crosses hung oer the kuttamow flood    as a derelict ship drifts away with the tide   the captain went out on the past from his bride    back back through the springs to the chill of the year   when he hunted the boh from maloon to tsaleer    as the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water   in his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter   and men who had fought with oneil for the life   had gazed on his face with less dread than his wife    for she who had held him so long could not hold him   though a fourmonth eternity should have controlled him   but watched the twin terrorthe head turned to head   the scowling scarred black and the flushed savage red   the spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to   some grim hidden past she had never a clue to    but it knew as it grinned for he touched it unfearing   and muttered aloud so you kept that jade earring    then nodded and kindly as friend nods to friend   old man you fought well but you lost in the end                    the visions departed and shame followed passion   he took what i said in this horrible fashion    ill write to harendra  with language unsainted   the captain came back to the bridewho had fainted                    and this is a fiction  no  go to simoorie   and look at their baby a twelvemonth old houri   a pert little irisheyed kathleen mavournin   shes always about on

of the zukka kheyl    and if i fall to your hand afresh    i give you leave for the sin   that you cram my throat with the foul pigs flesh    and swing me in the skin     the rhyme of the three captains    this ballad appears to refer to one of the exploits of the notorious paul   jones the american pirate  it is founded on fact       at the close of a winter day   their anchors down by london town the three great captains lay   and one was admiral of the north from solway firth to skye   and one was lord of the wessex coast and all the lands thereby   and one was master of the thames from limehouse to blackwall   and he was captain of the fleetthe bravest of them all    their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the   sheer   when there came a certain tradingbrig with news of a privateer    her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a northern breeze   her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the eastern seas    light she rode in the rude tiderip to left and right she rolled   and the skipper sat on the scuttlebutt and stared at an empty hold    i ha paid port dues for your law quoth he and where is the law ye boast   if i sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a christian coast   ye have smoked the hives of the laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk   we tack not now to a gallang prow or a plunging peiho junk   i had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare   till i met with a limewashed yankee brig that rode off finisterre    there were canvas blinds to his bowgun ports to screen the weight he bore   and the signals ran for a merchantman from sandy hook to the nore    he would not fly the rovers flagthe bloody or the black   but now he floated the gridiron and now he flaunted the jack   he spoke of the law as he crimped my crewhe swore it was only a loan   but when i would ask for my own again he swore it was none of my own    he has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the line   he has stripped my rails of the shaddockfrails and the green unripened pine   he has taken my bale of dammer and spice i won beyond the seas   he has taken my grinning heathen godsand what should he want o these   my foremast would not mend his boom my deckhouse patch his boats   he has whittled the two this yank yahoo to peddle for shoepeg oats    i could not fight for the failing light and a rough beamsea beside   but i hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied    had i had guns as i had goods to work my christian harm   i had run him up from his quarterdeck to trade with his own yardarm   i had nailed his ears to my capstanhead and ripped them off with a saw   and soused them in the bilgewater and served them to him raw   i had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark   i had towed him aft of his own craft a bait for his brother shark   i had lapped him round with cocoa husk and drenched him with the oil   and lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil   i had stripped his hide for my hammockside and tasselled his beard i the   mesh   and spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened   flesh   i had hove him down by the mangroves brown where the mudreef sucks and   draws   moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the landcrabs claws   he is lazar within and lime without ye can nose him far enow   for he carries the taint of a musky shipthe reek of the slavers dhow   the skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold   and the captains three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold   and the captains three called courteously from deck to scuttlebutt   good sir we ha dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut    your words be words of a lawless race and the law it standeth thus   he comes of a race that have never a law and he never has boarded us    we ha sold him canvas and rope and sparwe know that his price is fair   and we know that he weeps for the lack of a law as he rides off finisterre    and since he is damned for a gallowsthief by you and better than you   we hold it meet that the english fleet should know that we hold him true   the skipper called to the tall taffrailand what is that to me   did ever you hear of a yankee brig that rifled a seventythree   do i loom so large from your quarterdeck that i lift like a ship o        the line   he has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine    there is never a law on the cocos keys to hold a white man in   but we do not steal the niggers meal for that is a niggers sin    must he have his law as a quid to chaw or laid in brass on his wheel   does he steal with tears when he buccaneers fore gad then why does he   steal   the skipper bit on a deepsea word and the word it was not sweet   for he could see the captains three had signalled to the fleet    but three and two in white and blue the whimpering flags began   we have heard a tale of aforeign sail but he is a merchantman   the skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the great horn spoon   fore gad the chaplain of the fleet would bless my picaroon   by two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air   we have sold our spars to the merchantmanwe know that his price is fair   the skipper winked his western eye and swore by a china storm   they ha rigged him a josephs jurycoat to keep his honour warm   the halliards twanged against the tops the bunting bellied broad   the skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord    mastheadmasthead the signal sped by the line o the british craft   the skipper called to his lascar crew and put her about and laughed   its mainsail haul my bully boys allwell out to the seas again   ere they set us to paint their pirate saint or scrub at his grapnelchain    its foresheet free with her head to the sea and the swing of the   unbought brine   well make no sport in an english court till we come as a ship o the line   till we come as a ship o the line my lads of thirty foot in the sheer   lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer   flying his pluck at our mizzentruck for weft of admiralty   heaving his head for our dipseylead in sign that we keep the sea    then foresheet home as she lifts to the foamwe stand on the outward   tack   we are paid in the coin of the white mans tradethe bezant is hard ay   and black    the frigatebird shall carry my word to the kling and the oranglaut   how a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a christian port   how a man may be robbed in christian port while three great captains there   shall dip their flag to a slavers ragto show that his trade is fair     the ballad of the clampherdown    it was our warship clampherdown    would sweep the channel clean   wherefore she kept her hatches close   when the merry channel chops arose    to save the bleached marine    she had one bowgun of a hundred ton    and a great sterngun beside   they dipped their noses deep in the sea   they racked their stays and stanchions free    in the wash of the windwhipped tide    it was our warship clampherdown    fell in with a cruiser light   that carried the dainty hotchkiss gun   and a pair o heels wherewith to run    from the grip of a closefought fight    she opened fire at seven miles    as ye shoot at a bobbing cork   and once she fired and twice she fired   till the bowgun drooped like a lily tired    that lolls upon the stalk    captain the bowgun melts apace    the deckbeams break below   twere well to rest for an hour or twain   and patch the shattered plates again    and he answered make it so    she opened fire within the mile    as ye shoot at the flying duck   and the great sterngun shot fair and true   with the heave of the ship to the stainless blue    and the great sternturret stuck    captain the turret fills with steam    the feedpipes burst below   you can hear the hiss of the helpless ram   you can hear the twisted runners jam    and he answered turn and go    it was our warship clampherdown    and grimly did she roll   swung round to take the cruisers fire   as the white whale faces the threshers ire    when they war by the frozen pole    captain the shells are falling fast    and faster still fall we   and it is not meet for english stock   to bide in the heart of an eightday clock    the death they cannot see    lie down lie down my bold ab    we drift upon her beam   we dare not ram for she can run   and dare ye fire another gun    and die in the peeling steam    it was our warship clampherdown    that carried an armourbelt   but fifty feet at stern and bow   lay bare as the paunch of the pursers sow    to the hail of the nordenfeldt    captain they hack us through and through    the chilled steel bolts are swift   we have emptied the bunkers in open sea   their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be    and he answered let her drift    it was our warship clampherdown    swung round upon the tide   her two dumb guns glared south and north   and the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth    and she ground the cruisers side    captain they cry the fight is done    they bid you send your sword   and he answered grapple her stern and bow   they have asked for the steel  they shall have it now    out cutlasses and board    it was our warship clampherdown    spewed up four hundred men   and the scalded stokers yelped delight   as they rolled in the waist and heard the fight    stamp oer their steelwalled pen    they cleared the cruiser end to end    from conningtower to hold   they fought as they fought in nelsons fleet   they were stripped to the waist they were bare to the feet    as it was in the days of old    it was the sinking clampherdown    heaved up her battered side   and carried a million pounds in steel   to the cod and the corpsefed congereel    and the scour of the channel tide    it was the crew of the clampherdown    stood out to sweep the sea   on a cruiser won from an ancient foe   as it was in the days of long ago    and as it still shall be     the ballad of the bolivar         seven men from all the world back to docks again        rolling down the ratcliffe road drunk and raising cain        give the girls another drink fore we sign away        we that took the bolivar out across the bay    we put out from sunderland loaded down with rails    we put back to sunderland cause our cargo shifted   we put out from sunderlandmet the winter gales

steering like a dray       out we took the bolivar out across the bay    one by one the lights came up winked and let us by    mile by mile we waddled on coal and focsle short   met a blow that laid us down heard a bulkhead fly    left the wolf behind us with a twofoot list to port        trailing like a wounded duck working out her soul       clanging like a smithyshop after every roll       just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray       so we threshed the bolivar out across the bay    felt her hog and felt her sag betted when shed break    wondered every time she raced if shed stand the shock   heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake    hoped the lord ud keep his thumb on the plummerblock        banged against the iron decks bilges choked with coal       flayed and frozen foot and hand sick of heart and soul       last we prayed shed buck herself into judgment day       hi we cursed the bolivarknocking round the bay    o her nose flung up to sky groaning to be still    up and down and back we went never time for breath   then the money paid at lloyds caught her by the heel    and the stars ran round and round dancin at our death        aching for an hours sleep dozing off between       heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green       watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play       that was on the bolivar south across the bay     once we saw between the squalls lyin head to swell    mad with work and weariness wishin they was we   some damned liners lights go by like a long hotel    cheered her from the

flames for some time but ultimately        when it fell the crowds rent the air with shouts        and seemed to see significance in the incidentdaily papers     winds of the world give answer  they are whimpering to and fro   and what should they know of england who only england know   the poor little streetbred people that vapour and fume and brag   they are lifting their heads in the stillness

is run by one and one and never by two and two   then tomlinson looked up and down and little gain was there   for the naked stars grinned overhead and he saw that his soul was bare   the wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife   and tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life    this i have read in a book he said and that was told to me   and this i have thought that another man thought of a prince in muscovy   the good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path   and peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath    ye have read ye have heard ye have thought he said and the tale is   yet to run   by the worth of the body that once ye had give answerwhat haye done   then tomlinson looked back and forth and little good it bore   for the darkness stayed at his shoulderblade and heavens gate before   o this i have felt and this i have guessed and this i have heard men say   and this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in norroway   ye have read ye have felt ye have guessed good lack ye have hampered   heavens gate   theres little room between the stars in idleness to prate   o none may reach by hired speech of neighbour priest and kin   through borrowed deed to gods good meed that lies so fair within   get hence get hence to the lord of wrong for doom has yet to run   andthe faith that ye share with berkeley square uphold you tomlinson                    the spirit gripped him by the hair and sun by sun they fell   till they came to the belt of naughty stars that rim the mouth of hell   the first are red with pride and wrath the next are white with pain   but the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again   they may hold their path they may leave their path with never a soul to   mark   they may burn or freeze but they must not cease in the scorn of the outer   dark    the wind that blows between the worlds it nipped him to the bone   and he yearned to the flare of hellgate there as the light of his own   hearthstone    the devil he sat behind the bars where the desperate legions drew   but he caught the hasting tomlinson and would not let him through    wot ye the price of good pitcoal that i must pay said he   that ye rank yoursel so fit for hell and ask no leave of me   i am all oersib to adams breed that ye should give me scorn   for i strove with god for your first father the day that he was born    sit down sit down upon the slag and answer loud and high   the harm that ye did to the sons of men or ever you came to die   and tomlinson looked up and up and saw against the night   the belly of a tortured star bloodred in hellmouth light   and tomlinson looked down and down and saw beneath his feet   the frontlet of a tortured star milkwhite in hellmouth heat    o i had a love on earth said he that kissed me to my fall   and if ye would call my love to me i know she would answer all   all that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair   but now ye wait at hellmouth gate and not in berkeley square   though we whistled your love from her bed tonight i trow she would not run   for the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one   the wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife   and tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life   once i ha laughed at the power of love and twice at the grip of the grave   and thrice i ha patted my god on the head that men might call me brave   the devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool   do ye think i would waste my good pitcoal on the hide of a brainsick fool   i see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did   that i should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid   then tomlinson looked back and forth and there was little grace   for hellgate filled the houseless soul with the fear of naked space    nay this i ha heard quo  tomlinson and this was noised abroad   and this i ha got from a belgian book on the word of a dead french lord   ye ha heard ye ha read ye ha got good lack and the tale begins   afresh   have ye sinned one sin for the pride o the eye or the sinful lust of the   flesh   then tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered let me in   for i mind that i borrowed my neighbours wife to sin the deadly sin   the devil he grinned behind the bars and banked the fires high   did ye read of that sin in a book said he and tomlinson said ay   the devil he blew upon his nails and the little devils ran   and he said go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man   winnow him out twixt star and star and sieve his proper worth   theres sore decline in adams line if this be spawn of earth    empusas crew so nakednew they may not face the fire   but weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire   over the coal they chased the soul and racked it all abroad   as children rifle a caddiscase or the ravens foolish hoard    and back they came with the tattered thing as children after play   and they said  the soul that he got from god he has bartered clean away    we have threshed a stook of print and book and winnowed a chattering wind   and many a soul wherefrom he stole but his we cannot find   we have handled him we have dandled him we have seared him to the bone   and sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own   the devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low   im all oersib to adams breed that i should bid him go    yet close we lie and deep we lie and if i gave him place   my gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face   theyd call my house a common stews and me a careless host   andi would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost   the devil he looked at the mangled soul that prayed to feel the flame   and he thought of holy charity but he thought of his own good name   now ye could haste my coal to waste and sit ye down to fry   did ye think of that theft for yourself said he and tomlinson said ay   the devil he blew an outward breath for his heart was free from care   ye have scarce the soul of a louse he said but the roots of sin are   there   and for that sin should ye come in were i the lord alone   but sinful pride has rule insideand mightier than my own    honour and wit foredamned they sit to each his priest and whore   nay scarce i dare myself go there and you theyd torture sore    ye are neither spirit nor spirk he said        ye are neither book nor brute   go get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of mans repute    im all oersib to adams breed that i should mock your pain   but look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again   get hence the hearse is at your doorthe grim black stallions wait   they bear your clay to place today  speed lest ye come too late   go back to earth with a lip unsealedgo back with an open eye   and carry my word to the sons of men or ever ye come to die   that the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one   andthe god that you took from a printed book be with you tomlinson                             barrackroom ballads     dedication         to t a
