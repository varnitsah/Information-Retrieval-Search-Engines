          249     life of keats   of all the great poets of the early nineteenth centurywordsworth coleridge scott byron shelley keatsjohn keats was the last born and the first to die the length of his life was not onethird that of wordsworth who was born twentyfive years before him and outlived him by twentynine yet before his tragic death at twentysix keats had produced a body of poetry of such extraordinary power and promise that the world has sometimes been tempted in its regret for what he might have done had he lived to lose sight of the superlative merit of what he actually accomplished  the three years of his poetic career during which he published three small volumes of poetry show a development at the same time rapid and steady and a gradual but complete abandonment of almost every fault and weakness it would probably be impossible in the history of literature to find such another instance of the growth of a poets mind  the last of these three volumes which is here reprinted was published in 1820 when it had good success among the literary people and    a moderate sale it contains the flower of his poetic production and is perhaps altogether one of the most marvellous volumes ever issued from the press  but in spite of the maturity of keatss work when he was twentyfive he had been in no sense a precocious child born in 1795 in the city of london the son of a liverystable keeper he was brought up amid surroundings and influences by no means calculated to awaken poetic genius  he was the eldest of fivefour boys one of whom died in infancy and a girl younger than all and he and his brothers george and tom were educated at a private school at enfield here john was at first distinguished more for fighting than for study whilst his bright brave generous nature made him popular with masters and boys  soon after he had begun to go to school his father died and when he was fifteen the children lost their mother too keats was passionately devoted to his mother during her last illness he would sit up all night with her give her her medicine and even cook her food himself at her death he was brokenhearted  the children were now put under the care of two guardians one of whom mr abbey taking the sole responsibility immediately removed john from school and apprenticed him for five years to a surgeon at edmonton  whilst thus employed keats spent all his leisure time in reading for which he had developed a great enthusiasm during his last two years at school there he had devoured every book that came in his way especially rejoicing in stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient greece at edmonton he was able to continue his studies by borrowing books from his friend charles cowden clarke the son of his schoolmaster and he often went over to enfield to change his books and to discuss those which he had been reading on one of these occasions cowden clarke introduced him to spenser to whom so many poets have owed their first inspiration that he has been called the poets poet and it was then apparently that keats was first prompted to write  when he was nineteen a year before his apprenticeship came to an end he quarrelled with his master left him and continued his training in london as a student at st thomass hospital and guys gradually however during the months that followed though he was an industrious and able medical student keats came to realize that poetry was his true vocation and as soon as he was of age in spite of the opposition of his guardian he decided to abandon the medical profession and devote his life to literature  if mr abbey was unsympathetic keats was not without encouragement from others his brothers always believed in him wholeheartedly and his exceptionally lovable nature had won him many friends amongst these friends two men older than himself each famous in his own sphere had special influence upon him  one of them leigh hunt was something of a poet himself and a pleasant prosewriter his encouragement did much to stimulate keatss genius but his direct influence on his poetry was wholly bad leigh hunts was not a deep nature his poetry is often trivial and sentimental and his easy conversational style is intolerable when applied to a great theme to this mans influence as well as to the surroundings of his youth are doubtless due the occasional flaws of taste in keatss early work  the other haydon was an artist of mediocre creative talent but great aims and amazing belief in himself he had a fine critical faculty which was shown in his appreciation of the elgin marbles in opposition to the most respected authorities of his day mainly through his insistence they were secured for the nation which thus owes him a boundless debt of gratitude he helped to guide and direct keatss taste by his enthusiastic exposition of these masterpieces of greek sculpture  in 1817 keats published his first volume of poems including sleep and poetry and the wellknown lines i stood tiptoe upon a little hill with much that is of the highest poetic value many memorable lines and touches of his unique insight into nature the volume yet showed considerable immaturity it contained indeed if we except one perfect sonnet rather a series of experiments than any complete and finished work there were abundant faults for those who liked to look for them though there were abundant beauties too and the critics and the public chose rather to concentrate their attention on the former the volume was therefore anything but a success but keats was not discouraged for he saw many of his own faults more clearly than did his critics and felt his power to outgrow them  immediately after this keats went to the isle of wight and thence to margate that he might study and write undisturbed on may 10th he wrote to haydoni never quite despair and i read shakespeareindeed i shall i think never read any other book much we have seen keats influenced by spenser and by leigh hunt now though his love for spenser continued shakespeares had become the dominant influence gradually he came too under the influence of wordsworths philosophy of poetry and life and later his reading of milton affected his style to some extent but shakespeares influence was the widest deepest and most lasting though it is the hardest to define his study of other poets left traces upon his work in turns of phrase or turns of thought shakespeare permeated his whole being and his influence is to be detected not in a resemblance of style for shakespeare can have no imitators but in a broadening view of life and increased humanity  no poet could have owed his education more completely to the english poets than did john keats his knowledge of latin was slighthe knew no greek and even the classical stories which he loved and constantly used came to him almost entirely through the medium of elizabethan translations and allusions in this connexion it is interesting to read his first fine sonnet in which he celebrates his introduction to the greatest of greek poets in the translation of the rugged and forcible elizabethan george chapman       on first looking into chapmans homer       much have i travelled in the realms of gold      and many goodly states and kingdoms seen      round many western islands have i been      which bards in fealty to apollo hold      oft of one wide expanse had i been told      that deepbrowd homer ruled as his demesne      yet did i never breathe its pure serene      till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold      then felt i like some watcher of the skies      when a new planet swims into his ken      or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes      he stared at the pacificand all his men      lookd at each other with a wild surmise      silent upon a peak in darien  of the work upon which he was now engaged the narrativepoem of endymion we may give his own account to his little sister fanny in a letter dated september 10th 1817  perhaps you might like to know what i am writing about i will tell you many years ago there was a young handsome shepherd who fed his flocks on a mountains side called latmushe was a very contemplative sort of a person and lived solitary among the trees and plains little thinking that such a beautiful creature as the moon was growing mad in love with himhowever so it was and when he was asleep she used to come down from heaven and admire him excessively for a long time and at last could not refrain from carrying him away in her arms to the top of that high mountain latmus while he was a dreamingbut i dare say you have read this and all the other beautiful tales which have come down from the ancient times of that beautiful greece  on his return to london he and his brother tom always delicate and now quite an invalid took lodgings at hampstead here keats remained for some time harassed by the illness of his brother and of several of his friends and in june he was still further depressed by the departure of his brother george to try his luck in america  in april 1818 endymion was finished keats was by no means satisfied with it but preferred to publish it as it was feeling it to be as good as i had power to make it by myselfi will write independently he says to his publisheri have written independently without judgment i may write independently and with judgment hereafter in endymion i leaped headlong into the sea and thereby have become better acquainted with the soundings the quicksands and the rocks than if i had stayed upon the green shore and piped a silly pipe and took tea and comfortable advice he published it with a preface modestly explaining to the public his own sense of its imperfection nevertheless a storm of abuse broke upon him from the critics who fastened upon all the faults of the poemthe diffuseness of the story its occasional sentimentality and the sometimes fantastic coinage of wordsxiii1 and ignored the extraordinary beauties of which it is full  directly after the publication of endymion and before the appearance of these reviews keats started with a friend charles brown for a walking tour in scotland they first visited the english lakes and thence walked to dumfries where they saw the house of burns and his grave they entered next the country of meg merrilies and from kirkcudbrightshire crossed over to ireland for a few days on their return they went north as far as argyleshire whence they sailed to staffa and saw fingals cave which keats wrote for solemnity and grandeur far surpasses the finest cathedral they then crossed scotland through inverness and keats returned home by boat from cromarty  his letters home are at first full of interest and enjoyment but a slight sore throat contracted in a most wretched walk of thirtyseven miles across the isle of mull proved very troublesome and finally cut short his holiday this was the beginning of the end there was consumption in the family tom was dying of it and the cold wet and overexertion of his scotch tour seems to have developed the fatal tendency in keats himself  from this time forward he was never well and no good was done to either his health or spirits by the task which now awaited him of tending on his dying brother for the last two or three months of 1818 until toms death in december he scarcely left the bedside and it was well for him that his friend charles armitage brown was at hand to help and comfort him after the long strain brown persuaded keats at once to leave the house with its sad associations and to come and live with him  before long poetry absorbed keats again and the first few months of 1819 were the most fruitful of his life besides working at hyperion which he had begun during toms illness he wrote the eve of st agnes the eve of st mark la belle dame sans merci and nearly all his famous odes  troubles however beset him his friend haydon was in difficulties and tormenting him poor as he was to lend him money the state of his throat gave serious cause for alarm and above all he was consumed by an unsatisfying passion for the daughter of a neighbour mrs brawne she had rented browns house whilst they were in scotland and had now moved to a street near by miss fanny brawne returned his love but she seems never to have understood his nature or his needs highspirited and fond of pleasure she did not apparently allow the thought of her invalid lover to interfere much with her enjoyment of life she would not however abandon her engagement and she probably gave him all which it was in her nature to give illhealth made him on the other hand morbidly dissatisfied and suspicious and as a result of his illness and her limitations his love throughout brought him restlessness and torment rather than peace and comfort  towards the end of july he went to shanklin and there in collaboration with brown wrote a play otho the great brown tells us how they used to sit one on either side of a table he sketching out the scenes and handing each one as the outline was finished to keats to write as keats never knew what was coming it was quite impossible that the characters should be adequately conceived or that the drama should be a united whole nevertheless there is much that is beautiful and promising in it it should not be forgotten that keatss greatest ambition was in his own words the writing of a few fine plays and with the increasing humanity and grasp which his poetry shows there is no reason to suppose that had he lived he would not have fulfilled it  at shanklin moreover he had begun to write lamia and he continued it at winchester here he stayed until the middle of october excepting a few days which he spent in london to arrange about the sending of some money to his brother in america george had been unsuccessful in his commercial enterprises and keats in view of his familys illsuccess determined temporarily to abandon poetry and by reviewing or journalism to support himself and earn money to help his brother then when he could afford it he would return to poetry  accordingly he came back to london but his health was breaking down and with it his resolution he tried to rewrite hyperion which he felt had been written too much under the influence of milton and in the artists humour the same independence of spirit which he had shown in the publication of endymion urged him now to abandon a work the style of which he did not feel to be absolutely his own the recast he wrote in the form of a vision calling it the fall of hyperion and in so doing he added much to his conception of the meaning of the story in no poem does he show more of the profoundly philosophic spirit which characterizes many of his letters but it was too late his power was failing and in spite of the beauty and interest of some of his additions the alterations are mostly for the worse  whilst the fall of hyperion occupied his evenings his mornings were spent over a satirical fairypoem the cap and bells in the metre of the faerie queene this metre however was illsuited to the subject satire was not natural to him and the poem has little intrinsic merit  neither this nor the recast of hyperion was finished when in february 1820 he had an attack of illness in which the first definite symptom of consumption appeared brown tells how he came home on the evening of thursday february 3rd in a state of high fever chilled from having ridden outside the coach on a bitterly cold day he mildly and instantly yielded to my request that he should go to bed    on entering the cold sheets before his head was on the pillow he slightly coughed and i heard him saythat is blood from my mouth i went towards him he was examining a single drop of blood upon the sheet bring me the candle brown and let me see this blood after regarding it steadfastly he looked up in my face with a calmness of expression that i can never forget and said i know the colour of that bloodit is arterial blood i cannot be deceived in that colour that drop of blood is my death warranti must die  he lived for another year but it was one long dying he himself called it his posthumous life  keats was one of the most charming of letterwriters he had that rare quality of entering sympathetically into the mind of the friend to whom he was writing so that his letters reveal to us much of the character of the recipient as well as of the writer in the long journalletters which he wrote to his brother and sisterinlaw in america he is probably most fully himself for there he is with the people who knew him best and on whose understanding and sympathy he could rely but in none is the beauty of his character more fully revealed than in those to his little sister fanny now seventeen years old and living with their guardian mr abbey he had always been very anxious that they should become intimately acquainted in order as he says that i may not only as you grow up love you as my only sister but confide in you as my dearest friend in his most harassing times he continued to write to her directing her reading sympathizing in her childish troubles and constantly thinking of little presents to please her her health was to him a matter of paramount concern and in his last letters to her we find him reiterating warnings to take care of herselfyou must be careful always to wear warm clothing not only in frost but in a thawbe careful to let no fretting injure your health as i have suffered ithealth is the greatest of blessingswith health and hope we should be content to live and so you will find as you grow older the constant recurrence of this thought becomes in the light of his own sufferings almost unbearably pathetic  during the first months of his illness keats saw through the press his last volume of poetry of which this is a reprint the praise which it received from reviewers and public was in marked contrast to the scornful reception of his earlier works and would have augured well for the future but keats was past caring much for poetic fame he dragged on through the summer with rallies and relapses tormented above all by the thought that death would separate him from the woman he loved only brown of all his friends knew what he was suffering and it seems that he only knew fully after they were parted  the doctors warned keats that a winter in england would kill him so in september 1820 he left london for naples accompanied by a young artist joseph severn one of his many devoted friends shelley who knew him slightly invited him to stay at pisa but keats refused he had never cared for shelley though shelley seems to have liked him and in his invalid state he naturally shrank from being a burden to a mere acquaintance  it was as they left england off the coast of dorsetshire that keats wrote his last beautiful sonnet on a blank leaf of his folio copy of shakespeare facing a lovers complaint       bright star would i were steadfast as thou art      not in lone splendour hung aloft the night      and watching with eternal lids apart      like natures patient sleepless eremite      the moving waters at their priestlike task      of pure ablution round earths human shores      or gazing on the new softfallen mask      of snow upon the mountains and the moors      noyet still steadfast still unchangeable      pillowd upon my fair loves ripening breast      to feel for ever its soft fall and swell      awake for ever in a sweet unrest      still still to hear her tender taken breath      and so live everor else swoon to death  the friends reached rome and there keats after a brief rally rapidly became worse severn nursed him with desperate devotion and of keatss sweet considerateness and patience he could never say enough indeed such was the force and lovableness of keatss personality that though severn lived fiftyeight years longer it was for the rest of his life a chief occupation to write and draw his memories of his friend  on february 23rd 1821 came the end for which keats had begun to long he died peacefully in severns arms on the 26th he was buried in the beautiful little protestant cemetery of which shelley said that it made one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place  great indignation was felt at the time by those who attributed his death in part at least to the cruel treatment which he had received from the critics shelley in adonais withered them with his scorn and byron in don juan had his gibe both at the poet and at his enemies but we know now how mistaken they were keats in a normal state of mind and body was never unduly depressed by harsh or unfair criticism praise or blame he wrote has but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic on his own works and this attitude he consistently maintained throughout his poetic career no doubt the sense that his genius was unappreciated added something to the torment of mind which he suffered in rome and on his deathbed he asked that on his tombstone should be inscribed the words here lies one whose name was writ in water but it was apparently not said in bitterness and the rest of the inscriptionxxiii1 expresses rather the natural anger of his friends at the treatment he had received than the mental attitude of the poet himself  fully to understand him we must read his poetry with the commentary of his letters which reveal in his character elements of humour clearsighted wisdom frankness strength sympathy and tolerance so doing we shall enter into the mind and heart of the friend who speaking for many described keats as one whose genius i did not and do not more fully admire than i entirely loved the man   footnotes  xiii1 many of the words which the reviewers thought to be coined were good elizabethan  xxiii1 this grave contains all that was mortal of a young english poet who on his death bed in the bitterness of his heart at the malicious power of his enemies desired these words to be engraven on his tomb stone here lies one whose name was writ in water feb 24th 1821     lamia  isabella  the eve of st agnes  and  other poems   by john keats author of endymion   london printed for taylor and hessey fleetstreet 1820     advertisement   if any apology be thought necessary for the appearance of the unfinished poem of hyperion the publishers beg to state that they alone are responsible as it was printed at their particular request and contrary to the wish of the author the poem was intended to have been of equal length with endymion but the reception given to that work discouraged the author from proceeding    fleetstreet june 26 1820     lamia   part i    upon a time before the faery broods   drove nymph and satyr from the prosperous woods   before king oberons bright diadem   sceptre and mantle claspd with dewy gem   frighted away the dryads and the fauns   from rushes green and brakes and cowslipd lawns   the eversmitten hermes empty left   his golden throne bent warm on amorous theft   from high olympus had he stolen light   on this side of joves clouds to escape the sight           10   of his great summoner and made retreat   into a forest on the shores of crete   for somewhere in that sacred island dwelt   a nymph to whom all hoofed satyrs knelt   at whose white feet the languid tritons poured   pearls while on land they witherd and adored   fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont   and in those meads where sometime she might haunt   were strewn rich gifts unknown to any muse   though fancys casket were unlockd to choose               20   ah what a world of love was at her feet   so hermes thought and a celestial heat   burnt from his winged heels to either ear   that from a whiteness as the lily clear   blushd into roses mid his golden hair   fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare   from vale to vale from wood to wood he flew   breathing upon the flowers his passion new   and wound with many a river to its head   to find where this sweet nymph prepard her secret bed      30   in vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found   and so he rested on the lonely ground   pensive and full of painful jealousies   of the woodgods and even the very trees   there as he stood he heard a mournful voice   such as once heard in gentle heart destroys   all pain but pity thus the lone voice spake   when from this wreathed tomb shall i awake   when move in a sweet body fit for life   and love and pleasure and the ruddy strife                 40   of hearts and lips ah miserable me   the god dovefooted glided silently   round bush and tree softbrushing in his speed   the taller grasses and fullflowering weed   until he found a palpitating snake   bright and cirquecouchant in a dusky brake      she was a gordian shape of dazzling hue   vermilionspotted golden green and blue   striped like a zebra freckled like a pard   eyed like a peacock and all crimson barrd                 50   and full of silver moons that as she breathed   dissolvd or brighter shone or interwreathed   their lustres with the gloomier tapestries   so rainbowsided touchd with miseries   she seemd at once some penanced lady elf   some demons mistress or the demons self   upon her crest she wore a wannish fire   sprinkled with stars like ariadnes tiar   her head was serpent but ah bittersweet   she had a womans mouth with all its pearls complete        60   and for her eyes what could such eyes do there   but weep and weep that they were born so fair   as proserpine still weeps for her sicilian air   her throat was serpent but the words she spake   came as through bubbling honey for loves sake   and thus while hermes on his pinions lay   like a stoopd falcon ere he takes his prey      fair hermes crownd with feathers fluttering light   i had a splendid dream of thee last night   i saw thee sitting on a throne of gold                     70   among the gods upon olympus old   the only sad one for thou didst not hear   the soft lutefingerd muses chaunting clear   nor even apollo when he sang alone   deaf to his throbbing throats long long melodious moan   i dreamt i saw thee robed in purple flakes   break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks   and swiftly as a bright phoebean dart   strike for the cretan isle and here thou art   too gentle hermes hast thou found the maid                80   whereat the star of lethe not delayd   his rosy eloquence and thus inquired   thou smoothlippd serpent surely high inspired   thou

again the brilliance feminine   too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine   free as the air invisibly she strays   about these thornless wilds her pleasant days   she tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet   leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet   from weary tendrils and bowd branches green   she plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen   and by my power is her beauty veild                        100   to keep it unaffronted unassaild   by the loveglances of unlovely eyes   of satyrs fauns and bleard silenus sighs   pale grew her immortality for woe   of all these lovers and she grieved so   i took compassion on her bade her steep   her hair in weird syrops that would keep   her loveliness invisible yet free   to wander as she loves in liberty   thou shalt behold her hermes thou alone                  110   if thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon   then once again the charmed god began   an oath and through the serpents ears it ran   warm tremulous devout psalterian   ravishd she lifted her circean head   blushd a live damask and swiftlisping said   i was a woman let me have once more   a womans shape and charming as before   i love a youth of corintho the bliss   give me my womans form and place me where he is          120   stoop hermes let me breathe upon thy brow   and thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now   the god on halfshut feathers sank serene   she breathd upon his eyes and swift was seen   of both the guarded nymph nearsmiling on the green   it was no dream or say a dream it was   real are the dreams of gods and smoothly pass   their pleasures

serpent and with languid arm   delicate put to proof the lythe caducean charm   so done upon the nymph his eyes he bent   full of adoring tears and blandishment   and towards her stept she like a moon in wane   faded before him cowerd nor could restrain   her fearful sobs selffolding like a flower   that faints into itself at evening hour   but the god fostering her chilled hand                     140   she felt the warmth her eyelids opend bland   and like new flowers at morning song of bees   bloomd and gave up her honey to the lees   into the greenrecessed woods they flew   nor grew they

fled lamia now a lady bright   a fullborn beauty new and exquisite   she fled into that valley they pass oer   who go to corinth from cenchreas shore   and rested at the foot of those wild hills   the rugged founts of the peræan rills   and of that other ridge whose barren back   stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack   southwestward to cleone there she stood   about a young birds flutter from a wood                   180   fair on a sloping green of mossy tread   by a clear pool wherein she passioned   to see herself escapd from so sore ills   while her robes flaunted with the daffodils      ah happy lyciusfor she was a maid   more beautiful than ever twisted braid   or sighd or blushd or on springflowered lea   spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy   a virgin purest lippd yet in the

their points of contact and swift counterchange   intrigue with the specious chaos and dispart   its most ambiguous atoms with sure art   as though in cupids college she had spent   sweet days a lovely graduate still unshent   and kept his rosy terms in idle languishment      why this fair creature chose so fairily                   200   by the wayside to linger we shall see   but first tis fit to tell how she could muse   and dream when in the serpent prisonhouse   of all she list strange or magnificent   how ever where she willd her spirit went   whether to faint elysium or where   down through tresslifting waves the nereids fair   wind into thetis bower by many a pearly stair   or where god bacchus drains his cups divine   stretchd out at ease beneath a glutinous pine           210   or where in plutos gardens palatine   mulcibers columns gleam in far piazzian line   and sometimes into cities she would send   her dream with feast and rioting to blend   and once while among mortals dreaming thus   she saw the young corinthian lycius   charioting foremost in the envious race   like a young jove with calm uneager face   and fell into a swooning love of him   now on the mothtime of that evening dim                    220   he would return that way as well she knew   to corinth from the shore for freshly blew   the eastern soft wind and his galley now   grated the quaystones with her brazen prow   in port cenchreas from egina isle   fresh anchord whither he had been awhile   to sacrifice to jove whose temple there   waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare   jove heard his vows and betterd his desire   for by some freakful chance he made retire                  230   from his companions and set forth to walk   perhaps grown wearied of their corinth talk   over the solitary hills he fared   thoughtless at first but ere eves star appeared   his phantasy was lost where reason fades   in the calmd twilight of platonic shades   lamia beheld him coming near more near   close to her passing in indifference drear   his silent sandals swept the mossy green   so neighbourd to him and yet so unseen                    240   she stood he passd shut up in mysteries   his mind wrappd like his mantle while her eyes   followd his steps and her neck regal white   turndsyllabling thus ah lycius bright   and will you leave me on the hills alone   lycius look back and be some pity shown   he did not with cold wonder fearingly   but orpheuslike at an eurydice   for so delicious were the words she sung   it seemd he had lovd them a whole summer long            250   and soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up   leaving no drop in the bewildering cup   and still the cup was fullwhile he afraid   lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid   due adoration thus began to adore   her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure   leave thee alone look back ah goddess see   whether my eyes can ever turn from thee   for pity do not this sad heart belie   even as thou vanishest so i shall die                      260   stay though a naiad of the rivers stay   to thy far wishes will thy streams obey   stay though the greenest woods be thy domain   alone they can drink up the morning rain   though a descended pleiad will not one   of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune   thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine   so sweetly to these ravishd ears of mine   came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade   thy memory will waste me to a shade                      270   for pity do not meltif i should stay   said lamia here upon this floor of clay   and pain my steps upon these flowers too rough   what canst thou say or do of charm enough   to dull the nice remembrance of my home   thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam   over these hills and vales where no joy is   empty of immortality and bliss   thou art a scholar lycius and must know   that finer spirits cannot breathe below                     280   in human climes and live alas poor youth   what taste of purer air hast thou to soothe   my essence what serener palaces   where i may all my many senses please   and by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease   it cannot beadieu so said she rose   tiptoe with white arms spread he sick to lose   the amorous promise of her lone complain   swoond murmuring of love and pale with pain   the cruel lady without any show                            290   of sorrow for her tender favourites woe   but rather if her eyes could brighter be   with brighter eyes and slow amenity   put her new lips to his and gave afresh   the life she had so tangled in her mesh   and as he from one trance was wakening   into another she began to sing   happy in beauty life and love and every thing   a song of love too sweet for earthly lyres   while like held breath the stars drew in their panting       fires                                                  300   and then she whisperd in such trembling tone   as those who safe together met alone   for the first time through many anguishd days   use other speech than looks bidding him raise   his drooping head and clear his soul of doubt   for that she was a woman and without   any more subtle fluid in her veins   than throbbing blood and that the selfsame pains   inhabited her frailstrung heart as his   and next she wonderd how his eyes could miss               310   her face so long in corinth where she said   she dwelt but half retird and there had led   days happy as the gold coin could invent   without the aid of love yet in content   till she saw him as once she passd him by   where gainst a column he leant thoughtfully   at venus temple porch mid baskets heapd   of amorous herbs and flowers newly reapd   late on that eve as twas the night before   the adonian feast whereof she saw no more                 320   but wept alone those days for why should she adore   lycius from death awoke into amaze   to see her still and singing so sweet lays   then from amaze into delight he fell   to hear her whisper womans lore so well   and every word she spake enticd him on   to unperplexd delight and pleasure known   let the mad poets say whateer they please   of the sweets of fairies peris goddesses   there is not such a treat among them all                   330   haunters of cavern lake and waterfall   as a real woman lineal indeed   from pyrrhas pebbles or old adams seed   thus gentle lamia judgd and judgd aright   that lycius could not love in half a fright   so threw the goddess off and won his heart   more pleasantly by playing womans part   with no more awe than what her beauty gave   that while it smote still guaranteed to save   lycius to all made eloquent reply                          340   marrying to every

 to a few paces not at all surmised   by blinded lycius so in her comprized   they passd the city gates he knew not how   so noiseless and he never thought to know      as men talk in a dream so

their moving shadows on the walls   or found them clusterd in the corniced shade               360   of some archd temple door or dusky colonnade      muffling his face of greeting friends in fear   her fingers he pressd hard as one came near   with curld gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown   slowsteppd and robed in philosophic gown   lycius shrank closer as they met and past   into his

slumberous tenderness     which when he heard that minute did he bless     and breathd himself then from the closet crept     noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness                   250     and over the hushd carpet silent stept   and tween the curtains peepd where lohow fast she       slept    xxix      then by the bedside where the faded moon     made a dim silver twilight soft he set     a

joined hands and piteous eye   fearing to move or speak she lookd so dreamingly    xxxv      ah porphyro said she but even now     thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear     made tuneable with

stone   still as the silence round about his lair   forest on forest hung about his head   like cloud on cloud no stir of air was there   not so much life as on a summers day   robs not one light seed from the featherd grass   but where the dead leaf fell there did it rest             10   a stream went voiceless by still deadened more   by reason of his fallen divinity   spreading a shade the naiad mid her reeds   pressd her cold finger closer to her lips      along the marginsand large footmarks went   no further than to where his feet had strayd   and slept there since upon the sodden ground   his old right hand lay nerveless listless dead   unsceptred and his realmless eyes were closed   while his bowd head seemd listning to the earth          20   his ancient mother for some comfort yet      it seemd no force could wake him from his place   but there came one who with a kindred hand   touchd his wide shoulders after bending low   with reverence though to one who knew it not   she was a goddess of the infant world   by her in stature the tall amazon   had stood a pigmys height she would have taen   achilles by the hair and bent his neck   or with a finger stayd ixions wheel                       30   her face was large as that of memphian sphinx   pedestald haply in a palace court   when sages lookd to egypt for their lore   but oh how unlike marble was that face   how beautiful if sorrow had not made   sorrow more beautiful than beautys self   there was a listening fear in her regard   as if calamity had but begun   as if the vanward clouds of evil days   had spent their malice and the sullen rear                  40   was with its stored thunder labouring up   one hand she pressd upon that aching spot   where beats the human heart as if just there   though an immortal she felt cruel pain   the other upon saturns bended neck   she laid and to the level of his ear   leaning with parted lips some words she spake   in solemn tenour and deep organ tone   some mourning words which in our feeble tongue   would come in these like accents o how frail                50   to that large utterance of the early gods   saturn look upthough wherefore poor old king   i have no comfort for thee no not one   i cannot say o wherefore sleepest thou   for heaven is parted from thee and the earth   knows thee not thus afflicted for a god   and ocean too with all its solemn noise   has from thy sceptre passd and all the air   is emptied of thine hoary majesty   thy thunder conscious of the new command                   60   rumbles reluctant oer our fallen house   and thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands   scorches and burns our once serene domain   o aching time o moments big as years   all as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth   and press it so

dream all night without a stir   save from one gradual solitary gust   which comes upon the silence and dies off   as if the ebbing air had but one wave   so came these words and went the while in tears   she touchd her fair large forehead to the ground           80   just where her falling hair might be outspread   a soft and silken mat for saturns feet   one moon with alteration slow had shed   her silver seasons four upon the night   and still these two were postured motionless   like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern   the frozen god still couchant on the earth   and the sad goddess weeping at his feet   until at length old saturn lifted up   his faded eyes and saw his kingdom gone                    90   and all the gloom and sorrow of the place   and that fair kneeling goddess and then spake   as with a palsied tongue and while his beard   shook horrid with such aspenmalady   o tender spouse of gold hyperion   thea i feel thee ere i see thy face   look up and let me see our doom in it   look up and tell me if this feeble shape   is saturns tell me if thou hearst the voice   of saturn tell me if this wrinkling brow                 100   naked and bare of its great diadem

 for as among us mortals omens drear   fright and perplex so also shuddered he                  170   not at dogs howl or gloombirds hated screech   or the familiar visiting of one   upon the first toll of his passingbell   or prophesyings of the midnight lamp   but horrors portiond to a giant nerve   oft made hyperion ache his palace bright   bastiond with pyramids of glowing gold   and touchd with shade of bronzed obelisks   glard a bloodred through all its thousand courts   arches and domes and fiery galleries                     180   and all its curtains of aurorian clouds   flushd angerly while sometimes eagles wings   unseen before by gods or wondering men   darkend the place and neighing steeds were heard   not heard before by gods or wondering men   also when he would taste the spicy wreaths   of incense breathd aloft from sacred hills   instead of sweets his ample palate took   savour of poisonous brass and metal sick   and so when harbourd in the sleepy west                  190   after the full completion of fair day   for rest divine upon exalted couch   and slumber in the arms of melody   he pacd away the pleasant hours of ease   with stride colossal on from hall to hall   while far within each aisle and deep recess   his winged minions in close clusters stood   amazd and full of fear like anxious men   who on wide plains gather in panting troops   when earthquakes jar their battlements and towers          200   even now while saturn rousd from icy trance   went step for step with thea through the woods   hyperion leaving twilight in the rear   came slope upon the threshold of the west   then as was wont his palacedoor flew ope   in smoothest silence save what solemn tubes   blown by the serious zephyrs gave of sweet   and wandering sounds slowbreathed melodies   and like a rose in vermeil tint and shape   in fragrance soft and coolness to the eye                 210   that inlet to severe magnificence   stood full blown for the god to enter in      he enterd but he enterd full of wrath   his flaming robes streamd out beyond his heels   and gave a roar as if of earthly fire   that scard away the meek ethereal hours   and made their dovewings tremble on he flared   from stately nave to nave from vault to vault   through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light   and diamondpaved lustrous long arcades                    220   until he reachd the great main cupola   there standing fierce beneath he stampt his foot   and from the basements deep to the high towers   jarrd his own golden region and before   the quavering thunder thereupon had ceasd   his voice leapt out despite of godlike curb   to this result o dreams of day and night   o monstrous forms o effigies of pain   o spectres busy in a cold cold gloom   o lankeared

 for as in theatres of crowded men   hubbub increases more they call out hush   so at hyperions words the phantoms pale   bestirrd themselves thrice horrible and cold   and from the mirrord level where he stood   a mist arose as from a scummy marsh   at this through all his bulk an agony   crept gradual from the feet unto the crown                260   like a lithe serpent vast and muscular   making slow way with head and neck convulsd   from overstrained might releasd he fled   to the eastern gates and full six dewy hours   before the dawn in season due should blush   he breathd fierce breath against the sleepy portals   cleard them of heavy vapours burst them wide   suddenly on the oceans chilly streams   the planet orb of fire whereon he rode   each day from east to west the heavens through             270   spun round in sable curtaining of clouds   not therefore veiled quite blindfold and hid   but ever and anon the glancing spheres   circles and arcs and broadbelting

 where a sweet clime was breathed from a land   of fragrance quietness and trees and flowers   full of calm joy it was as i of grief   too full of joy and soft delicious warmth   so that i felt a movement in my heart   to chide and to reproach that solitude   with songs of misery music of our woes   and sat me down and took a mouthed shell                   270   and murmurd into it and made melody   o melody no more for while i sang   and with poor skill let pass into the breeze   the dull shells echo from a bowery strand   just opposite an island of the sea   there came enchantment with the shifting wind   that did both drown and keep alive my ears   i threw my shell away upon the sand   and a wave filld it as my sense was filld   with that new blissful golden melody                       280   a living death was in each gush of sounds   each family of rapturous hurried notes   that fell one after one yet all at once   like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string   and then another then another strain   each like a dove leaving its olive perch   with music wingd instead of silent plumes   to hover round my head and make me sick   of joy and grief at once grief overcame   and i was stopping up my frantic ears                      290   when past all hindrance of my trembling hands   a voice came sweeter sweeter than all tune   and still it cried apollo young apollo

in the heroic couplet but the difference in style is very marked the influence of drydens narrativepoems his translations from boccaccio and chaucer is clearly traceable in the metre style and construction of the later poem like dryden keats now makes frequent use of the alexandrine or 6foot line and of the triplet he has also restrained the exuberance of his language and gained force whilst in imaginative power and felicity of diction he surpasses anything of which dryden was capable the flaws in his style are mainly due to carelessness in the rimes and some questionable coining of words he also occasionally lapses into the vulgarity and triviality which marred certain of his early poems  the best he gained from his study of drydens fables a debt perhaps to chaucer rather than to dryden was a notable advance in constructive power in lamia he shows a very much greater sense of proportion and power of selection than in his earlier work there is as it were more light and shade  thus we find that whenever the occasion demands it his style rises to supreme force and beauty the metamorphosis of the serpent the entry of lamia and lycius into corinth the building by lamia of the fairy hall and her final withering under the eye of apolloniusthese are the most important points in the story and the passages in which they are described are also the most striking in the poem  the allegorical meaning of the story seems to be that it is fatal to attempt to separate the sensuous and emotional life from the life of reason philosophy alone is cold and destructive but the pleasures of the senses alone are unreal and unsatisfying the man who attempts such a divorce between the two parts of his nature will fail miserably as did lycius who unable permanently to exclude reason was compelled to face the death of his illusions and could not himself survive them  of the poem keats himself says writing to his brother in september 1819 i have been reading over a part of a short poem i have composed lately called lamia and i am certain there is that sort of fire in it that must take hold of people some way give them either pleasant or unpleasant sensationwhat they want is a sensation of some sort but to the greatest of keatss critics charles lamb the poem appealed somewhat differently for he writes more exuberantly rich in imagery and painting than isabella is the story of lamia it is of as gorgeous stuff as ever romance was composed of and after enumerating the most striking pictures in the poem he adds these are all that fairyland can do for us lamia struck

introduction to isabella and the eve of st agnes  in lamia and hyperion as in endymion we find keats inspired by classic story though the inspiration in each case came to him through elizabethan writers here on the other hand mediaeval legend is his inspiration the faery broods have driven nymph and satyr from the prosperous woods akin to the greeks as he was in spirit in his instinctive personification of the lovely manifestations of nature his style and method were really more naturally suited to the portrayal of mediaeval scenes where he found the richness and warmth of colour in which his soul delighted  the story of isabella he took from boccaccio an italian writer of the fourteenth century whose decameron a collection of one hundred stories has been a storehouse of plots for english writers by boccaccio the tale is very shortly and simply told being evidently interesting to him mainly for its plot keats was attracted to it not so much by the action as by the passion involved so that his enlargement of it means little elaboration of incident but very much more dwelling on the psychological aspect that is to say he does not care so much what happens as what the personages of the poem think and feel  thus we see that the main incident of the story the murder of lorenzo is passed over in a linethus was lorenzo slain and buried in the next line there in that forest did his great love cease bringing us back at once from the physical reality of the murder to the thought of his love which is to keats the central fact of the story  in the delineation of isabella her first tender passion of love her agony of apprehension giving way to dull despair her sudden wakening to a brief period of frenzied action described in stanzas of incomparable dramatic force and the peace which followed when she       forgot the stars the moon the sun      and she forgot the blue above the trees      and she forgot the dells where waters run      and she forgot the chilly autumn breeze      she had no knowledge when the day was done      and the new morn she saw not  culminating in the piteous death too lone and incompletein the delineation of all this keats shows supreme power and insight  in the conception too of the tragic loneliness of lorenzos ghost we feel that nothing could be changed added or taken away  not quite equally happy are the descriptions of the cruel brothers and of lorenzo as the young lover there is a tendency to exaggerate both their inhumanity and his gentleness for purposes of contrast which weakens where it would give strength  the eve of st agnes founded on a popular mediaeval legend not being a tragedy like isabella cannot be expected to rival it in depth and intensity but in every other poetic quality it equals where it does not surpass the former poem  to be specially noted is the skilful use which keats here makes of contrastbetween the cruel cold without and the warm love within the palsied age of the bedesman and angela and the eager youth of porphyro and madeline the noise and revel and the hush of madelines bedroom and as mr colvin has pointed out in the moonlight which chill and sepulchral when it strikes elsewhere to madeline is as a halo of glory an angelic light  a mysterious charm is given to the poem by the way in which keats endows inanimate things with a sort of halfconscious life the knights and ladies of stone arouse the bedesmans shuddering sympathy when he thinks of the cold they must be enduring the carven angels stard eagereyed from the roof of the chapel and the scutcheon in madelines window blushd with blood of queens and kings  keatss characteristic method of descriptionthe way in which by his masterly choice of significant detail he gives us the whole feeling of the situation is here seen in its perfection in stanza 1 each line is a picture and each picture contributes to the whole effect of painful chill the silence of the sheep the old mans breath visible in the frosty airthese are things which many people would not notice but it is such little things that make the whole scene real to us  there is another method of description quite as beautiful in its way which coleridge adopted with magic effect in christabel this is to use the power of suggestion to say very little but that little of a kind to awaken the readers imagination and make him complete the picture for example we are told of christabel       her gentle limbs did she undress      and lay down in her loveliness  compare this with stanza xxvi of the eve of st agnes  that keats was a master of both ways of obtaining a romantic effect is shown by his la belle dame sans merci considered by some people his masterpiece where the rich detail of the eve of st agnes is replaced by reserve and suggestion  as the poem was not included in the volume published in 1820 it is given here       la belle dame sans merci       oh what can ail thee knight at arms        alone and palely loitering      the sedge has withered from the lake        and no birds sing       oh what can ail thee knight at arms        so haggard and so woe begone      the squirrels granary is full        and the harvests done       i see a lily on thy brow        with anguish moist and fever dew      and on thy cheeks a fading rose        fast withereth too       i met a lady in the meads        full beautiful a faerys child      her hair was long her foot was light        and her eyes were wild       i made a garland for her head        and bracelets too and fragrant zone      she lookd at me as she did love        and made sweet moan       i set her on my pacing steed        and nothing else saw all day long      for sidelong would she bend and sing        a faerys song       she found me roots of relish sweet        and honey wild and manna dew      and sure in language strange she said        i love thee true       she took me to her elfin grot        and there she wept and sighd full sore      and there i shut her wild wild eyes        with kisses four       and there she lulled me asleep        and there i dreamd ah woe betide      the latest dream i ever dreamt        on the cold hill side       i saw pale kings and princes too        pale warriors death pale were they all      they cried la belle dame sans merci        thee hath in thrall       i saw their starvd lips in the gloam        with horrid warning gaped wide      and i awoke and found me here        on the cold hills side       and this is why i sojourn here        alone and palely loitering

between the old the poor and the joyless and the young the rich and the happy   introduction to the ode to a nightingale ode on a grecian urn ode on melancholy and to autumn  these four odes which were all written in 1819 the first three in the early months of that year ought to be considered together since the same strain of thought runs through them all and taken all together they seem to sum up keatss philosophy  in all of them the poet looks upon life as it is and the eternal principle of beauty in the first three seeing them in sharp contrast in the last reconciling them and leaving us content  the firstwritten of the four the ode to a nightingale is the most passionately human and personal of them all for keats wrote it soon after the death of his brother tom whom he had loved devotedly and himself nursed to the end he was feeling keenly the tragedy of a world where youth grows pale and spectrethin and dies and the song of the nightingale heard in a friends garden at hampstead made him long to escape with it from this world of realities and sorrows to the world of ideal beauty which it seemed to him somehow to stand for and suggest he did not think of the nightingale as an individual bird but of its song which had been beautiful for centuries and would continue to be beautiful long after his generation had passed away and the thought of this undying loveliness he contrasted bitterly with our feverishly sad and short life when by the power of imagination he had left the world behind him and was absorbed in the vision of beauty roused by the birds song he longed for death rather than a return to disillusionment  so in the grecian urn he contrasts unsatisfying human life with art which is everlastingly beautiful the figures on the vase lack one thing onlyrealitywhilst on the other hand they are happy in not being subject to trouble change or death the thought is sad yet keats closes this ode triumphantly not as in the nightingale on a note of disappointment the beauty of this greek sculpture truly felt teaches us that beauty at any rate is real and lasting and that utter belief in beauty is the one thing needful in life  in the ode on melancholy keats in a more bitter mood finds the presence in a fleeting world of eternal beauty the source of the deepest melancholy to encourage your melancholy mood he tells us do not look on the things counted sad but on the most beautiful which are only quicklyfading manifestations of the everlasting principle of beauty it is then when a man most deeply loves the beautiful when he uses his capacities of joy to the utmost that the full bitterness of the contrast between the real and the ideal comes home to him and crushes him if he did not feel so much he would not suffer so much if he loved beauty less he would care less that he could not hold it long  but in the ode to autumn keats attains to the serenity he has been seeking in this unparalleled description of a richly beautiful autumn day he conveys to us all the peace and comfort which his spirit receives he does not philosophize upon the spectacle or draw a moral from it but he shows us how in nature beauty is ever present to the momentary regret for spring he replies with praise of the present hour concluding with an exquisite description of the sounds of autumnits music as beautiful as that of spring hitherto he has lamented the insecurity of a mans hold upon the beautiful though he has never doubted the reality of beauty and the worth of its worship to man now under the influence of nature he intuitively knows that beauty once seen and grasped is mans possession for ever he is in much the same position that wordsworth was when he declared that                      nature never did betray      the heart that loved her tis her privilege      through all the years of this our life to lead      from joy to joy for she can so inform      the mind that is within us so impress      with quietness and beauty and so feed      with lofty thoughts that neither evil tongues      rash judgments nor the sneers of selfish men      nor greetings where no kindness is nor all      the dreary intercourse of daily life      shall eer prevail against us or disturb      our cheerful faith that all which we behold      is full of blessings  this was not the last poem that keats wrote but it was the last which he wrote in the fulness of his powers we can scarcely help wishing that beautiful as were some of the productions of his last feverish year of life this perfect ode expressing so serene and untroubled a mood might have been his last word to the world   notes on the ode to a nightingale  in the early months of 1819 keats was living with his friend brown at hampstead wentworth place in april a nightingale built her nest in the garden and brown writes keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast table to the grassplot under a plum where he sat for two or three hours when he came into the house i perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books on inquiry i found those scraps four or five in number contained his poetic feeling on the song of our nightingale the writing was not well legible and it was difficult to arrange the stanza on so many scraps with his assistance i succeeded and

the more richly for it and will i hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit you must recollect that psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of apuleius the platonist who lived after the augustan age and consequently the goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour and perhaps never thought of in the old religioni am more orthodox than to let a heathen goddess be so neglected the ode to psyche follows  the story of psyche may be best told in the words of william morris in the argument to the story of cupid and psyche in his earthly paradise       psyche a kings daughter by her exceeding beauty caused the      people to forget venus therefore the goddess would fain have      destroyed her nevertheless she became the bride of love yet      in an unhappy moment lost him by her own fault and wandering      through the world suffered many evils at the hands of venus      for whom she must accomplish fearful tasks but the gods and      all nature helped her and in process of time she was      reunited to love forgiven by venus and made immortal by the      father of gods and men  psyche

introduction to fancy  this poem although so much lighter in spirit bears a certain relation in thought to keatss other odes in the nightingale the tragedy of this life made him long to escape on the wings of imagination to the ideal world of beauty symbolized by the song of the bird here finding all real things even the most beautiful pall upon him he extols the fancy which can escape from reality and is not tied by place or season in its search for new joys this is of course only a passing mood as the extempore character of the poetry indicates we see more of settled conviction in the deeplymeditative ode to autumn where he finds the ideal in the rich and everchanging real  this poem is written in the fouraccent metre employed by milton in lallegro and il penseroso and we can often

introduction to hyperion  this poem deals with the overthrow of the primaeval order of gods by jupiter son of saturn the old king there are many versions of the fable in greek mythology and there are many sources from which it may have come to keats at school he is said to have known the classical dictionary by heart but his inspiration is more likely to have been due to his later reading of the elizabethan poets and their translations of classic story one thing is certain that he did not confine himself to any one authority nor did he consider it necessary to be circumscribed by authorities at all he used rather than followed the greek fable dealing freely with it and giving it his own interpretation  the situation when the poem opens is as followssaturn king of the gods has been driven from olympus down into a deep dell by his son jupiter who has seized and used his fathers weapon the thunderbolt a similar fate has overtaken nearly all his brethren who are called by keats titans and giants indiscriminately though in greek mythology the two races are quite distinct these titans are the children of tellus and coelus the earth and sky thus representing as it were the first birth of form and personality from formless nature before the separation of earth and sky chaos a confusion of the elements of all things had reigned supreme one only of the titans hyperion the sungod still keeps his kingdom and he is about to be superseded by young apollo the god of light and song  in the second book we hear oceanus and clymene his daughter tell how both were defeated not by battle or violence but by the irresistible beauty of their dispossessors and from this oceanus deduces the eternal law that first in beauty should be first in might he recalls the fact that saturn himself was not the first ruler but received his kingdom from his parents the earth and sky and he prophesies that progress will continue in the overthrow of jove by a yet brighter and better order enceladus is however furious at what he considers a cowardly acceptance of their fate and urges his brethren to resist  in book i we saw hyperion though still a god distressed by portents and now in book iii we see the rise to divinity of his successor the young apollo the poem breaks off short at the moment of apollos metamorphosis and how keats intended to complete it we can never know  it is certain that he originally meant to write an epic in ten books and the publishers remark2451 at the beginning of the 1820 volume would lead us to think that he was in the same mind when he wrote the poem this statement however must be altogether discounted as keats in his copy of the poems crossed it right out and wrote above i had no part in this i was ill at the time  moreover the last sentence from but to proceeding he bracketed writing below this is a lie  this together with other evidence external and internal has led dr de sélincourt to the conclusion that keats had modified his plan and when he was writing the poem intended to conclude it in four books of the probable contents of the oneandhalf unwritten books mr de sélincourt writes i conceive that apollo now conscious of his divinity would have gone to olympus heard from the lips of jove of his newlyacquired supremacy and been called upon by the rebel three to secure the kingdom that awaited him he would have gone forth to meet hyperion who struck by the power of supreme beauty would have found resistance impossible critics have inclined to take for granted the supposition that an actual battle was contemplated by keats but i do not believe that such was at least his final intention in the first place he had the example of milton whom he was studying very closely to warn him of its dangers in the second if hyperion had been meant to fight he would hardly be represented as already before the battle shorn of much of his strength thus making the victory of apollo depend upon his enemys unnatural weakness and not upon his own strength one may add that a combat would have been completely alien to the whole idea of the poem as keats conceived it and as in fact it is universally interpreted from the speech of oceanus in the second book the resistance of enceladus and the giants themselves rebels against an order already established would have been dealt with summarily and the poem would have closed with a description of the new age which had been inaugurated by the triumph of the olympians and in particular of apollo the god of light and song  the central idea then of the poem is that the new age triumphs over the old by virtue of its acknowledged superioritythat intellectual supremacy makes physical force feel its power and yield dignity and moral conquest lies for the conquered in the capacity to recognize the truth and look upon the inevitable undismayed  keats broke the poem off because it was too miltonic and it is easy to see what he meant not only does the treatment of the subject recall that of paradise lost the council of the fallen gods bearing special resemblance to that of the fallen angels in book ii of miltons epic but in its style and syntax the influence of milton is everywhere apparent it is to be seen in the restraint and concentration of the language which is in marked contrast to the wordiness of keatss early work as well as in the constant use of classical constructions2471 miltonic inversions2472 and repetitions2473 and in occasional reminiscences of actual lines and phrases in paradise lost2474  in hyperion we see too the influence of the study of greek sculpture upon keatss mind and art this study had taught him that the highest beauty is not incompatible with definiteness of form and clearness of detail to his romantic appreciation of mystery was now added an equal sense of the importance of simplicity form and proportion these being from its nature inevitable characteristics of the art of sculpture so we see that again and again the figures described in hyperion are like great statuesclearcut massive and motionless such are the pictures of saturn and thea in book i and of each of the group of titans at the opening of book ii  striking too is keatss very greek identification of the gods with the powers of nature which they represent it is this attitude of mind which has led some peopleshelley and landor among themto declare keats in spite of his ignorance of the language the most truly greek of all english poets very beautiful instances of this are the sunset and sunrise in book i when the departure of the sungod and his return to earth are so described that the pictures we see are of an evening and morning sky an angry sunset and a grey and misty dawn  but neither miltonic nor greek is keatss marvellous treatment of nature as he feels and makes us feel the magic of its mystery in such a picture as that of the                                 tall oaks      branchcharmèd by the earnest stars  or of the
