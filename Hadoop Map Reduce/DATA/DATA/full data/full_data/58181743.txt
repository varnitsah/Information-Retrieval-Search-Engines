58181743	the snow image   by  nathaniel hawthorne    contents    the snow image a childish miracle   the great stone face   ethan brand   the canterbury pilgrims   the devil in manuscript   my kinsman major molineux      the snowimage  a childish miracle  one afternoon of a cold winters day when the sun shone forth with chilly brightness after a long storm two children asked leave of their mother to run out and play in the newfallen snow the elder child was a little girl whom because she was of a tender and modest disposition and was thought to be very beautiful her parents and other people who were familiar with her used to call violet but her brother was known by the style and title of peony on account of the ruddiness of his broad and round little phiz which made everybody think of sunshine and great scarlet flowers the father of these two children a certain mr lindsey it is important to say was an excellent but exceedingly matteroffact sort of man a dealer in hardware and was sturdily accustomed to take what is called the commonsense view of all matters that came under his consideration with a heart about as tender as other peoples he had a head as hard and impenetrable and therefore perhaps as empty as one of the iron pots which it was a part of his business to sell the mothers character on the other hand had a strain of poetry in it a trait of unworldly beautya delicate and dewy flower as it were that had survived out of her imaginative youth and still kept itself alive amid the dusty realities of matrimony and motherhood  so violet and peony as i began with saying besought their mother to let them run out and play in the new snow for though it had looked so dreary and dismal drifting downward out of the gray sky it had a very cheerful aspect now that the sun was shining on it the children dwelt in a city and had no wider playplace than a little garden before the house divided by a white fence from the street and with a peartree and two or three plumtrees overshadowing it and some rosebushes just in front of the parlorwindows the trees and shrubs however were now leafless and their twigs were enveloped in the light snow which thus made a kind of wintry foliage with here and there a pendent icicle for the fruit  yes violetyes my little peony said their kind mother you may go out and play in the new snow  accordingly the good lady bundled up her darlings in woollen jackets and wadded sacks and put comforters round their necks and a pair of striped gaiters on each little pair of legs and worsted mittens on their hands and gave them a kiss apiece by way of a spell to keep away jack frost forth sallied the two children with a hopskipandjump that carried them at once into the very heart of a huge snowdrift whence violet emerged like a snowbunting while little peony floundered out with his round face in full bloom then what a merry time had they to look at them frolicking in the wintry garden you would have thought that the dark and pitiless storm had been sent for no other purpose but to provide a new plaything for violet and peony and that they themselves had beer created as the snowbirds were to take delight only in the tempest and in the white mantle which it spread over the earth  at last when they had frosted one another all over with handfuls of snow violet after laughing heartily at little peonys figure was struck with a new idea  you look exactly like a snowimage peony said she if your cheeks were not so red and that puts me in mind let us make an image out of snowan image of a little girland it shall be our sister and shall run about and play with us all winter long wont it be nice  oh yes cried peony as plainly as he could speak for he was but a little boy that will be nice and mamma shall see it  yes answered violet mamma shall see the new little girl but she must not make her come into the warm parlor for you know our little snowsister will not love the warmth  and forthwith the children began this great business of making a snowimage that should run about while their mother who was sitting at the window and overheard some of their talk could not help smiling at the gravity with which they set about it they really seemed to imagine that there would be no difficulty whatever in creating a live little girl out of the snow and to say the truth if miracles are ever to be wrought it will be by putting our hands to the work in precisely such a simple and undoubting frame of mind as that in which violet and peony now undertook to perform one without so much as knowing that it was a miracle so thought the mother and thought likewise that the new snow just fallen from heaven would be excellent material to make new beings of if it were not so very cold she gazed at the children a moment longer delighting to watch their little figuresthe girl tall for her age graceful and agile and so delicately colored that she looked like a cheerful thought more than a physical reality while peony expanded in breadth rather than height and rolled along on his short and sturdy legs as substantial as an elephant though not quite so big then the mother resumed her work what it was i forget but she was either trimming a silken bonnet for violet or darning a pair of stockings for little peonys short legs again however and again and yet other agains she could not help turning her head to the window to see how the children got on with their snowimage  indeed it was an exceedingly pleasant sight those bright little souls at their task moreover it was really wonderful to observe how knowingly and skilfully they managed the matter violet assumed the chief direction and told peony what to do while with her own delicate fingers she shaped out all the nicer parts of the snowfigure it seemed in fact not so much to be made by the children as to grow up under their hands while they were playing and prattling about it their mother was quite surprised at this and the longer she looked the more and more surprised she grew  what remarkable children mine are thought she smiling with a mothers pride and smiling at herself too for being so proud of them what other children could have made anything so like a little girls figure out of snow at the first trial well but now i must finish peonys new frock for his grandfather is coming tomorrow and i want the little fellow to look handsome  so she took up the frock and was soon as busily at work again with her needle as the two children with their snowimage but still as the needle travelled hither and thither through the seams of the dress the mother made her toil light and happy by listening to the airy voices of violet and peony they kept talking to one another all the time their tongues being quite as active as their feet and hands except at intervals she could not distinctly hear what was said but had merely a sweet impression that they were in a most loving mood and were enjoying themselves highly and that the business of making the snowimage went prosperously on now and then however when violet and peony happened to raise their voices the words were as audible as if they had been spoken in the very parlor where the mother sat oh how delightfully those words echoed in her heart even though they meant nothing so very wise or wonderful after all  but you must know a mother listens with her heart much more than with her ears and thus she is often delighted with the trills of celestial music when other people can hear nothing of the kind  peony peony cried violet to her brother who had gone to another part of the garden bring me some of that fresh snow peony from the very farthest corner where we have not been trampling i want it to shape our little snowsisters bosom with you know that part must be quite pure just as it came out of the sky  here it is violet answered peony in his bluff tonebut a very sweet tone tooas he came floundering through the halftrodden drifts here is the snow for her little bosom o violet how beautiful she begins to look  yes said violet thoughtfully and quietly our snowsister does look very lovely i did not quite know peony that we could make such a sweet little girl as this  the mother as she listened thought how fit and delightful an incident it would be if fairies or still better if angelchildren were to come from paradise and play invisibly with her own darlings and help them to make their snowimage giving it the features of celestial babyhood violet and peony would not be aware of their immortal playmatesonly they would see that the image grew very beautiful while they worked at it and would think that they themselves had done it all  my little girl and boy deserve such playmates if mortal children ever did said the mother to herself and then she smiled again at her own motherly pride  nevertheless the idea seized upon her imagination and ever and anon she took a glimpse out of the window half dreaming that she might see the goldenhaired children of paradise sporting with her own goldenhaired violet and brightcheeked peony  now for a few moments there was a busy and earnest but indistinct hum of the two childrens voices as violet and peony wrought together with one happy consent violet still seemed to be the guiding spirit while peony acted rather as a laborer and brought her the snow from far and near and yet the little urchin evidently had a proper understanding of the matter too  peony peony cried violet for her brother was again at the other side of the garden bring me those light wreaths of snow that have rested on the lower branches of the peartree you can clamber on the snowdrift peony and reach them easily i must have them to make some ringlets for our snowsisters head  here they are violet answered the little boy take care you do not break them well done well done how pretty  does she not look sweetly said violet with a very satisfied tone and now we must have some little shining bits of ice to make the brightness of her eyes she is not finished yet mamma will see how very beautiful she is but papa will say tush nonsensecome in out of the cold  let us call mamma to look out said peony and then he shouted lustily mamma mamma mamma look out and see what a nice ittle girl we are making  the mother put down her work for an instant and looked out of the window but it so happened that the sunfor this was one of the shortest days of the whole yearhad sunken so nearly to the edge of the world that his setting shine came obliquely into the ladys eyes so she was dazzled you must understand and could not very distinctly observe what was in the garden still however through all that bright blinding dazzle of the sun and the new snow she beheld a small white figure in the garden that seemed to have a wonderful deal of human likeness about it and she saw violet and peonyindeed she looked more at them than at the imageshe saw the two children still at work peony bringing fresh snow and violet applying it to the figure as scientifically as a sculptor adds clay to his model indistinctly as she discerned the snowchild the mother thought to herself that never before was there a snowfigure so cunningly made nor ever such a dear little girl and boy to make it  they do everything better than other children said she very complacently no wonder they make better snowimages  she sat down again to her work and made as much haste with it as possible because twilight would soon come and peonys frock was not yet finished and grandfather was expected by railroad pretty early in the morning faster and faster therefore went her flying fingers the children likewise kept busily at work in the garden and still the mother listened whenever she could catch a word she was amused to observe how their little imaginations had got mixed up with what they were doing and carried away by it they seemed positively to think that the snowchild would run about and play with them  what a nice playmate she will be for us all winter long said violet i hope papa will not be afraid of her giving us a cold shant you love her dearly peony  oh yes cried peony and i will hug her and she shall sit down close by me and drink some of my warm milk  oh no peony answered violet with grave wisdom that will not do at all warm milk will not be wholesome for our little snowsister little snow people like her eat nothing but icicles no no peony we must not give her anything warm to drink  there was a minute or two of silence for peony whose short legs were never weary had gone on a pilgrimage again to the other side of the garden all of a sudden violet cried out loudly and joyfullylook here peony come quickly a light has been shining on her cheek out of that rosecolored cloud and the color does not go away is not that beautiful  yes it is beautiful answered peony pronouncing the three syllables with deliberate accuracy o violet only look at her hair it is all like gold  oh certainly said violet with tranquillity as if it were very much a matter of course that color you know comes from the golden clouds that we see up there in the sky she is almost finished now but her lips must be made very redredder than her cheeks perhaps peony it will make them red if we both kiss them  accordingly the mother heard two smart little smacks as if both her children were kissing the snowimage on its frozen mouth but as this did not seem to make the lips quite red enough violet next proposed that the snowchild should be invited to kiss peonys scarlet cheek  come ittle snowsister kiss me cried peony  there she has kissed you added violet and now her lips are very red and she blushed a little too  oh what a cold kiss cried peony  just then there came a breeze of the pure westwind sweeping through the garden and rattling the parlorwindows it sounded so wintry cold that the mother was about to tap on the windowpane with her thimbled finger to summon the two children in when they both cried out to her with one voice the tone was not a tone of surprise although they were evidently a good deal excited it appeared rather as if they were very much rejoiced at some event that had now happened but which they had been looking for and had reckoned upon all along  mamma mamma we have finished our little snowsister and she is running about the garden with us  what imaginative little beings my children are thought the mother putting the last few stitches into peonys frock and it is strange too that they make me almost as much a child as they themselves are i can hardly help believing now that the snowimage has really come to life  dear mamma cried violet pray look out and see what a sweet playmate we have  the mother being thus entreated could no longer delay to look forth from the window the sun was now gone out of the sky leaving however a rich inheritance of his brightness among those purple and golden clouds which make the sunsets of winter so magnificent but there was not the slightest gleam or dazzle either on the window or on the snow so that the good lady could look all over the garden and see everything and everybody in it and what do you think she saw there violet and peony of course her own two darling children ah but whom or what did she see besides why if you will believe me there was a small figure of a girl dressed all in white with rosetinged cheeks and ringlets of golden hue playing about the garden with the two children a stranger though she was the child seemed to be on as familiar terms with violet and peony and they with her as if all the three had been playmates during the whole of their little lives the mother thought to herself that it must certainly be the daughter of one of the neighbors and that seeing violet and peony in the garden the child had run across the street to play with them so this kind lady went to the door intending to invite the little runaway into her comfortable parlor for now that the sunshine was withdrawn the atmosphere out of doors was already growing very cold  but after opening the housedoor she stood an instant on the threshold hesitating whether she ought to ask the child to come in or whether she should even speak to her indeed she almost doubted whether it were a real child after all or only a light wreath of the newfallen snow blown hither and thither about the garden by the intensely cold westwind there was certainly something very singular in the aspect of the little stranger among all the children of the neighborhood the lady could remember no such face with its pure white and delicate rosecolor and the golden ringlets tossing about the forehead and cheeks and as for her dress which was entirely of white and fluttering in the breeze it was such as no reasonable woman would put upon a little girl when sending her out to play in the depth of winter it made this kind and careful mother shiver only to look at those small feet with nothing in the world on them except a very thin pair of white slippers nevertheless airily as she was clad the child seemed to feel not the slightest inconvenience from the cold but danced so lightly over the snow that the tips of her toes left hardly a print in its surface while violet could but just keep pace with her and peonys short legs compelled him to lag behind  once in the course of their play the strange child placed herself between violet and peony and taking a hand of each skipped merrily forward and they along with her almost immediately however peony pulled away his little fist and began to rub it as if the fingers were tingling with cold while violet also released herself though with less abruptness gravely remarking that it was better not to take hold of hands the whiterobed damsel said not a word but danced about just as merrily as before if violet and peony did not choose to play with her she could make just as good a playmate of the brisk and cold westwind which kept blowing her all about the garden and took such liberties with her that they seemed to have been friends for a long time all this while the mother stood on the threshold wondering how a little girl could look so much like a flying snowdrift or how a snowdrift could look so very like a little girl  she called violet and whispered to her  violet my darling what is this childs name asked she does she live near us  why dearest mamma answered violet laughing to think that her mother did not comprehend so very plain an affair this is our little snowsister whom we have just been making  yes dear mamma cried peony running to his mother and looking up simply into her face this is our snowimage is it not a nice ittle child  at this instant a flock of snowbirds came flitting through the air as was very natural they avoided violet and peony butand this looked strangethey flew at once to the whiterobed child fluttered eagerly about her head alighted on her shoulders and seemed to claim her as an old acquaintance she on her part was evidently as glad to see these little birds old winters grandchildren as they were to see her and welcomed them by holding out both her hands hereupon they each and all tried to alight on her two palms and ten small fingers and thumbs crowding one another off with an immense fluttering of their tiny wings one dear little bird nestled tenderly in her bosom another put its bill to her lips they were as joyous all the while and seemed as much in their element as you may have seen them when sporting with a snowstorm  violet and peony stood laughing at this pretty sight for they enjoyed the merry time which their new playmate was having with these smallwinged visitants almost as much as if they themselves took part in it  violet said her mother greatly perplexed tell me the truth without any jest who is this little girl  my darling mamma answered violet looking seriously into her mothers face and apparently surprised that she should need any further explanation i have told you truly who she is it is our little snowimage which peony and i have been making peony will tell you so as well as i  yes mamma asseverated peony with much gravity in his crimson little phiz this is ittle snowchild is not she a nice one but mamma her hand is oh so very cold  while mamma still hesitated what to think and what to do the streetgate was thrown open and the father of violet and peony appeared wrapped in a pilotcloth sack with a fur cap drawn down over his ears and the thickest of gloves upon his hands mr lindsey was a middleaged man with a weary and yet a happy look in his windflushed and frostpinched face as if he had been busy all the day long and was glad to get back to his quiet home his eyes brightened at the sight of his wife and children although he could not help uttering a word or two of surprise at finding the whole family in the open air on so bleak a day and after sunset too he soon perceived the little white stranger sporting to and fro in the garden like a dancing snowwreath and the flock of snowbirds fluttering about her head  pray what little girl may that be inquired this very sensible man surely her mother must be crazy to let her go out in such bitter weather as it has been today with only that flimsy white gown and those thin slippers  my dear husband said his wife i know no more about the little thing than you do some neighbors child i suppose our violet and peony she added laughing at herself for repeating so absurd a story insist that she is nothing but a snowimage which they have been busy about in the garden almost all the afternoon  as she said this the mother glanced her eyes toward the spot where the childrens snowimage had been made what was her surprise on perceiving that there was not the slightest trace of so much laborno image at allno piled up heap of snownothing whatever save the prints of little footsteps around a vacant space  this is very strange said she  what is strange dear mother asked violet dear father do not you see how it is this is our snowimage which peony and i have made because we wanted another playmate did not we peony  yes papa said crimson peony this be our ittle snowsister is she not beautiful but she gave me such a cold kiss  poh nonsense children cried their good honest father who as we have already intimated had an exceedingly commonsensible way of looking at matters do not tell me of making live figures out of snow come wife this little stranger must not stay out in the bleak air a moment longer we will bring her into the parlor and you shall give her a supper of warm bread and milk and make her as comfortable as you can meanwhile i will inquire among the neighbors or if necessary send the citycrier about the streets to give notice of a lost child  so saying this honest and very kindhearted man was going toward the little white damsel with the best intentions in the world but violet and peony each seizing their father by the hand earnestly besought him not to make her come in  dear father cried violet putting herself before him it is true what i have been telling you this is our little snowgirl and she cannot live any longer than while she breathes the cold westwind do not make her come into the hot room  yes father shouted peony stamping his little foot so mightily was he in earnest this be nothing but our ittle snowchild she will not love the hot fire  nonsense children nonsense nonsense cried the father half vexed half laughing at what he considered their foolish obstinacy run into the house this moment it is too late to play any longer now i must take care of this little girl immediately or she will catch her deathacold  husband dear husband said his wife in a low voicefor she had been looking narrowly at the snowchild and was more perplexed than everthere is something very singular in all this you will think me foolishbutbutmay it not be that some invisible angel has been attracted by the simplicity and good faith with which our children set about their undertaking may he not have spent an hour of his immortality in playing with those dear little souls and so the result is what we call a miracle no no do not laugh at me i see what a foolish thought it is  my dear wife replied the husband laughing heartily you are as much a child as violet and peony  and in one sense so she was for all through life she had kept her heart full of childlike simplicity and faith which was as pure and clear as crystal and looking at all matters through this transparent medium she sometimes saw truths so profound that other people laughed at them as nonsense and absurdity  but now kind mr lindsey had entered the garden breaking away from his two children who still sent their shrill voices after him beseeching him to let the snowchild stay and enjoy herself in the cold westwind as he approached the snowbirds took to flight the little white damsel also fled backward shaking her head as if to say pray do not touch me and roguishly as it appeared leading him through the deepest of the snow once the good man stumbled and floundered down upon his face so that gathering himself up again with the snow sticking to his rough pilotcloth sack he looked as white and wintry as a snowimage of the largest size some of the neighbors meanwhile seeing him from their windows wondered what could possess poor mr lindsey to be running about his garden in pursuit of a snowdrift which the westwind was driving hither and thither at length after a vast deal of trouble he chased the little stranger into a corner where she could not possibly escape him his wife had been looking on and it being nearly twilight was wonderstruck to observe how the snowchild gleamed and sparkled and how she seemed to shed a glow all round about her and when driven into the corner she positively glistened like a star it was a frosty kind of brightness too like that of an icicle in the moonlight the wife thought it strange that good mr lindsey should see nothing remarkable in the snowchilds appearance  come you odd little thing cried the honest man seizing her by the hand i have caught you at last and will make you comfortable in spite of yourself we will put a nice warm pair of worsted stockings on your frozen little feet and you shall have a good thick shawl to wrap yourself in your poor white nose i am afraid is actually frostbitten but we will make it all right come along in  and so with a most benevolent smile on his sagacious visage all purple as it was with the cold this very wellmeaning gentleman took the snowchild by the hand and led her towards the house she followed him droopingly and reluctant for all the glow and sparkle was gone out of her figure and whereas just before she had resembled a bright frosty stargemmed evening with a crimson gleam on the cold horizon she now looked as dull and languid as a thaw as kind mr lindsey led her up the steps of the door violet and peony looked into his facetheir eyes full of tears which froze before they could run down their cheeksand again entreated him not to bring their snowimage into the house  not bring her in exclaimed the kindhearted man why you are crazy my little violetquite crazy my small peony she is so cold already that her hand has almost frozen mine in spite of my thick gloves would you have her freeze to death  his wife as he came up the steps had been taking another long earnest almost awestricken gaze at the little white stranger she hardly knew whether it was a dream or no but she could not help fancying that she saw the delicate print of violets fingers on the childs neck it looked just as if while violet was shaping out the image she had given it a gentle pat with her hand and had neglected to smooth the impression quite away  after all husband said the mother recurring to her idea that the angels would be as much delighted to play with violet and peony as she herself wasafter all she does look strangely like a snowimage i do believe she is made of snow  a puff of the westwind blew against the snowchild and again she sparkled like a star  snow repeated good mr lindsey drawing the reluctant guest over his hospitable threshold no wonder she looks like snow she is half frozen poor little thing but a good fire will put everything to rights  without further talk and always with the same best intentions this highly benevolent and commonsensible individual led the little white damseldrooping drooping drooping more and more out of the frosty air and into his comfortable parlor a heidenberg stove filled to the brim with intensely burning anthracite was sending a bright gleam through the isinglass of its iron door and causing the vase of water on its top to fume and bubble with excitement a warm sultry smell was diffused throughout the room a thermometer on the wall farthest from the stove stood at eighty degrees the parlor was hung with red curtains and covered with a red carpet and looked just as warm as it felt the difference betwixt the atmosphere here and the cold wintry twilight out of doors was like stepping at once from nova zembla to the hottest part of india or from the north pole into an oven oh this was a fine place for the little white stranger  the commonsensible man placed the snowchild on the hearthrug right in front of the hissing and fuming stove  now she will be comfortable cried mr lindsey rubbing his hands and looking about him with the pleasantest smile you ever saw make yourself at home my child  sad sad and drooping looked the little white maiden as she stood on the hearthrug with the hot blast of the stove striking through her like a pestilence once she threw a glance wistfully toward the windows and caught a glimpse through its red curtains of the snowcovered roofs and the stars glimmering frostily and all the delicious intensity of the cold night the bleak wind rattled the windowpanes as if it were summoning her to come forth but there stood the snowchild drooping before the hot stove  but the commonsensible man saw nothing amiss  come wife said he let her have a pair of thick stockings and a woollen shawl or blanket directly and tell dora to give her some warm supper as soon as the milk boils you violet and peony amuse your little friend she is out of spirits you see at finding herself in a strange place for my part i will go around among the neighbors and find out where she belongs  the mother meanwhile had gone in search of the shawl and stockings for her own view of the matter however subtle and delicate had given way as it always did to the stubborn materialism of her husband without heeding the remonstrances of his two children who still kept murmuring that their little snowsister did not love the warmth good mr lindsey took his departure shutting the parlordoor carefully behind him turning up the collar of his sack over his ears he emerged from the house and had barely reached the streetgate when he was recalled by the screams of violet and peony and the rapping of a thimbled finger against the parlor window  husband husband cried his wife showing her horrorstricken face through the windowpanes there is no need of going for the childs parents  we told you so father screamed violet and peony as he reentered the parlor you would bring her in and now our poordearbeautiful little snowsister is thawed  and their own sweet little faces were already dissolved in tears so that their father seeing what strange things occasionally happen in this everyday world felt not a little anxious lest his children might be going to thaw too in the utmost perplexity he demanded an explanation of his wife she could only reply that being summoned to the parlor by the cries of violet and peony she found no trace of the little white maiden unless it were the remains of a heap of snow which while she was gazing at it melted quite away upon the hearthrug  and there you see all that is left of it added she pointing to a pool of water in front of the stove  yes father said violet looking reproachfully at him through her tears there is all that is left of our dear little snowsister  naughty father cried peony stamping his foot andi shudder to sayshaking his little fist at the commonsensible man we told you how it would be what for did you bring her in  and the heidenberg stove through the isinglass of its door seemed to glare at good mr lindsey like a redeyed demon triumphing in the mischief which it had done  this you will observe was one of those rare cases which yet will occasionally happen where commonsense finds itself at fault the remarkable story of the snowimage though to that sagacious class of people to whom good mr lindsey belongs it may seem but a childish affair is nevertheless capable of being moralized in various methods greatly for their edification one of its lessons for instance might be that it behooves men and especially men of benevolence to consider well what they are about and before acting on their philanthropic purposes to be quite sure that they comprehend the nature and all the relations of the business in hand what has been established as an element of good to one being may prove absolute mischief to another even as the warmth of the parlor was proper enough for children of flesh and blood like violet and peonythough by no means very wholesome even for thembut involved nothing short of annihilation to the unfortunate snowimage  but after all there is no teaching anything to wise men of good mr lindseys stamp they know everythingoh to be sureeverything that has been and everything that is and everything that by any future possibility can be and should some phenomenon of nature or providence transcend their system they will not recognize it even if it come to pass under their very noses  wife said mr lindsey after a fit of silence see what a quantity of snow the children have brought in on their feet it has made quite a puddle here before the stove pray tell dora to bring some towels and mop it up    the great stone face  one afternoon when the sun was going down a mother and her little boy sat at the door of their cottage talking about the great stone face they had but to lift their eyes and there it was plainly to be seen though miles away with the sunshine brightening all its features  and what was the great stone face  embosomed amongst a family of lofty mountains there was a valley so spacious that it contained many thousand inhabitants some of these good people dwelt in loghuts with the black forest all around them on the steep and difficult hillsides others had their homes in comfortable farmhouses and cultivated the rich soil on the gentle slopes or level surfaces of the valley others again were congregated into populous villages where some wild highland rivulet tumbling down from its birthplace in the upper mountain region had been caught and tamed by human cunning and compelled to turn the machinery of cottonfactories the inhabitants of this valley in short were numerous and of many modes of life but all of them grown people and children had a kind of familiarity with the great stone face although some possessed the gift of distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many of their neighbors  the great stone face then was a work of nature in her mood of majestic playfulness formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rocks which had been thrown together in such a position as when viewed at a proper distance precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance it seemed as if an enormous giant or a titan had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice there was the broad arch of the forehead a hundred feet in height the nose with its long bridge and the vast lips which if they could have spoken would have rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the other true it is that if the spectator approached too near he lost the outline of the gigantic visage and could discern only a heap of ponderous and gigantic rocks piled in chaotic ruin one upon another retracing his steps however the wondrous features would again be seen and the farther he withdrew from them the more like a human face with all its original divinity intact did they appear until as it grew dim in the distance with the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains clustering about it the great stone face seemed positively to be alive  it was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or womanhood with the great stone face before their eyes for all the features were noble and the expression was at once grand and sweet as if it were the glow of a vast warm heart that embraced all mankind in its affections and had room for more it was an education only to look at it according to the belief of many people the valley owed much of its fertility to this benign aspect that was continually beaming over it illuminating the clouds and infusing its tenderness into the sunshine  as we began with saying a mother and her little boy sat at their cottagedoor gazing at the great stone face and talking about it the childs name was ernest  mother said he while the titanic visage smiled on him i wish that it could speak for it looks so very kindly that its voice must needs be pleasant if i were to see a man with such a face i should love him dearly  if an old prophecy should come to pass answered his mother we may see a man some time or other with exactly such a face as that  what prophecy do you mean dear mother eagerly inquired ernest pray tell me about it  so his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her when she herself was younger than little ernest a story not of things that were past but of what was yet to come a story nevertheless so very old that even the indians who formerly inhabited this valley had heard it from their forefathers to whom as they affirmed it had been murmured by the mountain streams and whispered by the wind among the treetops the purport was that at some future day a child should be born hereabouts who was destined to become the greatest and noblest personage of his time and whose countenance in manhood should bear an exact resemblance to the great stone face not a few oldfashioned people and young ones likewise in the ardor of their hopes still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy but others who had seen more of the world had watched and waited till they were weary and had beheld no man with such a face nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale at all events the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared  o mother dear mother cried ernest clapping his hands above his head i do hope that i shall live to see him  his mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman and felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy so she only said to him perhaps you may  and ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him it was always in his mind whenever he looked upon the great stone face he spent his childhood in the logcottage where he was born and was dutiful to his mother and helpful to her in many things assisting her much with his little hands and more with his loving heart in this manner from a happy yet often pensive child he grew up to be a mild quiet unobtrusive boy and sunbrowned with labor in the fields but with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have been taught at famous schools yet ernest had had no teacher save only that the great stone face became one to him when the toil of the day was over he would gaze at it for hours until he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him and gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement responsive to his own look of veneration we must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake although the face may have looked no more kindly at ernest than at all the world besides but the secret was that the boys tender and confiding simplicity discerned what other people could not see and thus the love which was meant for all became his peculiar portion  about this time there went a rumor throughout the valley that the great man foretold from ages long ago who was to bear a resemblance to the great stone face had appeared at last it seems that many years before a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a distant seaport where after getting together a little money he had set up as a shopkeeper his namebut i could never learn whether it was his real one or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success in lifewas gathergold being shrewd and active and endowed by providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what the world calls luck he became an exceedingly rich merchant and owner of a whole fleet of bulkybottomed ships all the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one mans wealth the cold regions of the north almost within the gloom and shadow of the arctic circle sent him their tribute in the shape of furs hot africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great elephants out of the forests the east came bringing him the rich shawls and spices and teas and the effulgence of diamonds and the gleaming purity of large pearls the ocean not to be behindhand with the earth yielded up her mighty whales that mr gathergold might sell their oil and make a profit of it be the original commodity what it might it was gold within his grasp it might be said of him as of midas in the fable that whatever he touched with his finger immediately glistened and grew yellow and was changed at once into sterling metal or which suited him still better into piles of coin and when mr gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years only to count his wealth he bethought himself of his native valley and resolved to go back thither and end his days where he was born with this purpose in view he sent a skilful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to live in  as i have said above it had already been rumored in the valley that mr gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly looked for and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable similitude of the great stone face people were the more ready to believe that this must needs be the fact when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose as if by enchantment on the site of his fathers old weatherbeaten farmhouse the exterior was of marble so dazzlingly white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine like those humbler ones which mr gathergold in his young playdays before his fingers were gifted with the touch of transmutation had been accustomed to build of snow it had a richly ornamented portico supported by tall pillars beneath which was a lofty door studded with silver knobs and made of a kind of variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the sea the windows from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment were composed respectively of but one enormous pane of glass so transparently pure that it was said to be a finer medium than even the vacant atmosphere hardly anybody had been permitted to see the interior of this palace but it was reported and with good semblance of truth to be far more gorgeous than the outside insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in other houses was silver or gold in this and mr gathergolds bedchamber especially made such a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would have been able to close his eyes there but on the other hand mr gathergold was now so inured to wealth that perhaps he could not have closed his eyes unless where the gleam of it was certain to find its way beneath his eyelids  in due time the mansion was finished next came the upholsterers with magnificent furniture then a whole troop of black and white servants the harbingers of mr gathergold who in his own majestic person was expected to arrive at sunset our friend ernest meanwhile had been deeply stirred by the idea that the great man the noble man the man of prophecy after so many ages of delay was at length to be made manifest to his native valley he knew boy as he was that there were a thousand ways in which mr gathergold with his vast wealth might transform himself into an angel of beneficence and assume a control over human affairs as wide and benignant as the smile of the great stone face full of faith and hope ernest doubted not that what the people said was true and that now he was to behold the living likeness of those wondrous features on the mountainside while the boy was still gazing up the valley and fancying as he always did that the great stone face returned his gaze and looked kindly at him the rumbling of wheels was heard approaching swiftly along the winding road  here he comes cried a group of people who were assembled to witness the arrival here comes the great mr gathergold  a carriage drawn by four horses dashed round the turn of the road within it thrust partly out of the window appeared the physiognomy of the old man with a skin as yellow as if his own midashand had transmuted it he had a low forehead small sharp eyes puckered about with innumerable wrinkles and very thin lips which he made still thinner by pressing them forcibly together  the very image of the great stone face shouted the people sure enough the old prophecy is true and here we have the great man come at last  and what greatly perplexed ernest they seemed actually to believe that here was the likeness which they spoke of by the roadside there chanced to be an old beggarwoman and two little beggarchildren stragglers from some faroff region who as the carriage rolled onward held out their hands and lifted up their doleful voices most piteously beseeching charity a yellow clawthe very same that had clawed together so much wealthpoked itself out of the coachwindow and dropt some copper coins upon the ground so that though the great mans name seems to have been gathergold he might just as suitably have been nicknamed scattercopper still nevertheless with an earnest shout and evidently with as much good faith as ever the people bellowed he is the very image of the great stone face  but ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that sordid visage and gazed up the valley where amid a gathering mist gilded by the last sunbeams he could still distinguish those glorious features which had impressed themselves into his soul their aspect cheered him what did the benign lips seem to say  he will come fear not ernest the man will come  the years went on and ernest ceased to be a boy he had grown to be a young man now he attracted little notice from the other inhabitants of the valley for they saw nothing remarkable in his way of life save that when the labor of the day was over he still loved to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the great stone face according to their idea of the matter it was a folly indeed but pardonable inasmuch as ernest was industrious kind and neighborly and neglected no duty for the sake of indulging this idle habit they knew not that the great stone face had become a teacher to him and that the sentiment which was expressed in it would enlarge the young mans heart and fill it with wider and deeper sympathies than other hearts they knew not that thence would come a better wisdom than could be learned from books and a better life than could be moulded on the defaced example of other human lives neither did ernest know that the thoughts and affections which came to him so naturally in the fields and at the fireside and wherever he communed with himself were of a higher tone than those which all men shared with him a simple soulsimple as when his mother first taught him the old prophecyhe beheld the marvellous features beaming adown the valley and still wondered that their human counterpart was so long in making his appearance  by this time poor mr gathergold was dead and buried and the oddest part of the matter was that his wealth which was the body and spirit of his existence had disappeared before his death leaving nothing of him but a living skeleton covered over with a wrinkled yellow skin since the melting away of his gold it had been very generally conceded that there was no such striking resemblance after all betwixt the ignoble features of the ruined merchant and that majestic face upon the mountainside so the people ceased to honor him during his lifetime and quietly consigned him to forgetfulness after his decease once in a while it is true his memory was brought up in connection with the magnificent palace which he had built and which had long ago been turned into a hotel for the accommodation of strangers multitudes of whom came every summer to visit that famous natural curiosity the great stone face thus mr gathergold being discredited and thrown into the shade the man of prophecy was yet to come  it so happened that a nativeborn son of the valley many years before had enlisted as a soldier and after a great deal of hard fighting had now become an illustrious commander whatever he may be called in history he was known in camps and on the battlefield under the nickname of old bloodandthunder this warworn veteran being now infirm with age and wounds and weary of the turmoil of a military life and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet that had so long been ringing in his ears had lately signified a purpose of returning to his native valley hoping to find repose where he remembered to have left it the inhabitants his old neighbors and their grownup children were resolved to welcome the renowned warrior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner and all the more enthusiastically it being affirmed that now at last the likeness of the great stone face had actually appeared an aiddecamp of old bloodandthunder travelling through the valley was said to have been struck with the resemblance moreover the schoolmates and early acquaintances of the general were ready to testify on oath that to the best of their recollection the aforesaid general had been exceedingly like the majestic image even when a boy only the idea had never occurred to them at that period great therefore was the excitement throughout the valley and many people who had never once thought of glancing at the great stone face for years before now spent their time in gazing at it for the sake of knowing exactly how general bloodandthunder looked  on the day of the great festival ernest with all the other people of the valley left their work and proceeded to the spot where the sylvan banquet was prepared as he approached the loud voice of the rev dr battleblast was heard beseeching a blessing on the good things set before them and on the distinguished friend of peace in whose honor they were assembled the tables were arranged in a cleared space of the woods shut in by the surrounding trees except where a vista opened eastward and afforded a distant view of the great stone face over the generals chair which was a relic from the home of washington there was an arch of verdant boughs with the laurel profusely intermixed and surmounted by his countrys banner beneath which he had won his victories our friend ernest raised himself on his tiptoes in hopes to get a glimpse of the celebrated guest but there was a mighty crowd about the tables anxious to hear the toasts and speeches and to catch any word that might fall from the general in reply and a volunteer company doing duty as a guard pricked ruthlessly with their bayonets at any particularly quiet person among the throng so ernest being of an unobtrusive character was thrust quite into the background where he could see no more of old bloodandthunders physiognomy than if it had been still blazing on the battlefield to console himself he turned towards the great stone face which like a faithful and long remembered friend looked back and smiled upon him through the vista of the forest meantime however he could overhear the remarks of various individuals who were comparing the features of the hero with the face on the distant mountainside  tis the same face to a hair cried one man cutting a caper for joy  wonderfully like thats a fact responded another  like why i call it old bloodandthunder himself in a monstrous lookingglass cried a third and why not hes the greatest man of this or any other age beyond a doubt  and then all three of the speakers gave a great shout which communicated electricity to the crowd and called forth a roar from a thousand voices that went reverberating for miles among the mountains until you might have supposed that the great stone face had poured its thunderbreath into the cry all these comments and this vast enthusiasm served the more to interest our friend nor did he think of questioning that now at length the mountainvisage had found its human counterpart it is true ernest had imagined that this longlookedfor personage would appear in the character of a man of peace uttering wisdom and doing good and making people happy but taking an habitual breadth of view with all his simplicity he contended that providence should choose its own method of blessing mankind and could conceive that this great end might be effected even by a warrior and a bloody sword should inscrutable wisdom see fit to order matters so  the general the general was now the cry hush silence old bloodandthunders going to make a speech  even so for the cloth being removed the generals health had been drunk amid shouts of applause and he now stood upon his feet to thank the company ernest saw him there he was over the shoulders of the crowd from the two glittering epaulets and embroidered collar upward beneath the arch of green boughs with intertwined laurel and the banner drooping as if to shade his brow and there too visible in the same glance through the vista of the forest appeared the great stone face and was there indeed such a resemblance as the crowd had testified alas ernest could not recognize it he beheld a warworn and weatherbeaten countenance full of energy and expressive of an iron will but the gentle wisdom the deep broad tender sympathies were altogether wanting in old bloodandthunders visage and even if the great stone face had assumed his look of stern command the milder traits would still have tempered it  this is not the man of prophecy sighed ernest to himself as he made his way out of the throng and must the world wait longer yet  the mists had congregated about the distant mountainside and there were seen the grand and awful features of the great stone face awful but benignant as if a mighty angel were sitting among the hills and enrobing himself in a cloudvesture of gold and purple as he looked ernest could hardly believe but that a smile beamed over the whole visage with a radiance still brightening although without motion of the lips it was probably the effect of the western sunshine melting through the thinly diffused vapors that had swept between him and the object that he gazed at butas it always didthe aspect of his marvellous friend made ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain  fear not ernest said his heart even as if the great face were whispering himfear not ernest he will come  more years sped swiftly and tranquilly away ernest still dwelt in his native valley and was now a man of middle age by imperceptible degrees he had become known among the people now as heretofore he labored for his bread and was the same simplehearted man that he had always been but he had thought and felt so much he had given so many of the best hours of his life to unworldly hopes for some great good to mankind that it seemed as though he had been talking with the angels and had imbibed a portion of their wisdom unawares it was visible in the calm and wellconsidered beneficence of his daily life the quiet stream of which had made a wide green margin all along its course not a day passed by that the world was not the better because this man humble as he was had lived he never stepped aside from his own path yet would always reach a blessing to his neighbor almost involuntarily too he had become a preacher the pure and high simplicity of his thought which as one of its manifestations took shape in the good deeds that dropped silently from his hand flowed also forth in speech he uttered truths that wrought upon and moulded the lives of those who heard him his auditors it may be never suspected that ernest their own neighbor and familiar friend was more than an ordinary man least of all did ernest himself suspect it but inevitably as the murmur of a rivulet came thoughts out of his mouth that no other human lips had spoken  when the peoples minds had had a little time to cool they were ready enough to acknowledge their mistake in imagining a similarity between general bloodandthunders truculent physiognomy and the benign visage on the mountainside but now again there were reports and many paragraphs in the newspapers affirming that the likeness of the great stone face had appeared upon the broad shoulders of a certain eminent statesman he like mr gathergold and old bloodandthunder was a native of the valley but had left it in his early days and taken up the trades of law and politics instead of the rich mans wealth and the warriors sword he had but a tongue and it was mightier than both together so wonderfully eloquent was he that whatever he might choose to say his auditors had no choice but to believe him wrong looked like right and right like wrong for when it pleased him he could make a kind of illuminated fog with his mere breath and obscure the natural daylight with it his tongue indeed was a magic instrument sometimes it rumbled like the thunder sometimes it warbled like the sweetest music it was the blast of war the song of peace and it seemed to have a heart in it when there was no such matter in good truth he was a wondrous man and when his tongue had acquired him all other imaginable successwhen it had been heard in halls of state and in the courts of princes and potentatesafter it had made him known all over the world even as a voice crying from shore to shoreit finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the presidency before this timeindeed as soon as he began to grow celebratedhis admirers had found out the resemblance between him and the great stone face and so much were they struck by it that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman was known by the name of old stony phiz the phrase was considered as giving a highly favorable aspect to his political prospects for as is likewise the case with the popedom nobody ever becomes president without taking a name other than his own  while his friends were doing their best to make him president old stony phiz as he was called set out on a visit to the valley where he was born of course he had no other object than to shake hands with his fellowcitizens and neither thought nor cared about any effect which his progress through the country might have upon the election magnificent preparations were made to receive the illustrious statesman a cavalcade of horsemen set forth to meet him at the boundary line of the state and all the people left their business and gathered along the wayside to see him pass among these was ernest though more than once disappointed as we have seen he had such a hopeful and confiding nature that he was always ready to believe in whatever seemed beautiful and good he kept his heart continually open and thus was sure to catch the blessing from on high when it should come so now again as buoyantly as ever he went forth to behold the likeness of the great stone face  the cavalcade came prancing along the road with a great clattering of hoofs and a mighty cloud of dust which rose up so dense and high that the visage of the mountainside was completely hidden from ernests eyes all the great men of the neighborhood were there on horseback militia officers in uniform the member of congress the sheriff of the county the editors of newspapers and many a farmer too had mounted his patient steed with his sunday coat upon his back it really was a very brilliant spectacle especially as there were numerous banners flaunting over the cavalcade on some of which were gorgeous portraits of the illustrious statesman and the great stone face smiling familiarly at one another like two brothers if the pictures were to be trusted the mutual resemblance it must be confessed was marvellous we must not forget to mention that there was a band of music which made the echoes of the mountains ring and reverberate with the loud triumph of its strains so that airy and soulthrilling melodies broke out among all the heights and hollows as if every nook of his native valley had found a voice to welcome the distinguished guest but the grandest effect was when the faroff mountain precipice flung back the music for then the great stone face itself seemed to be swelling the triumphant chorus in acknowledgment that at length the man of prophecy was come  all this while the people were throwing up their hats and shouting with enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of ernest kindled up and he likewise threw up his hat and shouted as loudly as the loudest huzza for the great man huzza for old stony phiz but as yet he had not seen him  here he is now cried those who stood near ernest there there look at old stony phiz and then at the old man of the mountain and see if they are not as like as two twinbrothers  in the midst of all this gallant array came an open barouche drawn by four white horses and in the barouche with his massive head uncovered sat the illustrious statesman old stony phiz himself  confess it said one of ernests neighbors to him the great stone face has met its match at last  now it must be owned that at his first glimpse of the countenance which was bowing and smiling from the barouche ernest did fancy that there was a resemblance between it and the old familiar face upon the mountainside the brow with its massive depth and loftiness and all the other features indeed were boldly and strongly hewn as if in emulation of a more than heroic of a titanic model but the sublimity and stateliness the grand expression of a divine sympathy that illuminated the mountain visage and etherealized its ponderous granite substance into spirit might here be sought in vain something had been originally left out or had departed and therefore the marvellously gifted statesman had always a weary gloom in the deep caverns of his eyes as of a child that has outgrown its playthings or a man of mighty faculties and little aims whose life with all its high performances was vague and empty because no high purpose had endowed it with reality  still ernests neighbor was thrusting his elbow into his side and pressing him for an answer  confess confess is not he the very picture of your old man of the mountain  no said ernest bluntly i see little or no likeness  then so much the worse for the great stone face answered his neighbor and again he set up a shout for old stony phiz  but ernest turned away melancholy and almost despondent for this was the saddest of his disappointments to behold a man who might have fulfilled the prophecy and had not willed to do so meantime the cavalcade the banners the music and the barouches swept past him with the vociferous crowd in the rear leaving the dust to settle down and the great stone face to be revealed again with the grandeur that it had worn for untold centuries  lo here i am ernest the benign lips seemed to say i have waited longer than thou and am not yet weary fear not the man will come  the years hurried onward treading in their haste on one anothers heels and now they began to bring white hairs and scatter them over the head of ernest they made reverend wrinkles across his forehead and furrows in his cheeks he was an aged man but not in vain had he grown old more than the white hairs on his head were the sage thoughts in his mind his wrinkles and furrows were inscriptions that time had graved and in which he had written legends of wisdom that had been tested by the tenor of a life and ernest had ceased to be obscure unsought for undesired had come the fame which so many seek and made him known in the great world beyond the limits of the valley in which he had dwelt so quietly college professors and even the active men of cities came from far to see and converse with ernest for the report had gone abroad that this simple husbandman had ideas unlike those of other men not gained from books but of a higher tonea tranquil and familiar majesty as if he had been talking with the angels as his daily friends whether it were sage statesman or philanthropist ernest received these visitors with the gentle sincerity that had characterized him from boyhood and spoke freely with them of whatever came uppermost or lay deepest in his heart or their own while they talked together his face would kindle unawares and shine upon them as with a mild evening light pensive with the fulness of such discourse his guests took leave and went their way and passing up the valley paused to look at the great stone face imagining that they had seen its likeness in a human countenance but could not remember where  while ernest had been growing up and growing old a bountiful providence had granted a new poet to this earth he likewise was a native of the valley but had spent the greater part of his life at a distance from that romantic region pouring out his sweet music amid the bustle and din of cities often however did the mountains which had been familiar to him in his childhood lift their snowy peaks into the clear atmosphere of his poetry neither was the great stone face forgotten for the poet had celebrated it in an ode which was grand enough to have been uttered by its own majestic lips this man of genius we may say had come down from heaven with wonderful endowments if he sang of a mountain the eyes of all mankind beheld a mightier grandeur reposing on its breast or soaring to its summit than had before been seen there if his theme were a lovely lake a celestial smile had now been thrown over it to gleam forever on its surface if it were the vast old sea even the deep immensity of its dread bosom seemed to swell the higher as if moved by the emotions of the song thus the world assumed another and a better aspect from the hour that the poet blessed it with his happy eyes the creator had bestowed him as the last best touch to his own handiwork creation was not finished till the poet came to interpret and so complete it  the effect was no less high and beautiful when his human brethren were the subject of his verse the man or woman sordid with the common dust of life who crossed his daily path and the little child who played in it were glorified if he beheld them in his mood of poetic faith he showed the golden links of the great chain that intertwined them with an angelic kindred he brought out the hidden traits of a celestial birth that made them worthy of such kin some indeed there were who thought to show the soundness of their judgment by affirming that all the beauty and dignity of the natural world existed only in the poets fancy let such men speak for themselves who undoubtedly appear to have been spawned forth by nature with a contemptuous bitterness she having plastered them up out of her refuse stuff after all the swine were made as respects all things else the poets ideal was the truest truth  the songs of this poet found their way to ernest he read them after his customary toil seated on the bench before his cottagedoor where for such a length of time he had filled his repose with thought by gazing at the great stone face and now as he read stanzas that caused the soul to thrill within him he lifted his eyes to the vast countenance beaming on him so benignantly  o majestic friend he murmured addressing the great stone face is not this man worthy to resemble thee  the face seemed to smile but answered not a word  now it happened that the poet though he dwelt so far away had not only heard of ernest but had meditated much upon his character until he deemed nothing so desirable as to meet this man whose untaught wisdom walked hand in hand with the noble simplicity of his life one summer morning therefore he took passage by the railroad and in the decline of the afternoon alighted from the cars at no great distance from ernests cottage the great hotel which had formerly been the palace of mr gathergold was close at hand but the poet with his carpetbag on his arm inquired at once where ernest dwelt and was resolved to be accepted as his guest  approaching the door he there found the good old man holding a volume in his hand which alternately he read and then with a finger between the leaves looked lovingly at the great stone face  good evening said the poet can you give a traveller a nights lodging  willingly answered ernest and then he added smiling methinks i never saw the great stone face look so hospitably at a stranger  the poet sat down on the bench beside him and he and ernest talked together often had the poet held intercourse with the wittiest and the wisest but never before with a man like ernest whose thoughts and feelings gushed up with such a natural freedom and who made great truths so familiar by his simple utterance of them angels as had been so often said seemed to have wrought with him at his labor in the fields angels seemed to have sat with him by the fireside and dwelling with angels as friend with friends he had imbibed the sublimity of their ideas and imbued it with the sweet and lowly charm of household words so thought the poet and ernest on the other hand was moved and agitated by the living images which the poet flung out of his mind and which peopled all the air about the cottagedoor with shapes of beauty both gay and pensive the sympathies of these two men instructed them with a profounder sense than either could have attained alone their minds accorded into one strain and made delightful music which neither of them could have claimed as all his own nor distinguished his own share from the others they led one another as it were into a high pavilion of their thoughts so remote and hitherto so dim that they had never entered it before and so beautiful that they desired to be there always  as ernest listened to the poet he imagined that the great stone face was bending forward to listen too he gazed earnestly into the poets glowing eyes  who are you my strangely gifted guest he said  the poet laid his finger on the volume that ernest had been reading  you have read these poems said he you know me thenfor i wrote them  again and still more earnestly than before ernest examined the poets features then turned towards the great stone face then back with an uncertain aspect to his guest but his countenance fell he shook his head and sighed  wherefore are you sad inquired the poet  because replied ernest all through life i have awaited the fulfilment of a prophecy and when i read these poems i hoped that it might be fulfilled in you  you hoped answered the poet faintly smiling to find in me the likeness of the great stone face and you are disappointed as formerly with mr gathergold and old bloodandthunder and old stony phiz yes ernest it is my doom you must add my name to the illustrious three and record another failure of your hopes forin shame and sadness do i speak it ernesti am not worthy to be typified by yonder benign and majestic image  and why asked ernest he pointed to the volume are not those thoughts divine  they have a strain of the divinity replied the poet you can hear in them the faroff echo of a heavenly song but my life dear ernest has not corresponded with my thought i have had grand dreams but they have been only dreams because i have livedand that too by my own choiceamong poor and mean realities sometimes evenshall i dare to say iti lack faith in the grandeur the beauty and the goodness which my own words are said to have made more evident in nature and in human life why then pure seeker of the good and true shouldst thou hope to find me in yonder image of the divine  the poet spoke sadly and his eyes were dim with tears so likewise were those of ernest  at the hour of sunset as had long been his frequent custom ernest was to discourse to an assemblage of the neighboring inhabitants in the open air he and the poet arm in arm still talking together as they went along proceeded to the spot it was a small nook among the hills with a gray precipice behind the stern front of which was relieved by the pleasant foliage of many creeping plants that made a tapestry for the naked rock by hanging their festoons from all its rugged angles at a small elevation above the ground set in a rich framework of verdure there appeared a niche spacious enough to admit a human figure with freedom for such gestures as spontaneously accompany earnest thought and genuine emotion into this natural pulpit ernest ascended and threw a look of familiar kindness around upon his audience they stood or sat or reclined upon the grass as seemed good to each with the departing sunshine falling obliquely over them and mingling its subdued cheerfulness with the solemnity of a grove of ancient trees beneath and amid the boughs of which the golden rays were constrained to pass in another direction was seen the great stone face with the same cheer combined with the same solemnity in its benignant aspect  ernest began to speak giving to the people of what was in his heart and mind his words had power because they accorded with his thoughts and his thoughts had reality and depth because they harmonized with the life which he had always lived it was not mere breath that this preacher uttered they were the words of life because a life of good deeds and holy love was melted into them pearls pure and rich had been dissolved into this precious draught the poet as he listened felt that the being and character of ernest were a nobler strain of poetry than he had ever written his eyes glistening with tears he gazed reverentially at the venerable man and said within himself that never was there an aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that mild sweet thoughtful countenance with the glory of white hair diffused about it at a distance but distinctly to be seen high up in the golden light of the setting sun appeared the great stone face with hoary mists around it like the white hairs around the brow of ernest its look of grand beneficence seemed to embrace the world  at that moment in sympathy with a thought which he was about to utter the face of ernest assumed a grandeur of expression so imbued with benevolence that the poet by an irresistible impulse threw his arms aloft and shouted behold behold ernest is himself the likeness of the great stone face  then all the people looked and saw that what the deepsighted poet said was true the prophecy was fulfilled but ernest having finished what he had to say took the poets arm and walked slowly homeward still hoping that some wiser and better man than himself would by and by appear bearing a resemblance to the great stone face    ethan brand  a chapter from an abortive romance  bartram the limeburner a rough heavylooking man begrimed with charcoal sat watching his kiln at nightfall while his little son played at building houses with the scattered fragments of marble when on the hillside below them they heard a roar of laughter not mirthful but slow and even solemn like a wind shaking the boughs of the forest  father what is that asked the little boy leaving his play and pressing betwixt his fathers knees  oh some drunken man i suppose answered the limeburner some merry fellow from the barroom in the village who dared not laugh loud enough within doors lest he should blow the roof of the house off so here he is shaking his jolly sides at the foot of graylock  but father said the child more sensitive than the obtuse middleaged clown he does not laugh like a man that is glad so the noise frightens me  dont be a fool child cried his father gruffly you will never make a man i do believe there is too much of your mother in you i have known the rustling of a leaf startle you hark here comes the merry fellow now you shall see that there is no harm in him  bartram and his little son while they were talking thus sat watching the same limekiln that had been the scene of ethan brands solitary and meditative life before he began his search for the unpardonable sin many years as we have seen had now elapsed since that portentous night when the idea was first developed the kiln however on the mountainside stood unimpaired and was in nothing changed since he had thrown his dark thoughts into the intense glow of its furnace and melted them as it were into the one thought that took possession of his life it was a rude round towerlike structure about twenty feet high heavily built of rough stones and with a hillock of earth heaped about the larger part of its circumference so that the blocks and fragments of marble might be drawn by cartloads and thrown in at the top there was an opening at the bottom of the tower like an overmouth but large enough to admit a man in a stooping posture and provided with a massive iron door with the smoke and jets of flame issuing from the chinks and crevices of this door which seemed to give admittance into the hillside it resembled nothing so much as the private entrance to the infernal regions which the shepherds of the delectable mountains were accustomed to show to pilgrims  there are many such limekilns in that tract of country for the purpose of burning the white marble which composes a large part of the substance of the hills some of them built years ago and long deserted with weeds growing in the vacant round of the interior which is open to the sky and grass and wildflowers rooting themselves into the chinks of the stones look already like relics of antiquity and may yet be overspread with the lichens of centuries to come others where the limeburner still feeds his daily and nightlong fire afford points of interest to the wanderer among the hills who seats himself on a log of wood or a fragment of marble to hold a chat with the solitary man it is a lonesome and when the character is inclined to thought may be an intensely thoughtful occupation as it proved in the case of ethan brand who had mused to such strange purpose in days gone by while the fire in this very kiln was burning  the man who now watched the fire was of a different order and troubled himself with no thoughts save the very few that were requisite to his business at frequent intervals he flung back the clashing weight of the iron door and turning his face from the insufferable glare thrust in huge logs of oak or stirred the immense brands with a long pole within the furnace were seen the curling and riotous flames and the burning marble almost molten with the intensity of heat while without the reflection of the fire quivered on the dark intricacy of the surrounding forest and showed in the foreground a bright and ruddy little picture of the hut the spring beside its door the athletic and coalbegrimed figure of the limeburner and the halffrightened child shrinking into the protection of his fathers shadow and when again the iron door was closed then reappeared the tender light of the halffull moon which vainly strove to trace out the indistinct shapes of the neighboring mountains and in the upper sky there was a flitting congregation of clouds still faintly tinged with the rosy sunset though thus far down into the valley the sunshine had vanished long and long ago  the little boy now crept still closer to his father as footsteps were heard ascending the hillside and a human form thrust aside the bushes that clustered beneath the trees  halloo who is it cried the limeburner vexed at his sons timidity yet half infected by it come forward and show yourself like a man or ill fling this chunk of marble at your head  you offer me a rough welcome said a gloomy voice as the unknown man drew nigh yet i neither claim nor desire a kinder one even at my own fireside  to obtain a distincter view bartram threw open the iron door of the kiln whence immediately issued a gush of fierce light that smote full upon the strangers face and figure to a careless eye there appeared nothing very remarkable in his aspect which was that of a man in a coarse brown countrymade suit of clothes tall and thin with the staff and heavy shoes of a wayfarer as he advanced he fixed his eyeswhich were very brightintently upon the brightness of the furnace as if he beheld or expected to behold some object worthy of note within it  good evening stranger said the limeburner whence come you so late in the day  i come from my search answered the wayfarer for at last it is finished  drunkor crazy muttered bartram to himself i shall have trouble with the fellow the sooner i drive him away the better  the little boy all in a tremble whispered to his father and begged him to shut the door of the kiln so that there might not be so much light for that there was something in the mans face which he was afraid to look at yet could not look away from and indeed even the limeburners dull and torpid sense began to be impressed by an indescribable something in that thin rugged thoughtful visage with the grizzled hair hanging wildly about it and those deeply sunken eyes which gleamed like fires within the entrance of a mysterious cavern but as he closed the door the stranger turned towards him and spoke in a quiet familiar way that made bartram feel as if he were a sane and sensible man after all  your task draws to an end i see said he this marble has already been burning three days a few hours more will convert the stone to lime  why who are you exclaimed the limeburner you seem as well acquainted with my business as i am myself  and well i may be said the stranger for i followed the same craft many a long year and here too on this very spot but you are a newcomer in these parts did you never hear of ethan brand  the man that went in search of the unpardonable sin asked bartram with a laugh  the same answered the stranger he has found what he sought and therefore he comes back again  what then you are ethan brand himself cried the limeburner in amazement i am a newcomer here as you say and they call it eighteen years since you left the foot of graylock but i can tell you the good folks still talk about ethan brand in the village yonder and what a strange errand took him away from his limekiln well and so you have found the unpardonable sin  even so said the stranger calmly  if the question is a fair one proceeded bartram where might it be  ethan brand laid his finger on his own heart  here replied he  and then without mirth in his countenance but as if moved by an involuntary recognition of the infinite absurdity of seeking throughout the world for what was the closest of all things to himself and looking into every heart save his own for what was hidden in no other breast he broke into a laugh of scorn it was the same slow heavy laugh that had almost appalled the limeburner when it heralded the wayfarers approach  the solitary mountainside was made dismal by it laughter when out of place mistimed or bursting forth from a disordered state of feeling may be the most terrible modulation of the human voice the laughter of one asleep even if it be a little childthe madmans laughthe wild screaming laugh of a born idiotare sounds that we sometimes tremble to hear and would always willingly forget poets have imagined no utterance of fiends or hobgoblins so fearfully appropriate as a laugh and even the obtuse limeburner felt his nerves shaken as this strange man looked inward at his own heart and burst into laughter that rolled away into the night and was indistinctly reverberated among the hills  joe said he to his little son scamper down to the tavern in the village and tell the jolly fellows there that ethan brand has come back and that he has found the unpardonable sin  the boy darted away on his errand to which ethan brand made no objection nor seemed hardly to notice it he sat on a log of wood looking steadfastly at the iron door of the kiln when the child was out of sight and his swift and light footsteps ceased to be heard treading first on the fallen leaves and then on the rocky mountainpath the limeburner began to regret his departure he felt that the little fellows presence had been a barrier between his guest and himself and that he must now deal heart to heart with a man who on his own confession had committed the one only crime for which heaven could afford no mercy that crime in its indistinct blackness seemed to overshadow him and made his memory riotous with a throng of evil shapes that asserted their kindred with the master sin whatever it might be which it was within the scope of mans corrupted nature to conceive and cherish they were all of one family they went to and fro between his breast and ethan brands and carried dark greetings from one to the other  then bartram remembered the stories which had grown traditionary in reference to this strange man who had come upon him like a shadow of the night and was making himself at home in his old place after so long absence that the dead people dead and buried for years would have had more right to be at home in any familiar spot than he ethan brand it was said had conversed with satan himself in the lurid blaze of this very kiln the legend had been matter of mirth heretofore but looked grisly now according to this tale before ethan brand departed on his search he had been accustomed to evoke a fiend from the hot furnace of the limekiln night after night in order to confer with him about the unpardonable sin the man and the fiend each laboring to frame the image of some mode of guilt which could neither be atoned for nor forgiven and with the first gleam of light upon the mountaintop the fiend crept in at the iron door there to abide the intensest element of fire until again summoned forth to share in the dreadful task of extending mans possible guilt beyond the scope of heavens else infinite mercy  while the limeburner was struggling with the horror of these thoughts ethan brand rose from the log and flung open the door of the kiln the action was in such accordance with the idea in bartrams mind that he almost expected to see the evil one issue forth redhot from the raging furnace  hold hold cried he with a tremulous attempt to laugh for he was ashamed of his fears although they overmastered him dont for mercys sake bring out your devil now  man sternly replied ethan brand what need have i of the devil i have left him behind me on my track it is with such halfway sinners as you that he busies himself fear not because i open the door i do but act by old custom and am going to trim your fire like a limeburner as i was once  he stirred the vast coals thrust in more wood and bent forward to gaze into the hollow prisonhouse of the fire regardless of the fierce glow that reddened upon his face the limeburner sat watching him and half suspected this strange guest of a purpose if not to evoke a fiend at least to plunge into the flames and thus vanish from the sight of man ethan brand however drew quietly back and closed the door of the kiln  i have looked said he into many a human heart that was seven times hotter with sinful passions than yonder furnace is with fire but i found not there what i sought no not the unpardonable sin  what is the unpardonable sin asked the limeburner and then he shrank farther from his companion trembling lest his question should be answered  it is a sin that grew within my own breast replied ethan brand standing erect with a pride that distinguishes all enthusiasts of his stamp a sin that grew nowhere else the sin of an intellect that triumphed over the sense of brotherhood with man and reverence for god and sacrificed everything to its own mighty claims the only sin that deserves a recompense of immortal agony freely were it to do again would i incur the guilt unshrinkingly i accept the retribution  the mans head is turned muttered the limeburner to himself he may be a sinner like the rest of usnothing more likelybut ill be sworn he is a madman too  nevertheless he felt uncomfortable at his situation alone with ethan brand on the wild mountainside and was right glad to hear the rough murmur of tongues and the footsteps of what seemed a pretty numerous party stumbling over the stones and rustling through the underbrush soon appeared the whole lazy regiment that was wont to infest the village tavern comprehending three or four individuals who had drunk flip beside the barroom fire through all the winters and smoked their pipes beneath the stoop through all the summers since ethan brands departure laughing boisterously and mingling all their voices together in unceremonious talk they now burst into the moonshine and narrow streaks of firelight that illuminated the open space before the limekiln bartram set the door ajar again flooding the spot with light that the whole company might get a fair view of ethan brand and he of them  there among other old acquaintances was a once ubiquitous man now almost extinct but whom we were formerly sure to encounter at the hotel of every thriving village throughout the country it was the stageagent the present specimen of the genus was a wilted and smokedried man wrinkled and rednosed in a smartly cut brown bobtailed coat with brass buttons who for a length of time unknown had kept his desk and corner in the barroom and was still puffing what seemed to be the same cigar that he had lighted twenty years before he had great fame as a dry joker though perhaps less on account of any intrinsic humor than from a certain flavor of brandytoddy and tobaccosmoke which impregnated all his ideas and expressions as well as his person another wellremembered though strangely altered face was that of lawyer giles as people still called him in courtesy an elderly ragamuffin in his soiled shirtsleeves and towcloth trousers this poor fellow had been an attorney in what he called his better days a sharp practitioner and in great vogue among the village litigants but flip and sling and toddy and cocktails imbibed at all hours morning noon and night had caused him to slide from intellectual to various kinds and degrees of bodily labor till at last to adopt his own phrase he slid into a soapvat in other words giles was now a soapboiler in a small way he had come to be but the fragment of a human being a part of one foot having been chopped off by an axe and an entire hand torn away by the devilish grip of a steamengine yet though the corporeal hand was gone a spiritual member remained for stretching forth the stump giles steadfastly averred that he felt an invisible thumb and fingers with as vivid a sensation as before the real ones were amputated a maimed and miserable wretch he was but one nevertheless whom the world could not trample on and had no right to scorn either in this or any previous stage of his misfortunes since he had still kept up the courage and spirit of a man asked nothing in charity and with his one handand that the left onefought a stern battle against want and hostile circumstances  among the throng too came another personage who with certain points of similarity to lawyer giles had many more of difference it was the village doctor a man of some fifty years whom at an earlier period of his life we introduced as paying a professional visit to ethan brand during the latters supposed insanity he was now a purplevisaged rude and brutal yet halfgentlemanly figure with something wild ruined and desperate in his talk and in all the details of his gesture and manners brandy possessed this man like an evil spirit and made him as surly and savage as a wild beast and as miserable as a lost soul but there was supposed to be in him such wonderful skill such native gifts of healing beyond any which medical science could impart that society caught hold of him and would not let him sink out of its reach so swaying to and fro upon his horse and grumbling thick accents at the bedside he visited all the sickchambers for miles about among the mountain towns and sometimes raised a dying man as it were by miracle or quite as often no doubt sent his patient to a grave that was dug many a year too soon the doctor had an everlasting pipe in his mouth and as somebody said in allusion to his habit of swearing it was always alight with hellfire  these three worthies pressed forward and greeted ethan brand each after his own fashion earnestly inviting him to partake of the contents of a certain black bottle in which as they averred he would find something far better worth seeking than the unpardonable sin no mind which has wrought itself by intense and solitary meditation into a high state of enthusiasm can endure the kind of contact with low and vulgar modes of thought and feeling to which ethan brand was now subjected it made him doubtand strange to say it was a painful doubtwhether he had indeed found the unpardonable sin and found it within himself the whole question on which he had exhausted life and more than life looked like a delusion  leave me he said bitterly ye brute beasts that have made yourselves so shrivelling up your souls with fiery liquors i have done with you years and years ago i groped into your hearts and found nothing there for my purpose get ye gone  why you uncivil scoundrel cried the fierce doctor is that the way you respond to the kindness of your best friends then let me tell you the truth you have no more found the unpardonable sin than yonder boy joe has you are but a crazy fellowi told you so twenty years agoneither better nor worse than a crazy fellow and the fit companion of old humphrey here  he pointed to an old man shabbily dressed with long white hair thin visage and unsteady eyes for some years past this aged person had been wandering about among the hills inquiring of all travellers whom he met for his daughter the girl it seemed had gone off with a company of circusperformers and occasionally tidings of her came to the village and fine stories were told of her glittering appearance as she rode on horseback in the ring or performed marvellous feats on the tightrope  the whitehaired father now approached ethan brand and gazed unsteadily into his face  they tell me you have been all over the earth said he wringing his hands with earnestness you must have seen my daughter for she makes a grand figure in the world and everybody goes to see her did she send any word to her old father or say when she was coming back  ethan brands eye quailed beneath the old mans that daughter from whom he so earnestly desired a word of greeting was the esther of our tale the very girl whom with such cold and remorseless purpose ethan brand had made the subject of a psychological experiment and wasted absorbed and perhaps annihilated her soul in the process  yes he murmured turning away from the hoary wanderer it is no delusion there is an unpardonable sin  while these things were passing a merry scene was going forward in the area of cheerful light beside the spring and before the door of the hut a number of the youth of the village young men and girls had hurried up the hillside impelled by curiosity to see ethan brand the hero of so many a legend familiar to their childhood finding nothing however very remarkable in his aspectnothing but a sunburnt wayfarer in plain garb and dusty shoes who sat looking into the fire as if he fancied pictures among the coalsthese young people speedily grew tired of observing him as it happened there was other amusement at hand an old german jew travelling with a diorama on his back was passing down the mountainroad towards the village just as the party turned aside from it and in hopes of eking out the profits of the day the showman had kept them company to the limekiln  come old dutchman cried one of the young men let us see your pictures if you can swear they are worth looking at  oh yes captain answered the jewwhether as a matter of courtesy or craft he styled everybody captaini shall show you indeed some very superb pictures  so placing his box in a proper position he invited the young men and girls to look through the glass orifices of the machine and proceeded to exhibit a series of the most outrageous scratchings and daubings as specimens of the fine arts that ever an itinerant showman had the face to impose upon his circle of spectators the pictures were worn out moreover tattered full of cracks and wrinkles dingy with tobaccosmoke and otherwise in a most pitiable condition some purported to be cities public edifices and ruined castles in europe others represented napoleons battles and nelsons seafights and in the midst of these would be seen a gigantic brown hairy handwhich might have been mistaken for the hand of destiny though in truth it was only the showmanspointing its forefinger to various scenes of the conflict while its owner gave historical illustrations when with much merriment at its abominable deficiency of merit the exhibition was concluded the german bade little joe put his head into the box viewed through the magnifyingglasses the boys round rosy visage assumed the strangest imaginable aspect of an immense titanic child the mouth grinning broadly and the eyes and every other feature overflowing with fun at the joke suddenly however that merry face turned pale and its expression changed to horror for this easily impressed and excitable child had become sensible that the eye of ethan brand was fixed upon him through the glass  you make the little man to be afraid captain said the german jew turning up the dark and strong outline of his visage from his stooping posture but look again and by chance i shall cause you to see somewhat that is very fine upon my word  ethan brand gazed into the box for an instant and then starting back looked fixedly at the german what had he seen nothing apparently for a curious youth who had peeped in almost at the same moment beheld only a vacant space of canvas  i remember you now muttered ethan brand to the showman  ah captain whispered the jew of nuremberg with a dark smile i find it to be a heavy matter in my showboxthis unpardonable sin by my faith captain it has wearied my shoulders this long day to carry it over the mountain  peace answered ethan brand sternly or get thee into the furnace yonder  the jews exhibition had scarcely concluded when a great elderly dogwho seemed to be his own master as no person in the company laid claim to himsaw fit to render himself the object of public notice hitherto he had shown himself a very quiet welldisposed old dog going round from one to another and by way of being sociable offering his rough head to be patted by any kindly hand that would take so much trouble but now all of a sudden this grave and venerable quadruped of his own mere motion and without the slightest suggestion from anybody else began to run round after his tail which to heighten the absurdity of the proceeding was a great deal shorter than it should have been never was seen such headlong eagerness in pursuit of an object that could not possibly be attained never was heard such a tremendous outbreak of growling snarling barking and snappingas if one end of the ridiculous brutes body were at deadly and most unforgivable enmity with the other faster and faster round about went the cur and faster and still faster fled the unapproachable brevity of his tail and louder and fiercer grew his yells of rage and animosity until utterly exhausted and as far from the goal as ever the foolish old dog ceased his performance as suddenly as he had begun it the next moment he was as mild quiet sensible and respectable in his deportment as when he first scraped acquaintance with the company  as may be supposed the exhibition was greeted with universal laughter clapping of hands and shouts of encore to which the canine performer responded by wagging all that there was to wag of his tail but appeared totally unable to repeat his very successful effort to amuse the spectators  meanwhile ethan brand had resumed his seat upon the log and moved as it might be by a perception of some remote analogy between his own case and that of this selfpursuing cur he broke into the awful laugh which more than any other token expressed the condition of his inward being from that moment the merriment of the party was at an end they stood aghast dreading lest the inauspicious sound should be reverberated around the horizon and that mountain would thunder it to mountain and so the horror be prolonged upon their ears then whispering one to another that it was latethat the moon was almost downthat the august night was growing chillthey hurried homewards leaving the limeburner and little joe to deal as they might with their unwelcome guest save for these three human beings the open space on the hillside was a solitude set in a vast gloom of forest beyond that darksome verge the firelight glimmered on the stately trunks and almost black foliage of pines intermixed with the lighter verdure of sapling oaks maples and poplars while here and there lay the gigantic corpses of dead trees decaying on the leafstrewn soil and it seemed to little joea timorous and imaginative childthat the silent forest was holding its breath until some fearful thing should happen  ethan brand thrust more wood into the fire and closed the door of the kiln then looking over his shoulder at the limeburner and his son he bade rather than advised them to retire to rest  for myself i cannot sleep said he i have matters that it concerns me to meditate upon i will watch the fire as i used to do in the old time  and call the devil out of the furnace to keep you company i suppose muttered bartram who had been making intimate acquaintance with the black bottle above mentioned but watch if you like and call as many devils as you like for my part i shall be all the better for a snooze come joe  as the boy followed his father into the hut he looked back at the wayfarer and the tears came into his eyes for his tender spirit had an intuition of the bleak and terrible loneliness in which this man had enveloped himself  when they had gone ethan brand sat listening to the crackling of the kindled wood and looking at the little spirts of fire that issued through the chinks of the door these trifles however once so familiar had but the slightest hold of his attention while deep within his mind he was reviewing the gradual but marvellous change that had been wrought upon him by the search to which he had devoted himself he remembered how the night dew had fallen upon himhow the dark forest had whispered to himhow the stars had gleamed upon hima simple and loving man watching his fire in the years gone by and ever musing as it burned he remembered with what tenderness with what love and sympathy for mankind and what pity for human guilt and woe he had first begun to contemplate those ideas which afterwards became the inspiration of his life with what reverence he had then looked into the heart of man viewing it as a temple originally divine and however desecrated still to be held sacred by a brother with what awful fear he had deprecated the success of his pursuit and prayed that the unpardonable sin might never be revealed to him then ensued that vast intellectual development which in its progress disturbed the counterpoise between his mind and heart the idea that possessed his life had operated as a means of education it had gone on cultivating his powers to the highest point of which they were susceptible it had raised him from the level of an unlettered laborer to stand on a starlit eminence whither the philosophers of the earth laden with the lore of universities might vainly strive to clamber after him so much for the intellect but where was the heart that indeed had witheredhad contractedhad hardenedhad perished it had ceased to partake of the universal throb he had lost his hold of the magnetic chain of humanity he was no longer a brotherman opening the chambers or the dungeons of our common nature by the key of holy sympathy which gave him a right to share in all its secrets he was now a cold observer looking on mankind as the subject of his experiment and at length converting man and woman to be his puppets and pulling the wires that moved them to such degrees of crime as were demanded for his study  thus ethan brand became a fiend he began to be so from the moment that his moral nature had ceased to keep the pace of improvement with his intellect and now as his highest effort and inevitable developmentas the bright and gorgeous flower and rich delicious fruit of his lifes laborhe had produced the unpardonable sin  what more have i to seek what more to achieve said ethan brand to himself my task is done and well done  starting from the log with a certain alacrity in his gait and ascending the hillock of earth that was raised against the stone circumference of the limekiln he thus reached the top of the structure it was a space of perhaps ten feet across from edge to edge presenting a view of the upper surface of the immense mass of broken marble with which the kiln was heaped all these innumerable blocks and fragments of marble were redhot and vividly on fire sending up great spouts of blue flame which quivered aloft and danced madly as within a magic circle and sank and rose again with continual and multitudinous activity as the lonely man bent forward over this terrible body of fire the blasting heat smote up against his person with a breath that it might be supposed would have scorched and shrivelled him up in a moment  ethan brand stood erect and raised his arms on high the blue flames played upon his face and imparted the wild and ghastly light which alone could have suited its expression it was that of a fiend on the verge of plunging into his gulf of intensest torment  o mother earth cried he who art no more my mother and into whose bosom this frame shall never be resolved o mankind whose brotherhood i have cast off and trampled thy great heart beneath my feet o stars of heaven that shone on me of old as if to light me onward and upwardfarewell all and forever come deadly element of firehenceforth my familiar friend embrace me as i do thee  that night the sound of a fearful peal of laughter rolled heavily through the sleep of the limeburner and his little son dim shapes of horror and anguish haunted their dreams and seemed still present in the rude hovel when they opened their eyes to the daylight  up boy up cried the limeburner staring about him thank heaven the night is gone at last and rather than pass such another i would watch my limekiln wide awake for a twelvemonth this ethan brand with his humbug of an unpardonable sin has done me no such mighty favor in taking my place  he issued from the hut followed by little joe who kept fast hold of his fathers hand the early sunshine was already pouring its gold upon the mountaintops and though the valleys were still in shadow they smiled cheerfully in the promise of the bright day that was hastening onward the village completely shut in by hills which swelled away gently about it looked as if it had rested peacefully in the hollow of the great hand of providence every dwelling was distinctly visible the little spires of the two churches pointed upwards and caught a foreglimmering of brightness from the sungilt skies upon their gilded weathercocks the tavern was astir and the figure of the old smokedried stageagent cigar in mouth was seen beneath the stoop old graylock was glorified with a golden cloud upon his head scattered likewise over the breasts of the surrounding mountains there were heaps of hoary mist in fantastic shapes some of them far down into the valley others high up towards the summits and still others of the same family of mist or cloud hovering in the gold radiance of the upper atmosphere stepping from one to another of the clouds that rested on the hills and thence to the loftier brotherhood that sailed in air it seemed almost as if a mortal man might thus ascend into the heavenly regions earth was so mingled with sky that it was a daydream to look at it  to supply that charm of the familiar and homely which nature so readily adopts into a scene like this the stagecoach was rattling down the mountainroad and the driver sounded his horn while echo caught up the notes and intertwined them into a rich and varied and elaborate harmony of which the original performer could lay claim to little share the great hills played a concert among themselves each contributing a strain of airy sweetness  little joes face brightened at once  dear father cried he skipping cheerily to and fro that strange man is gone and the sky and the mountains all seem glad of it  yes growled the limeburner with an oath but he has let the fire go down and no thanks to him if five hundred bushels of lime are not spoiled if i catch the fellow hereabouts again i shall feel like tossing him into the furnace  with his long pole in his hand he ascended to the top of the kiln after a moments pause he called to his son  come up here joe said he  so little joe ran up the hillock and stood by his fathers side the marble was all burnt into perfect snowwhite lime but on its surface in the midst of the circlesnowwhite too and thoroughly converted into limelay a human skeleton in the attitude of a person who after long toil lies down to long repose within the ribsstrange to saywas the shape of a human heart  was the fellows heart made of marble cried bartram in some perplexity at this phenomenon at any rate it is burnt into what looks like special good lime and taking all the bones together my kiln is half a bushel the richer for him  so saying the rude limeburner lifted his pole and letting it fall upon the skeleton the relics of ethan brand were crumbled into fragments    the canterbury pilgrims  the summer moon which shines in so many a tale was beaming over a broad extent of uneven country some of its brightest rays were flung into a spring of water where no traveller toiling as the writer has up the hilly road beside which it gushes ever failed to quench his thirst the work of neat hands and considerate art was visible about this blessed fountain an open cistern hewn and hollowed out of solid stone was placed above the waters which filled it to the brim but by some invisible outlet were conveyed away without dripping down its sides though the basin had not room for another drop and the continual gush of water made a tremor on the surface there was a secret charm that forbade it to overflow i remember that when i had slaked my summer thirst and sat panting by the cistern it was my fanciful theory that nature could not afford to lavish so pure a liquid as she does the waters of all meaner fountains  while the moon was hanging almost perpendicularly over this spot two figures appeared on the summit of the hill and came with noiseless footsteps down towards the spring they were then in the first freshness of youth nor is there a wrinkle now on either of their brows and yet they wore a strange oldfashioned garb one a young man with ruddy cheeks walked beneath the canopy of a broadbrimmed gray hat he seemed to have inherited his greatgrandsires squareskirted coat and a waistcoat that extended its immense flaps to his knees his brown locks also hung down behind in a mode unknown to our times by his side was a sweet young damsel her fair features sheltered by a prim little bonnet within which appeared the vestal muslin of a cap her close longwaisted gown and indeed her whole attire might have been worn by some rustic beauty who had faded half a century before but that there was something too warm and lifelike in them i would here have compared this couple to the ghosts of two young lovers who had died long since in the glow of passion and now were straying out of their graves to renew the old vows and shadow forth the unforgotten kiss of their earthly lips beside the moonlit spring  thee and i will rest here a moment miriam said the young man as they drew near the stone cistern for there is no fear that the elders know what we have done and this may be the last time we shall ever taste this water  thus speaking with a little sadness in his face which was also visible in that of his companion he made her sit down on a stone and was about to place himself very close to her side she however repelled him though not unkindly  nay josiah said she giving him a timid push with her maiden hand thee must sit farther off on that other stone with the spring between us what would the sisters say if thee were to sit so close to me  but we are of the worlds people now miriam answered josiah  the girl persisted in her prudery nor did the youth in fact seem altogether free from a similar sort of shyness so they sat apart from each other gazing up the hill where the moonlight discovered the tops of a group of buildings while their attention was thus occupied a party of travellers who had come wearily up the long ascent made a halt to refresh themselves at the spring there were three men a woman and a little girl and boy their attire was mean covered with the dust of the summers day and damp with the nightdew they all looked woebegone as if the cares and sorrows of the world had made their steps heavier as they climbed the hill even the two little children appeared older in evil days than the young man and maiden who had first approached the spring  good evening to you young folks was the salutation of the travellers and good evening friends replied the youth and damsel  is that white building the shaker meetinghouse asked one of the strangers and are those the red roofs of the shaker village  friend it is the shaker village answered josiah after some hesitation  the travellers who from the first had looked suspiciously at the garb of these young people now taxed them with an intention which all the circumstances indeed rendered too obvious to be mistaken  it is true friends replied the young man summoning up his courage miriam and i have a gift to love each other and we are going among the worlds people to live after their fashion and ye know that we do not transgress the law of the land and neither ye nor the elders themselves have a right to hinder us  yet you think it expedient to depart without leavetaking remarked one of the travellers  yea yea said josiah reluctantly because father job is a very awful man to speak with and being aged himself he has but little charity for what he calls the iniquities of the flesh  well said the stranger we will neither use force to bring you back to the village nor will we betray you to the elders but sit you here awhile and when you have heard what we shall tell you of the world which we have left and into which you are going perhaps you will turn back with us of your own accord what say you added he turning to his companions we have travelled thus far without becoming known to each other shall we tell our stories here by this pleasant spring for our own pastime and the benefit of these misguided young lovers  in accordance with this proposal the whole party stationed themselves round the stone cistern the two children being very weary fell asleep upon the damp earth and the pretty shaker girl whose feelings were those of a nun or a turkish lady crept as close as possible to the female traveller and as far as she well could from the unknown men the same person who had hitherto been the chief spokesman now stood up waving his hat in his hand and suffered the moonlight to fall full upon his front  in me said he with a certain majesty of utterancein me you behold a poet  though a lithographic print of this gentleman is extant it may be well to notice that he was now nearly forty a thin and stooping figure in a black coat out at elbows notwithstanding the ill condition of his attire there were about him several tokens of a peculiar sort of foppery unworthy of a mature man particularly in the arrangement of his hair which was so disposed as to give all possible loftiness and breadth to his forehead however he had an intelligent eye and on the whole a marked countenance  a poet repeated the young shaker a little puzzled how to understand such a designation seldom heard in the utilitarian community where he had spent his life oh ay miriam he means a varsemaker thee must know  this remark jarred upon the susceptible nerves of the poet nor could he help wondering what strange fatality had put into this young mans mouth an epithet which illnatured people had affirmed to be more proper to his merit than the one assumed by himself  true i am a versemaker he resumed but my verse is no more than the material body into which i breathe the celestial soul of thought alas how many a pang has it cost me this same insensibility to the ethereal essence of poetry with which you have here tortured me again at the moment when i am to relinquish my profession forever o fate why hast thou warred with nature turning all her higher and more perfect gifts to the ruin of me their possessor what is the voice of song when the world lacks the ear of taste how can i rejoice in my strength and delicacy of feeling when they have but made great sorrows out of little ones have i dreaded scorn like death and yearned for fame as others pant for vital air only to find myself in a middle state between obscurity and infamy but i have my revenge i could have given existence to a thousand bright creations i crush them into my heart and there let them putrefy i shake off the dust of my feet against my countrymen but posterity tracing my footsteps up this weary hill will cry shame upon the unworthy age that drove one of the fathers of american song to end his days in a shaker village  during this harangue the speaker gesticulated with great energy and as poetry is the natural language of passion there appeared reason to apprehend his final explosion into an ode extempore the reader must understand that for all these bitter words he was a kind gentle harmless poor fellow enough whom nature tossing her ingredients together without looking at her recipe had sent into the world with too much of one sort of brain and hardly any of another  friend said the young shaker in some perplexity thee seemest to have met with great troubles and doubtless i should pity them ifif i could but understand what they were  happy in your ignorance replied the poet with an air of sublime superiority to your coarser mind perhaps i may seem to speak of more important griefs when i add what i had wellnigh forgotten that i am out at elbows and almost starved to death at any rate you have the advice and example of one individual to warn you back for i am come hither a disappointed man flinging aside the fragments of my hopes and seeking shelter in the calm retreat which you are so anxious to leave  i thank thee friend rejoined the youth but i do not mean to be a poet nor heaven be praised do i think miriam ever made a varse in her life so we need not fear thy disappointments but miriam he added with real concern thee knowest that the elders admit nobody that has not a gift to be useful now what under the sun can they do with this poor varsemaker  nay josiah do not thee discourage the poor man said the girl in all simplicity and kindness our hymns are very rough and perhaps they may trust him to smooth them  without noticing this hint of professional employment the poet turned away and gave himself up to a sort of vague reverie which he called thought sometimes he watched the moon pouring a silvery liquid on the clouds through which it slowly melted till they became all bright then he saw the same sweet radiance dancing on the leafy trees which rustled as if to shake it off or sleeping on the high tops of hills or hovering down in distant valleys like the material of unshaped dreams lastly he looked into the spring and there the light was mingling with the water in its crystal bosom too beholding all heaven reflected there he found an emblem of a pure and tranquil breast he listened to that most ethereal of all sounds the song of crickets coming in full choir upon the wind and fancied that if moonlight could be heard it would sound just like that finally he took a draught at the shaker spring and as if it were the true castalia was forthwith moved to compose a lyric a farewell to his harp which he swore should be its closing strain the last verse that an ungrateful world should have from him this effusion with two or three other little pieces subsequently written he took the first opportunity to send by one of the shaker brethren to concord where they were published in the new hampshire patriot  meantime another of the canterbury pilgrims one so different from the poet that the delicate fancy of the latter could hardly have conceived of him began to relate his sad experience he was a small man of quick and unquiet gestures about fifty years old with a narrow forehead all wrinkled and drawn together he held in his hand a pencil and a card of some commissionmerchant in foreign parts on the back of which for there was light enough to read or write by he seemed ready to figure out a calculation  young man said he abruptly what quantity of land do the shakers own here in canterbury  that is more than i can tell thee friend answered josiah but it is a very rich establishment and for a long way by the roadside thee may guess the land to be ours by the neatness of the fences  and what may be the value of the whole continued the stranger with all the buildings and improvements pretty nearly in round numbers  oh a monstrous summore than i can reckon replied the young shaker  well sir said the pilgrim there was a day and not very long ago neither when i stood at my countingroom window and watched the signal flags of three of my own ships entering the harbor from the east indies from liverpool and from up the straits and i would not have given the invoice of the least of them for the titledeeds of this whole shaker settlement you stare perhaps now you wont believe that i could have put more value on a little piece of paper no bigger than the palm of your hand than all these solid acres of grain grass and pastureland would sell for  i wont dispute it friend answered josiah but i know i had rather have fifty acres of this good land than a whole sheet of thy paper  you may say so now said the ruined merchant bitterly for my name would not be worth the paper i should write it on of course you must have heard of my failure  and the stranger mentioned his name which however mighty it might have been in the commercial world the young shaker had never heard of among the canterbury hills  not heard of my failure exclaimed the merchant considerably piqued why it was spoken of on change in london and from boston to new orleans men trembled in their shoes at all events i did fail and you see me here on my road to the shaker village where doubtless for the shakers are a shrewd sect they will have a due respect for my experience and give me the management of the trading part of the concern in which case i think i can pledge myself to double their capital in four or five years turn back with me young man for though you will never meet with my good luck you can hardly escape my bad  i will not turn back for this replied josiah calmly any more than for the advice of the varsemaker between whom and thee friend i see a sort of likeness though i cant justly say where it lies but miriam and i can earn our daily bread among the worlds people as well as in the shaker village and do we want anything more miriam  nothing more josiah said the girl quietly  yea miriam and daily bread for some other little mouths if god send them observed the simple shaker lad  miriam did not reply but looked down into the spring where she encountered the image of her own pretty face blushing within the prim little bonnet the third pilgrim now took up the conversation he was a sunburnt countryman of tall frame and bony strength on whose rude and manly face there appeared a darker more sullen and obstinate despondency than on those of either the poet or the merchant  well now youngster he began these folks have had their say so ill take my turn my story will cut but a poor figure by the side of theirs for i never supposed that i could have a right to meat and drink and great praise besides only for tagging rhymes together as it seems this man does nor ever tried to get the substance of hundreds into my own hands like the trader there when i was about of your years i married me a wifejust such a neat and pretty young woman as miriam if thats her nameand all i asked of providence was an ordinary blessing on the sweat of my brow so that we might be decent and comfortable and have daily bread for ourselves and for some other little mouths that we soon had to feed we had no very great prospects before us but i never wanted to be idle and i thought it a matter of course that the lord would help me because i was willing to help myself  and didnt he help thee friend demanded josiah with some eagerness  no said the yeoman sullenly for then you would not have seen me here i have labored hard for years and my means have been growing narrower and my living poorer and my heart colder and heavier all the time till at last i could bear it no longer i set myself down to calculate whether i had best go on the oregon expedition or come here to the shaker village but i had not hope enough left in me to begin the world over again and to make my story short here i am and now youngster take my advice and turn back or else some few years hence youll have to climb this hill with as heavy a heart as mine  this simple story had a strong effect on the young fugitives the misfortunes of the poet and merchant had won little sympathy from their plain good sense and unworldly feelings qualities which made them such unprejudiced and inflexible judges that few men would have chosen to take the opinion of this youth and maiden as to the wisdom or folly of their pursuits but here was one whose simple wishes had resembled their own and who after efforts which almost gave him a right to claim success from fate had failed in accomplishing them  but thy wife friend exclaimed the younger man what became of the pretty girl like miriam oh i am afraid she is dead  yea poor man she must be deadshe and the children too sobbed miriam  the female pilgrim had been leaning over the spring wherein latterly a tear or two might have been seen to fall and form its little circle on the surface of the water she now looked up disclosing features still comely but which had acquired an expression of fretfulness in the same long course of evil fortune that had thrown a sullen gloom over the temper of the unprosperous yeoman  i am his wife said she a shade of irritability just perceptible in the sadness of her tone these poor little things asleep on the ground are two of our children we had two more but god has provided better for them than we could by taking them to himself  and what would thee advise josiah and me to do asked miriam this being the first question which she had put to either of the strangers  tis a thing almost against nature for a woman to try to part true lovers answered the yeomans wife after a pause but ill speak as truly to you as if these were my dying words though my husband told you some of our troubles he didnt mention the greatest and that which makes all the rest so hard to bear if you and your sweetheart marry youll be kind and pleasant to each other for a year or two and while thats the case you never will repent but by and by hell grow gloomy rough and hard to please and youll be peevish and full of little angry fits and apt to be complaining by the fireside when he comes to rest himself from his troubles out of doors so your love will wear away by little and little and leave you miserable at last it has been so with us and yet my husband and i were true lovers once if ever two young folks were   as she ceased the yeoman and his wife exchanged a glance in which there was more and warmer affection than they had supposed to have escaped the frost of a wintry fate in either of their breasts at that moment when they stood on the utmost verge of married life one word fitly spoken or perhaps one peculiar look had they had mutual confidence enough to reciprocate it might have renewed all their old feelings and sent them back resolved to sustain each other amid the struggles of the world but the crisis passed and never came again just then also the children roused by their mothers voice looked up and added their wailing accents to the testimony borne by all the canterbury pilgrims against the world from which they fled  we are tired and hungry cried they is it far to the shaker village  the shaker youth and maiden looked mournfully into each others eyes they had but stepped across the threshold of their homes when lo the dark array of cares and sorrows that rose up to warn them back the varied narratives of the strangers had arranged themselves into a parable they seemed not merely instances of woful fate that had befallen others but shadowy omens of disappointed hope and unavailing toil domestic grief and estranged affection that would cloud the onward path of these poor fugitives but after one instants hesitation they opened their arms and sealed their resolve with as pure and fond an embrace as ever youthful love had hallowed  we will not go back said they the world never can be dark to us for we will always love one another  then the canterbury pilgrims went up the hill while the poet chanted a drear and desperate stanza of the farewell to his harp fitting music for that melancholy band they sought a home where all former ties of nature or society would be sundered and all old distinctions levelled and a cold and passionless security be substituted for mortal hope and fear as in that other refuge of the worlds weary outcasts the grave the lovers drank at the shaker spring and then with chastened hopes but more confiding affections went on to mingle in an untried life    the devil in manuscript  on a bitter evening of december i arrived by mail in a large town which was then the residence of an intimate friend one of those gifted youths who cultivate poetry and the belleslettres and call themselves students at law my first business after supper was to visit him at the office of his distinguished instructor as i have said it was a bitter night clear starlight but cold as nova zemblathe shopwindows along the street being frosted so as almost to hide the lights while the wheels of coaches thundered equally loud over frozen earth and pavements of stone there was no snow either on the ground or the roofs of the houses the wind blew so violently that i had but to spread my cloak like a mainsail and scud along the street at the rate of ten knots greatly envied by other navigators who were beating slowly up with the gale right in their teeth one of these i capsized but was gone on the wings of the wind before he could even vociferate an oath  after this picture of an inclement night behold us seated by a great blazing fire which looked so comfortable and delicious that i felt inclined to lie down and roll among the hot coals the usual furniture of a lawyers office was around usrows of volumes in sheepskin and a multitude of writs summonses and other legal papers scattered over the desks and tables but there were certain objects which seemed to intimate that we had little dread of the intrusion of clients or of the learned counsellor himself who indeed was attending court in a distant town a tall decantershaped bottle stood on the table between two tumblers and beside a pile of blotted manuscripts altogether dissimilar to any law documents recognized in our courts my friend whom i shall call oberonit was a name of fancy and friendship between him and memy friend oberon looked at these papers with a peculiar expression of disquietude  i do believe said he soberly or at least i could believe if i chose that there is a devil in this pile of blotted papers you have read them and know what i meanthat conception in which i endeavored to embody the character of a fiend as represented in our traditions and the written records of witchcraft oh i have a horror of what was created in my own brain and shudder at the manuscripts in which i gave that dark idea a sort of material existence would they were out of my sight  and of mine too thought i  you remember continued oberon how the hellish thing used to suck away the happiness of those who by a simple concession that seemed almost innocent subjected themselves to his power just so my peace is gone and all by these accursed manuscripts have you felt nothing of the same influence  nothing replied i unless the spell be hid in a desire to turn novelist after reading your delightful tales  novelist exclaimed oberon half seriously then indeed my devil has his claw on you you are gone you cannot even pray for deliverance but we will be the last and only victims for this night i mean to burn the manuscripts and commit the fiend to his retribution in the flames  burn your tales repeated i startled at the desperation of the idea  even so said the author despondingly you cannot conceive what an effect the composition of these tales has had on me i have become ambitious of a bubble and careless of solid reputation i am surrounding myself with shadows which bewilder me by aping the realities of life they have drawn me aside from the beaten path of the world and led me into a strange sort of solitudea solitude in the midst of menwhere nobody wishes for what i do nor thinks nor feels as i do the tales have done all this when they are ashes perhaps i shall be as i was before they had existence moreover the sacrifice is less than you may suppose since nobody will publish them  that does make a difference indeed said i  they have been offered by letter continued oberon reddening with vexation to some seventeen booksellers it would make you stare to read their answers and read them you should only that i burnt them as fast as they arrived one man publishes nothing but schoolbooks another has five novels already under examination  what a voluminous mass the unpublished literature of america must be cried i  oh the alexandrian manuscripts were nothing to it said my friend well another gentleman is just giving up business on purpose i verily believe to escape publishing my book several however would not absolutely decline the agency on my advancing half the cost of an edition and giving bonds for the remainder besides a high percentage to themselves whether the book sells or not another advises a subscription  the villain exclaimed i  a fact said oberon in short of all the seventeen booksellers only one has vouchsafed even to read my tales and hea literary dabbler himself i should judgehas the impertinence to criticise them proposing what he calls vast improvements and concluding after a general sentence of condemnation with the definitive assurance that he will not be concerned on any terms  it might not be amiss to pull that fellows nose remarked i  if the whole trade had one common nose there would be some satisfaction in pulling it answered the author but there does seem to be one honest man among these seventeen unrighteous ones and he tells me fairly that no american publisher will meddle with an american workseldom if by a known writer and never if by a new oneunless at the writers risk  the paltry rogues cried i will they live by literature and yet risk nothing for its sake but after all you might publish on your own account  and so i might replied oberon but the devil of the business is this these people have put me so out of conceit with the tales that i loathe the very thought of them and actually experience a physical sickness of the stomach whenever i glance at them on the table i tell you there is a demon in them i anticipate a wild enjoyment in seeing them in the blaze such as i should feel in taking vengeance on an enemy or destroying something noxious  i did not very strenuously oppose this determination being privately of opinion in spite of my partiality for the author that his tales would make a more brilliant appearance in the fire than anywhere else before proceeding to execution we broached the bottle of champagne which oberon had provided for keeping up his spirits in this doleful business we swallowed each a tumblerful in sparkling commotion it went bubbling down our throats and brightened my eyes at once but left my friend sad and heavy as before he drew the tales towards him with a mixture of natural affection and natural disgust like a father taking a deformed infant into his arms  pooh pish pshaw exclaimed he holding them at armslength it was grays idea of heaven to lounge on a sofa and read new novels now what more appropriate torture would dante himself have contrived for the sinner who perpetrates a bad book than to be continually turning over the manuscript  it would fail of effect said i because a bad author is always his own great admirer  i lack that one characteristic of my tribethe only desirable one observed oberon but how many recollections throng upon me as i turn over these leaves this scene came into my fancy as i walked along a hilly road on a starlight october evening in the pure and bracing air i became all soul and felt as if i could climb the sky and run a race along the milky way here is another tale in which i wrapt myself during a dark and dreary nightride in the month of march till the rattling of the wheels and the voices of my companions seemed like faint sounds of a dream and my visions a bright reality that scribbled page describes shadows which i summoned to my bedside at midnight they would not depart when i bade them the gray dawn came and found me wide awake and feverish the victim of my own enchantments  there must have been a sort of happiness in all this said i smitten with a strange longing to make proof of it  there may be happiness in a fever fit replied the author and then the various moods in which i wrote sometimes my ideas were like precious stones under the earth requiring toil to dig them up and care to polish and brighten them but often a delicious stream of thought would gush out upon the page at once like water sparkling up suddenly in the desert and when it had passed i gnawed my pen hopelessly or blundered on with cold and miserable toil as if there were a wall of ice between me and my subject  do you now perceive a corresponding difference inquired i between the passages which you wrote so coldly and those fervid flashes of the mind  no said oberon tossing the manuscripts on the table i find no traces of the golden pen with which i wrote in characters of fire my treasure of fairy coin is changed to worthless dross my picture painted in what seemed the loveliest hues presents nothing but a faded and indistinguishable surface i have been eloquent and poetical and humorous in a dreamand behold it is all nonsense now that i am awake  my friend now threw sticks of wood and dry chips upon the fire and seeing it blaze like nebuchadnezzars furnace seized the champagne bottle and drank two or three brimming bumpers successively the heady liquor combined with his agitation to throw him into a species of rage he laid violent hands on the tales in one instant more their faults and beauties would alike have vanished in a glowing purgatory but all at once i remembered passages of high imagination deep pathos original thoughts and points of such varied excellence that the vastness of the sacrifice struck me most forcibly i caught his arm  surely you do not mean to burn them i exclaimed  let me alone cried oberon his eyes flashing fire i will burn them not a scorched syllable shall escape would you have me a damned authorto undergo sneers taunts abuse and cold neglect and faint praise bestowed for pitys sake against the givers conscience a hissing and a laughingstock to my own traitorous thoughts an outlaw from the protection of the graveone whose ashes every careless foot might spurn unhonored in life and remembered scornfully in death am i to bear all this when yonder fire will insure me from the whole no there go the tales may my hand wither when it would write another  the deed was done he had thrown the manuscripts into the hottest of the fire which at first seemed to shrink away but soon curled around them and made them a part of its own fervent brightness oberon stood gazing at the conflagration and shortly began to soliloquize in the wildest strain as if fancy resisted and became riotous at the moment when he would have compelled her to ascend that funeral pile his words described objects which he appeared to discern in the fire fed by his own precious thoughts perhaps the thousand visions which the writers magic had incorporated with these pages became visible to him in the dissolving heat brightening forth ere they vanished forever while the smoke the vivid sheets of flame the ruddy and whitening coals caught the aspect of a varied scenery  they blaze said he as if i had steeped them in the intensest spirit of genius there i see my lovers clasped in each others arms how pure the flame that bursts from their glowing hearts and yonder the features of a villain writhing in the fire that shall torment him to eternity my holy men my pious and angelic women stand like martyrs amid the flames their mild eyes lifted heavenward ring out the bells a city is on fire seedestruction roars through my dark forests while the lakes boil up in steaming billows and the mountains are volcanoes and the sky kindles with a lurid brightness all elements are but one pervading flame ha the fiend  i was somewhat startled by this latter exclamation the tales were almost consumed but just then threw forth a broad sheet of fire which flickered as with laughter making the whole room dance in its brightness and then roared portentously up the chimney  you saw him you must have seen him cried oberon how he glared at me and laughed in that last sheet of flame with just the features that i imagined for him well the tales are gone  the papers were indeed reduced to a heap of black cinders with a multitude of sparks hurrying confusedly among them the traces of the pen being now represented by white lines and the whole mass fluttering to and fro in the draughts of air the destroyer knelt down to look at them  what is more potent than fire said he in his gloomiest tone even thought invisible and incorporeal as it is cannot escape it in this little time it has annihilated the creations of long nights and days which i could no more reproduce in their first glow and freshness than cause ashes and whitened bones to rise up and live there too i sacrificed the unborn children of my mind all that i had accomplishedall that i planned for future yearshas perished by one common ruin and left only this heap of embers the deed has been my fate and what remains a weary and aimless lifea long repentance of this hourand at last an obscure grave where they will bury and forget me  as the author concluded his dolorous moan the extinguished embers arose and settled down and arose again and finally flew up the chimney like a demon with sable wings just as they disappeared there was a loud and solitary cry in the street below us fire fire other voices caught up that terrible word and it speedily became the shout of a multitude oberon started to his feet in fresh excitement  a fire on such a night cried he the wind blows a gale and wherever it whirls the flames the roofs will flash up like gunpowder every pump is frozen up and boiling water would turn to ice the moment it was flung from the engine in an hour this wooden town will be one great bonfire what a glorious scene for my nextpshaw  the street was now all alive with footsteps and the air full of voices we heard one engine thundering round a corner and another rattling from a distance over the pavements the bells of three steeples clanged out at once spreading the alarm to many a neighboring town and expressing hurry confusion and terror so inimitably that i could almost distinguish in their peal the burden of the universal cryfire fire fire  what is so eloquent as their iron tongues exclaimed oberon my heart leaps and trembles but not with fear and that other sound toodeep and awful as a mighty organthe roar and thunder of the multitude on the pavement below come we are losing time i will cry out in the loudest of the uproar and mingle my spirit with the wildest of the confusion and be a bubble on the top of the ferment  from the first outcry my forebodings had warned me of the true object and centre of alarm there was nothing now but uproar above beneath and around us footsteps stumbling pellmell up the public staircase eager shouts and heavy thumps at the door the whiz and dash of water from the engines and the crash of furniture thrown upon the pavement at once the truth flashed upon my friend his frenzy took the hue of joy and with a wild gesture of exultation he leaped almost to the ceiling of the chamber  my tales cried oberon the chimney the roof the fiend has gone forth by night and startled thousands in fear and wonder from their beds here i standa triumphant author huzza huzza my brain has set the town on fire huzza    my kinsman major molineux  after the kings of great britain had assumed the right of appointing the colonial governors the measures of the latter seldom met with the ready and generous approbation which had been paid to those of their predecessors under the original charters the people looked with most jealous scrutiny to the exercise of power which did not emanate from themselves and they usually rewarded their rulers with slender gratitude for the compliances by which in softening their instructions from beyond the sea they had incurred the reprehension of those who gave them the annals of massachusetts bay will inform us that of six governors in the space of about forty years from the surrender of the old charter under james ii two were imprisoned by a popular insurrection a third as hutchinson inclines to believe was driven from the province by the whizzing of a musketball a fourth in the opinion of the same historian was hastened to his grave by continual bickerings with the house of representatives and the remaining two as well as their successors till the revolution were favored with few and brief intervals of peaceful sway the inferior members of the court party in times of high political excitement led scarcely a more desirable life these remarks may serve as a preface to the following adventures which chanced upon a summer night not far from a hundred years ago the reader in order to avoid a long and dry detail of colonial affairs is requested to dispense with an account of the train of circumstances that had caused much temporary inflammation of the popular mind  it was near nine oclock of a moonlight evening when a boat crossed the ferry with a single passenger who had obtained his conveyance at that unusual hour by the promise of an extra fare while he stood on the landingplace searching in either pocket for the means of fulfilling his agreement the ferryman lifted a lantern by the aid of which and the newly risen moon he took a very accurate survey of the strangers figure he was a youth of barely eighteen years evidently countrybred and now as it should seem upon his first visit to town he was clad in a coarse gray coat well worn but in excellent repair his under garments were durably constructed of leather and fitted tight to a pair of serviceable and wellshaped limbs his stockings of blue yarn were the incontrovertible work of a mother or a sister and on his head was a threecornered hat which in its better days had perhaps sheltered the graver brow of the lads father under his left arm was a heavy cudgel formed of an oak sapling and retaining a part of the hardened root and his equipment was completed by a wallet not so abundantly stocked as to incommode the vigorous shoulders on which it hung brown curly hair wellshaped features and bright cheerful eyes were natures gifts and worth all that art could have done for his adornment  the youth one of whose names was robin finally drew from his pocket the half of a little province bill of five shillings which in the depreciation in that sort of currency did but satisfy the ferrymans demand with the surplus of a sexangular piece of parchment valued at three pence he then walked forward into the town with as light a step as if his days journey had not already exceeded thirty miles and with as eager an eye as if he were entering london city instead of the little metropolis of a new england colony before robin had proceeded far however it occurred to him that he knew not whither to direct his steps so he paused and looked up and down the narrow street scrutinizing the small and mean wooden buildings that were scattered on either side  this low hovel cannot be my kinsmans dwelling thought he nor yonder old house where the moonlight enters at the broken casement and truly i see none hereabouts that might be worthy of him it would have been wise to inquire my way of the ferryman and doubtless he would have gone with me and earned a shilling from the major for his pains but the next man i meet will do as well  he resumed his walk and was glad to perceive that the street now became wider and the houses more respectable in their appearance he soon discerned a figure moving on moderately in advance and hastened his steps to overtake it as robin drew nigh he saw that the passenger was a man in years with a full periwig of gray hair a wideskirted coat of dark cloth and silk stockings rolled above his knees he carried a long and polished cane which he struck down perpendicularly before him at every step and at regular intervals he uttered two successive hems of a peculiarly solemn and sepulchral intonation having made these observations robin laid hold of the skirt of the old mans coat just when the light from the open door and windows of a barbers shop fell upon both their figures  good evening to you honored sir said he making a low bow and still retaining his hold of the skirt i pray you tell me whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman major molineux  the youths question was uttered very loudly and one of the barbers whose razor was descending on a wellsoaped chin and another who was dressing a ramillies wig left their occupations and came to the door the citizen in the mean time turned a longfavored countenance upon robin and answered him in a tone of excessive anger and annoyance his two sepulchral hems however broke into the very centre of his rebuke with most singular effect like a thought of the cold grave obtruding among wrathful passions  let go my garment fellow i tell you i know not the man you speak of what i have authority i havehem hemauthority and if this be the respect you show for your betters your feet shall be brought acquainted with the stocks by daylight tomorrow morning  robin released the old mans skirt and hastened away pursued by an illmannered roar of laughter from the barbers shop he was at first considerably surprised by the result of his question but being a shrewd youth soon thought himself able to account for the mystery  this is some country representative was his conclusion who has never seen the inside of my kinsmans door and lacks the breeding to answer a stranger civilly the man is old or verilyi might be tempted to turn back and smite him on the nose ah robin robin even the barbers boys laugh at you for choosing such a guide you will be wiser in time friend robin  he now became entangled in a succession of crooked and narrow streets which crossed each other and meandered at no great distance from the waterside the smell of tar was obvious to his nostrils the masts of vessels pierced the moonlight above the tops of the buildings and the numerous signs which robin paused to read informed him that he was near the centre of business but the streets were empty the shops were closed and lights were visible only in the second stories of a few dwellinghouses at length on the corner of a narrow lane through which he was passing he beheld the broad countenance of a british hero swinging before the door of an inn whence proceeded the voices of many guests the casement of one of the lower windows was thrown back and a very thin curtain permitted robin to distinguish a party at supper round a wellfurnished table the fragrance of the good cheer steamed forth into the outer air and the youth could not fail to recollect that the last remnant of his travelling stock of provision had yielded to his morning appetite and that noon had found and left him dinnerless  oh that a parchment threepenny might give me a right to sit down at yonder table said robin with a sigh but the major will make me welcome to the best of his victuals so i will even step boldly in and inquire my way to his dwelling  he entered the tavern and was guided by the murmur of voices and the fumes of tobacco to the publicroom it was a long and low apartment with oaken walls grown dark in the continual smoke and a floor which was thickly sanded but of no immaculate purity a number of personsthe larger part of whom appeared to be mariners or in some way connected with the seaoccupied the wooden benches or leatherbottomed chairs conversing on various matters and occasionally lending their attention to some topic of general interest three or four little groups were draining as many bowls of punch which the west india trade had long since made a familiar drink in the colony others who had the appearance of men who lived by regular and laborious handicraft preferred the insulated bliss of an unshared potation and became more taciturn under its influence nearly all in short evinced a predilection for the good creature in some of its various shapes for this is a vice to which as fast day sermons of a hundred years ago will testify we have a long hereditary claim the only guests to whom robins sympathies inclined him were two or three sheepish countrymen who were using the inn somewhat after the fashion of a turkish caravansary they had gotten themselves into the darkest corner of the room and heedless of the nicotian atmosphere were supping on the bread of their own ovens and the bacon cured in their own chimneysmoke but though robin felt a sort of brotherhood with these strangers his eyes were attracted from them to a person who stood near the door holding whispered conversation with a group of illdressed associates his features were separately striking almost to grotesqueness and the whole face left a deep impression on the memory the forehead bulged out into a double prominence with a vale between the nose came boldly forth in an irregular curve and its bridge was of more than a fingers breadth the eyebrows were deep and shaggy and the eyes glowed beneath them like fire in a cave  while robin deliberated of whom to inquire respecting his kinsmans dwelling he was accosted by the innkeeper a little man in a stained white apron who had come to pay his professional welcome to the stranger being in the second generation from a french protestant he seemed to have inherited the courtesy of his parent nation but no variety of circumstances was ever known to change his voice from the one shrill note in which he now addressed robin  from the country i presume sir said he with a profound bow beg leave to congratulate you on your arrival and trust you intend a long stay with us fine town here sir beautiful buildings and much that may interest a stranger may i hope for the honor of your commands in respect to supper  the man sees a family likeness the rogue has guessed that i am related to the major thought robin who had hitherto experienced little superfluous civility  all eyes were now turned on the country lad standing at the door in his worn threecornered hat gray coat leather breeches and blue yarn stockings leaning on an oaken cudgel and bearing a wallet on his back  robin replied to the courteous innkeeper with such an assumption of confidence as befitted the majors relative my honest friend he said i shall make it a point to patronize your house on some occasion whenhere he could not help lowering his voicewhen i may have more than a parchment threepence in my pocket my present business continued he speaking with lofty confidence is merely to inquire my way to the dwelling of my kinsman major molineux  there was a sudden and general movement in the room which robin interpreted as expressing the eagerness of each individual to become his guide but the innkeeper turned his eyes to a written paper on the wall which he read or seemed to read with occasional recurrences to the young mans figure  what have we here said he breaking his speech into little dry fragments left the house of the subscriber bounden servant hezekiah mudgehad on when he went away gray coat leather breeches masters thirdbest hat one pound currency reward to whosoever shall lodge him in any jail of the providence better trudge boy better trudge  robin had begun to draw his hand towards the lighter end of the oak cudgel but a strange hostility in every countenance induced him to relinquish his purpose of breaking the courteous innkeepers head as he turned to leave the room he encountered a sneering glance from the boldfeatured personage whom he had before noticed and no sooner was he beyond the door than he heard a general laugh in which the innkeepers voice might be distinguished like the dropping of small stones into a kettle  now is it not strange thought robin with his usual shrewdness is it not strange that the confession of an empty pocket should outweigh the name of my kinsman major molineux oh if i had one of those grinning rascals in the woods where i and my oak sapling grew up together i would teach him that my arm is heavy though my purse be light  on turning the corner of the narrow lane robin found himself in a spacious street with an unbroken line of lofty houses on each side and a steepled building at the upper end whence the ringing of a bell announced the hour of nine the light of the moon and the lamps from the numerous shopwindows discovered people promenading on the pavement and amongst them robin had hoped to recognize his hitherto inscrutable relative the result of his former inquiries made him unwilling to hazard another in a scene of such publicity and he determined to walk slowly and silently up the street thrusting his face close to that of every elderly gentleman in search of the majors lineaments in his progress robin encountered many gay and gallant figures embroidered garments of showy colors enormous periwigs goldlaced hats and silverhilted swords glided past him and dazzled his optics travelled youths imitators of the european fine gentlemen of the period trod jauntily along half dancing to the fashionable tunes which they hummed and making poor robin ashamed of his quiet and natural gait at length after many pauses to examine the gorgeous display of goods in the shopwindows and after suffering some rebukes for the impertinence of his scrutiny into peoples faces the majors kinsman found himself near the steepled building still unsuccessful in his search as yet however he had seen only one side of the thronged street so robin crossed and continued the same sort of inquisition down the opposite pavement with stronger hopes than the philosopher seeking an honest man but with no better fortune he had arrived about midway towards the lower end from which his course began when he overheard the approach of some one who struck down a cane on the flagstones at every step uttering at regular intervals two sepulchral hems  mercy on us quoth robin recognizing the sound  turning a corner which chanced to be close at his right hand he hastened to pursue his researches in some other part of the town his patience now was wearing low and he seemed to feel more fatigue from his rambles since he crossed the ferry than from his journey of several days on the other side hunger also pleaded loudly within him and robin began to balance the propriety of demanding violently and with lifted cudgel the necessary guidance from the first solitary passenger whom he should meet while a resolution to this effect was gaining strength he entered a street of mean appearance on either side of which a row of illbuilt houses was straggling towards the harbor the moonlight fell upon no passenger along the whole extent but in the third domicile which robin passed there was a halfopened door and his keen glance detected a womans garment within  my luck may be better here said he to himself  accordingly he approached the doors and beheld it shut closer as he did so yet an open space remained sufficing for the fair occupant to observe the stranger without a corresponding display on her part all that robin could discern was a strip of scarlet petticoat and the occasional sparkle of an eye as if the moonbeams were trembling on some bright thing  pretty mistress for i may call her so with a good conscience thought the shrewd youth since i know nothing to the contrarymy sweet pretty mistress will you be kind enough to tell me whereabouts i must seek the dwelling of my kinsman major molineux  robins voice was plaintive and winning and the female seeing nothing to be shunned in the handsome country youth thrust open the door and came forth into the moonlight she was a dainty little figure with a white neck round arms and a slender waist at the extremity of which her scarlet petticoat jutted out over a hoop as if she were standing in a balloon moreover her face was oval and pretty her hair dark beneath the little cap and her bright eyes possessed a sly freedom which triumphed over those of robin  major molineux dwells here said this fair woman  now her voice was the sweetest robin had heard that night yet he could not help doubting whether that sweet voice spoke gospel truth he looked up and down the mean street and then surveyed the house before which they stood it was a small dark edifice of two stories the second of which projected over the lower floor and the front apartment had the aspect of a shop for petty commodities  now truly i am in luck replied robin cunningly and so indeed is my kinsman the major in having so pretty a housekeeper but i prithee trouble him to step to the door i will deliver him a message from his friends in the country and then go back to my lodgings at the inn  nay the major has been abed this hour or more said the lady of the scarlet petticoat and it would be to little purpose to disturb him tonight seeing his evening draught was of the strongest but he is a kindhearted man and it would be as much as my lifes worth to let a kinsman of his turn away from the door you are the good old gentlemans very picture and i could swear that was his rainyweather hat also he has garments very much resembling those leather smallclothes but come in i pray for i bid you hearty welcome in his name  so saying the fair and hospitable dame took our hero by the hand and the touch was light and the force was gentleness and though robin read in her eyes what he did not hear in her words yet the slenderwaisted woman in the scarlet petticoat proved stronger than the athletic country youth she had drawn his halfwilling footsteps nearly to the threshold when the opening of a door in the neighborhood startled the majors housekeeper and leaving the majors kinsman she vanished speedily into her own domicile a heavy yawn preceded the appearance of a man who like the moonshine of pyramus and thisbe carried a lantern needlessly aiding his sister luminary in the heavens as he walked sleepily up the street he turned his broad dull face on robin and displayed a long staff spiked at the end  home vagabond home said the watchman in accents that seemed to fall asleep as soon as they were uttered home or well set you in the stocks by peep of day  this is the second hint of the kind thought robin i wish they would end my difficulties by setting me there tonight  nevertheless the youth felt an instinctive antipathy towards the guardian of midnight order which at first prevented him from asking his usual question but just when the man was about to vanish behind the corner robin resolved not to lose the opportunity and shouted lustily after him i say friend will you guide me to the house of my kinsman major molineux  the watchman made no reply but turned the corner and was gone yet robin seemed to hear the sound of drowsy laughter stealing along the solitary street at that moment also a pleasant titter saluted him from the open window above his head he looked up and caught the sparkle of a saucy eye a round arm beckoned to him and next he heard light footsteps descending the staircase within but robin being of the household of a new england clergyman was a good youth as well as a shrewd one so he resisted temptation and fled away  he now roamed desperately and at random through the town almost ready to believe that a spell was on him like that by which a wizard of his country had once kept three pursuers wandering a whole winter night within twenty paces of the cottage which they sought the streets lay before him strange and desolate and the lights were extinguished in almost every house twice however little parties of men among whom robin distinguished individuals in outlandish attire came hurrying along but though on both occasions they paused to address him such intercourse did not at all enlighten his perplexity they did but utter a few words in some language of which robin knew nothing and perceiving his inability to answer bestowed a curse upon him in plain english and hastened away finally the lad determined to knock at the door of every mansion that might appear worthy to be occupied by his kinsman trusting that perseverance would overcome the fatality that had hitherto thwarted him firm in this resolve he was passing beneath the walls of a church which formed the corner of two streets when as he turned into the shade of its steeple he encountered a bulky stranger muffled in a cloak the man was proceeding with the speed of earnest business but robin planted himself full before him holding the oak cudgel with both hands across his body as a bar to further passage  halt honest man and answer me a question said he very resolutely tell me this instant whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman major molineux  keep your tongue between your teeth fool and let me pass said a deep gruff voice which robin partly remembered let me pass or ill strike you to the earth  no no neighbor cried robin flourishing his cudgel and then thrusting its larger end close to the mans muffled face no no im not the fool you take me for nor do you pass till i have an answer to my question whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman major molineux the stranger instead of attempting to force his passage stepped back into the moonlight unmuffled his face and stared full into that of robin  watch here an hour and major molineux will pass by said he  robin gazed with dismay and astonishment on the unprecedented physiognomy of the speaker the forehead with its double prominence the broad hooked nose the shaggy eyebrows and fiery eyes were those which he had noticed at the inn but the mans complexion had undergone a singular or more properly a twofold change one side of the face blazed an intense red while the other was black as midnight the division line being in the broad bridge of the nose and a mouth which seemed to extend from ear to ear was black or red in contrast to the color of the cheek the effect was as if two individual devils a fiend of fire and a fiend of darkness had united themselves to form this infernal visage the stranger grinned in robins face muffled his partycolored features and was out of sight in a moment  strange things we travellers see ejaculated robin  he seated himself however upon the steps of the churchdoor resolving to wait the appointed time for his kinsman a few moments were consumed in philosophical speculations upon the species of man who had just left him but having settled this point shrewdly rationally and satisfactorily he was compelled to look elsewhere for his amusement and first he threw his eyes along the street it was of more respectable appearance than most of those into which he had wandered and the moon creating like the imaginative power a beautiful strangeness in familiar objects gave something of romance to a scene that might not have possessed it in the light of day the irregular and often quaint architecture of the houses some of whose roofs were broken into numerous little peaks while others ascended steep and narrow into a single point and others again were square the pure snowwhite of some of their complexions the aged darkness of others and the thousand sparklings reflected from bright substances in the walls of many these matters engaged robins attention for a while and then began to grow wearisome next he endeavored to define the forms of distant objects starting away with almost ghostly indistinctness just as his eye appeared to grasp them and finally he took a minute survey of an edifice which stood on the opposite side of the street directly in front of the churchdoor where he was stationed it was a large square mansion distinguished from its neighbors by a balcony which rested on tall pillars and by an elaborate gothic window communicating therewith  perhaps this is the very house i have been seeking thought robin  then he strove to speed away the time by listening to a murmur which swept continually along the street yet was scarcely audible except to an unaccustomed ear like his it was a low dull dreamy sound compounded of many noises each of which was at too great a distance to be separately heard robin marvelled at this snore of a sleeping town and marvelled more whenever its continuity was broken by now and then a distant shout apparently loud where it originated but altogether it was a sleepinspiring sound and to shake off its drowsy influence robin arose and climbed a windowframe that he might view the interior of the church there the moonbeams came trembling in and fell down upon the deserted pews and extended along the quiet aisles a fainter yet more awful radiance was hovering around the pulpit and one solitary ray had dared to rest upon the open page of the great bible had nature in that deep hour become a worshipper in the house which man had builded or was that heavenly light the visible sanctity of the placevisible because no earthly and impure feet were within the walls the scene made robins heart shiver with a sensation of loneliness stronger than he had ever felt in the remotest depths of his native woods so he turned away and sat down again before the door there were graves around the church and now an uneasy thought obtruded into robins breast what if the object of his search which had been so often and so strangely thwarted were all the time mouldering in his shroud what if his kinsman should glide through yonder gate and nod and smile to him in dimly passing by  oh that any breathing thing were here with me said robin  recalling his thoughts from this uncomfortable track he sent them over forest hill and stream and attempted to imagine how that evening of ambiguity and weariness had been spent by his fathers household he pictured them assembled at the door beneath the tree the great old tree which had been spared for its huge twisted trunk and venerable shade when a thousand leafy brethren fell there at the going down of the summer sun it was his fathers custom to perform domestic worship that the neighbors might come and join with him like brothers of the family and that the wayfaring man might pause to drink at that fountain and keep his heart pure by freshening the memory of home robin distinguished the seat of every individual of the little audience he saw the good man in the midst holding the scriptures in the golden light that fell from the western clouds he beheld him close the book and all rise up to pray he heard the old thanksgivings for daily mercies the old supplications for their continuance to which he had so often listened in weariness but which were now among his dear remembrances he perceived the slight inequality of his fathers voice when he came to speak of the absent one he noted how his mother turned her face to the broad and knotted trunk how his elder brother scorned because the beard was rough upon his upper lip to permit his features to be moved how the younger sister drew down a low hanging branch before her eyes and how the little one of all whose sports had hitherto broken the decorum of the scene understood the prayer for her playmate and burst into clamorous grief then he saw them go in at the door and when robin would have entered also the latch tinkled into its place and he was excluded from his home  am i here or there cried robin starting for all at once when his thoughts had become visible and audible in a dream the long wide solitary street shone out before him  he aroused himself and endeavored to fix his attention steadily upon the large edifice which he had surveyed before but still his mind kept vibrating between fancy and reality by turns the pillars of the balcony lengthened into the tall bare stems of pines dwindled down to human figures settled again into their true shape and size and then commenced a new succession of changes for a single moment when he deemed himself awake he could have sworn that a visageone which he seemed to remember yet could not absolutely name as his kinsmanswas looking towards him from the gothic window a deeper sleep wrestled with and nearly overcame him but fled at the sound of footsteps along the opposite pavement robin rubbed his eyes discerned a man passing at the foot of the balcony and addressed him in a loud peevish and lamentable cry  hallo friend must i wait here all night for my kinsman major molineux  the sleeping echoes awoke and answered the voice and the passenger barely able to discern a figure sitting in the oblique shade of the steeple traversed the street to obtain a nearer view he was himself a gentleman in his prime of open intelligent cheerful and altogether prepossessing countenance perceiving a country youth apparently homeless and without friends he accosted him in a tone of real kindness which had become strange to robins ears  well my good lad why are you sitting here inquired he can i be of service to you in any way  i am afraid not sir replied robin despondingly yet i shall take it kindly if youll answer me a single question ive been searching half the night for one major molineux now sir is there really such a person in these parts or am i dreaming  major molineux the name is not altogether strange to me said the gentleman smiling have you any objection to telling me the nature of your business with him  then robin briefly related that his father was a clergyman settled on a small salary at a long distance back in the country and that he and major molineux were brothers children the major having inherited riches and acquired civil and military rank had visited his cousin in great pomp a year or two before had manifested much interest in robin and an elder brother and being childless himself had thrown out hints respecting the future establishment of one of them in life the elder brother was destined to succeed to the farm which his father cultivated in the interval of sacred duties it was therefore determined that robin should profit by his kinsmans generous intentions especially as he seemed to be rather the favorite and was thought to possess other necessary endowments  for i have the name of being a shrewd youth observed robin in this part of his story  i doubt not you deserve it replied his new friend goodnaturedly but pray proceed  well sir being nearly eighteen years old and well grown as you see continued robin drawing himself up to his full height i thought it high time to begin in the world so my mother and sister put me in handsome trim and my father gave me half the remnant of his last years salary and five days ago i started for this place to pay the major a visit but would you believe it sir i crossed the ferry a little after dark and have yet found nobody that would show me the way to his dwelling only an hour or two since i was told to wait here and major molineux would pass by  can you describe the man who told you this inquired the gentleman  oh he was a very illfavored fellow sir replied robin with two great bumps on his forehead a hook nose fiery eyes and what struck me as the strangest his face was of two different colors do you happen to know such a man sir  not intimately answered the stranger but i chanced to meet him a little time previous to your stopping me i believe you may trust his word and that the major will very shortly pass through this street in the mean time as i have a singular curiosity to witness your meeting i will sit down here upon the steps and bear you company  he seated himself accordingly and soon engaged his companion in animated discourse it was but of brief continuance however for a noise of shouting which had long been remotely audible drew so much nearer that robin inquired its cause  what may be the meaning of this uproar asked he truly if your town be always as noisy i shall find little sleep while i am an inhabitant  why indeed friend robin there do appear to be three or four riotous fellows abroad tonight replied the gentleman you must not expect all the stillness of your native woods here in our streets but the watch will shortly be at the heels of these lads and  ay and set them in the stocks by peep of day interrupted robin recollecting his own encounter with the drowsy lanternbearer but dear sir if i may trust my ears an army of watchmen would never make head against such a multitude of rioters there were at least a thousand voices went up to make that one shout  may not a man have several voices robin as well as two complexions said his friend  perhaps a man may but heaven forbid that a woman should responded the shrewd youth thinking of the seductive tones of the majors housekeeper  the sounds of a trumpet in some neighboring street now became so evident and continual that robins curiosity was strongly excited in addition to the shouts he heard frequent bursts from many instruments of discord and a wild and confused laughter filled up the intervals robin rose from the steps and looked wistfully towards a point whither people seemed to be hastening  surely some prodigious merrymaking is going on exclaimed he i have laughed very little since i left home sir and should be sorry to lose an opportunity shall we step round the corner by that darkish house and take our share of the fun  sit down again sit down good robin replied the gentleman laying his hand on the skirt of the gray coat you forget that we must wait here for your kinsman and there is reason to believe that he will pass by in the course of a very few moments  the near approach of the uproar had now disturbed the neighborhood windows flew open on all sides and many heads in the attire of the pillow and confused by sleep suddenly broken were protruded to the gaze of whoever had leisure to observe them eager voices hailed each other from house to house all demanding the explanation which not a soul could give halfdressed men hurried towards the unknown commotion stumbling as they went over the stone steps that thrust themselves into the narrow footwalk the shouts the laughter and the tuneless bray the antipodes of music came onwards with increasing din till scattered individuals and then denser bodies began to appear round a corner at the distance of a hundred yards  will you recognize your kinsman if he passes in this crowd inquired the gentleman  indeed i cant warrant it sir but ill take my stand here and keep a bright lookout answered robin descending to the outer edge of the pavement  a mighty stream of people now emptied into the street and came rolling slowly towards the church a single horseman wheeled the corner in the midst of them and close behind him came a band of fearful wind instruments sending forth a fresher discord now that no intervening buildings kept it from the ear then a redder light disturbed the moonbeams and a dense multitude of torches shone along the street concealing by their glare whatever object they illuminated the single horseman clad in a military dress and bearing a drawn sword rode onward as the leader and by his fierce and variegated countenance appeared like war personified the red of one cheek was an emblem of fire and sword the blackness of the other betokened the mourning that attends them in his train were wild figures in the indian dress and many fantastic shapes without a model giving the whole march a visionary air as if a dream had broken forth from some feverish brain and were sweeping visibly through the midnight streets a mass of people inactive except as applauding spectators hemmed the procession in and several women ran along the sidewalk piercing the confusion of heavier sounds with their shrill voices of mirth or terror  the doublefaced fellow has his eye upon me muttered robin with an indefinite but an uncomfortable idea that he was himself to bear a part in the pageantry  the leader turned himself in the saddle and fixed his glance full upon the country youth as the steed went slowly by when robin had freed his eyes from those fiery ones the musicians were passing before him and the torches were close at hand but the unsteady brightness of the latter formed a veil which he could not penetrate the rattling of wheels over the stones sometimes found its way to his ear and confused traces of a human form appeared at intervals and then melted into the vivid light a moment more and the leader thundered a command to halt the trumpets vomited a horrid breath and then held their peace the shouts and laughter of the people died away and there remained only a universal hum allied to silence right before robins eyes was an uncovered cart there the torches blazed the brightest there the moon shone out like day and there in tarandfeathery dignity sat his kinsman major molineux  he was an elderly man of large and majestic person and strong square features betokening a steady soul but steady as it was his enemies had found means to shake it his face was pale as death and far more ghastly the broad forehead was contracted in his agony so that his eyebrows formed one grizzled line his eyes were red and wild and the foam hung white upon his quivering lip his whole frame was agitated by a quick and continual tremor which his pride strove to quell even in those circumstances of overwhelming humiliation but perhaps the bitterest pang of all was when his eyes met those of robin for he evidently knew him on the instant as the youth stood witnessing the foul disgrace of a head grown gray in honor they stared at each other in silence and robins knees shook and his hair bristled with a mixture of pity and terror soon however a bewildering excitement began to seize upon his mind the preceding adventures of the night the unexpected appearance of the crowd the torches the confused din and the hush that followed the spectre of his kinsman reviled by that great multitudeall this and more than all a perception of tremendous ridicule in the whole scene affected him with a sort of mental inebriety at that moment a voice of sluggish merriment saluted robins ears he turned instinctively and just behind the corner of the church stood the lanternbearer rubbing his eyes and drowsily enjoying the lads amazement then he heard a peal of laughter like the ringing of silvery bells a woman twitched his arm a saucy eye met his and he saw the lady of the scarlet petticoat a sharp dry cachinnation appealed to his memory and standing on tiptoe in the crowd with his white apron over his head he beheld the courteous little innkeeper and lastly there sailed over the heads of the multitude a great broad laugh broken in the midst by two sepulchral hems thus haw haw hawhem hemhaw haw haw haw  the sound proceeded from the balcony of the opposite edifice and thither robin turned his eyes in front of the gothic window stood the old citizen wrapped in a wide gown his gray periwig exchanged for a nightcap which was thrust back from his forehead and his silk stockings hanging about his legs he supported himself on his polished cane in a fit of convulsive merriment which manifested itself on his solemn old features like a funny inscription on a tombstone then robin seemed to hear the voices of the barbers of the guests of the inn and of all who had made sport of him that night the contagion was spreading among the multitude when all at once it seized upon robin and he sent forth a shout of laughter that echoed through the streetevery man shook his sides every man emptied his lungs but robins shout was the loudest there the cloudspirits peeped from their silvery islands as the congregated mirth went roaring up the sky the man in the moon heard the far bellow oho quoth he the old earth is frolicsome tonight  when there was a momentary calm in that tempestuous sea of sound the leader gave the sign the procession resumed its march on they went like fiends that throng in mockery around some dead potentate mighty no more but majestic still in his agony on they went in counterfeited pomp in senseless uproar in frenzied merriment trampling all on an old mans heart on swept the tumult and left a silent street behind                                  well robin are you dreaming inquired the gentleman laying his hand on the youths shoulder  robin started and withdrew his arm from the stone post to which he had instinctively clung as the living stream rolled by him his cheek was somewhat pale and his eye not quite as lively as in the earlier part of the evening  will you be kind enough to show me the way to the ferry said he after a moments pause  you have then adopted a new subject of inquiry observed his companion with a smile  why yes sir replied robin rather dryly thanks to you and to my other friends i have at last met my kinsman and he will scarce desire to see my face again i begin to grow weary of a town life sir will you show me the way to the ferry  no my good friend robinnot tonight at least said the gentleman some few days hence if you wish it i will speed you on your journey or if you prefer to remain with us perhaps as you are a shrewd youth you may rise in the world without the help of your kinsman major molineux
