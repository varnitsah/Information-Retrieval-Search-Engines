youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic marvelous and manifestly unreal  the winged fairies of grimm and andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations  yet the old time fairy tale having served for generations may now be classed as historical in the childrens library for the time has come for a series of newer wonder tales in which the stereotyped genie dwarf and fairy are eliminated together with all the horrible and bloodcurdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale  modern education includes morality therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident  having this thought in mind the story of the wonderful wizard of oz was written solely to please children of today  it aspires to being a modernized fairy tale in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out   l frank baum  chicago april 1900     the wonderful wizard of oz     1  the cyclone   dorothy lived in the midst of the great kansas prairies with uncle henry who was a farmer and aunt em who was the farmers wife  their house was small for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles  there were four walls a floor and a roof which made one room and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove a cupboard for the dishes a table three or four chairs and the beds  uncle henry and aunt em had a big bed in one corner and dorothy a little bed in another corner  there was no garret at all and no cellarexcept a small hole dug in the ground called a cyclone cellar where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose mighty enough to crush any building in its path  it was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole  when dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side  not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions  the sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass with little cracks running through it  even the grass was not green for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere  once the house had been painted but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else  when aunt em came there to live she was a young pretty wife  the sun and wind had changed her too  they had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips and they were gray also  she was thin and gaunt and never smiled now  when dorothy who was an orphan first came to her aunt em had been so startled by the childs laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever dorothys merry voice reached her ears and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at  uncle henry never laughed  he worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was  he was gray also from his long beard to his rough boots and he looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke  it was toto that made dorothy laugh and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings  toto was not gray he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny wee nose  toto played all day long and dorothy played with him and loved him dearly  today however they were not playing  uncle henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky which was even grayer than usual  dorothy stood in the door with toto in her arms and looked at the sky too  aunt em was washing the dishes  from the far north they heard a low wail of the wind and uncle henry and dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm  there now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also  suddenly uncle henry stood up  theres a cyclone coming em he called to his wife  ill go look after the stock  then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept  aunt em dropped her work and came to the door  one glance told her of the danger close at hand  quick dorothy she screamed  run for the cellar  toto jumped out of dorothys arms and hid under the bed and the girl started to get him  aunt em badly frightened threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small dark hole  dorothy caught toto at last and started to follow her aunt when she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor  then a strange thing happened  the house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air  dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon  the north and south winds met where the house stood and made it the exact center of the cyclone  in the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher until it was at the very top of the cyclone and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather  it was very dark and the wind howled horribly around her but dorothy found she was riding quite easily  after the first few whirls around and one other time when the house tipped badly she felt as if she were being rocked gently like a baby in a cradle  toto did not like it  he ran about the room now here now there barking loudly but dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen  once toto got too near the open trap door and fell in and at first the little girl thought she had lost him  but soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall  she crept to the hole caught toto by the ear and dragged him into the room again afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen  hour after hour passed away and slowly dorothy got over her fright but she felt quite lonely and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf  at first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring  at last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed and lay down upon it and toto followed and lay down beside her  in spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep     2  the council with the munchkins   she was awakened by a shock so sudden and severe that if dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt  as it was the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened and toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving nor was it dark for the bright sunshine came in at the window flooding the little room  she sprang from her bed and with toto at her heels ran and opened the door  the little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw  the cyclone had set the house down very gentlyfor a cyclonein the midst of a country of marvelous beauty  there were lovely patches of greensward all about with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits  banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes a little way off was a small brook rushing and sparkling along between green banks and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry gray prairies  while she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen  they were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to but neither were they very small  in fact they seemed about as tall as dorothy who was a wellgrown child for her age although they were so far as looks go many years older  three were men and one a woman and all were oddly dressed  they wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved  the hats of the men were blue the little womans hat was white and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders  over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds  the men were dressed in blue of the same shade as their hats and wore wellpolished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops  the men dorothy thought were about as old as uncle henry for two of them had beards  but the little woman was doubtless much older  her face was covered with wrinkles her hair was nearly white and she walked rather stiffly  when these people drew near the house where dorothy was standing in the doorway they paused and whispered among themselves as if afraid to come farther  but the little old woman walked up to dorothy made a low bow and said in a sweet voice  you are welcome most noble sorceress to the land of the munchkins we are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked witch of the east and for setting our people free from bondage  dorothy listened to this speech with wonder  what could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress and saying she had killed the wicked witch of the east  dorothy was an innocent harmless little girl who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home and she had never killed anything in all her life  but the little woman evidently expected her to answer so dorothy said with hesitation you are very kind but there must be some mistake  i have not killed anything  your house did anyway replied the little old woman with a laugh and that is the same thing  see she continued pointing to the corner of the house  there are her two feet still sticking out from under a block of wood  dorothy looked and gave a little cry of fright  there indeed just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on two feet were sticking out shod in silver shoes with pointed toes  oh dear  oh dear cried dorothy clasping her hands together in dismay  the house must have fallen on her  whatever shall we do  there is nothing to be done said the little woman calmly  but who was she asked dorothy  she was the wicked witch of the east as i said answered the little woman  she has held all the munchkins in bondage for many years making them slave for her night and day  now they are all set free and are grateful to you for the favor  who are the munchkins inquired dorothy  they are the people who live in this land of the east  where the wicked witch ruled  are you a munchkin asked dorothy  no but i am their friend although i live in the land of the north when they saw the witch of the east was dead the munchkins sent a swift messenger to me and i came at once  i am the witch of the north  oh gracious cried dorothy  are you a real witch  yes indeed answered the little woman  but i am a good witch and the people love me  i am not as powerful as the wicked witch was who ruled here or i should have set the people free myself  but i thought all witches were wicked said the girl who was half frightened at facing a real witch  oh no that is a great mistake there were only four witches in all the land of oz and two of them those who live in the north and the south are good witches  i know this is true for i am one of them myself and cannot be mistaken those who dwelt in the east and the west were indeed wicked witches but now that you have killed one of them there is but one wicked witch in all the land of ozthe one who lives in the west  but said dorothy after a moments thought aunt em has told me that the witches were all deadyears and years ago  who is aunt em inquired the little old woman  she is my aunt who lives in kansas where i came from  the witch of the north seemed to think for a time with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground  then she looked up and said i do not know where kansas is for i have never heard that country mentioned before  but tell me is it a civilized country  oh yes replied dorothy  then that accounts for it  in the civilized countries i believe there are no witches left nor wizards nor sorceresses nor magicians  but you see the land of oz has never been civilized for we are cut off from all the rest of the world  therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us  who are the wizards asked dorothy  oz himself is the great wizard answered the witch sinking her voice to a whisper  he is more powerful than all the rest of us together he lives in the city of emeralds  dorothy was going to ask another question but just then the munchkins who had been standing silently by gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the wicked witch had been lying  what is it asked the little old woman and looked and began to laugh  the feet of the dead witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes  she was so old explained the witch of the north that she dried up quickly in the sun  that is the end of her  but the silver shoes are yours and you shall have them to wear she reached down and picked up the shoes and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to dorothy  the witch of the east was proud of those silver shoes said one of the munchkins and there is some charm connected with them but what it is we never knew  dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table then she came out again to the munchkins and said  i am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle for i am sure they will worry about me  can you help me find my way  the munchkins and the witch first looked at one another and then at dorothy and then shook their heads  at the east not far from here said one there is a great desert and none could live to cross it  it is the same at the south said another for i have been there and seen it  the south is the country of the quadlings  i am told said the third man that it is the same at the west  and that country where the winkies live is ruled by the wicked witch of the west who would make you her slave if you passed her way  the north is my home said the old lady and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this land of oz  im afraid my dear you will have to live with us  dorothy began to sob at this for she felt lonely among all these strange people  her tears seemed to grieve the kindhearted munchkins for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also  as for the little old woman she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose while she counted one two three in a solemn voice  at once the cap changed to a slate on which was written in big white chalk marks    let dorothy go to the city of emeralds   the little old woman took the slate from her nose and having read the words on it asked is your name dorothy my dear  yes answered the child looking up and drying her tears  then you must go to the city of emeralds  perhaps oz will help you  where is this city asked dorothy  it is exactly in the center of the country and is ruled by oz the great wizard i told you of  is he a good man inquired the girl anxiously  he is a good wizard  whether he is a man or not i cannot tell for i have never seen him  how can i get there asked dorothy  you must walk  it is a long journey through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible  however i will use all the magic arts i know of to keep you from harm  wont you go with me pleaded the girl who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend  no i cannot do that she replied but i will give you my kiss and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the witch of the north  she came close to dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead  where her lips touched the girl they left a round shining mark as dorothy found out soon after  the road to the city of emeralds is paved with yellow brick said the witch so you cannot miss it  when you get to oz do not be afraid of him but tell your story and ask him to help you  goodbye my dear  the three munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey after which they walked away through the trees  the witch gave dorothy a friendly little nod whirled around on her left heel three times and straightway disappeared much to the surprise of little toto who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by  but dorothy knowing her to be a witch had expected her to disappear in just that way and was not surprised in the least     3  how dorothy saved the scarecrow   when dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry  so she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread which she spread with butter she gave some to toto and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear sparkling water toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there  dorothy went to get him and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast  then she went back to the house and having helped herself and toto to a good drink of the cool clear water she set about making ready for the journey to the city of emeralds  dorothy had only one other dress but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed  it was gingham with checks of white and blue and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings it was still a pretty frock  the girl washed herself carefully dressed herself in the clean gingham and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head  she took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard laying a white cloth over the top  then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were  they surely will never do for a long journey toto she said  and toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant  at that moment dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the witch of the east  i wonder if they will fit me she said to toto  they would be just the thing to take a long walk in for they could not wear out  she took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her  finally she picked up her basket  come along toto she said  we will go to the emerald city and ask the great oz how to get back to kansas again  she closed the door locked it and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress  and so with toto trotting along soberly behind her she started on her journey  there were several roads near by but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks  within a short time she was walking briskly toward the emerald city her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard yellow roadbed  the sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly and dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land  she was surprised as she walked along to see how pretty the country was about her  there were neat fences at the sides of the road painted a dainty blue color and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance  evidently the munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops  once in a while she would pass a house and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage  the houses of the munchkins were oddlooking dwellings for each was round with a big dome for a roof all were painted blue for in this country of the east blue was the favorite color  toward evening when dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night she came to a house rather larger than the rest  on the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing  five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts pies and cakes and many other good things to eat  the people greeted dorothy kindly and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them for this was the home of one of the richest munchkins in the land and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch  dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich munchkin himself whose name was boq  then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance  when boq saw her silver shoes he said you must be a great sorceress  why asked the girl  because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch besides you have white in your frock and only witches and sorceresses wear white  my dress is blue and white checked said dorothy smoothing out the wrinkles in it  it is kind of you to wear that said boq  blue is the color of the munchkins and white is the witch color  so we know you are a friendly witch  dorothy did not know what to say to this for all the people seemed to think her a witch and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land  when she had tired watching the dancing boq led her into the house where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it  the sheets were made of blue cloth and dorothy slept soundly in them till morning with toto curled up on the blue rug beside her  she ate a hearty breakfast and watched a wee munchkin baby who played with toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused dorothy  toto was a fine curiosity to all the people for they had never seen a dog before  how far is it to the emerald city the girl asked  i do not know answered boq gravely for i have never been there it is better for people to keep away from oz unless they have business with him  but it is a long way to the emerald city and it will take you many days  the country here is rich and pleasant but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey  this worried dorothy a little but she knew that only the great oz could help her get to kansas again so she bravely resolved not to turn back  she bade her friends goodbye and again started along the road of yellow brick  when she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down  there was a great cornfield beyond the fence and not far away she saw a scarecrow placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn  dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the scarecrow  its head was a small sack stuffed with straw with eyes nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face  an old pointed blue hat that had belonged to some munchkin was perched on his head and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes worn and faded which had also been stuffed with straw  on the feet were some old boots with blue tops such as every man wore in this country and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back  while dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer painted face of the scarecrow she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her she thought she must have been mistaken at first for none of the scarecrows in kansas ever wink but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way  then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it while toto ran around the pole and barked  good day said the scarecrow in a rather husky voice  did you speak asked the girl in wonder  certainly answered the scarecrow  how do you do  im pretty well thank you replied dorothy politely  how do you do  im not feeling well said the scarecrow with a smile for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows  cant you get down asked dorothy  no for this pole is stuck up my back  if you will please take away the pole i shall be greatly obliged to you  dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole for being stuffed with straw it was quite light  thank you very much said the scarecrow when he had been set down on the ground  i feel like a new man  dorothy was puzzled at this for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak and to see him bow and walk along beside her  who are you asked the scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned  and where are you going  my name is dorothy said the girl and i am going to the emerald city to ask the great oz to send me back to kansas  where is the emerald city he inquired  and who is oz  why dont you know she returned in surprise  no indeed  i dont know anything  you see i am stuffed so i have no brains at all he answered sadly  oh said dorothy im awfully sorry for you  do you think he asked if i go to the emerald city with you that oz would give me some brains  i cannot tell she returned but you may come with me if you like if oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now  that is true said the scarecrow  you see he continued confidentially i dont mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed because i cannot get hurt  if anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me it doesnt matter for i cant feel it  but i do not want people to call me a fool and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains as yours is how am i ever to know anything  i understand how you feel said the little girl who was truly sorry for him  if you will come with me ill ask oz to do all he can for you  thank you he answered gratefully  they walked back to the road  dorothy helped him over the fence and they started along the path of yellow brick for the emerald city  toto did not like this addition to the party at first  he smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the scarecrow  dont mind toto said dorothy to her new friend  he never bites  oh im not afraid replied the scarecrow  he cant hurt the straw do let me carry that basket for you  i shall not mind it for i cant get tired  ill tell you a secret he continued as he walked along there is only one thing in the world i am afraid of  what is that asked dorothy the munchkin farmer who made you  no answered the scarecrow its a lighted match     4  the road through the forest   after a few hours the road began to be rough and the walking grew so difficult that the scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks which were here very uneven  sometimes indeed they were broken or missing altogether leaving holes that toto jumped across and dorothy walked around  as for the scarecrow having no brains he walked straight ahead and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks  it never hurt him however and dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap  the farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back  there were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became  at noon they sat down by the roadside near a little brook and dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread  she offered a piece to the scarecrow but he refused  i am never hungry he said and it is a lucky thing i am not for my mouth is only painted and if i should cut a hole in it so i could eat the straw i am stuffed with would come out and that would spoil the shape of my head  dorothy saw at once that this was true so she only nodded and went on eating her bread  tell me something about yourself and the country you came from said the scarecrow when she had finished her dinner  so she told him all about kansas and how gray everything was there and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer land of oz  the scarecrow listened carefully and said i cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry gray place you call kansas  that is because you have no brains answered the girl  no matter how dreary and gray our homes are we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country be it ever so beautiful there is no place like home  the scarecrow sighed  of course i cannot understand it he said  if your heads were stuffed with straw like mine you would probably all live in the beautiful places and then kansas would have no people at all  it is fortunate for kansas that you have brains  wont you tell me a story while we are resting asked the child  the scarecrow looked at her reproachfully and answered  my life has been so short that i really know nothing whatever  i was only made day before yesterday  what happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me  luckily when the farmer made my head one of the first things he did was to paint my ears so that i heard what was going on  there was another munchkin with him and the first thing i heard was the farmer saying how do you like those ears  they arent straight answered the other  never mind said the farmer  they are ears just the same which was true enough  now ill make the eyes said the farmer  so he painted my right eye and as soon as it was finished i found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity for this was my first glimpse of the world  thats a rather pretty eye remarked the munchkin who was watching the farmer  blue paint is just the color for eyes  i think ill make the other a little bigger said the farmer  and when the second eye was done i could see much better than before  then he made my nose and my mouth  but i did not speak because at that time i didnt know what a mouth was for  i had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs and when they fastened on my head at last i felt very proud for i thought i was just as good a man as anyone  this fellow will scare the crows fast enough said the farmer  he looks just like a man  why he is a man said the other and i quite agreed with him  the farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick where you found me  he and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone  i did not like to be deserted this way  so i tried to walk after them  but my feet would not touch the ground and i was forced to stay on that pole  it was a lonely life to lead for i had nothing to think of having been made such a little while before  many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield but as soon as they saw me they flew away again thinking i was a munchkin and this pleased me and made me feel that i was quite an important person  by and by an old crow flew near me and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said  i wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted  the other birds seeing he was not harmed by me came to eat the corn too so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me  i felt sad at this for it showed i was not such a good scarecrow after all but the old crow comforted me saying if you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them and a better man than some of them  brains are the only things worth having in this world no matter whether one is a crow or a man  after the crows had gone i thought this over and decided i would try hard to get some brains  by good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake and from what you say i am sure the great oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the emerald city  i hope so said dorothy earnestly since you seem anxious to have them  oh yes i am anxious returned the scarecrow  it is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool  well said the girl let us go  and she handed the basket to the scarecrow  there were no fences at all by the roadside now and the land was rough and untilled  toward evening they came to a great forest where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick  it was almost dark under the trees for the branches shut out the daylight but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest  if this road goes in it must come out said the scarecrow and as the emerald city is at the other end of the road we must go wherever it leads us  anyone would know that said dorothy  certainly that is why i know it returned the scarecrow  if it required brains to figure it out i never should have said it  after an hour or so the light faded away and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness  dorothy could not see at all but toto could for some dogs see very well in the dark and the scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day  so she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well  if you see any house or any place where we can pass the night she said you must tell me for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark  soon after the scarecrow stopped  i see a little cottage at the right of us he said built of logs and branches  shall we go there  yes indeed answered the child  i am all tired out  so the scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage and dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner  she lay down at once and with toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep  the scarecrow who was never tired stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came     5  the rescue of the tin woodman   when dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels  she sat up and looked around her scarecrow still standing patiently in his corner waiting for her  we must go and search for water she said to him  why do you want water he asked  to wash my face clean after the dust of the road and to drink so the dry bread will not stick in my throat  it must be inconvenient to be made of flesh said the scarecrow thoughtfully for you must sleep and eat and drink  however you have brains and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly  they left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water where dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast  she saw there was not much bread left in the basket and the girl was thankful the scarecrow did not have to eat anything for there was scarcely enough for herself and toto for the day  when she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick she was startled to hear a deep groan near by  what was that she asked timidly  i cannot imagine replied the scarecrow but we can go and see  just then another groan reached their ears and the sound seemed to come from behind them  they turned and walked through the forest a few steps when dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees  she ran to the place and then stopped short with a little cry of surprise  one of the big trees had been partly chopped through and standing beside it with an uplifted axe in his hands was a man made entirely of tin  his head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body but he stood perfectly motionless as if he could not stir at all  dorothy looked at him in amazement and so did the scarecrow while toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs which hurt his teeth  did you groan asked dorothy  yes answered the tin man i did  ive been groaning for more than a year and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me  what can i do for you she inquired softly for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke  get an oilcan and oil my joints he answered  they are rusted so badly that i cannot move them at all if i am well oiled i shall soon be all right again  you will find an oilcan on a shelf in my cottage  dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oilcan and then she returned and asked anxiously where are your joints  oil my neck first replied the tin woodman  so she oiled it and as it was quite badly rusted the scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely and then the man could turn it himself  now oil the joints in my arms he said  and dorothy oiled them and the scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new  the tin woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe which he leaned against the tree  this is a great comfort he said  i have been holding that axe in the air ever since i rusted and im glad to be able to put it down at last  now if you will oil the joints of my legs i shall be all right once more  so they oiled his legs until he could move them freely and he thanked them again and again for his release for he seemed a very polite creature and very grateful  i might have stood there always if you had not come along he said so you have certainly saved my life  how did you happen to be here  we are on our way to the emerald city to see the great oz she answered and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night  why do you wish to see oz he asked  i want him to send me back to kansas and the scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head she replied  the tin woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment  then he said  do you suppose oz could give me a heart  why i guess so dorothy answered  it would be as easy as to give the scarecrow brains  true the tin woodman returned  so if you will allow me to join your party i will also go to the emerald city and ask oz to help me  come along said the scarecrow heartily and dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company  so the tin woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick  the tin woodman had asked dorothy to put the oilcan in her basket for he said if i should get caught in the rain and rust again i would need the oilcan badly  it was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass  but the tin woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party  dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road  indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again  why didnt you walk around the hole asked the tin woodman  i dont know enough replied the scarecrow cheerfully  my head is stuffed with straw you know and that is why i am going to oz to ask him for some brains  oh i see said the tin woodman  but after all brains are not the best things in the world  have you any inquired the scarecrow  no my head is quite empty answered the woodman  but once i had brains and a heart also so having tried them both i should much rather have a heart  and why is that asked the scarecrow  i will tell you my story and then you will know  so while they were walking through the forest the tin woodman told the following story  i was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living  when i grew up i too became a woodchopper and after my father died i took care of my old mother as long as she lived  then i made up my mind that instead of living alone i would marry so that i might not become lonely  there was one of the munchkin girls who was so beautiful that i soon grew to love her with all my heart  she on her part promised to marry me as soon as i could earn enough money to build a better house for her so i set to work harder than ever  but the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework  so the old woman went to the wicked witch of the east and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage thereupon the wicked witch enchanted my axe and when i was chopping away at my best one day for i was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg  this at first seemed a great misfortune for i knew a onelegged man could not do very well as a woodchopper  so i went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin  the leg worked very well once i was used to it  but my action angered the wicked witch of the east for she had promised the old woman i should not marry the pretty munchkin girl  when i began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg  again i went to the tinsmith and again he made me a leg out of tin  after this the enchanted axe cut off my arms one after the other but nothing daunted i had them replaced with tin ones the wicked witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head and at first i thought that was the end of me  but the tinsmith happened to come along and he made me a new head out of tin  i thought i had beaten the wicked witch then and i worked harder than ever but i little knew how cruel my enemy could be  she thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful munchkin maiden and made my axe slip again so that it cut right through my body splitting me into two halves  once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it by means of joints so that i could move around as well as ever  but alas  i had now no heart so that i lost all my love for the munchkin girl and did not care whether i married her or not  i suppose she is still living with the old woman waiting for me to come after her  my body shone so brightly in the sun that i felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped for it could not cut me there was only one dangerthat my joints would rust but i kept an oilcan in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever i needed it however there came a day when i forgot to do this and being caught in a rainstorm before i thought of the danger my joints had rusted and i was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me  it was a terrible thing to undergo but during the year i stood there i had time to think that the greatest loss i had known was the loss of my heart  while i was in love i was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so i am resolved to ask oz to give me one  if he does i will go back to the munchkin maiden and marry her  both dorothy and the scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the tin woodman and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart  all the same said the scarecrow i shall ask for brains instead of a heart for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one  i shall take the heart returned the tin woodman for brains do not make one happy and happiness is the best thing in the world  dorothy did not say anything for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right and she decided if she could only get back to kansas and aunt em it did not matter so much whether the woodman had no brains and the scarecrow no heart or each got what he wanted  what worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone and another meal for herself and toto would empty the basket  to be sure neither the woodman nor the scarecrow ever ate anything but she was not made of tin nor straw and could not live unless she was fed     6  the cowardly lion   all this time dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods  the road was still paved with yellow brick but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees and the walking was not at all good  there were few birds in this part of the forest for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine  but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees  these sounds made the little girls heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but toto knew and he walked close to dorothys side and did not even bark in return  how long will it be the child asked of the tin woodman before we are out of the forest  i cannot tell was the answer for i have never been to the emerald city  but my father went there once when i was a boy and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country although nearer to the city where oz dwells the country is beautiful  but i am not afraid so long as i have my oilcan and nothing can hurt the scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good witchs kiss and that will protect you from harm  but toto said the girl anxiously  what will protect him  we must protect him ourselves if he is in danger replied the tin woodman  just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar and the next moment a great lion bounded into the road  with one blow of his paw he sent the scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road and then he struck at the tin woodman with his sharp claws  but to the lions surprise he could make no impression on the tin although the woodman fell over in the road and lay still  little toto now that he had an enemy to face ran barking toward the lion and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog when dorothy fearing toto would be killed and heedless of danger rushed forward and slapped the lion upon his nose as hard as she could while she cried out  dont you dare to bite toto  you ought to be ashamed of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor little dog  i didnt bite him said the lion as he rubbed his nose with his paw where dorothy had hit it  no but you tried to she retorted  you are nothing but a big coward  i know it said the lion hanging his head in shame  ive always known it  but how can i help it  i dont know im sure  to think of your striking a stuffed man like the poor scarecrow  is he stuffed asked the lion in surprise as he watched her pick up the scarecrow and set him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again  of course hes stuffed replied dorothy who was still angry  thats why he went over so easily remarked the lion  it astonished me to see him whirl around so  is the other one stuffed also  no said dorothy hes made of tin  and she helped the woodman up again  thats why he nearly blunted my claws said the lion  when they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back  what is that little animal you are so tender of  he is my dog toto answered dorothy  is he made of tin or stuffed asked the lion  neither  hes aaa meat dog said the girl  oh  hes a curious animal and seems remarkably small now that i look at him  no one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me continued the lion sadly  what makes you a coward asked dorothy looking at the great beast in wonder for he was as big as a small horse  its a mystery replied the lion  i suppose i was born that way all the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave for the lion is everywhere thought to be the king of beasts  i learned that if i roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way  whenever ive met a man ive been awfully scared but i just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go if the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me i should have run myselfim such a coward but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me and of course i let them go  but that isnt right  the king of beasts shouldnt be a coward said the scarecrow  i know it returned the lion wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail  it is my great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy but whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast  perhaps you have heart disease said the tin woodman  it may be said the lion  if you have continued the tin woodman you ought to be glad for it proves you have a heart  for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart disease  perhaps said the lion thoughtfully if i had no heart i should not be a coward  have you brains asked the scarecrow  i suppose so  ive never looked to see replied the lion  i am going to the great oz to ask him to give me some remarked the scarecrow for my head is stuffed with straw  and i am going to ask him to give me a heart said the woodman  and i am going to ask him to send toto and me back to kansas added dorothy  do you think oz could give me courage asked the cowardly lion  just as easily as he could give me brains said the scarecrow  or give me a heart said the tin woodman  or send me back to kansas said dorothy  then if you dont mind ill go with you said the lion for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage  you will be very welcome answered dorothy for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts  it seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily  they really are said the lion but that doesnt make me any braver and as long as i know myself to be a coward i shall be unhappy  so once more the little company set off upon the journey the lion walking with stately strides at dorothys side  toto did not approve this new comrade at first for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the lions great jaws  but after a time he became more at ease and presently toto and the cowardly lion had grown to be good friends  during the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey  once indeed the tin woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road and killed the poor little thing  this made the tin woodman very unhappy for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret  these tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw and there they rusted  when dorothy presently asked him a question the tin woodman could not open his mouth for his jaws were tightly rusted together  he became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to dorothy to relieve him but she could not understand  the lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong  but the scarecrow seized the oilcan from dorothys basket and oiled the woodmans jaws so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before  this will serve me a lesson said he to look where i step  for if i should kill another bug or beetle i should surely cry again and crying rusts my jaws so that i cannot speak  thereafter he walked very carefully with his eyes on the road and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it so as not to harm it  the tin woodman knew very well he had no heart and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything  you people with hearts he said have something to guide you and need never do wrong but i have no heart and so i must be very careful  when oz gives me a heart of course i neednt mind so much     7  the journey to the great oz   they were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest for there were no houses near  the tree made a good thick covering to protect them from the dew and the tin woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely  she and toto ate the last of their bread and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast  if you wish said the lion i will go into the forest and kill a deer for you  you can roast it by the fire since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food and then you will have a very good breakfast  dont  please dont begged the tin woodman  i should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer and then my jaws would rust again  but the lion went away into the forest and found his own supper and no one ever knew what it was for he didnt mention it  and the scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled dorothys basket with them so that she would not be hungry for a long time  she thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the scarecrow but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts  his padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket  but the scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket for it enabled him to keep away from the fire as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up  so he kept a good distance away from the flames and only came near to cover dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep these kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning  when it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward the emerald city  this was to be an eventful day for the travelers  they had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side  it was a very wide ditch and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep and there were many big jagged rocks at the bottom  the sides were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end  what shall we do asked dorothy despairingly  i havent the faintest idea said the tin woodman and the lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful  but the scarecrow said we cannot fly that is certain  neither can we climb down into this great ditch  therefore if we cannot jump over it we must stop where we are  i think i could jump over it said the cowardly lion after measuring the distance carefully in his mind  then we are all right answered the scarecrow for you can carry us all over on your back one at a time  well ill try it said the lion  who will go first  i will declared the scarecrow for if you found that you could not jump over the gulf dorothy would be killed or the tin woodman badly dented on the rocks below  but if i am on your back it will not matter so much for the fall would not hurt me at all  i am terribly afraid of falling myself said the cowardly lion but i suppose there is nothing to do but try it  so get on my back and we will make the attempt  the scarecrow sat upon the lions back and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down  why dont you run and jump asked the scarecrow  because that isnt the way we lions do these things he replied then giving a great spring he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side  they were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it and after the scarecrow had got down from his back the lion sprang across the ditch again  dorothy thought she would go next so she took toto in her arms and climbed on the lions back holding tightly to his mane with one hand the next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air and then before she had time to think about it she was safe on the other side  the lion went back a third time and got the tin woodman and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest for his great leaps had made his breath short and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long  they found the forest very thick on this side and it looked dark and gloomy  after the lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick silently wondering each in his own mind if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again to add to their discomfort they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest and the lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the kalidahs lived  what are the kalidahs asked the girl  they are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers replied the lion and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as i could kill toto  im terribly afraid of the kalidahs  im not surprised that you are returned dorothy  they must be dreadful beasts  the lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road  but this one was so broad and deep that the lion knew at once he could not leap across it  so they sat down to consider what they should do and after serious thought the scarecrow said  here is a great tree standing close to the ditch  if the tin woodman can chop it down so that it will fall to the other side we can walk across it easily  that is a firstrate idea said the lion  one would almost suspect you had brains in your head instead of straw  the woodman set to work at once and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through  then the lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch with its top branches on the other side  they had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers  they are the kalidahs said the cowardly lion beginning to tremble  quick cried the scarecrow  let us cross over  so dorothy went first holding toto in her arms the tin woodman followed and the scarecrow came next  the lion although he was certainly afraid turned to face the kalidahs and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that dorothy screamed and the scarecrow fell over backward while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise  but seeing they were bigger than the lion and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him the kalidahs again rushed forward and the lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next  without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree  and the lion said to dorothy  we are lost for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws  but stand close behind me and i will fight them as long as i am alive  wait a minute called the scarecrow  he had been thinking what was best to be done and now he asked the woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch  the tin woodman began to use his axe at once and just as the two kalidahs were nearly across the tree fell with a crash into the gulf carrying the ugly snarling brutes with it and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom  well said the cowardly lion drawing a long breath of relief i see we are going to live a little while longer and i am glad of it for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive  those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet  ah said the tin woodman sadly i wish i had a heart to beat  this adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest and they walked so fast that dorothy became tired and had to ride on the lions back  to their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river flowing swiftly just before them  on the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits  they were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them  how shall we cross the river asked dorothy  that is easily done replied the scarecrow  the tin woodman must build us a raft so we can float to the other side  so the woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft and while he was busy at this the scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit  this pleased dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit  but it takes time to make a raft even when one is as industrious and untiring as the tin woodman and when night came the work was not done so they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning and dorothy dreamed of the emerald city and of the good wizard oz who would soon send her back to her own home again     8  the deadly poppy field   our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope and dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river  behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through although they had suffered many discouragements but before them was a lovely sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the emerald city  to be sure the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land but the raft was nearly done and after the tin woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins they were ready to start  dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held toto in her arms  when the cowardly lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly for he was big and heavy but the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood upon the other end to steady it and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water  they got along quite well at first but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick  and the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom  this is bad said the tin woodman for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the wicked witch of the west and she will enchant us and make us her slaves  and then i should get no brains said the scarecrow  and i should get no courage said the cowardly lion  and i should get no heart said the tin woodman  and i should never get back to kansas said dorothy  we must certainly get to the emerald city if we can the scarecrow continued and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river  then before he could pull it out againor let gothe raft was swept away and the poor scarecrow left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river  goodbye he called after them and they were very sorry to leave him  indeed the tin woodman began to cry but fortunately remembered that he might rust and so dried his tears on dorothys apron  of course this was a bad thing for the scarecrow  i am now worse off than when i first met dorothy he thought  then i was stuck on a pole in a cornfield where i could makebelieve scare the crows at any rate  but surely there is no use for a scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river  i am afraid i shall never have any brains after all  down the stream the raft floated and the poor scarecrow was left far behind  then the lion said  something must be done to save us  i think i can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail  so he sprang into the water and the tin woodman caught fast hold of his tail  then the lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore  it was hard work although he was so big but by and by they were drawn out of the current and then dorothy took the tin woodmans long pole and helped push the raft to the land  they were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the emerald city  what shall we do now asked the tin woodman as the lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him  we must get back to the road in some way said dorothy  the best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again remarked the lion  so when they were rested dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank to the road from which the river had carried them  it was a lovely country with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them and had they not felt so sorry for the poor scarecrow they could have been very happy  they walked along as fast as they could dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower and after a time the tin woodman cried out look  then they all looked at the river and saw the scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water looking very lonely and sad  what can we do to save him asked dorothy  the lion and the woodman both shook their heads for they did not know so they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the scarecrow until a stork flew by who upon seeing them stopped to rest at the waters edge  who are you and where are you going asked the stork  i am dorothy answered the girl and these are my friends the tin woodman and the cowardly lion  and we are going to the emerald city  this isnt the road said the stork as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party  i know it returned dorothy but we have lost the scarecrow and are wondering how we shall get him again  where is he asked the stork  over there in the river answered the little girl  if he wasnt so big and heavy i would get him for you remarked the stork  he isnt heavy a bit said dorothy eagerly for he is stuffed with straw and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much  well ill try said the stork but if i find he is too heavy to carry i shall have to drop him in the river again  so the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the scarecrow was perched upon his pole  then the stork with her great claws grabbed the scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank where dorothy and the lion and the tin woodman and toto were sitting  when the scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all even the lion and toto and as they walked along he sang tolderideoh at every step he felt so gay  i was afraid i should have to stay in the river forever he said but the kind stork saved me and if i ever get any brains i shall find the stork again and do her some kindness in return  thats all right said the stork who was flying along beside them i always like to help anyone in trouble  but i must go now for my babies are waiting in the nest for me  i hope you will find the emerald city and that oz will help you  thank you replied dorothy and then the kind stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight  they walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them  there were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms besides great clusters of scarlet poppies which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled dorothys eyes  arent they beautiful the girl asked as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers  i suppose so answered the scarecrow  when i have brains i shall probably like them better  if i only had a heart i should love them added the tin woodman  i always did like flowers said the lion  they of seem so helpless and frail  but there are none in the forest so bright as these  they now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies and fewer and fewer of the other flowers and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies  now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever  but dorothy did not know this nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep  but the tin woodman would not let her do this  we must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark he said and the scarecrow agreed with him  so they kept walking until dorothy could stand no longer  her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies fast asleep  what shall we do asked the tin woodman  if we leave her here she will die said the lion  the smell of the flowers is killing us all  i myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already  it was true toto had fallen down beside his little mistress  but the scarecrow and the tin woodman not being made of flesh were not troubled by the scent of the flowers  run fast said the scarecrow to the lion and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can  we will bring the little girl with us but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried  so the lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go in a moment he was out of sight  let us make a chair with our hands and carry her said the scarecrow so they picked up toto and put the dog in dorothys lap and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers  on and on they walked and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end  they followed the bend of the river and at last came upon their friend the lion lying fast asleep among the poppies  the flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them  we can do nothing for him said the tin woodman sadly for he is much too heavy to lift  we must leave him here to sleep on forever and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last  im sorry said the scarecrow  the lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly  but let us go on  they carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her     9  the queen of the field mice   we cannot be far from the road of yellow brick now remarked the scarecrow as he stood beside the girl for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away  the tin woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl and turning his head which worked beautifully on hinges he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them  it was indeed a great yellow wildcat and the woodman thought it must be chasing something for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open showing two rows of ugly teeth while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire  as it came nearer the tin woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty harmless creature  so the woodman raised his axe and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beasts head clean off from its body and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces  the field mouse now that it was freed from its enemy stopped short and coming slowly up to the woodman it said in a squeaky little voice  oh thank you  thank you ever so much for saving my life  dont speak of it i beg of you replied the woodman  i have no heart you know so i am careful to help all those who may need a friend even if it happens to be only a mouse  only a mouse cried the little animal indignantly  why i am a queenthe queen of all the field mice  oh indeed said the woodman making a bow  therefore you have done a great deed as well as a brave one in saving my life added the queen  at that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them and when they saw their queen they exclaimed  oh your majesty we thought you would be killed  how did you manage to escape the great wildcat  they all bowed so low to the little queen that they almost stood upon their heads  this funny tin man she answered killed the wildcat and saved my life  so hereafter you must all serve him and obey his slightest wish  we will cried all the mice in a shrill chorus  and then they scampered in all directions for toto had awakened from his sleep and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group  toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in kansas and he saw no harm in it  but the tin woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight while he called to the mice come back  come back  toto shall not hurt you  at this the queen of the mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked in a timid voice are you sure he will not bite us  i will not let him said the woodman so do not be afraid  one by one the mice came creeping back and toto did not bark again although he tried to get out of the woodmans arms and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin  finally one of the biggest mice spoke  is there anything we can do it asked to repay you for saving the life of our queen  nothing that i know of answered the woodman but the scarecrow who had been trying to think but could not because his head was stuffed with straw said quickly oh yes you can save our friend the cowardly lion who is asleep in the poppy bed  a lion cried the little queen  why he would eat us all up  oh no declared the scarecrow this lion is a coward  really asked the mouse  he says so himself answered the scarecrow and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend  if you will help us to save him i promise that he shall treat you all with kindness  very well said the queen we trust you  but what shall we do  are there many of these mice which call you queen and are willing to obey you  oh yes there are thousands she replied  then send for them all to come here as soon as possible and let each one bring a long piece of string  the queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people  as soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible  now said the scarecrow to the tin woodman you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the lion  so the woodman went at once to the trees and began to work and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches  he fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk  so fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them  they came from all directions and there were thousands of them big mice and little mice and middlesized mice and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth  it was about this time that dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes  she was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly  but the scarecrow told her about everything and turning to the dignified little mouse he said  permit me to introduce to you her majesty the queen  dorothy nodded gravely and the queen made a curtsy after which she became quite friendly with the little girl  the scarecrow and the woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck using the strings they had brought  one end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck  of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily  even the scarecrow and the tin woodman could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the lion lay asleep  after a great deal of hard work for the lion was heavy they managed to get him up on the truck  then the queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep  at first the little creatures many though they were could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck but the woodman and the scarecrow both pushed from behind and they got along better  soon they rolled the lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields where he could breathe the sweet fresh air again instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers  dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death  she had grown so fond of the big lion she was glad he had been rescued  then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes  the queen of the mice was the last to leave  if ever you need us again she said come out into the field and call and we shall hear you and come to your assistance  goodbye  goodbye they all answered and away the queen ran while dorothy held toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her  after this they sat down beside the lion until he should awaken and the scarecrow brought dorothy some fruit from a tree near by which she ate for her dinner     10  the guardian of the gate   it was some time before the cowardly lion awakened for he had lain among the poppies a long while breathing in their deadly fragrance but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive  i ran as fast as i could he said sitting down and yawning but the flowers were too strong for me  how did you get me out  then they told him of the field mice and how they had generously saved him from death and the cowardly lion laughed and said  i have always thought myself very big and terrible yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me and such small animals as mice have saved my life  how strange it all is  but comrades what shall we do now  we must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again said dorothy and then we can keep on to the emerald city  so the lion being fully refreshed and feeling quite himself again they all started upon the journey greatly enjoying the walk through the soft fresh grass and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the emerald city where the great oz dwelt  the road was smooth and well paved now and the country about was beautiful so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades once more they could see fences built beside the road but these were painted green and when they came to a small house in which a farmer evidently lived that also was painted green  they passed by several of these houses during the afternoon and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great lion of which they were very much afraid  the people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emeraldgreen color and wore peaked hats like those of the munchkins  this must be the land of oz said dorothy and we are surely getting near the emerald city  yes answered the scarecrow  everything is green here while in the country of the munchkins blue was the favorite color  but the people do not seem to be as friendly as the munchkins and im afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night  i should like something to eat besides fruit said the girl and im sure toto is nearly starved  let us stop at the next house and talk to the people  so when they came to a goodsized farmhouse dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked  a woman opened it just far enough to look out and said what do you want child and why is that great lion with you  we wish to pass the night with you if you will allow us answered dorothy and the lion is my friend and comrade and would not hurt you for the world  is he tame asked the woman opening the door a little wider  oh yes said the girl and he is a great coward too  he will be more afraid of you than you are of him  well said the woman after thinking it over and taking another peep at the lion if that is the case you may come in and i will give you some supper and a place to sleep  so they all entered the house where there were besides the woman two children and a man  the man had hurt his leg and was lying on the couch in a corner  they seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked  where are you all going  to the emerald city said dorothy to see the great oz  oh indeed exclaimed the man  are you sure that oz will see you  why not she replied  why it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence  i have been to the emerald city many times and it is a beautiful and wonderful place but i have never been permitted to see the great oz nor do i know of any living person who has seen him  does he never go out asked the scarecrow  never  he sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face  what is he like asked the girl  that is hard to tell said the man thoughtfully  you see oz is a great wizard and can take on any form he wishes  so that some say he looks like a bird and some say he looks like an elephant and some say he looks like a cat  to others he appears as a beautiful fairy or a brownie or in any other form that pleases him  but who the real oz is when he is in his own form no living person can tell  that is very strange said dorothy but we must try in some way to see him or we shall have made our journey for nothing  why do you wish to see the terrible oz asked the man  i want him to give me some brains said the scarecrow eagerly  oh oz could do that easily enough declared the man  he has more brains than he needs  and i want him to give me a heart said the tin woodman  that will not trouble him continued the man for oz has a large collection of hearts of all sizes and shapes  and i want him to give me courage said the cowardly lion  oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room said the man which he has covered with a golden plate to keep it from running over  he will be glad to give you some  and i want him to send me back to kansas said dorothy  where is kansas asked the man with surprise  i dont know replied dorothy sorrowfully but it is my home and im sure its somewhere  very likely  well oz can do anything so i suppose he will find kansas for you  but first you must get to see him and that will be a hard task for the great wizard does not like to see anyone and he usually has his own way  but what do you want he continued speaking to toto  toto only wagged his tail for strange to say he could not speak  the woman now called to them that supper was ready so they gathered around the table and dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread and enjoyed her meal the lion ate some of the porridge but did not care for it saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses not for lions  the scarecrow and the tin woodman ate nothing at all  toto ate a little of everything and was glad to get a good supper again  the woman now gave dorothy a bed to sleep in and toto lay down beside her while the lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed  the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night although of course they could not sleep  the next morning as soon as the sun was up they started on their way and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them  that must be the emerald city said dorothy  as they walked on the green glow became brighter and brighter and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels  yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the city  it was high and thick and of a bright green color  in front of them and at the end of the road of yellow brick was a big gate all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy  there was a bell beside the gate and dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within  then the big gate swung slowly open and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds  before them stood a little man about the same size as the munchkins he was clothed all in green from his head to his feet and even his skin was of a greenish tint  at his side was a large green box  when he saw dorothy and her companions the man asked what do you wish in the emerald city  we came here to see the great oz said dorothy  the man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over  it has been many years since anyone asked me to see oz he said shaking his head in perplexity  he is powerful and terrible and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the great wizard he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant  but it is not a foolish errand nor an idle one replied the scarecrow it is important  and we have been told that oz is a good wizard  so he is said the green man and he rules the emerald city wisely and well  but to those who are not honest or who approach him from curiosity he is most terrible and few have ever dared ask to see his face  i am the guardian of the gates and since you demand to see the great oz i must take you to his palace  but first you must put on the spectacles  why asked dorothy  because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the emerald city would blind you  even those who live in the city must wear spectacles night and day  they are all locked on for oz so ordered it when the city was first built and i have the only key that will unlock them  he opened the big box and dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape  all of them had green glasses in them  the guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit dorothy and put them over her eyes  there were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the guardian of the gates wore around his neck  when they were on dorothy could not take them off had she wished but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the emerald city so she said nothing  then the green man fitted spectacles for the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion and even on little toto and all were locked fast with the key  then the guardian of the gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace  taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the emerald city     11  the wonderful city of oz   even with eyes protected by the green spectacles dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful city the streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds  they walked over a pavement of the same green marble and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds set closely and glittering in the brightness of the sun  the window panes were of green glass even the sky above the city had a green tint and the rays of the sun were green  there were many peoplemen women and childrenwalking about and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins  they looked at dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the lion but no one spoke to them  many shops stood in the street and dorothy saw that everything in them was green  green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale as well as green shoes green hats and green clothes of all sorts  at one place a man was selling green lemonade and when the children bought it dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies  there seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind the men carried things around in little green carts which they pushed before them everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous  the guardian of the gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building exactly in the middle of the city which was the palace of oz the great wizard  there was a soldier before the door dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard  here are strangers said the guardian of the gates to him and they demand to see the great oz  step inside answered the soldier and i will carry your message to him  so they passed through the palace gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds  the soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room and when they were seated he said politely  please make yourselves comfortable while i go to the door of the throne room and tell oz you are here  they had to wait a long time before the soldier returned  when at last he came back dorothy asked  have you seen oz  oh no returned the soldier i have never seen him  but i spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message  he said he will grant you an audience if you so desire but each one of you must enter his presence alone and he will admit but one each day therefore as you must remain in the palace for several days i will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey  thank you replied the girl that is very kind of oz  the soldier now blew upon a green whistle and at once a young girl dressed in a pretty green silk gown entered the room  she had lovely green hair and green eyes and she bowed low before dorothy as she said follow me and i will show you your room  so dorothy said goodbye to all her friends except toto and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the palace  it was the sweetest little room in the world with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane  there was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room that shot a spray of green perfume into the air to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin  beautiful green flowers stood in the windows and there was a shelf with a row of little green books when dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh they were so funny  in a wardrobe were many green dresses made of silk and satin and velvet and all of them fitted dorothy exactly  make yourself perfectly at home said the green girl and if you wish for anything ring the bell  oz will send for you tomorrow morning  she left dorothy alone and went back to the others  these she also led to rooms and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the palace  of course this politeness was wasted on the scarecrow for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot just within the doorway to wait till morning it would not rest him to lie down and he could not close his eyes so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world  the tin woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit for he remembered when he was made of flesh but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order  the lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest and did not like being shut up in a room but he had too much sense to let this worry him so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute  the next morning after breakfast the green maiden came to fetch dorothy and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns made of green brocaded satin  dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around totos neck and they started for the throne room of the great oz  first they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court all dressed in rich costumes  these people had nothing to do but talk to each other but they always came to wait outside the throne room every morning although they were never permitted to see oz  as dorothy entered they looked at her curiously and one of them whispered  are you really going to look upon the face of oz the terrible  of course answered the girl if he will see me  oh he will see you said the soldier who had taken her message to the wizard although he does not like to have people ask to see him indeed at first he was angry and said i should send you back where you came from  then he asked me what you looked like and when i mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested  at last i told him about the mark upon your forehead and he decided he would admit you to his presence  just then a bell rang and the green girl said to dorothy that is the signal  you must go into the throne room alone  she opened a little door and dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place  it was a big round room with a high arched roof and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together  in the center of the roof was a great light as bright as the sun which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner  but what interested dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room  it was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems as did everything else  in the center of the chair was an enormous head without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever  there was no hair upon this head but it had eyes and a nose and mouth and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant  as dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily  then the mouth moved and dorothy heard a voice say  i am oz the great and terrible  who are you and why do you seek me  it was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big head so she took courage and answered  i am dorothy the small and meek  i have come to you for help  the eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute  then said the voice  where did you get the silver shoes  i got them from the wicked witch of the east when my house fell on her and killed her she replied  where did you get the mark upon your forehead continued the voice  that is where the good witch of the north kissed me when she bade me goodbye and sent me to you said the girl  again the eyes looked at her sharply and they saw she was telling the truth  then oz asked what do you wish me to do  send me back to kansas where my aunt em and uncle henry are she answered earnestly  i dont like your country although it is so beautiful  and i am sure aunt em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long  the eyes winked three times and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room  and at last they looked at dorothy again  why should i do this for you asked oz  because you are strong and i am weak because you are a great wizard and i am only a little girl  but you were strong enough to kill the wicked witch of the east said oz  that just happened returned dorothy simply i could not help it  well said the head i will give you my answer  you have no right to expect me to send you back to kansas unless you do something for me in return  in this country everyone must pay for everything he gets if you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first  help me and i will help you  what must i do asked the girl  kill the wicked witch of the west answered oz  but i cannot exclaimed dorothy greatly surprised  you killed the witch of the east and you wear the silver shoes which bear a powerful charm  there is now but one wicked witch left in all this land and when you can tell me she is dead i will send you back to kansasbut not before  the little girl began to weep she was so much disappointed and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously as if the great oz felt that she could help him if she would  i never killed anything willingly she sobbed  even if i wanted to how could i kill the wicked witch  if you who are great and terrible cannot kill her yourself how do you expect me to do it  i do not know said the head but that is my answer and until the wicked witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again  remember that the witch is wickedtremendously wickedand ought to be killed now go and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task  sorrowfully dorothy left the throne room and went back where the lion and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were waiting to hear what oz had said to her  there is no hope for me she said sadly for oz will not send me home until i have killed the wicked witch of the west and that i can never do  her friends were sorry but could do nothing to help her so dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the scarecrow and said  come with me for oz has sent for you  so the scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great throne room where he saw sitting in the emerald throne a most lovely lady she was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels  growing from her shoulders were wings gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them  when the scarecrow had bowed as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him before this beautiful creature she looked upon him sweetly and said  i am oz the great and terrible  who are you and why do you seek me  now the scarecrow who had expected to see the great head dorothy had told him of was much astonished but he answered her bravely  i am only a scarecrow stuffed with straw  therefore i have no brains and i come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw so that i may become as much a man as any other in your dominions  why should i do this for you asked the lady  because you are wise and powerful and no one else can help me answered the scarecrow  i never grant favors without some return said oz but this much i will promise  if you will kill for me the wicked witch of the west i will bestow upon you a great many brains and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the land of oz  i thought you asked dorothy to kill the witch said the scarecrow in surprise  so i did  i dont care who kills her  but until she is dead i will not grant your wish  now go and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire  the scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what oz had said and dorothy was surprised to find that the great wizard was not a head as she had seen him but a lovely lady  all the same said the scarecrow she needs a heart as much as the tin woodman  on the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the tin woodman and said  oz has sent for you  follow me  so the tin woodman followed him and came to the great throne room  he did not know whether he would find oz a lovely lady or a head but he hoped it would be the lovely lady  for he said to himself if it is the head i am sure i shall not be given a heart since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me  but if it is the lovely lady i shall beg hard for a heart for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted  but when the woodman entered the great throne room he saw neither the head nor the lady for oz had taken the shape of a most terrible beast it was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight  the beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros only there were five eyes in its face  there were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long slim legs  thick woolly hair covered every part of it and a more dreadfullooking monster could not be imagined  it was fortunate the tin woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror  but being only tin the woodman was not at all afraid although he was much disappointed  i am oz the great and terrible spoke the beast in a voice that was one great roar  who are you and why do you seek me  i am a woodman and made of tin  therefore i have no heart and cannot love  i pray you to give me a heart that i may be as other men are  why should i do this demanded the beast  because i ask it and you alone can grant my request answered the woodman  oz gave a low growl at this but said gruffly if you indeed desire a heart you must earn it  how asked the woodman  help dorothy to kill the wicked witch of the west replied the beast when the witch is dead come to me and i will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the land of oz  so the tin woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible beast he had seen  they all wondered greatly at the many forms the great wizard could take upon himself and the lion said  if he is a beast when i go to see him i shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all i ask  and if he is the lovely lady i shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bidding  and if he is the great head he will be at my mercy for i will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire  so be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the lion to the great throne room and bade him enter the presence of oz  the lion at once passed through the door and glancing around saw to his surprise that before the throne was a ball of fire so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it  his first thought was that oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up but when he tried to go nearer the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door  then a low quiet voice came from the ball of fire and these were the words it spoke  i am oz the great and terrible  who are you and why do you seek me  and the lion answered i am a cowardly lion afraid of everything  i came to you to beg that you give me courage so that in reality i may become the king of beasts as men call me  why should i give you courage demanded oz  because of all wizards you are the greatest and alone have power to grant my request answered the lion  the ball of fire burned fiercely for a time and the voice said bring me proof that the wicked witch is dead and that moment i will give you courage  but as long as the witch lives you must remain a coward  the lion was angry at this speech but could say nothing in reply and while he stood silently gazing at the ball of fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room  he was glad to find his friends waiting for him and told them of his terrible interview with the wizard  what shall we do now asked dorothy sadly  there is only one thing we can do returned the lion and that is to go to the land of the winkies seek out the wicked witch and destroy her  but suppose we cannot said the girl  then i shall never have courage declared the lion  and i shall never have brains added the scarecrow  and i shall never have a heart spoke the tin woodman  and i shall never see aunt em and uncle henry said dorothy beginning to cry  be careful cried the green girl  the tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it  so dorothy dried her eyes and said i suppose we must try it but i am sure i do not want to kill anybody even to see aunt em again  i will go with you but im too much of a coward to kill the witch said the lion  i will go too declared the scarecrow but i shall not be of much help to you i am such a fool  i havent the heart to harm even a witch remarked the tin woodman but if you go i certainly shall go with you  therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning and the woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled  the scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better  the green girl who was very kind to them filled dorothys basket with good things to eat and fastened a little bell around totos neck with a green ribbon  they went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg     12  the search for the wicked witch   the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the emerald city until they reached the room where the guardian of the gates lived  this officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box and then he politely opened the gate for our friends  which road leads to the wicked witch of the west asked dorothy  there is no road answered the guardian of the gates  no one ever wishes to go that way  how then are we to find her inquired the girl  that will be easy replied the man for when she knows you are in the country of the winkies she will find you and make you all her slaves  perhaps not said the scarecrow for we mean to destroy her  oh that is different said the guardian of the gates  no one has ever destroyed her before so i naturally thought she would make slaves of you as she has of the rest  but take care for she is wicked and fierce and may not allow you to destroy her  keep to the west where the sun sets and you cannot fail to find her  they thanked him and bade him goodbye and turned toward the west walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups  dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace but now to her surprise she found it was no longer green but pure white  the ribbon around totos neck had also lost its green color and was as white as dorothys dress  the emerald city was soon left far behind  as they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west and the ground was untilled  in the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces for there were no trees to offer them shade so that before night dorothy and toto and the lion were tired and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch  now the wicked witch of the west had but one eye yet that was as powerful as a telescope and could see everywhere  so as she sat in the door of her castle she happened to look around and saw dorothy lying asleep with her friends all about her  they were a long distance off but the wicked witch was angry to find them in her country so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck  at once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves  they had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth  go to those people said the witch and tear them to pieces  are you not going to make them your slaves asked the leader of the wolves  no she answered one is of tin and one of straw one is a girl and another a lion  none of them is fit to work so you may tear them into small pieces  very well said the wolf and he dashed away at full speed followed by the others  it was lucky the scarecrow and the woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming  this is my fight said the woodman so get behind me and i will meet them as they come  he seized his axe which he had made very sharp and as the leader of the wolves came on the tin woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolfs head from its body so that it immediately died  as soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up and he also fell under the sharp edge of the tin woodmans weapon  there were forty wolves and forty times a wolf was killed so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the woodman  then he put down his axe and sat beside the scarecrow who said it was a good fight friend  they waited until dorothy awoke the next morning  the little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves but the tin woodman told her all  she thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast after which they started again upon their journey  now this same morning the wicked witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off  she saw all her wolves lying dead and the strangers still traveling through her country  this made her angrier than before and she blew her silver whistle twice  straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her enough to darken the sky  and the wicked witch said to the king crow fly at once to the strangers peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces  the wild crows flew in one great flock toward dorothy and her companions  when the little girl saw them coming she was afraid  but the scarecrow said this is my battle so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed  so they all lay upon the ground except the scarecrow and he stood up and stretched out his arms  and when the crows saw him they were frightened as these birds always are by scarecrows and did not dare to come any nearer  but the king crow said  it is only a stuffed man  i will peck his eyes out  the king crow flew at the scarecrow who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died  and then another crow flew at him and the scarecrow twisted its neck also  there were forty crows and forty times the scarecrow twisted a neck until at last all were lying dead beside him  then he called to his companions to rise and again they went upon their journey  when the wicked witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap she got into a terrible rage and blew three times upon her silver whistle  forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her  go to the strangers and sting them to death commanded the witch and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where dorothy and her friends were walking  but the woodman had seen them coming and the scarecrow had decided what to do  take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the lion he said to the woodman and the bees cannot sting them this the woodman did and as dorothy lay close beside the lion and held toto in her arms the straw covered them entirely  the bees came and found no one but the woodman to sting so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin without hurting the woodman at all  and as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees and they lay scattered thick about the woodman like little heaps of fine coal  then dorothy and the lion got up and the girl helped the tin woodman put the straw back into the scarecrow again until he was as good as ever  so they started upon their journey once more  the wicked witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth  and then she called a dozen of her slaves who were the winkies and gave them sharp spears telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them  the winkies were not a brave people but they had to do as they were told  so they marched away until they came near to dorothy  then the lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them and the poor winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could  when they returned to the castle the wicked witch beat them well with a strap and sent them back to their work after which she sat down to think what she should do next  she could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed but she was a powerful witch as well as a wicked one and she soon made up her mind how to act  there was in her cupboard a golden cap with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it  this golden cap had a charm  whoever owned it could call three times upon the winged monkeys who would obey any order they were given  but no person could command these strange creatures more than three times  twice already the wicked witch had used the charm of the cap  once was when she had made the winkies her slaves and set herself to rule over their country  the winged monkeys had helped her do this  the second time was when she had fought against the great oz himself and driven him out of the land of the west  the winged monkeys had also helped her in doing this  only once more could she use this golden cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted  but now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone and her slaves had been scared away by the cowardly lion she saw there was only one way left to destroy dorothy and her friends  so the wicked witch took the golden cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head  then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly  eppe peppe kakke  next she stood upon her right foot and said  hillo hollo hello  after this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice  zizzy zuzzy zik  now the charm began to work  the sky was darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air  there was a rushing of many wings a great chattering and laughing and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the wicked witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders  one much bigger than the others seemed to be their leader  he flew close to the witch and said you have called us for the third and last time  what do you command  go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the lion said the wicked witch  bring that beast to me for i have a mind to harness him like a horse and make him work  your commands shall be obeyed said the leader  then with a great deal of chattering and noise the winged monkeys flew away to the place where dorothy and her friends were walking  some of the monkeys seized the tin woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks here they dropped the poor woodman who fell a great distance to the rocks where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan  others of the monkeys caught the scarecrow and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head  they made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree  the remaining monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way  then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the witchs castle where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it so that he could not escape  but dorothy they did not harm at all  she stood with toto in her arms watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn  the leader of the winged monkeys flew up to her his long hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly but he saw the mark of the good witchs kiss upon her forehead and stopped short motioning the others not to touch her  we dare not harm this little girl he said to them for she is protected by the power of good and that is greater than the power of evil  all we can do is to carry her to the castle of the wicked witch and leave her there  so carefully and gently they lifted dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle where they set her down upon the front doorstep  then the leader said to the witch  we have obeyed you as far as we were able  the tin woodman and the scarecrow are destroyed and the lion is tied up in your yard  the little girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carries in her arms your power over our band is now ended and you will never see us again  then all the winged monkeys with much laughing and chattering and noise flew into the air and were soon out of sight  the wicked witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on dorothys forehead for she knew well that neither the winged monkeys nor she herself dare hurt the girl in any way  she looked down at dorothys feet and seeing the silver shoes began to tremble with fear for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them  at first the witch was tempted to run away from dorothy but she happened to look into the childs eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the silver shoes gave her  so the wicked witch laughed to herself and thought i can still make her my slave for she does not know how to use her power then she said to dorothy harshly and severely  come with me and see that you mind everything i tell you for if you do not i will make an end of you as i did of the tin woodman and the scarecrow  dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen where the witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood  dorothy went to work meekly with her mind made up to work as hard as she could for she was glad the wicked witch had decided not to kill her  with dorothy hard at work the witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the cowardly lion like a horse it would amuse her she was sure to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive  but as she opened the gate the lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the witch was afraid and ran out and shut the gate again  if i cannot harness you said the witch to the lion speaking through the bars of the gate i can starve you  you shall have nothing to eat until you do as i wish  so after that she took no food to the imprisoned lion but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked are you ready to be harnessed like a horse  and the lion would answer no  if you come in this yard i will bite you  the reason the lion did not have to do as the witch wished was that every night while the woman was asleep dorothy carried him food from the cupboard  after he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw and dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft shaggy mane while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape  but they could find no way to get out of the castle for it was constantly guarded by the yellow winkies who were the slaves of the wicked witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them  the girl had to work hard during the day and often the witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand  but in truth she did not dare to strike dorothy because of the mark upon her forehead  the child did not know this and was full of fear for herself and toto  once the witch struck toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return  the witch did not bleed where she was bitten for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before  dorothys life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to kansas and aunt em again  sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours with toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress  toto did not really care whether he was in kansas or the land of oz so long as dorothy was with him but he knew the little girl was unhappy and that made him unhappy too  now the wicked witch had a great longing to have for her own the silver shoes which the girl always wore  her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up and she had used up all the power of the golden cap but if she could only get hold of the silver shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost  she watched dorothy carefully to see if she ever took off her shoes thinking she might steal them  but the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath  the witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in dorothys room at night to take the shoes and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark so she never came near when dorothy was bathing  indeed the old witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her in any way  but the wicked creature was very cunning and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted  she placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes  so that when dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar not being able to see it and fell at full length  she was not much hurt but in her fall one of the silver shoes came off and before she could reach it the witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot  the wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm and dorothy could not use it against her even had she known how to do so  the little girl seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes grew angry and said to the witch give me back my shoe  i will not retorted the witch for it is now my shoe and not yours  you are a wicked creature cried dorothy  you have no right to take my shoe from me  i shall keep it just the same said the witch laughing at her and someday i shall get the other one from you too  this made dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the witch wetting her from head to foot  instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear and then as dorothy looked at her in wonder the witch began to shrink and fall away  see what you have done she screamed  in a minute i shall melt away  im very sorry indeed said dorothy who was truly frightened to see the witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes  didnt you know water would be the end of me asked the witch in a wailing despairing voice  of course not answered dorothy  how should i  well in a few minutes i shall be all melted and you will have the castle to yourself  i have been wicked in my day but i never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds  look outhere i go  with these words the witch fell down in a brown melted shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor  seeing that she had really melted away to nothing dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess  she then swept it all out the door  after picking out the silver shoe which was all that was left of the old woman she cleaned and dried it with a cloth and put it on her foot again  then being at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the lion that the wicked witch of the west had come to an end and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land     13  the rescue   the cowardly lion was much pleased to hear that the wicked witch had been melted by a bucket of water and dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free  they went in together to the castle where dorothys first act was to call all the winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves  there was great rejoicing among the yellow winkies for they had been made to work hard during many years for the wicked witch who had always treated them with great cruelty  they kept this day as a holiday then and ever after and spent the time in feasting and dancing  if our friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman were only with us said the lion i should be quite happy  dont you suppose we could rescue them asked the girl anxiously  we can try answered the lion  so they called the yellow winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends and the winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for dorothy who had set them free from bondage  so she chose a number of the winkies who looked as if they knew the most and they all started away  they traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the tin woodman lay all battered and bent  his axe was near him but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short  the winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms and carried him back to the yellow castle again dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend and the lion looking sober and sorry when they reached the castle dorothy said to the winkies  are any of your people tinsmiths  oh yes  some of us are very good tinsmiths they told her  then bring them to me she said  and when the tinsmiths came bringing with them all their tools in baskets she inquired can you straighten out those dents in the tin woodman and bend him back into shape again and solder him together where he is broken  the tinsmiths looked the woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever  so they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the tin woodman until at last he was straightened out into his old form and his joints worked as well as ever  to be sure there were several patches on him but the tinsmiths did a good job and as the woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all  when at last he walked into dorothys room and thanked her for rescuing him he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy and dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron so his joints would not be rusted  at the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again and these tears did not need to be wiped away  as for the lion he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried  if we only had the scarecrow with us again said the tin woodman when dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened i should be quite happy  we must try to find him said the girl  so she called the winkies to help her and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the winged monkeys had tossed the scarecrows clothes  it was a very tall tree and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it but the woodman said at once ill chop it down and then we can get the scarecrows clothes  now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the woodman himself another of the winkies who was a goldsmith had made an axehandle of solid gold and fitted it to the woodmans axe instead of the old broken handle  others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver  as soon as he had spoken the tin woodman began to chop and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash whereupon the scarecrows clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground  dorothy picked them up and had the winkies carry them back to the castle where they were stuffed with nice clean straw and behold here was the scarecrow as good as ever thanking them over and over again for saving him  now that they were reunited dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the yellow castle where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable  but one day the girl thought of aunt em and said we must go back to oz and claim his promise  yes said the woodman at last i shall get my heart  and i shall get my brains added the scarecrow joyfully  and i shall get my courage said the lion thoughtfully  and i shall get back to kansas cried dorothy clapping her hands oh let us start for the emerald city tomorrow  this they decided to do  the next day they called the winkies together and bade them goodbye  the winkies were sorry to have them go and they had grown so fond of the tin woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the yellow land of the west  finding they were determined to go the winkies gave toto and the lion each a golden collar and to dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds and to the scarecrow they gave a goldheaded walking stick to keep him from stumbling and to the tin woodman they offered a silver oilcan inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels  every one of the travelers made the winkies a pretty speech in return and all shook hands with them until their arms ached  dorothy went to the witchs cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey and there she saw the golden cap  she tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly  she did not know anything about the charm of the golden cap but she saw that it was pretty so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket  then being prepared for the journey they all started for the emerald city and the winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them     14  the winged monkeys   you will remember there was no roadnot even a pathwaybetween the castle of the wicked witch and the emerald city  when the four travelers went in search of the witch she had seen them coming and so sent the winged monkeys to bring them to her  it was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried  they knew of course they must go straight east toward the rising sun and they started off in the right way  but at noon when the sun was over their heads they did not know which was east and which was west and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields  they kept on walking however and at night the moon came out and shone brightly  so they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morningall but the scarecrow and the tin woodman  the next morning the sun was behind a cloud but they started on as if they were quite sure which way they were going  if we walk far enough said dorothy i am sure we shall sometime come to some place  but day by day passed away and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields  the scarecrow began to grumble a bit  we have surely lost our way he said and unless we find it again in time to reach the emerald city i shall never get my brains  nor i my heart declared the tin woodman  it seems to me i can scarcely wait till i get to oz and you must admit this is a very long journey  you see said the cowardly lion with a whimper i havent the courage to keep tramping forever without getting anywhere at all  then dorothy lost heart  she sat down on the grass and looked at her companions and they sat down and looked at her and toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head  so he put out his tongue and panted and looked at dorothy as if to ask what they should do next  suppose we call the field mice she suggested  they could probably tell us the way to the emerald city  to be sure they could cried the scarecrow  why didnt we think of that before  dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the queen of the mice had given it to her  in a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet and many of the small gray mice came running up to her  among them was the queen herself who asked in her squeaky little voice  what can i do for my friends  we have lost our way said dorothy  can you tell us where the emerald city is  certainly answered the queen but it is a great way off for you have had it at your backs all this time  then she noticed dorothys golden cap and said why dont you use the charm of the cap and call the winged monkeys to you  they will carry you to the city of oz in less than an hour  i didnt know there was a charm answered dorothy in surprise what is it  it is written inside the golden cap replied the queen of the mice but if you are going to call the winged monkeys we must run away for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us  wont they hurt me asked the girl anxiously  oh no  they must obey the wearer of the cap  goodbye and she scampered out of sight with all the mice hurrying after her  dorothy looked inside the golden cap and saw some words written upon the lining  these she thought must be the charm so she read the directions carefully and put the cap upon her head  eppe peppe kakke she said standing on her left foot  what did you say asked the scarecrow who did not know what she was doing  hillo hollo hello  dorothy went on standing this time on her right foot  hello replied the tin woodman calmly  zizzy zuzzy zik said dorothy who was now standing on both feet this ended the saying of the charm and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings as the band of winged monkeys flew up to them  the king bowed low before dorothy and asked what is your command  we wish to go to the emerald city said the child and we have lost our way  we will carry you replied the king and no sooner had he spoken than two of the monkeys caught dorothy in their arms and flew away with her others took the scarecrow and the woodman and the lion and one little monkey seized toto and flew after them although the dog tried hard to bite him  the scarecrow and the tin woodman were rather frightened at first for they remembered how badly the winged monkeys had treated them before but they saw that no harm was intended so they rode through the air quite cheerfully and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them  dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest monkeys one of them the king himself  they had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her  why do you have to obey the charm of the golden cap she asked  that is a long story answered the king with a winged laugh but as we have a long journey before us i will pass the time by telling you about it if you wish  i shall be glad to hear it she replied  once began the leader we were a free people living happily in the great forest flying from tree to tree eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master  perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings chasing birds and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest  but we were careless and happy and full of fun and enjoyed every minute of the day  this was many years ago long before oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land  there lived here then away at the north a beautiful princess who was also a powerful sorceress  all her magic was used to help the people and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good  her name was gayelette and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby  everyone loved her but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise  at last however she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years  gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish  when he grew to manhood quelala as he was called was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land while his manly beauty was so great that gayelette loved him dearly and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding  my grandfather was at that time the king of the winged monkeys which lived in the forest near gayelettes palace and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner  one day just before the wedding my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw quelala walking beside the river  he was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do  at his word the band flew down and seized quelala carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river and then dropped him into the water  swim out my fine fellow cried my grandfather and see if the water has spotted your clothes  quelala was much too wise not to swim and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune  he laughed when he came to the top of the water and swam in to shore but when gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river  the princess was angry and she knew of course who did it  she had all the winged monkeys brought before her and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated quelala and dropped in the river  but my grandfather pleaded hard for he knew the monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied and quelala said a kind word for them also so that gayelette finally spared them on condition that the winged monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the golden cap  this cap had been made for a wedding present to quelala and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom  of course my grandfather and all the other monkeys at once agreed to the condition and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the golden cap whosoever he may be  and what became of them asked dorothy who had been greatly interested in the story  quelala being the first owner of the golden cap replied the monkey he was the first to lay his wishes upon us  as his bride could not bear the sight of us he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a winged monkey which we were glad to do for we were all afraid of her  this was all we ever had to do until the golden cap fell into the hands of the wicked witch of the west who made us enslave the winkies and afterward drive oz himself out of the land of the west  now the golden cap is yours and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us  as the monkey king finished his story dorothy looked down and saw the green shining walls of the emerald city before them  she wondered at the rapid flight of the monkeys but was glad the journey was over the strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the city the king bowed low to dorothy and then flew swiftly away followed by all his band  that was a good ride said the little girl  yes and a quick way out of our troubles replied the lion  how lucky it was you brought away that wonderful cap       15  the discovery of oz the terrible   the four travelers walked up to the great gate of emerald city and rang the bell  after ringing several times it was opened by the same guardian of the gates they had met before  what are you back again he asked in surprise  do you not see us answered the scarecrow  but i thought you had gone to visit the wicked witch of the west  we did visit her said the scarecrow  and she let you go again asked the man in wonder  she could not help it for she is melted explained the scarecrow  melted  well that is good news indeed said the man  who melted her  it was dorothy said the lion gravely  good gracious exclaimed the man and he bowed very low indeed before her  then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes just as he had done before  afterward they passed on through the gate into the emerald city  when the people heard from the guardian of the gates that dorothy had melted the wicked witch of the west they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the palace of oz  the soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door but he let them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl who showed each of them to their old rooms at once so they might rest until the great oz was ready to receive them  the soldier had the news carried straight to oz that dorothy and the other travelers had come back again after destroying the wicked witch but oz made no reply  they thought the great wizard would send for them at once but he did not  they had no word from him the next day nor the next nor the next  the waiting was tiresome and wearing and at last they grew vexed that oz should treat them in so poor a fashion after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery  so the scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to oz saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the winged monkeys to help them and find out whether he kept his promises or not when the wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the throne room at four minutes after nine oclock the next morning  he had once met the winged monkeys in the land of the west and he did not wish to meet them again  the four travelers passed a sleepless night each thinking of the gift oz had promised to bestow on him  dorothy fell asleep only once and then she dreamed she was in kansas where aunt em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again  promptly at nine oclock the next morning the greenwhiskered soldier came to them and four minutes later they all went into the throne room of the great oz  of course each one of them expected to see the wizard in the shape he had taken before and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room  they kept close to the door and closer to one another for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen oz take  presently they heard a solemn voice that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome and it said  i am oz the great and terrible  why do you seek me  they looked again in every part of the room and then seeing no one dorothy asked where are you  i am everywhere answered the voice but to the eyes of common mortals i am invisible  i will now seat myself upon my throne that you may converse with me  indeed the voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself so they walked toward it and stood in a row while dorothy said  we have come to claim our promise o oz  what promise asked oz  you promised to send me back to kansas when the wicked witch was destroyed said the girl  and you promised to give me brains said the scarecrow  and you promised to give me a heart said the tin woodman  and you promised to give me courage said the cowardly lion  is the wicked witch really destroyed asked the voice and dorothy thought it trembled a little  yes she answered i melted her with a bucket of water  dear me said the voice how sudden  well come to me tomorrow for i must have time to think it over  youve had plenty of time already said the tin woodman angrily  we shant wait a day longer said the scarecrow  you must keep your promises to us exclaimed dorothy  the lion thought it might be as well to frighten the wizard so he gave a large loud roar which was so fierce and dreadful that toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner  as it fell with a crash they looked that way and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder  for they saw standing in just the spot the screen had hidden a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face who seemed to be as much surprised as they were the tin woodman raising his axe rushed toward the little man and cried out who are you  i am oz the great and terrible said the little man in a trembling voice  but dont strike meplease dontand ill do anything you want me to  our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay  i thought oz was a great head said dorothy  and i thought oz was a lovely lady said the scarecrow  and i thought oz was a terrible beast said the tin woodman  and i thought oz was a ball of fire exclaimed the lion  no you are all wrong said the little man meekly  i have been making believe  making believe cried dorothy  are you not a great wizard  hush my dear he said  dont speak so loud or you will be overheardand i should be ruined  im supposed to be a great wizard  and arent you she asked  not a bit of it my dear im just a common man  youre more than that said the scarecrow in a grieved tone youre a humbug  exactly so declared the little man rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him  i am a humbug  but this is terrible said the tin woodman  how shall i ever get my heart  or i my courage asked the lion  or i my brains wailed the scarecrow wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve  my dear friends said oz i pray you not to speak of these little things  think of me and the terrible trouble im in at being found out  doesnt anyone else know youre a humbug asked dorothy  no one knows it but you fourand myself replied oz  i have fooled everyone so long that i thought i should never be found out  it was a great mistake my ever letting you into the throne room  usually i will not see even my subjects and so they believe i am something terrible  but i dont understand said dorothy in bewilderment  how was it that you appeared to me as a great head  that was one of my tricks answered oz  step this way please and i will tell you all about it  he led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the throne room and they all followed him  he pointed to one corner in which lay the great head made out of many thicknesses of paper and with a carefully painted face  this i hung from the ceiling by a wire said oz  i stood behind the screen and pulled a thread to make the eyes move and the mouth open  but how about the voice she inquired  oh i am a ventriloquist said the little man  i can throw the sound of my voice wherever i wish so that you thought it was coming out of the head  here are the other things i used to deceive you  he showed the scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely lady  and the tin woodman saw that his terrible beast was nothing but a lot of skins sewn together with slats to keep their sides out  as for the ball of fire the false wizard had hung that also from the ceiling  it was really a ball of cotton but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely  really said the scarecrow you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug  i ami certainly am answered the little man sorrowfully but it was the only thing i could do  sit down please there are plenty of chairs and i will tell you my story  so they sat down and listened while he told the following tale  i was born in omaha  why that isnt very far from kansas cried dorothy  no but its farther from here he said shaking his head at her sadly  when i grew up i became a ventriloquist and at that i was very well trained by a great master  i can imitate any kind of a bird or beast  here he mewed so like a kitten that toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was  after a time continued oz i tired of that and became a balloonist  what is that asked dorothy  a man who goes up in a balloon on circus day so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus he explained  oh she said i know  well one day i went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted so that i couldnt come down again  it went way up above the clouds so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many many miles away  for a day and a night i traveled through the air and on the morning of the second day i awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country  it came down gradually and i was not hurt a bit  but i found myself in the midst of a strange people who seeing me come from the clouds thought i was a great wizard  of course i let them think so because they were afraid of me and promised to do anything i wished them to  just to amuse myself and keep the good people busy i ordered them to build this city and my palace and they did it all willingly and well then i thought as the country was so green and beautiful i would call it the emerald city and to make the name fit better i put green spectacles on all the people so that everything they saw was green  but isnt everything here green asked dorothy  no more than in any other city replied oz but when you wear green spectacles why of course everything you see looks green to you  the emerald city was built a great many years ago for i was a young man when the balloon brought me here and i am a very old man now  but my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an emerald city and it certainly is a beautiful place abounding in jewels and precious metals and every good thing that is needed to make one happy  i have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this palace was built i have shut myself up and would not see any of them  one of my greatest fears was the witches for while i had no magical powers at all i soon found out that the witches were really able to do wonderful things  there were four of them in this country and they ruled the people who live in the north and south and east and west fortunately the witches of the north and south were good and i knew they would do me no harm but the witches of the east and west were terribly wicked and had they not thought i was more powerful than they themselves they would surely have destroyed me  as it was i lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased i was when i heard your house had fallen on the wicked witch of the east when you came to me i was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other witch but now that you have melted her i am ashamed to say that i cannot keep my promises  i think you are a very bad man said dorothy  oh no my dear im really a very good man but im a very bad wizard i must admit  cant you give me brains asked the scarecrow  you dont need them  you are learning something every day  a baby has brains but it doesnt know much  experience is the only thing that brings knowledge and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get  that may all be true said the scarecrow but i shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains  the false wizard looked at him carefully  well he said with a sigh im not much of a magician as i said but if you will come to me tomorrow morning i will stuff your head with brains  i cannot tell you how to use them however you must find that out for yourself  oh thank youthank you cried the scarecrow  ill find a way to use them never fear  but how about my courage asked the lion anxiously  you have plenty of courage i am sure answered oz  all you need is confidence in yourself  there is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger  the true courage is in facing danger when you are afraid and that kind of courage you have in plenty  perhaps i have but im scared just the same said the lion  i shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid  very well i will give you that sort of courage tomorrow replied oz  how about my heart asked the tin woodman  why as for that answered oz i think you are wrong to want a heart  it makes most people unhappy  if you only knew it you are in luck not to have a heart  that must be a matter of opinion said the tin woodman  for my part i will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur if you will give me the heart  very well answered oz meekly  come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart  i have played wizard for so many years that i may as well continue the part a little longer  and now said dorothy how am i to get back to kansas  we shall have to think about that replied the little man  give me two or three days to consider the matter and ill try to find a way to carry you over the desert  in the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests and while you live in the palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish  there is only one thing i ask in return for my helpsuch as it is  you must keep my secret and tell no one i am a humbug  they agreed to say nothing of what they had learned and went back to their rooms in high spirits  even dorothy had hope that the great and terrible humbug as she called him would find a way to send her back to kansas and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything       16  the magic art of the great humbug   next morning the scarecrow said to his friends  congratulate me  i am going to oz to get my brains at last  when i return i shall be as other men are  i have always liked you as you were said dorothy simply  it is kind of you to like a scarecrow he replied  but surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out  then he said goodbye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the throne room where he rapped upon the door  come in said oz  the scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window engaged in deep thought  i have come for my brains remarked the scarecrow a little uneasily  oh yes sit down in that chair please replied oz  you must excuse me for taking your head off but i shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place  thats all right said the scarecrow  you are quite welcome to take my head off as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again  so the wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw  then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran which he mixed with a great many pins and needles  having shaken them together thoroughly he filled the top of the scarecrows head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw to hold it in place  when he had fastened the scarecrows head on his body again he said to him hereafter you will be a great man for i have given you a lot of brannew brains  the scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish and having thanked oz warmly he went back to his friends  dorothy looked at him curiously  his head was quite bulged out at the top with brains  how do you feel she asked  i feel wise indeed he answered earnestly  when i get used to my brains i shall know everything  why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head asked the tin woodman  that is proof that he is sharp remarked the lion  well i must go to oz and get my heart said the woodman  so he walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in called oz and the woodman entered and said i have come for my heart  very well answered the little man  but i shall have to cut a hole in your breast so i can put your heart in the right place  i hope it wont hurt you  oh no answered the woodman  i shall not feel it at all  so oz brought a pair of tinsmiths shears and cut a small square hole in the left side of the tin woodmans breast  then going to a chest of drawers he took out a pretty heart made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust  isnt it a beauty he asked  it is indeed replied the woodman who was greatly pleased  but is it a kind heart  oh very answered oz  he put the heart in the woodmans breast and then replaced the square of tin soldering it neatly together where it had been cut  there said he now you have a heart that any man might be proud of im sorry i had to put a patch on your breast but it really couldnt be helped  never mind the patch exclaimed the happy woodman  i am very grateful to you and shall never forget your kindness  dont speak of it replied oz  then the tin woodman went back to his friends who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune  the lion now walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in said oz  i have come for my courage announced the lion entering the room  very well answered the little man i will get it for you  he went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle the contents of which he poured into a greengold dish beautifully carved  placing this before the cowardly lion who sniffed at it as if he did not like it the wizard said  drink  what is it asked the lion  well answered oz if it were inside of you it would be courage you know of course that courage is always inside one so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it  therefore i advise you to drink it as soon as possible  the lion hesitated no longer but drank till the dish was empty  how do you feel now asked oz  full of courage replied the lion who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune  oz left to himself smiled to think of his success in giving the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion exactly what they thought they wanted  how can i help being a humbug he said when all these people make me do things that everybody knows cant be done  it was easy to make the scarecrow and the lion and the woodman happy because they imagined i could do anything  but it will take more than imagination to carry dorothy back to kansas and im sure i dont know how it can be done     17  how the balloon was launched   for three days dorothy heard nothing from oz  these were sad days for the little girl although her friends were all quite happy and contented  the scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself  when the tin woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast and he told dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh  the lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce kalidahs  thus each of the little party was satisfied except dorothy who longed more than ever to get back to kansas  on the fourth day to her great joy oz sent for her and when she entered the throne room he greeted her pleasantly  sit down my dear i think i have found the way to get you out of this country  and back to kansas she asked eagerly  well im not sure about kansas said oz for i havent the faintest notion which way it lies  but the first thing to do is to cross the desert and then it should be easy to find your way home  how can i cross the desert she inquired  well ill tell you what i think said the little man  you see when i came to this country it was in a balloon  you also came through the air being carried by a cyclone  so i believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air  now it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone but ive been thinking the matter over and i believe i can make a balloon  how asked dorothy  a balloon said oz is made of silk which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it  i have plenty of silk in the palace so it will be no trouble to make the balloon  but in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with to make it float  if it wont float remarked dorothy it will be of no use to us  true answered oz  but there is another way to make it float which is to fill it with hot air  hot air isnt as good as gas for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert and we should be lost  we exclaimed the girl  are you going with me  yes of course replied oz  i am tired of being such a humbug  if i should go out of this palace my people would soon discover i am not a wizard and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them so i have to stay shut up in these rooms all day and it gets tiresome id much rather go back to kansas with you and be in a circus again  i shall be glad to have your company said dorothy  thank you he answered  now if you will help me sew the silk together we will begin to work on our balloon  so dorothy took a needle and thread and as fast as oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together  first there was a strip of light green silk then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green for oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them  it took three days to sew all the strips together but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long  then oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue to make it airtight after which he announced that the balloon was ready  but we must have a basket to ride in he said  so he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon  when it was all ready oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother wizard who lived in the clouds  the news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight  oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the palace and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity  the tin woodman had chopped a big pile of wood and now he made a fire of it and oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag  gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air until finally the basket just touched the ground  then oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice  i am now going away to make a visit  while i am gone the scarecrow will rule over you  i command you to obey him as you would me  the balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground for the air within it was hot and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky  come dorothy cried the wizard  hurry up or the balloon will fly away  i cant find toto anywhere replied dorothy who did not wish to leave her little dog behind  toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten and dorothy at last found him  she picked him up and ran towards the balloon  she was within a few steps of it and oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket when crack went the ropes and the balloon rose into the air without her  come back she screamed  i want to go too  i cant come back my dear called oz from the basket  goodbye  goodbye shouted everyone and all eyes were turned upward to where the wizard was riding in the basket rising every moment farther and farther into the sky  and that was the last any of them ever saw of oz the wonderful wizard though he may have reached omaha safely and be there now for all we know  but the people remembered him lovingly and said to one another  oz was always our friend  when he was here he built for us this beautiful emerald city and now he is gone he has left the wise scarecrow to rule over us  still for many days they grieved over the loss of the wonderful wizard and would not be comforted     18  away to the south   dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to kansas again but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon  and she also felt sorry at losing oz and so did her companions  the tin woodman came to her and said  truly i should be ungrateful if i failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart  i should like to cry a little because oz is gone if you will kindly wipe away my tears so that i shall not rust  with pleasure she answered and brought a towel at once  then the tin woodman wept for several minutes and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel  when he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oilcan to guard against mishap  the scarecrow was now the ruler of the emerald city and although he was not a wizard the people were proud of him  for they said there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man  and so far as they knew they were quite right  the morning after the balloon had gone up with oz the four travelers met in the throne room and talked matters over  the scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him  we are not so unlucky said the new ruler for this palace and the emerald city belong to us and we can do just as we please  when i remember that a short time ago i was up on a pole in a farmers cornfield and that now i am the ruler of this beautiful city i am quite satisfied with my lot  i also said the tin woodman am wellpleased with my new heart and really that was the only thing i wished in all the world  for my part i am content in knowing i am as brave as any beast that ever lived if not braver said the lion modestly  if dorothy would only be contented to live in the emerald city continued the scarecrow we might all be happy together  but i dont want to live here cried dorothy  i want to go to kansas and live with aunt em and uncle henry  well then what can be done inquired the woodman  the scarecrow decided to think and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains  finally he said  why not call the winged monkeys and ask them to carry you over the desert  i never thought of that said dorothy joyfully  its just the thing  ill go at once for the golden cap  when she brought it into the throne room she spoke the magic words and soon the band of winged monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her  this is the second time you have called us said the monkey king bowing before the little girl  what do you wish  i want you to fly with me to kansas said dorothy  but the monkey king shook his head  that cannot be done he said  we belong to this country alone and cannot leave it  there has never been a winged monkey in kansas yet and i suppose there never will be for they dont belong there  we shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power but we cannot cross the desert  goodbye  and with another bow the monkey king spread his wings and flew away through the window followed by all his band  dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment  i have wasted the charm of the golden cap to no purpose she said for the winged monkeys cannot help me  it is certainly too bad said the tenderhearted woodman  the scarecrow was thinking again and his head bulged out so horribly that dorothy feared it would burst  let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers he said and ask his advice  so the soldier was summoned and entered the throne room timidly for while oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door  this little girl said the scarecrow to the soldier wishes to cross the desert  how can she do so  i cannot tell answered the soldier for nobody has ever crossed the desert unless it is oz himself  is there no one who can help me asked dorothy earnestly  glinda might he suggested  who is glinda inquired the scarecrow  the witch of the south  she is the most powerful of all the witches and rules over the quadlings  besides her castle stands on the edge of the desert so she may know a way to cross it  glinda is a good witch isnt she asked the child  the quadlings think she is good said the soldier and she is kind to everyone  i have heard that glinda is a beautiful woman who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived  how can i get to her castle asked dorothy  the road is straight to the south he answered but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers  there are wild beasts in the woods and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country for this reason none of the quadlings ever come to the emerald city  the soldier then left them and the scarecrow said  it seems in spite of dangers that the best thing dorothy can do is to travel to the land of the south and ask glinda to help her  for of course if dorothy stays here she will never get back to kansas  you must have been thinking again remarked the tin woodman  i have said the scarecrow  i shall go with dorothy declared the lion for i am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again  i am really a wild beast you know  besides dorothy will need someone to protect her  that is true agreed the woodman  my axe may be of service to her so i also will go with her to the land of the south  when shall we start asked the scarecrow  are you going they asked in surprise  certainly  if it wasnt for dorothy i should never have had brains she lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the emerald city  so my good luck is all due to her and i shall never leave her until she starts back to kansas for good and all  thank you said dorothy gratefully  you are all very kind to me but i should like to start as soon as possible  we shall go tomorrow morning returned the scarecrow  so now let us all get ready for it will be a long journey     19  attacked by the fighting trees   the next morning dorothy kissed the pretty green girl goodbye and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers who had walked with them as far as the gate  when the guardian of the gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful city to get into new trouble  but he at once unlocked their spectacles which he put back into the green box and gave them many good wishes to carry with them  you are now our ruler he said to the scarecrow so you must come back to us as soon as possible  i certainly shall if i am able the scarecrow replied but i must help dorothy to get home first  as dorothy bade the goodnatured guardian a last farewell she said  i have been very kindly treated in your lovely city and everyone has been good to me  i cannot tell you how grateful i am  dont try my dear he answered  we should like to keep you with us but if it is your wish to return to kansas i hope you will find a way  he then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey  the sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the land of the south  they were all in the best of spirits and laughed and chatted together  dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were glad to be of use to her  as for the lion he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again while toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies barking merrily all the time  city life does not agree with me at all remarked the lion as they walked along at a brisk pace  i have lost much flesh since i lived there and now i am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous i have grown  they now turned and took a last look at the emerald city  all they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls and high up above everything the spires and dome of the palace of oz  oz was not such a bad wizard after all said the tin woodman as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast  he knew how to give me brains and very good brains too said the scarecrow  if oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me added the lion he would have been a brave man  dorothy said nothing  oz had not kept the promise he made her but he had done his best so she forgave him  as he said he was a good man even if he was a bad wizard  the first days journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the emerald city on every side  they slept that night on the grass with nothing but the stars over them and they rested very well indeed  in the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood  there was no way of going around it for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see and besides they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost  so they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest  the scarecrow who was in the lead finally discovered a big tree with such widespreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath  so he walked forward to the tree but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers  this did not hurt the scarecrow but it surprised him and he looked rather dizzy when dorothy picked him up  here is another space between the trees called the lion  let me try it first said the scarecrow for it doesnt hurt me to get thrown about  he walked up to another tree as he spoke but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again  this is strange exclaimed dorothy  what shall we do  the trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us and stop our journey remarked the lion  i believe i will try it myself said the woodman and shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree that had handled the scarecrow so roughly  when a big branch bent down to seize him the woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two  at once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain and the tin woodman passed safely under it  come on he shouted to the others  be quick  they all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury except toto who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled  but the woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free  the other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches and that probably these were the policemen of the forest and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it  the four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood  then to their surprise they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china  it was smooth like the surface of a dish and higher than their heads  what shall we do now asked dorothy  i will make a ladder said the tin woodman for we certainly must climb over the wall     20  the dainty china country   while the woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest dorothy lay down and slept for she was tired by the long walk the lion also curled himself up to sleep and toto lay beside him  the scarecrow watched the woodman while he worked and said to him  i cannot think why this wall is here nor what it is made of  rest your brains and do not worry about the wall replied the woodman  when we have climbed over it we shall know what is on the other side  after a time the ladder was finished  it looked clumsy but the tin woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose  the scarecrow waked dorothy and the lion and toto and told them that the ladder was ready  the scarecrow climbed up the ladder first but he was so awkward that dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off  when he got his head over the top of the wall the scarecrow said oh my  go on exclaimed dorothy  so the scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall and dorothy put her head over and cried oh my just as the scarecrow had done  then toto came up and immediately began to bark but dorothy made him be still  the lion climbed the ladder next and the tin woodman came last but both of them cried oh my as soon as they looked over the wall when they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight  before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter  scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors  these houses were quite small the biggest of them reaching only as high as dorothys waist  there were also pretty little barns with china fences around them and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens all made of china were standing about in groups  but the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country  there were milkmaids and shepherdesses with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them and golden buckles on their shoes and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads wearing ermine robes and satin doublets and funny clowns in ruffled gowns with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall pointed caps  and strangest of all these people were all made of china even to their clothes and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than dorothys knee  no one did so much as look at the travelers at first except one little purple china dog with an extralarge head which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice afterwards running away again  how shall we get down asked dorothy  they found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up so the scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet  of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet  when all were safely down they picked up the scarecrow whose body was quite flattened out and patted his straw into shape again  we must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side said dorothy for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due south  they began walking through the country of the china people and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow  as they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool the pail and even the milkmaid herself and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter  dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off and that the pail was lying in several small pieces while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow  there cried the milkmaid angrily  see what you have done  my cow has broken her leg and i must take her to the menders shop and have it glued on again  what do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow  im very sorry returned dorothy  please forgive us  but the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer  she picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away the poor animal limping on three legs  as she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers holding her nicked elbow close to her side  dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap  we must be very careful here said the kindhearted woodman or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it  a little farther on dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young princess who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away  dorothy wanted to see more of the princess so she ran after her  but the china girl cried out  dont chase me  dont chase me  she had such a frightened little voice that dorothy stopped and said why not  because answered the princess also stopping a safe distance away if i run i may fall down and break myself  but could you not be mended asked the girl  oh yes but one is never so pretty after being mended you know replied the princess  i suppose not said dorothy  now there is mr joker one of our clowns continued the china lady who is always trying to stand upon his head  he has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places and doesnt look at all pretty  here he comes now so you can see for yourself  indeed a jolly little clown came walking toward them and dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places  the clown put his hands in his pockets and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said    my lady fair      why do you stare    at poor old mr joker      youre quite as stiff    and prim as if      youd eaten up a poker   be quiet sir said the princess  cant you see these are strangers and should be treated with respect  well thats respect i expect declared the clown and immediately stood upon his head  dont mind mr joker said the princess to dorothy  he is considerably cracked in his head and that makes him foolish  oh i dont mind him a bit said dorothy  but you are so beautiful she continued that i am sure i could love you dearly wont you let me carry you back to kansas and stand you on aunt ems mantel  i could carry you in my basket  that would make me very unhappy answered the china princess  you see here in our country we live contentedly and can talk and move around as we please  but whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen and we can only stand straight and look pretty  of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawingroom tables but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country  i would not make you unhappy for all the world exclaimed dorothy so ill just say goodbye  goodbye replied the princess  they walked carefully through the china country  the little animals and all the people scampered out of their way fearing the strangers would break them and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall  it was not so high as the first however and by standing upon the lions back they all managed to scramble to the top  then the lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces  that was too bad said dorothy but really i think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cows leg and a church  they are all so brittle  they are indeed said the scarecrow and i am thankful i am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged  there are worse things in the world than being a scarecrow     21  the lion becomes the king of beasts   after climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall rank grass  it was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight however by carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground  but here the country seemed wilder than ever and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen  this forest is perfectly delightful declared the lion looking around him with joy  never have i seen a more beautiful place  it seems gloomy said the scarecrow  not a bit of it answered the lion  i should like to live here all my life  see how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees  surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home  perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now said dorothy  i suppose there are returned the lion but i do not see any of them about  they walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther  dorothy and toto and the lion lay down to sleep while the woodman and the scarecrow kept watch over them as usual  when morning came they started again  before they had gone far they heard a low rumble as of the growling of many wild animals  toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the welltrodden path until they came to an opening in the wood in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety there were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history and for a moment dorothy was afraid but the lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble  as he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic  the biggest of the tigers came up to the lion and bowed saying  welcome o king of beasts  you have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more  what is your trouble asked the lion quietly  we are all threatened answered the tiger by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest  it is a most tremendous monster like a great spider with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk  it has eight of these long legs and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth where he eats it as a spider does a fly  not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us  the lion thought for a moment  are there any other lions in this forest he asked  no there were some but the monster has eaten them all  and besides they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you  if i put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as king of the forest inquired the lion  we will do that gladly returned the tiger and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar we will  where is this great spider of yours now asked the lion  yonder among the oak trees said the tiger pointing with his forefoot  take good care of these friends of mine said the lion and i will go at once to fight the monster  he bade his comrades goodbye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy  the great spider was lying asleep when the lion found him and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust  its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said and its body covered with coarse black hair  it had a great mouth with a row of sharp teeth a foot long but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasps waist  this gave the lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monsters back  then with one blow of his heavy paw all armed with sharp claws he knocked the spiders head from its body  jumping down he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling when he knew it was quite dead  the lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly  you need fear your enemy no longer  then the beasts bowed down to the lion as their king and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as dorothy was safely on her way to kansas     22  the country of the quadlings   the four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock  that will be a hard climb said the scarecrow but we must get over the hill nevertheless  so he led the way and the others followed  they had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out keep back  who are you asked the scarecrow  then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said this hill belongs to us and we dont allow anyone to cross it  but we must cross it said the scarecrow  were going to the country of the quadlings  but you shall not replied the voice and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen  he was quite short and stout and had a big head which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles  but he had no arms at all and seeing this the scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill  so he said im sorry not to do as you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not and he walked boldly forward  as quick as lightning the mans head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head where it was flat struck the scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling over and over down the hill  almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body and the man laughed harshly as he said it isnt as easy as you think  a chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks and dorothy saw hundreds of the armless hammerheads upon the hillside one behind every rock  the lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the scarecrows mishap and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill  again a head shot swiftly out and the great lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball  dorothy ran down and helped the scarecrow to his feet and the lion came up to her feeling rather bruised and sore and said it is useless to fight people with shooting heads no one can withstand them  what can we do then she asked  call the winged monkeys suggested the tin woodman  you have still the right to command them once more  very well she answered and putting on the golden cap she uttered the magic words  the monkeys were as prompt as ever and in a few moments the entire band stood before her  what are your commands inquired the king of the monkeys bowing low  carry us over the hill to the country of the quadlings answered the girl  it shall be done said the king and at once the winged monkeys caught the four travelers and toto up in their arms and flew away with them  as they passed over the hill the hammerheads yelled with vexation and shot their heads high in the air but they could not reach the winged monkeys which carried dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the quadlings  this is the last time you can summon us said the leader to dorothy so goodbye and good luck to you  goodbye and thank you very much returned the girl and the monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling  the country of the quadlings seemed rich and happy  there was field upon field of ripening grain with wellpaved roads running between and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them  the fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the winkies and blue in the country of the munchkins  the quadlings themselves who were short and fat and looked chubby and goodnatured were dressed all in red which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain  the monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door  it was opened by the farmers wife and when dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies and a bowl of milk for toto  how far is it to the castle of glinda asked the child  it is not a great way answered the farmers wife  take the road to the south and you will soon reach it  thanking the good woman they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful castle  before the gates were three young girls dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid and as dorothy approached one of them said to her  why have you come to the south country  to see the good witch who rules here she answered  will you take me to her  let me have your name and i will ask glinda if she will receive you they told who they were and the girl soldier went into the castle after a few moments she came back to say that dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once     23  glinda the good witch grants dorothys wish   before they went to see glinda however they were taken to a room of the castle where dorothy washed her face and combed her hair and the lion shook the dust out of his mane and the scarecrow patted himself into his best shape and the woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints  when they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the witch glinda sat upon a throne of rubies  she was both beautiful and young to their eyes  her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders  her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue and they looked kindly upon the little girl  what can i do for you my child she asked  dorothy told the witch all her story how the cyclone had brought her to the land of oz how she had found her companions and of the wonderful adventures they had met with  my greatest wish now she added is to get back to kansas for aunt em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me and that will make her put on mourning and unless the crops are better this year than they were last i am sure uncle henry cannot afford it  glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet upturned face of the loving little girl  bless your dear heart she said i am sure i can tell you of a way to get back to kansas  then she added but if i do you must give me the golden cap  willingly exclaimed dorothy indeed it is of no use to me now and when you have it you can command the winged monkeys three times  and i think i shall need their service just those three times answered glinda smiling  dorothy then gave her the golden cap and the witch said to the scarecrow what will you do when dorothy has left us  i will return to the emerald city he replied for oz has made me its ruler and the people like me  the only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the hammerheads  by means of the golden cap i shall command the winged monkeys to carry you to the gates of the emerald city said glinda for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler  am i really wonderful asked the scarecrow  you are unusual replied glinda  turning to the tin woodman she asked what will become of you when dorothy leaves this country  he leaned on his axe and thought a moment  then he said the winkies were very kind to me and wanted me to rule over them after the wicked witch died  i am fond of the winkies and if i could get back again to the country of the west i should like nothing better than to rule over them forever  my second command to the winged monkeys said glinda will be that they carry you safely to the land of the winkies  your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the scarecrow but you are really brighter than he iswhen you are well polishedand i am sure you will rule the winkies wisely and well  then the witch looked at the big shaggy lion and asked when dorothy has returned to her own home what will become of you  over the hill of the hammerheads he answered lies a grand old forest and all the beasts that live there have made me their king  if i could only get back to this forest i would pass my life very happily there  my third command to the winged monkeys said glinda shall be to carry you to your forest  then having used up the powers of the golden cap i shall give it to the king of the monkeys that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore  the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion now thanked the good witch earnestly for her kindness and dorothy exclaimed  you are certainly as good as you are beautiful  but you have not yet told me how to get back to kansas  your silver shoes will carry you over the desert replied glinda if you had known their power you could have gone back to your aunt em the very first day you came to this country  but then i should not have had my wonderful brains cried the scarecrow  i might have passed my whole life in the farmers cornfield  and i should not have had my lovely heart said the tin woodman  i might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world  and i should have lived a coward forever declared the lion and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me  this is all true said dorothy and i am glad i was of use to these good friends  but now that each of them has had what he most desired and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides i think i should like to go back to kansas  the silver shoes said the good witch have wonderful powers  and one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps and each step will be made in the wink of an eye  all you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go  if that is so said the child joyfully i will ask them to carry me back to kansas at once  she threw her arms around the lions neck and kissed him patting his big head tenderly  then she kissed the tin woodman who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints  but she hugged the soft stuffed body of the scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades  glinda the good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a goodbye kiss and dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself  dorothy now took toto up solemnly in her arms and having said one last goodbye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times saying  take me home to aunt em  instantly she was whirling through the air so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears  the silver shoes took but three steps and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was  at length however she sat up and looked about her  good gracious she cried  for she was sitting on the broad kansas prairie and just before her was the new farmhouse uncle henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one  uncle henry was milking the cows in the barnyard and toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn barking furiously  dorothy stood up and found she was in her stockingfeet  for the silver shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air and were lost forever in the desert     24  home again   aunt em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw dorothy running toward her  my darling child she cried folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses  where in the world did you come from  from the land of oz said dorothy gravely  and here is toto too and oh aunt em  im so glad to be at home again
