25905789	something new   by pelham grenville wodehouse     chapter i  the sunshine of a fair spring morning fell graciously on london town out in piccadilly its heartening warmth seemed to infuse into traffic and pedestrians alike a novel jauntiness so that bus drivers jested and even the lips of chauffeurs uncurled into not unkindly smiles policemen whistled at their postsclerks on their way to work beggars approached the task of trying to persuade perfect strangers to bear the burden of their maintenance with that optimistic vim which makes all the difference it was one of those happy mornings  at nine oclock precisely the door of number seven arundell street leicester square opened and a young man stepped out  of all the spots in london which may fairly be described as backwaters there is none that answers so completely to the description as arundell street leicester square passing along the north sidewalk of the square just where it joins piccadilly you hardly notice the bottleneck opening of the tiny culdesac day and night the human flood roars past ignoring it arundell street is less than forty yards in length and though there are two hotels in it they are not fashionable hotels it is just a backwater  in shape arundell street is exactly like one of those flat stone jars in which italian wine of the cheaper sort is stored the narrow neck that leads off leicester square opens abruptly into a small court hotels occupy two sides of this the third is at present given up to rooming houses for the impecunious these are always just going to be pulled down in the name of progress to make room for another hotel but they never do meet with that fate and as they stand now so will they in all probability stand for generations to come  they provide single rooms of moderate size the bed modestly hidden during the day behind a battered screen the rooms contain a table an easychair a hard chair a bureau and a round tin bath which like the bed goes into hiding after its useful work is performed and you may rent one of these rooms with breakfast thrown in for five dollars a week  ashe marson had done so he had rented the secondfloor front of number seven  twentysix years before this story opens there had been born to joseph marson minister and sarah his wife of hayling massachusetts in the united states of america a son this son christened ashe after a wealthy uncle who subsequently doublecrossed them by leaving his money to charities in due course proceeded to harvard to study for the ministry so far as can be ascertained from contemporary records he did not study a great deal for the ministry but he did succeed in running the mile in four minutes and a half and the half mile at a correspondingly rapid speed and his researches in the art of long jumping won him the respect of all  that he should be awarded at the conclusion of his harvard career one of those scholarships at oxford university instituted by the late cecil rhodes for the encouragement of the liberal arts was a natural sequence of events  that was how ashe came to be in england  the rest of ashes history follows almost automatically he won his blue for athletics at oxford and gladdened thousands by winning the mile and the half mile two years in succession against cambridge at queens club but owing to the pressure of other engagements he unfortunately omitted to do any studying and when the hour of parting arrived he was peculiarly unfitted for any of the learned professions having however managed to obtain a sort of degree enough to enable him to call himself a bachelor of arts and realizing that you can fool some of the people some of the time he applied for and secured a series of private tutorships  a private tutor is a sort of blend of poor relation and nursemaid and few of the stately homes of england are without one he is supposed to instill learning and deportment into the small son of the house but what he is really there for is to prevent the latter from being a nuisance to his parents when he is home from school on his vacation  having saved a little money at this dreadful trade ashe came to london and tried newspaper work after two years of moderate success he got in touch with the mammoth publishing company  the mammoth publishing company which controls several important newspapers a few weekly journals and a number of other things does not disdain the pennies of the office boy and the junior clerk one of its many profitable ventures is a series of papercovered tales of crime and adventure it was here that ashe found his niche those adventures of gridley quayle investigator which are so popular with a certain section of the reading public were his work  until the advent of ashe and mr quayle the british pluck library had been written by many hands and had included the adventures of many heroes but in gridley quayle the proprietors held that the ideal had been reached and ashe received a commission to conduct the entire british pluck librarymonthlyhimself on the meager salary paid him for these labors he had been supporting himself ever since  that was how ashe came to be in arundell street leicester square on this may morning  he was a tall wellbuilt fitlooking young man with a clear eye and a strong chin and he was dressed as he closed the front door behind him in a sweater flannel trousers and rubbersoled gymnasium shoes in one hand he bore a pair of indian clubs in the other a skipping rope  having drawn in and expelled the morning air in a measured and solemn fashion which the initiated observer would have recognized as that scientific deep breathing so popular nowadays he laid down his clubs adjusted his rope and began to skip  when he had taken the secondfloor front of number seven three months before ashe marson had realized that he must forego those morning exercises which had become a second nature to him or else defy londons unwritten law and brave londons mockery he had not hesitated long physical fitness was his gospel on the subject of exercise he was confessedly a crank he decided to defy london  the first time he appeared in arundell street in his sweater and flannels he had barely whirled his indian clubs once around his head before he had attracted the following audience    a two cabmenone intoxicated    b four waiters from the hotel mathis    c six waiters from the hotel previtali    d six chambermaids from the hotel mathis    e five chambermaids from the hotel previtali    f the proprietor of the hotel mathis    g the proprietor of the hotel previtali    h a street cleaner    i eleven nondescript loafers    j twentyseven children    k a cat  they all laughedeven the catand kept on laughing the intoxicated cabman called ashe sunny jim and ashe kept on swinging his clubs  a month later such is the magic of perseverance his audience had narrowed down to the twentyseven children they still laughed but without that ringing conviction which the sympathetic support of their elders had lent them  and now after three months the neighborhood having accepted ashe and his morning exercises as a natural phenomenon paid him no further attention  on this particular morning ashe marson skipped with even more than his usual vigor this was because he wished to expel by means of physical fatigue a small devil of discontent of whose presence within him he had been aware ever since getting out of bed it is in the spring that the ache for the larger life comes on us and this was a particularly mellow spring morning it was the sort of morning when the air gives us a feeling of anticipationa feeling that on a day like this things surely cannot go jogging along in the same dull old groove a premonition that something romantic and exciting is about to happen to us  but the southwest wind of spring brings also remorse we catch the vague spirit of unrest in the air and we regret our misspent youth  ashe was doing this even as he skipped he was conscious of a wish that he had studied harder at college and was now in a position to be doing something better than hack work for a soulless publishing company never before had he been so completely certain that he was sick to death of the rut into which he had fallen  skipping brought no balm he threw down his rope and took up the indian clubs indian clubs left him still unsatisfied the thought came to him that it was a long time since he had done his larsen exercises perhaps they would heal him  the larsen exercises invented by a certain lieutenant larsen of the swedish army have almost every sort of merit they make a man strong supple and slender but they are not dignified indeed to one seeing them suddenly and without warning for the first time they are markedly humorous the only reason why king henry of england whose son sank with the white ship never smiled again was because lieutenant larsen had not then invented his admirable exercises  so complacent so insolently unselfconscious had ashe become in the course of three months owing to his success in inducing the populace to look on anything he did with the indulgent eye of understanding that it simply did not occur to him when he abruptly twisted his body into the shape of a corkscrew in accordance with the directions in the lieutenants book for the consummation of exercise one that he was doing anything funny  and the behavior of those present seemed to justify his confidence the proprietor of the hotel mathis regarded him without a smile the proprietor of the hotel previtali might have been in a trance for all the interest he displayed the hotel employees continued their tasks impassively the children were blind and dumb the cat across the way stropped its backbone against the railings unheeding  but even as he unscrambled himself and resumed a normal posture from his immediate rear there rent the quiet morning air a clear and musical laugh it floated out on the breeze and hit him like a bullet  three months ago ashe would have accepted the laugh as inevitable and would have refused to allow it to embarrass him but long immunity from ridicule had sapped his resolution he spun round with a jump flushed and selfconscious  from the window of the firstfloor front of number seven a girl was leaning the spring sunshine played on her golden hair and lit up her bright blue eyes fixed on his flanneled and sweatered person with a fascinated amusement even as he turned the laugh smote him afresh  for the space of perhaps two seconds they stared at each other eye to eye then she vanished into the room  ashe was beaten three months ago a million girls could have laughed at his morning exercises without turning him from his purpose today this one scoffer alone and unaided was sufficient for his undoing the depression which exercise had begun to dispel surged back on him he had no heart to continue sadly gathering up his belongings he returned to his room and found a cold bath tame and uninspiring  the breakfastsincluded in the rentprovided by mrs bell the landlady of number seven were held by some authorities to be specially designed to quell the spirits of their victims should they tend to soar excessively by the time ashe had done his best with the disheveled fried egg the chicory blasphemously called coffee and the charred bacon misery had him firmly in its grip and when he forced himself to the table and began to try to concoct the latest of the adventures of gridley quayle investigator his spirit groaned within him  this morning as he sat and chewed his pen his loathing for gridley seemed to have reached its climax it was his habit in writing these stories to think of a good title first and then fit an adventure to it and overnight in a moment of inspiration he had jotted down on an envelope the words the adventure of the wand of death  it was with the sullen repulsion of a vegetarian who finds a caterpillar in his salad that he now sat glaring at them  the title had seemed so promising overnightso full of strenuous possibilities it was still speciously attractive but now that the moment had arrived for writing the story its flaws became manifest  what was a wand of death it sounded good but coming down to hard facts what was it you cannot write a story about a wand of death without knowing what a wand of death is and conversely if you have thought of such a splendid title you cannot jettison it offhand ashe rumpled his hair and gnawed his pen  there came a knock at the door  ashe spun round in his chair this was the last straw if he had told mrs ball once that he was never to be disturbed in the morning on any pretext whatsoever he had told her twenty times it was simply too infernal to be endured if his work time was to be cut into like this ashe ran over in his mind a few opening remarks  come in he shouted and braced himself for battle  a girl walked inthe girl of the firstfloor front the girl with the blue eyes who had laughed at his larsen exercises  various circumstances contributed to the poorness of the figure ashe cut in the opening moments of this interview in the first place he was expecting to see his landlady whose height was about four feet six and the sudden entry of somebody who was about five feet seven threw the universe temporarily out of focus in the second place in anticipation of mrs bells entry he had twisted his face into a forbidding scowl and it was no slight matter to change this on the spur of the moment into a pleasant smile finally a man who has been sitting for half an hour in front of a sheet of paper bearing the words the adventure of the wand of death and trying to decide what a wand of death might be has not his mind under proper control  the net result of these things was that for perhaps half a minute ashe behaved absurdly he goggled and he yammered an alienist had one been present would have made up his mind about him without further investigation for an appreciable time he did not think of rising from his seat when he did the combined leap and twist he executed practically amounted to a larsen exercise  nor was the girl unembarrassed if ashe had been calmer he would have observed on her cheek the flush which told that she too was finding the situation trying but woman being ever better equipped with poise than man it was she who spoke first  im afraid im disturbing you  no no said ashe oh no not at allnot at all no oh nonot at allno and would have continued to play on the theme indefinitely had not the girl spoken again  i wanted to apologize she said for my abominable rudeness in laughing at you just now it was idiotic of me and i dont know why i did it im sorry  science with a thousand triumphs to her credit has not yet succeeded in discovering the correct reply for a young man to make who finds himself in the appalling position of being apologized to by a pretty girl if he says nothing he seems sullen and unforgiving if he says anything he makes a fool of himself ashe hesitating between these two courses suddenly caught sight of the sheet of paper over which he had been poring so long  what is a wand of death he asked  i beg your pardon  a wand of death  i dont understand  the delirium of the conversation was too much for ashe he burst out laughing a moment later the girl did the same and simultaneously embarrassment ceased to be  i suppose you think im mad said ashe  certainly said the girl  well i should have been if you hadnt come in  why was that  i was trying to write a detective story  i was wondering whether you were a writer  do you write  yes do you ever read home gossip  never  you are quite right to speak in that thankful tone its a horrid little paperall brownpaper patterns and advice to the lovelorn and puzzles i do a short story for it every week under various names a duke or an earl goes with each story i loathe it intensely  i am sorry for your troubles said ashe firmly but we are wandering from the point what is a wand of death  a wand of death  a wand of death  the girl frowned reflectively  why of course its the sacred ebony stick stolen from the indian temple which is supposed to bring death to whoever possesses it the hero gets hold of it and the priests dog him and send him threatening messages what else could it be  ashe could not restrain his admiration  this is genius  oh no  absolute genius i see it all the hero calls in gridley quayle and that patronizing ass by the aid of a series of wicked coincidences solves the mystery and there am i with another months work done  she looked at him with interest  are you the author of gridley quayle  dont tell me you read him  i do not read him but he is published by the same firm that publishes home gossip and i cant help seeing his cover sometimes while i am waiting in the waiting room to see the editress  ashe felt like one who meets a boyhoods chum on a desert island here was a real bond between them  does the mammoth publish you too why we are comrades in misfortunefellow serfs we should be friends shall we be friends  i should be delighted  shall we shake hands sit down and talk about ourselves a little  but i am keeping you from your work  an errand of mercy  she sat down it is a simple act this of sitting down but like everything else it may be an index to character there was something wholly satisfactory to ashe in the manner in which this girl did it she neither seated herself on the extreme edge of the easychair as one braced for instant flight nor did she wallow in the easychair as one come to stay for the weekend she carried herself in an unconventional situation with an unstudied selfconfidence that he could not sufficiently admire  etiquette is not rigid in arundell street but nevertheless a girl in a firstfloor front may be excused for showing surprise and hesitation when invited to a confidential chat with a secondfloor front young man whom she has known only five minutes but there is a freemasonry among those who live in large cities on small earnings  shall we introduce ourselves said ashe or did mrs bell tell you my name by the way you have not been here long have you  i took my room day before yesterday but your name if you are the author of gridley quayle is felix clovelly isnt it  good heavens no surely you dont think anyones name could really be felix clovelly that is only the cloak under which i hide my shame my real name is marsonashe marson and yours  valentinejoan valentine  will you tell me the story of your life or shall i tell mine first  i dont know that i have any particular story i am an american  not american  why not  because it is too extraordinary too much like a gridley quayle coincidence i am an american  well so are a good many other people  you miss the point we are not only fellow serfswe are fellow exiles you cant round the thing off by telling me you were born in hayling massachusetts i suppose  i was born in new york  surely not i didnt know anybody was  why hayling massachusetts  that was where i was born  im afraid i never heard of it  strange i know your home town quite well but i have not yet made my birthplace famous in fact i doubt whether i ever shall i am beginning to realize that i am one of the failures  how old are you  twentysix  you are only twentysix and you call yourself a failure i think that is a shameful thing to say  what would you call a man of twentysix whose only means of making a living was the writing of gridley quayle storiesan empire builder  how do you know its your only means of making a living why dont you try something new  such as  how should i know anything that comes along good gracious mr marson here you are in the biggest city in the world with chances for adventure simply shrieking to you on every side  i must be deaf the only thing i have heard shrieking to me on every side has been mrs bellfor the weeks rent  read the papers read the advertisement columns im sure you will find something sooner or later dont get into a groove be an adventurer snatch at the next chance whatever it is  ashe nodded  continue he said proceed you are stimulating me  but why should you want a girl like me to stimulate you surely london is enough to do it without my help you can always find something new surely listen mr marson i was thrown on my own resources about five years agonever mind how since then i have worked in a shop done typewriting been on the stage had a position as governess been a ladys maid  a what a ladys maid  why not it was all experience and i can assure you i would much rather be a ladys maid than a governess  i think i know what you mean i was a private tutor once i suppose a governess is the female equivalent i have often wondered what general sherman would have said about private tutoring if he expressed himself so breezily about mere war was it fun being a ladys maid  it was pretty good fun and it gave me an opportunity of studying the aristocracy in its native haunts which has made me the gossips established authority on dukes and earls  ashe drew a deep breathnot a scientific deep breath but one of admiration  you are perfectly splendid  splendid  i mean you have such pluck  oh well i keep on trying im twentythree and i havent achieved anything much yet but i certainly dont feel like sitting back and calling myself a failure  ashe made a grimace  all right he said ive got it  i meant you to said joan placidly i hope i havent bored you with my autobiography mr marson im not setting myself up as a shining example but i do like action and hate stagnation  you are absolutely wonderful said ashe you are a human correspondence course in efficiency one of the ones you see advertised in the back pages of the magazines beginning young man are you earning enough with a picture showing the dead beat gazing wistfully at the boss chair you would galvanize a jellyfish  if i have really stimulated you  i think that was another slam said ashe pensively well i deserve it yes you have stimulated me i feel like a new man its queer that you should have come to me right on top of everything else i dont remember when i have felt so restless and discontented as this morning  its the spring  i suppose it is i feel like doing something big and adventurous  well do it then you have a morning post on the table have you read it yet  i glanced at it  but you havent read the advertisement pages read them they may contain just the opening you want  well ill do it but my experience of advertisement pages is that they are monopolized by philanthropists who want to lend you any sum from ten to a hundred thousand pounds on your note of hand only however i will scan them  joan rose and held out her hand  goodby mr marson youve got your detective story to write and i have to think out something with a duke in it by tonight so i must be going she smiled we have traveled a good way from the point where we started but i may as well go back to it before i leave you im sorry i laughed at you this morning  ashe clasped her hand in a fervent grip  im not come and laugh at me whenever you feel like it i like being laughed at why when i started my morning exercises half of london used to come and roll about the sidewalks in convulsions im not an attraction any longer and it makes me feel lonesome there are twentynine of those larsen exercises and you saw only part of the first you have done so much for me that if i can be of any use to you in helping you to greet the day with a smile i shall be only too proud exercise six is a surefire mirthprovoker ill start with it tomorrow morning i can also recommend exercise elevena scream dont miss it  very well well goodby for the present  goodby  she was gone and ashe thrilling with new emotions stared at the door which had closed behind her he felt as though he had been wakened from sleep by a powerful electric shock  close beside the sheet of paper on which he had inscribed the now luminous and suggestive title of his new gridley quayle story lay the morning post the advertisement columns of which he had promised her to explore the least he could do was to begin at once  his spirits sank as he did so it was the same old game a mr brian macneill though doing no business with minors was willingeven anxiousto part with his vast fortune to anyone over the age of twentyone whose means happened to be a trifle straitened this good man required no security whatever nor did his rivals in generosity the messrs angus bruce duncan macfarlane wallace mackintosh and donald macnab they too showed a curious distaste for dealing with minors but anyone of maturer years could simply come round to the office and help himself  ashe threw the paper down wearily he had known all along that it was no good romance was dead and the unexpected no longer happened he picked up his pen and began to write the adventure of the wand of death    chapter ii  in a bedroom on the fourth floor of the hotel guelph in piccadilly the honorable frederick threepwood sat in bed with his knees drawn up to his chin and glared at the day with the glare of mental anguish he had very little mind but what he had was suffering  he had just remembered it is like that in this life you wake up feeling as fit as a fiddle you look at the window and see the sun and thank heaven for a fine day you begin to plan a perfectly corking luncheon party with some of the chappies you met last night at the national sporting club and thenyou remember  oh dash it said the honorable freddie and after a moments pause and i was feeling so dashed happy  for the space of some minutes he remained plunged in sad meditation then picking up the telephone from the table at his side he asked for a number  hello  hello responded a rich voice at the other end of the wire  oh i say is that you dickie  who is that  this is freddie threepwood i say dickie old top i want to see you about something devilish important will you be in at twelve  certainly whats the trouble  i cant explain over the wire but its deuced serious  very well by the way freddie congratulations on the engagement  thanks old man thanks very much and so onbut you wont forget to be in at twelve will you goodby  he replaced the receiver quickly and sprang out of bed for he had heard the door handle turn when the door opened he was giving a correct representation of a young man wasting no time in beginning his toilet for the day  an elderly thinfaced baldheaded amiably vacant man entered he regarded the honorable freddie with a certain disfavor  are you only just getting up frederick  hello govnor good morning i shant be two ticks now  you should have been out and about two hours ago the day is glorious  shant be more than a minute govnor now just got to have a tub and then chuck on a few clothes  he disappeared into the bathroom his father taking a chair placed the tips of his fingers together and in this attitude remained motionless a figure of disapproval and suppressed annoyance  like many fathers in his rank of life the earl of emsworth had suffered much through that problem which with the exception of mr lloydgeorge is practically the only fly in the british aristocratic amberthe problem of what to do with the younger sons  it is useless to try to gloss over the factin the aristocratic families of great britain the younger son is not required  apart however from the fact that he was a younger son and as such a nuisance in any case the honorable freddie had always annoyed his father in a variety of ways the earl of emsworth was so constituted that no man or thing really had the power to trouble him deeply but freddie had come nearer to doing it than anybody else in the world there had been a consistency a perseverance about his irritating performances that had acted on the placid peer as dripping water on a stone isolated acts of annoyance would have been powerless to ruffle his calm but freddie had been exploding bombs under his nose since he went to eton  he had been expelled from eton for breaking out at night and roaming the streets of windsor in a false mustache he had been sent down from oxford for pouring ink from a secondstory window on the junior dean of his college he had spent two years at an expensive london crammers and failed to pass into the army he had also accumulated an almost record series of racing debts besides as shady a gang of friendsfor the most part vaguely connected with the turfas any young man of his age ever contrived to collect  these things try the most placid of parents and finally lord emsworth had put his foot down it was the only occasion in his life when he had acted with decision and he did it with the accumulated energy of years he stopped his sons allowance haled him home to blandings castle and kept him there so relentlessly that until the previous night when they had come up together by an afternoon train freddie had not seen london for nearly a year  possibly it was the reflection that whatever his secret troubles he was at any rate once more in his beloved metropolis that caused freddie at this point to burst into discordant song he splashed and warbled simultaneously  lord emsworths frown deepened and he began to tap his fingers together irritably then his brow cleared and a pleased smile flickered over his face he too had remembered  what lord emsworth remembered was this late in the previous autumn the next estate to blandings had been rented by an american a mr petersa man with many millions chronic dyspepsia and one fair daughteraline the two families had met freddie and aline had been thrown together and only a few days before the engagement had been announced and for lord emsworth the only flaw in this best of all possible worlds had been removed  yes he was glad freddie was engaged to be married to aline peters he liked aline he liked mr peters such was the relief he experienced that he found himself feeling almost affectionate toward freddie who emerged from the bathroom at this moment clad in a pink bathrobe to find the paternal wrath evaporated and all so to speak right with the world  nevertheless he wasted no time about his dressing he was always ill at ease in his fathers presence and he wished to be elsewhere with all possible speed he sprang into his trousers with such energy that he nearly tripped himself up as he disentangled himself he recollected something that had slipped his memory  by the way govnor i met an old pal of mine last night and asked him down to blandings this week thats all right isnt it hes a man named emerson an american he knows aline quite well he sayshas known her since she was a kid  i do not remember any friend of yours named emerson  well as a matter of fact i met him last night for the first time but its all right hes a good chap dont you know and all that sort of rot  lord emsworth was feeling too benevolent to raise the objections he certainly would have raised had his mood been less sunny  certainly let him come if he wishes  thanks govnor  freddie completed his toilet  doing anything special this morning govnor i rather thought of getting a bit of breakfast and then strolling round a bit have you had breakfast  two hours ago i trust that in the course of your strolling you will find time to call at mr peters and see aline i shall be going there directly after lunch mr peters wishes to show me his collection ofi think scarabs was the word he used  oh ill look in all right dont you worry or if i dont ill call the old boy up on the phone and pass the time of day well i rather think ill be popping off and getting that bit of breakfastwhat  several comments on this speech suggested themselves to lord emsworth in the first place he did not approve of freddies allusion to one of americas merchant princes as the old boy second his sons attitude did not strike him as the ideal attitude of a young man toward his betrothed there seemed to be a lack of warmth but he reflected possibly this was simply another manifestation of the modern spirit and in any case it was not worth bothering about so he offered no criticism  presently freddie having given his shoes a flick with a silk handkerchief and thrust the latter carefully up his sleeve they passed out and down into the main lobby of the hotel where they partedfreddie to his bit of breakfast his father to potter about the streets and kill time until luncheon london was always a trial to the earl of emsworth his heart was in the country and the city held no fascinations for him                                  on one of the floors in one of the buildings in one of the streets that slope precipitously from the strand to the thames embankment there is a door that would be all the better for a lick of paint which bears what is perhaps the most modest and unostentatious announcement of its kind in london the grimy groundglass displays the words                    r jones  simply that and nothing more it is rugged in its simplicity you wonder as you look at itif you have time to look at and wonder about these thingswho this jones may be and what is the business he conducts with such coy reticence  as a matter of fact these speculations had passed through suspicious minds at scotland yard which had for some time taken not a little interest in r jones but beyond ascertaining that he bought and sold curios did a certain amount of bookmaking during the flatracing season and had been known to lend money scotland yard did not find out much about mr jones and presently dismissed him from its thoughts  on the theory given to the world by william shakespeare that it is the lean and hungrylooking men who are dangerous and that the fat sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights are harmless r jones should have been above suspicion he was infinitely the fattest man in the westcentral postal district of london he was a round ball of a man who wheezed when he walked upstairs which was seldom and shook like jelly if some tactless friend wishing to attract his attention tapped him unexpectedly on the shoulder but this occurred still less frequently than his walking upstairs for in r jones circle it was recognized that nothing is a greater breach of etiquette and worse form than to tap people unexpectedly on the shoulder that it was felt should be left to those who are paid by the government to do it  r jones was about fifty years old grayhaired of a mauve complexion jovial among his friends and perhaps even more jovial with chance acquaintances it was estimated by envious intimates that his joviality with chance acquaintances specially with young men of the upper classes with large purses and small foreheadswas worth hundreds of pounds a year to him there was something about his comfortable appearance and his jolly manner that irresistibly attracted a certain type of young man it was his good fortune that this type of young man should be the type financially most worth attracting  freddie threepwood had fallen under his spell during his short but crowded life in london they had met for the first time at the derby and ever since then r jones had held in freddies estimation that position of guide philosopher and friend which he held in the estimation of so many young men of freddies stamp  that was why at twelve oclock punctually on this spring day he tapped with his cane on r jones ground glass and showed such satisfaction and relief when the door was opened by the proprietor in person  well well well said r jones rollickingly whom have we here the dashing bridegroomtobe and no other  r jones like lord emsworth was delighted that freddie was about to marry a nice girl with plenty of money the sudden turning off of the tap from which freddies allowance had flowed had hit him hard he had other sources of income of course but few so easy and unfailing as freddie had been in the days of his prosperity  the prodigal son by george creeping back into the fold after all this weary time it seems years since i saw you freddie the old govnor put his foot downdidnt heand stopped the funds damned shame i take it that things have loosened up a bit since the engagement was announcedeh  freddie sat down and chewed the knob of his cane unhappily  well as a matter of fact dickie old top he said not so that you could notice it dont you know things are still pretty much the same i managed to get away from blandings for a night because the govnor had to come to london but ive got to go back with him on the threeoclock train and as for money i cant get a quid out of him as a matter of fact im in the deuce of a hole and thats why ive come to you  even fat jovial men have their moments of depression r jones face clouded and jerky remarks about hardness of times and losses on the stock exchange began to proceed from him as scotland yard had discovered he lent money on occasion but he did not lend it to youths in freddies unfortunate position  oh i dont want to make a touch you know freddie hastened to explain it isnt that as a matter of fact i managed to raise five hundred of the best this morning that ought to be enough  depends on what you want it for said r jones magically genial once more  the thought entered his mind as it had so often that the world was full of easy marks he wished he could meet the moneylender who had been rash enough to advance the honorable freddie five hundred pounds those philanthropists cross our path too seldom  freddie felt in his pocket produced a cigarette case and from it extracted a newspaper clipping  did you read about poor old percy in the papers the case you know  percy  lord stockheath you know  oh the stockheath breachofpromise case i did more than that i was in court all three days r jones emitted a cozy chuckle is he a pal of yours a cousin eh i wish you had seen him in the witness box with jellicoesmith crossexamining him the funniest thing i ever heard and his letters to the girl they read them out in court and of all  dont old man dickie old topplease i know all about it i read the reports they made poor old percy look like an absolute ass  well nature had done that already but im bound to say they improved on natures work i should think your cousin percy must have felt like a plucked chicken  a spasm of pain passed over the honorable freddies vacant face he wriggled in his chair  dickie old man i wish you wouldnt talk like that it makes me feel ill  why is he such a pal of yours as all that  its not that itsthe fact is dickie old top im in exactly the same bally hole as poor old percy was myself  what you have been sued for breach of promise  not absolutely thatyet look here ill tell you the whole thing do you remember a show at the piccadilly about a year ago called the baby doll there was a girl in the chorus  severali remember noticing  no i mean one particular girla girl called joan valentine the rotten part is that i never met her  pull yourself together freddie what exactly is the trouble  welldont you seei used to go to the show every other night and i fell frightfully in love with this girl  without having met her  yes you see i was rather an ass in those days  no no said r jones handsomely  i must have been or i shouldnt have been such an ass dont you know well as i was saying i used to write this girl letters saying how much i was in love with her andand  specifically proposing marriage  i cant remember i expect i did i was awfully in love  how was that if you never met her  she wouldnt meet me she wouldnt even come out to luncheon she didnt even answer my lettersjust sent word down by the johnny at the stage door and then  freddies voice died away he thrust the knob of his cane into his mouth in a sort of frenzy  what then inquired r jones  a scarlet blush manifested itself on freddies young face his eyes wandered sidewise after a long pause a single word escaped him almost inaudible  poetry  r jones trembled as though an electric current had been passed through his plump frame his little eyes sparkled with merriment  you wrote her poetry  yards of it old boyyards of it groaned freddie panic filled him with speech you see the frightful hole im in this girl is bound to have kept the letters i dont remember whether i actually proposed to her or not but anyway shes got enough material to make it worth while to have a dash at an actionespecially after poor old percy has just got soaked for such a pile of money and made breachofpromise cases the fashion so to speak  and now that the announcement of my engagement is out shes certain to get busy probably she has been waiting for something of the sort dont you see that all the cards are in her hands we couldnt afford to let the thing come into court that poetry would dish my marriage for a certainty id have to emigrate or something goodness knows what would happen at home my old govnor would murder me so you see what a frightful hole im in dont you dickie old man  and what do you want me to do  why to get hold of this girl and get back the lettersdont you see i cant do it myself cooped up miles away in the country and besides i shouldnt know how to handle a thing like that it needs a chappie with a lot of sense and a persuasive sort of way with him  thanks for the compliment freddie but i should imagine that something a little more solid than a persuasive way would be required in a case like this you said something a while ago about five hundred pounds  here it is old manin notes i brought it on purpose will you really take the thing on do you think you can work it for five hundred  i can have a try  freddie rose with an expression approximating to happiness on his face some men have the power of inspiring confidence in some of their fellows though they fill others with distrust scotland yard might look askance at r jones but to freddie he was all that was helpful and reliable he shook r jones hand several times in his emotion  thats absolutely topping of you old man he said then ill leave the whole thing to you write me the moment you have done anything wont you goodby old top and thanks ever so much  the door closed r jones remained where he sat his fingers straying luxuriously among the crackling paper a feeling of complete happiness warmed r jones bosom he was uncertain whether or not his mission would be successful and to be truthful he was not letting that worry him much what he was certain of was the fact that the heavens had opened unexpectedly and dropped five hundred pounds into his lap    chapter iii  the earl of emsworth stood in the doorway of the senior conservative clubs vast diningroom and beamed with a vague sweetness on the two hundred or so senior conservatives who with much clattering of knives and forks were keeping body and soul together by means of the coffeeroom luncheon he might have been posing for a statue of amiability his pale blue eyes shone with a friendly light through their protecting glasses the smile of a man at peace with all men curved his weak mouth his bald head reflecting the sunlight seemed almost to wear a halo  nobody appeared to notice him he so seldom came to london these days that he was practically a stranger in the club and in any case your senior conservative when at lunch has little leisure for observing anything not immediately on the table in front of him to attract attention in the diningroom of the senior conservative club between the hours of one and twothirty you have to be a mutton chopnot an earl  it is possible that lacking the initiative to make his way down the long aisle and find a table for himself he might have stood there indefinitely but for the restless activity of adams the head steward it was adams mission in life to flit to and fro hauling wouldbe lunchers to their destinations as a st bernard dog hauls travelers out of alpine snowdrifts he sighted lord emsworth and secured him with a genteel pounce  a table your lordship this way your lordship adams remembered him of course adams remembered everybody  lord emsworth followed him beamingly and presently came to anchor at a table in the farther end of the room adams handed him the bill of fare and stood brooding over him like a providence  dont often see your lordship in the club he opened chattily  it was business to know the tastes and dispositions of all the five thousand or so members of the senior conservative club and to suit his demeanor to them to some he would hand the bill of fare swiftly silently almost brusquely as one who realizes that there are moments in life too serious for talk others he knew liked conversation and to those he introduced the subject of food almost as a submotive  lord emsworth having examined the bill of fare with a mild curiosity laid it down and became conversational  no adams i seldom visit london nowadays london does not attract me the countrythe fieldsthe woodsthe birds  something across the room seemed to attract his attention and his voice trailed off he inspected this for some time with bland interest then turned to adams once more  what was i saying adams  the birds your lordship  birds what birds what about birds  you were speaking of the attractions of life in the country your lordship you included the birds in your remarks  oh yes yes yes oh yes yes oh yesto be sure do you ever go to the country adams  generally to the seashore your lordshipwhen i take my annual vacation  whatever was the attraction across the room once more exercised its spell his lordship concentrated himself on it to the exclusion of all other mundane matters presently he came out of his trance again  what were you saying adams  i said that i generally went to the seashore your lordship  eh when  for my annual vacation your lordship  your what  my annual vacation your lordship  what about it  adams never smiled during business hoursunless professionally as it were when a member made a joke but he was storing up in the recesses of his highly respectable body a large laugh to be shared with his wife when he reached home that night mrs adams never wearied of hearing of the eccentricities of the members of the club it occurred to adams that he was in luck today he was expecting a little party of friends to supper that night and he was a man who loved an audience  you would never have thought it to look at him when engaged in his professional duties but adams had built up a substantial reputation as a humorist in his circle by his imitations of certain members of the club and it was a matter of regret to him that he got so few opportunities nowadays of studying the absentminded lord emsworth it was rare luckhis lordship coming in today evidently in his best form  adams who is the gentleman over by the windowthe gentleman in the brown suit  that is mr simmonds your lordship he joined us last year  i never saw a man take such large mouthfuls did you ever see a man take such large mouthfuls adams  adams refrained from expressing an opinion but inwardly he was thrilling with artistic fervor mr simmonds eating was one of his best imitations though mrs adams was inclined to object to it on the score that it was a bad example for the children to be privileged to witness lord emsworth watching and criticizing mr simmonds was to collect material for a doublebarreled character study that would assuredly make the hit of the evening  that man went on lord emsworth is digging his grave with his teeth digging his grave with his teeth adams do you take large mouthfuls adams  no your lordship  quite right very sensible of you adamsvery sensible of you very sen what was i saying adams  about my not taking large mouthfuls your lordship  quite rightquite right never take large mouthfuls adams never gobble have you any children adams  two your lordship  i hope you teach them not to gobble they pay for it in later life americans gobble when young and ruin their digestions my american friend mr peters suffers terribly from indigestion  adams lowered his voice to a confidential murmur if you will pardon the liberty your lordshipi saw it in the paper  about mr peters indigestion  about miss peters your lordship and the honorable frederick may i be permitted to offer my congratulations  eh oh yesthe engagement yes yes yes yesto be sure yes very satisfactory in every respect high time he settled down and got a little sense i put it to him straight i cut off his allowance and made him stay at home that made him thinklazy young devil  lord emsworth had his lucid moments and in the one that occurred now it came home to him that he was not talking to himself as he had imagined but confiding intimate family secrets to the head steward of his clubs diningroom he checked himself abruptly and with a slight decrease of amiability fixed his gaze on the bill of fare and ordered cold beef for an instant he felt resentful against adams for luring him on to soliloquize but the next moment his whole mind was gripped by the fascinating spectacle of mr simmonds dealing with a wedge of stilton cheese and adams was forgotten  the cold beef had the effect of restoring his lordship to complete amiability and when adams in the course of his wanderings again found himself at the table he was once more disposed for light conversation  so you saw the news of the engagement in the paper did you adams  yes your lordship in the mail it had quite a long piece about it and the honorable fredericks photograph and the young ladys were in the mirror mrs adams clipped them out and put them in an album knowing that your lordship was a member of ours if i may say so your lordshipa beautiful young lady  devilish attractive adamsand devilish rich mr peters is a millionaire adams  so i read in the paper your lordship  damme they all seem to be millionaires in america wish i knew how they managed it honestly i hope mr peters is an honest man but his digestion is bad he used to bolt his food you dont bolt your food i hope adams  no your lordship i am most careful  the late mr gladstone used to chew each mouthful thirtythree times deuced good notion if you arent in a hurry what cheese would you recommend adams  the gentlemen are speaking well of the gorgonzola  all right bring me some you know adams what i admire about americans is their resource mr peters tells me that as a boy of eleven he earned twenty dollars a week selling mint to saloon keepers as they call publicans over there why they wanted mint i cannot recollect mr peters explained the reason to me and it seemed highly plausible at the time but i have forgotten it possibly for mint sauce it impressed me adams twenty dollars is four pounds i never earned four pounds a week when i was a boy of eleven in fact i dont think i ever earned four pounds a week his story impressed me adams every man ought to have an earning capacity i was so struck with what he told me that i began to paint  landscapes your lordship  furniture it is unlikely that i shall ever be compelled to paint furniture for a living but it is a consolation to me to feel that i could do so if called on there is a fascination about painting furniture adams i have painted the whole of my bedroom at blandings and am now engaged on the museum you would be surprised at the fascination of it it suddenly came back to me the other day that i had been inwardly longing to mess about with paints and things since i was a boy they stopped me when i was a boy i recollect my old father beating me with a walking sticktell me adams have i eaten my cheese  not yet your lordship i was about to send the waiter for it  never mind tell him to bring the bill instead i remember that i have an appointment i must not be late  shall i take the fork your lordship  the fork  your lordship has inadvertently put a fork in your coat pocket  lord emsworth felt in the pocket indicated and with the air of an inexpert conjurer whose trick has succeeded contrary to his expectations produced a silverplated fork he regarded it with surprise then he looked wonderingly at adams  adams im getting absentminded have you ever noticed any traces of absentmindedness in me before  oh no your lordship  well its deuced peculiar i have no recollection whatsoever of placing that fork in my pocket    adams i want a taxicab he glanced round the room as though expecting to locate one by the fireplace  the hall porter will whistle one for you your lordship  so he will by georgeso he will good day adams  good day your lordship  the earl of emsworth ambled benevolently to the door leaving adams with the feeling that his day had been wellspent he gazed almost with reverence after the slowmoving figure  what a nut said adams to his immortal soul  wafted through the sunlit streets in his taxicab the earl of emsworth smiled benevolently on londons teeming millions he was as completely happy as only a fluffyminded old man with excellent health and a large income can be other people worried about all sorts of thingsstrikes wars suffragettes the diminishing birth rate the growing materialism of the age a score of similar subjects  worrying indeed seemed to be the twentiethcentury specialty lord emsworth never worried nature had equipped him with a mind so admirably constructed for withstanding the disagreeableness of life that if an unpleasant thought entered it it passed out again a moment later except for a few of lifes fundamental facts such as that his check book was in the righthand top drawer of his desk that the honorable freddie threepwood was a young idiot who required perpetual restraint and that when in doubt about anything he had merely to apply to his secretary rupert baxterexcept for these basic things he never remembered anything for more than a few minutes  at eton in the sixties they had called him fathead  his was a life that lacked perhaps the sublimer emotions which raise man to the level of the gods but undeniably it was an extremely happy one he never experienced the thrill of ambition fulfilled but on the other hand he never knew the agony of ambition frustrated his name when he died would not live forever in englands annals he was spared the pain of worrying about this by the fact that he had no desire to live forever in englands annals he was possibly as nearly contented as a human being could be in this century of alarms and excursions  indeed as he bowled along in his cab and reflected that a really charming girl not in the chorus of any west end theater a girl with plenty of money and excellent breeding hadin a moment doubtless of mental aberrationbecome engaged to be married to the honorable freddie he told himself that life at last was absolutely without a crumpled rose leaf  the cab drew up before a house gay with flowered window boxes lord emsworth paid the driver and stood on the sidewalk looking up at this cheerful house trying to remember why on earth he had told the man to drive there  a few moments steady thought gave him the answer to the riddle this was mr peters town house and he had come to it by invitation to look at mr peters collection of scarabs to be sure he remembered nowhis collection of scarabs or was it arabs  lord emsworth smiled scarabs of course you couldnt collect arabs he wondered idly as he rang the bell what scarabs might be but he was interested in a fluffy kind of way in all forms of collecting and he was very pleased to have the opportunity of examining these objects whatever they were he rather thought they were a kind of fish  there are men in this world who cannot rest who are so constituted that they can only take their leisure in the shape of a change of work to this fairly numerous class belonged mr j preston peters father of freddies aline and to this meritor defectis to be attributed his almost maniacal devotion to that rather unattractive species of curio the egyptian scarab  five years before a nervous breakdown had sent mr peters to a new york specialist the specialist had grown rich on similar cases and his advice was always the same he insisted on mr peters taking up a hobby  what sort of a hobby inquired mr peters irritably his digestion had just begun to trouble him at the time and his temper now was not of the best  now my hobby said the specialist is the collecting of scarabs why should you not collect scarabs  because said mr peters i shouldnt know one if you brought it to me on a plate what are scarabs  scarabs said the specialist warming to his subject the egyptian hieroglyphs  and what inquired mr peters are egyptian hieroglyphs  the specialist began to wonder whether it would not have been better to advise mr peters to collect postage stamps  a scarab he saidderived from the latin scarabeusis literally a beetle  i will not collect beetles said mr peters definitely they give me the willies  scarabs are egyptian symbols in the form of beetles the specialist hurried on the most common form of scarab is in the shape of a ring scarabs were used for seals they were also employed as beads or ornaments some scarabaei bear inscriptions having reference to places as for instance memphis is mighty forever  mr peters scorn changed to active interest  have you got one like that  like what  a scarab boosting memphis its my home town  i think it possible that some other memphis was alluded to  there isnt any other except the one in tennessee said mr peters patriotically  the specialist owed the fact that he was a nerve doctor instead of a nerve patient to his habit of never arguing with his visitors  perhaps he said you would care to glance at my collection it is in the next room  that was the beginning of mr peters devotion to scarabs at first he did his collecting without any love of it partly because he had to collect something or suffer but principally because of a remark the specialist made as he was leaving the room  how long would it take me to get together that number of the things mr peters inquired when having looked his fill on the dullest assortment of objects he remembered ever to have seen he was preparing to take his leave  the specialist was proud of his collection how long to make a collection as large as mine years mr peters oh many many years  ill bet you a hundred dollars ill do it in six months  from that moment mr peters brought to the collecting of scarabs the same furious energy which had given him so many dollars and so much indigestion he went after scarabs like a dog after rats he scooped in scarabs from the four corners of the earth until at the end of a year he found himself possessed of what purely as regarded quantity was a record collection  this marked the end of the first phase ofso to speakthe scarabaean side of his life collecting had become a habit with him but he was not yet a real enthusiast it occurred to him that the time had arrived for a certain amount of pruning and elimination he called in an expert and bade him go through the collection and weed out what he felicitously termed the dead ones the expert did his job thoroughly when he had finished the collection was reduced to a mere dozen specimens  the rest he explained are practically valueless if you are thinking of making a collection that will have any value in the eyes of archeologists i should advise you to throw them away the remaining twelve are good  how do you meangood why is one of these things valuable and another so much punk they all look alike to me  and then the expert talked to mr peters for nearly two hours about the new kingdom the middle kingdom osiris ammon mut bubastis dynasties cheops the hyksos kings cylinders bezels amenophis iii queen taia the princess gilukhipa of mitanni the lake of zarukhe naucratis and the book of the dead he did it with a relish he liked to do it  when he had finished mr peters thanked him and went to the bathroom where he bathed his temples with eau de cologne  that talk changed j preston peters from a supercilious scooperup of random scarabs to what might be called a genuine scarab fan it does not matter what a man collects if nature has given him the collectors mind he will become a fanatic on the subject of whatever collection he sets out to make mr peters had collected dollars he began to collect scarabs with precisely the same enthusiasm he would have become just as enthusiastic about butterflies or old china if he had turned his thoughts to them but it chanced that what he had taken up was the collecting of the scarab and it gripped him more and more as the years went on  gradually he came to love his scarabs with that love surpassing the love of women which only collectors know he became an expert on those curious relics of a dead civilization for a time they ran neck and neck in his thoughts with business when he retired from business he was free to make them the master passion of his life he treasured each individual scarab in his collection as a miser treasures gold  collecting as mr peters did it resembles the drink habit it begins as an amusement and ends as an obsession he was gloating over his treasures when the maid announced lord emsworth  a curious species of mutual tolerationit could hardly be dignified by the title of friendshiphad sprung up between these two men so opposite in practically every respect each regarded the other with that feeling of perpetual amazement with which we encounter those whose whole viewpoint and mode of life is foreign to our own  the americans force and nervous energy fascinated lord emsworth as for mr peters nothing like the earl had ever happened to him before in a long and varied life each in fact was to the other a perpetual freak show with no charge for admission and if anything had been needed to cement the alliance it would have been supplied by the fact that they were both collectors  they differed in collecting as they did in everything else mr peters collecting as has been shown was keen furious concentrated lord emsworths had the amiable dodderingness that marked every branch of his life in the museum at blandings castle you could find every manner of valuable and valueless curio there was no central motive the place was simply an amateur junk shop side by side with a gutenberg bible for which rival collectors would have bidden without a limit you would come on a bullet from the field of waterloo one of a consignment of ten thousand shipped there for the use of tourists by a birmingham firm each was equally attractive to its owner  my dear mr peters said lord emsworth sunnily advancing into the room i trust i am not unpunctual i have been lunching at my club  id have asked you to lunch here said mr peters but you know how it is with me    ive promised the doctor ill give those nuts and grasses of his a fair trial and i can do it pretty well when im alone with aline but to have to sit by and see somebody else eating real food would be trying me too high  lord emsworth murmured sympathetically the others digestive tribulations touched a ready chord an excellent trencherman himself he understood what mr peters must suffer  too bad he said  mr peters turned the conversation into other channels  these are my scarabs he said  lord emsworth adjusted his glasses and the mild smile disappeared from his face to be succeeded by a set look a stage director of a movingpicture firm would have recognized the look lord emsworth was registering interestinterest which he perceived from the first instant would have to be completely simulated for instinct told him as mr peters began to talk that he was about to be bored as he had seldom been bored in his life  mr peters in his character of showman threw himself into his work with even more than his customary energy his flow of speech never faltered he spoke of the new kingdom the middle kingdom osiris and ammon waxed eloquent concerning mut bubastis cheops the hyksos kings cylinders bezels and amenophis iii and became at times almost lyrical when touching on queen taia the princess gilukhipa of mitanni the lake of zarukhe naucratis and the book of the dead time slid by  take a look at this lord emsworth  as one who brooding on love or running over business projects in his mind walks briskly into a lamppost and comes back to the realities of life with a sense of jarring shock lord emsworth started blinked and returned to consciousness far away his mind had beenseventy miles awayin the pleasant hothouses and shady garden walks of blandings castle he came back to london to find that his host with a mingled air of pride and reverence was extending toward him a small dingylooking something  he took it and looked at it that apparently was what he was meant to do so far all was well  ah he saidthat blessed word covering everything he repeated it pleased at his ready resource  a cheops of the fourth dynasty said mr peters fervently  i beg your pardon  a cheopsof the fourth dynasty  lord emsworth began to feel like a hunted stag he could not go on saying ah indefinitely yet what else was there to say to this curious little beastly sort of a beetle kind of thing  dear me a cheops  of the fourth dynasty  bless my soul the fourth dynasty  what do you think of thateh  strictly speaking lord emsworth thought nothing of it and he was wondering how to veil this opinion in diplomatic words when the providence that looks after all good men saved him by causing a knock at the door to occur in response to mr peters irritated cry a maid entered  if you please sir mr threepwood wishes to speak with you on the telephone  mr peters turned to his guest excuse me for one moment  certainly said lord emsworth gratefully certainly certainly certainly by all means  the door closed behind mr peters lord emsworth was alone for some moments he stood where he had been left a figure with small signs of alertness about it but mr peters did not return immediately the booming of his voice came faintly from some distant region lord emsworth strolled to the window and looked out  the sun still shone brightly on the quiet street across the road were trees lord emsworth was fond of trees he looked at these approvingly then round the corner came a vagrom man wheeling flowers in a barrow  flowers lord emsworths mind shot back to blandings like a homing pigeon flowers had he or had he not given head gardener thorne adequate instructions as to what to do with those hydrangeas assuming that he had not was thorne to be depended on to do the right thing by them by the light of his own intelligence lord emsworth began to brood on head gardener thorne  he was aware of some curious little object in his hand he accorded it a momentary inspection it had no message for him it was probably something but he could not remember what he put it in his pocket and returned to his meditations                                  at about the hour when the earl of emsworth was driving to keep his appointment with mr peters a party of two sat at a corner table at simpsons restaurant in the strand one of the two was a small pretty goodnaturedlooking girl of about twenty the other a thickset young man with a wiry crop of redbrown hair and an expression of mingled devotion and determination the girl was aline peters the young mans name was george emerson he also was an american a rising member in a new york law firm he had a strong square face with a dogged and persevering chin  there are all sorts of restaurants in london from the restaurant which makes you fancy you are in paris to the restaurant which makes you wish you were there are palaces in piccadilly quaint lethal chambers in soho and strange food factories in oxford street and tottenham court road there are restaurants which specialize in ptomaine and restaurants which specialize in sinister vegetable messes but there is only one simpsons  simpsons in the strand is unique here if he wishes the briton may for the small sum of half a dollar stupefy himself with food the god of fatted plenty has the place under his protection its keynote is solid comfort  it is a pleasant soothing hearty placea restful temple of food no strident orchestra forces the diner to bolt beef in ragtime no long central aisle distracts his attention with its stream of new arrivals there he sits alone with his food while whiterobed priests wheeling their smoking trucks move to and fro ever ready with fresh supplies  all round the roomsome at small tables some at large tables the worshipers sit in their eyes that resolute concentrated look which is the peculiar property of the british luncher expresident roosevelts maneating fish and the american army worm  conversation does not flourish at simpsons only two of all those present on this occasion showed any disposition toward chattiness they were aline peters and her escort  the girl you ought to marry aline was saying is joan valentine  the girl i am going to marry said george emerson is aline peters  for answer aline picked up from the floor beside her an illustrated paper and having opened it at a page toward the end handed it across the table  george emerson glanced at it disdainfully there were two photographs on the page one was of aline the other of a heavy loutishlooking youth who wore that expression of pained glassiness which young england always adopts in the face of a camera  under one photograph were printed the words miss aline peters who is to marry the honorable frederick threepwood in june under the other the honorable frederick threepwood who is to marry miss aline peters in june above the photographs was the legend forthcoming international wedding son of the earl of emsworth to marry american heiress in one corner of the picture a cupid draped in the stars and stripes aimed his bow at the gentleman in the other another cupid clad in a natty union jack was drawing a bead on the lady  the subeditor had done his work well he had not been ambiguous what he intended to convey to the reader was that miss aline peters of america was going to marry the honorable frederick threepwood son of the earl of emsworth and that was exactly the impression the average reader got  george emerson however was not an average reader the subeditors work did not impress him  you mustnt believe everything you see in the papers he said what are the stout children in the onepiece bathing suits supposed to be doing  those are cupids george aiming at us with their little bow a pretty and original idea  why cupids  cupid is the god of love  what has the god of love got to do with it  aline placidly devoured a fried potato youre simply trying to make me angry she said and i call it very mean of you you know perfectly well how fatal it is to get angry at meals it was eating while he was in a bad temper that ruined fathers digestion george that nice fat carver is wheeling his truck this way flag him and make him give me some more of that mutton  george looked round him morosely  this he said is englandthis restaurant i mean you dont need to go any farther just take a good look at this place and you have seen the whole country and can go home again you may judge a country by its meals a people with imagination will eat with imagination look at the french look at ourselves the englishman loathes imagination he goes to a place like this and says dont bother me to think heres half a dollar give me foodany sort of fooduntil i tell you to stop and thats the principle on which he lives his life give me anything and dont bother me thats his motto  if that was meant to apply to freddie and me i think youre very rude do you mean that any girl would have done for him so long as it was a girl  george emerson showed a trace of confusion being honest with himself he had to admit that he did not exactly know what he did meanif he meant anything that he felt rather bitterly was the worst of aline she would never let a fellows good things go purely as good things she probed and questioned and spoiled the whole effect he was quite sure that when he began to speak he had meant something but what it was escaped him for the moment he had been urged to the homily by the fact that at a neighboring table he had caught sight of a stout young briton with a red face who reminded him of the honorable frederick threepwood he mentioned this to aline  do you see that fellow in the gray suiti think he has been sleeping in itat the table on your right look at the stodgy face see the glassy eye if that man sandbagged your freddie and tied him up somewhere and turned up at the church instead of him can you honestly tell me you would know the difference come now wouldnt you simply say why freddie how natural you look and go through the ceremony without a suspicion  he isnt a bit like freddie  my dear girl there isnt a man in this restaurant under the age of thirty who isnt just like freddie all englishmen look exactly alike talk exactly alike and think exactly alike  and you oughtnt to speak of him as freddie you dont know him  yes i do and what is more he expressly asked me to call him freddie oh dash it old top dont keep on calling me threepwood freddie to pals those were his very words  george youre making this up  not at all we met last night at the national sporting club porky jones was going twenty rounds with eddie flynn i offered to give three to one on eddie freddie who was sitting next to me took me in fivers and if you want any further proof of your young mans pinheadedness mark that a child could have seen that eddie had him going eddie comes from pittsburghgod bless it my own home town  did your eddie win  you dont listeni told you he was from pittsburgh and afterward threepwood chummed up with me and told me that to real pals like me he was freddie i was a real pal as i understood it because i would have to wait for my money the fact was he explained his old governor had cut off his bally allowance  youre simply trying to poison my mind against him and i dont think its very nice of you george  what do you meanpoison your mind im not poisoning your mind im simply telling you a few things about him you know perfectly well that you dont love him and that you arent going to marry himand that you are going to marry me  how do you know i dont love my freddie  if you can look me straight in the eyes and tell me you do i will drop the whole thing and put on a little pages dress and carry your train up the aisle now then  and all the while youre talking youre letting my carver get away said aline  george called to the willing priest who steered his truck toward them aline directed his dissection of the shoulder of mutton by word and gesture  enjoy yourself said emerson coldly  so i do george so i do what excellent meat they have in england  it all comes from america said george patriotically and anyway cant you be a bit more spiritual i dont want to sit here discussing food products  if you were in my position george you wouldnt want to talk about anything else its doing him a world of good poor dear but there are times when im sorry father ever started this foodreform thing you dont know what it means for a healthy young girl to try and support life on nuts and grasses  and why should you broke out emerson ill tell you what it is alineyou are perfectly absurd about your father i dont want to say anything against him to you naturally but  go ahead george why this diffidence say what you like  very well then i will ill give it to you straight you know quite well that you have let your father bully you since you were in short frocks i dont say it is your fault or his fault or anybodys fault i just state it as a fact its temperament i suppose you are yielding and he is aggressive and he has taken advantage of it  we now come to this idiotic freddiemarriage business your father has forced you into that its all very well to say that you are a free agent and that fathers dont coerce their daughters nowadays the trouble is that your father does you let him do what he likes with you he has got you hypnotized and you wont break away from this freddie foolishness because you cant find the nerve im going to help you find the nerve im coming down to blandings castle when you go there on friday  coming to blandings  freddie invited me last night i think it was done by way of interest on the money he owed me but he did it and i accepted  but george my dear boy do you never read the etiquette books and the hints in the sunday papers on how to be the perfect gentleman dont you know you cant be a mans guest and take advantage of his hospitality to try to steal his fiancee away from him  watch me  a dreamy look came into alines eyes i wonder what it feels like being a countess she said  you will never know george looked at her pityingly my poor girl he said have you been lured into this engagement in the belief that popeyed frederick the idiot child is going to be an earl some day you have been stung freddie is not the heir his older brother lord bosham is as fit as a prizefighter and has three healthy sons freddie has about as much chance of getting the title as i have  george your education has been sadly neglected dont you know that the heir to the title always goes on a yachting cruise with his whole family and gets drownedand the children too it happens in every english novel you read  listen aline let us get this thing straight i have been in love with you since i wore knickerbockers i proposed to you at your first dance  very clumsily  but sincerely last year when i found that you had gone to england i came on after you as soon as the firm could spare me and i found you engaged to this freddie excrescence  i like the way you stand up for freddie so many men in your position might say horrid things about him  oh ive nothing against freddie he is practically an imbecile and i dont like his face outside of that hes all right but you will be glad later that you did not marry him you are much too real a person what a wife you will make for a hardworking man  what does freddie work hard at  i am alluding at the moment not to freddie but to myself i shall come home tired out maybe things will have gone wrong downtown i shall be fagged disheartened and then you will come with your cool white hands and placing them gently on my forehead  aline shook her head its no good george really you had better realize it im very fond of you but we are not suited  why not  you are too overwhelmingtoo much like a bomb i think you must be one of the supermen one reads about you would want your own way and nothing but your own way now freddie will roll through hoops and sham dead and we shall be the happiest pair in the world i am much too placid and mild to make you happy you want somebody who would stand up to yousomebody like joan valentine  thats the second time you have mentioned this joan valentine who is she  she is a girl who was at school with me we were the greatest chumsat least i worshiped her and would have done anything for her and i think she liked me then we lost touch with one another and didnt meet for years i met her on the street yesterday and she is just the same she has been through the most awful times her father was quite rich he died suddenly while he and joan were in paris and she found that he hadnt left a cent he had been living right up to his income all the time his life wasnt even insured she came to london and so far as i could make out from the short talk we had she has done pretty nearly everything since we last met she worked in a shop and went on the stage and all sorts of things isnt it awful george  pretty tough said emerson he was but faintly interested in miss valentine  she is so plucky and full of life she would stand up to you  thanks my idea of marriage is not a perpetual scrap my notion of a wife is something cozy and sympathetic and soothing that is why i love you we shall be the happiest  aline laughed  dear old george now pay the check and get me a taxi ive endless things to do at home if freddie is in town i suppose he will be calling to see me who is freddie do you ask freddie is my fiance george my betrothed my steady the young man im going to marry  emerson shook his head resignedly curious how you cling to that freddie idea never mind ill come down to blandings on friday and we shall see what happens bear in mind the broad fact that you and i are going to be married and that nothing on earth is going to stop us                                  it was aline peters who had to bear the brunt of her fathers mental agony when he discovered shortly after lord emsworth had left him that the gem of his collection of scarabs had done the same it is always the innocent bystander who suffers  the darned old sneak thief said mr peters  father  dont sit there saying father whats the use of saying father do you think it is going to helpyour saying father id rather the old pirate had taken the house and lot than that scarab he knows whats what trust him to walk off with the pick of the whole bunch i did think i could leave the father of the man whos going to marry my daughter for a second alone with the things theres no morality among collectorsnone id trust a syndicate of jesse james captain kidd and dick turpin sooner than i would a collector my cheops of the fourth dynasty i wouldnt have lost it for five thousand dollars  but father couldnt you write him a letter asking for it back hes such a nice old man im sure he didnt mean to steal the scarab  mr peters overwrought soul blew off steam in the shape of a passionate snort  didnt mean to steal it what do you think he meant to dotake it away and keep it safe for me for fear i should lose it didnt mean to steal it bet you hes wellknown in society as a kleptomaniac bet you that when his name is announced his friends pick up their spoons and send in a hurry call to police headquarters for a squad to come and see that he doesnt sneak the front door of course he meant to steal it he has a museum of his own down in the country my cheops is going to lend tone to that id give five thousand dollars to get it back if theres a man in this country with the spirit to break into that castle and steal that scarab and hand it back to me theres five thousand waiting for him right here and if he wants to he can knock that old safe blower on the head with a jimmy into the bargain  but father why cant you simply go to him and say its yours and that you must have it back  and have him come back at me by calling off this engagement of yours not if i know it you cant go about the place charging a man with theft and ask him to go on being willing to have his son marry your daughter can you the slightest suggestion that i thought he had stolen this scarab and he would do the proud old english aristocrat and end everything hes in the strongest position a thief has ever been in you cant get at him  i didnt think of that  you dont think at all thats the trouble with you said mr peters  years of indigestion had made mr peters temper even when in a normal mood perfectly impossible in a crisis like this it ran amuck he vented it on aline because he had always vented his irritabilities on aline because the fact of her sweet gentle disposition combined with the fact of their relationship made her the ideal person to receive the overflow of his black moods while his wife had lived he had bullied her on her death aline had stepped into the vacant position  aline did not cry because she was not a girl who was given to tears but for all her placid good temper she was wounded she was a girl who liked everything in the world to run smoothly and easily and these scenes with her father always depressed her she took advantage of a lull in mr peters flow of words and slipped from the room  her cheerfulness had received a shock she wanted sympathy she wanted comforting for a moment she considered george emerson in the role of comforter but there were objections to george in this character aline was accustomed to tease and chat with george but at heart she was a little afraid of him and instinct told her that as comforter he would be too volcanic and supermanly for a girl who was engaged to marry another man in june george as comforter would be far too prone to trust to action rather than to the soothing power of the spoken word georges idea of healing the wound she felt would be to push her into a cab and drive to the nearest registrars  no she would not go to george to whom then the vision of joan valentine came to herof joan as she had seen her yesterday strong cheerful selfreliant bearing herself in spite of adversity with a valiant jauntiness yes she would go and see joan she put on her hat and stole from the house  curiously enough only a quarter of an hour before r jones had set out with exactly the same object in view                                  at almost exactly the hour when aline peters set off to visit her friend miss valentine three men sat in the cozy smokingroom of blandings castle  they were variously occupied in the big chair nearest the door the honorable frederick threepwoodfreddie to palswas reading next to him sat a young man whose eyes glittering through rimless spectacles were concentrated on the upturned faces of several neat rows of playing cardsrupert baxter lord emsworths invaluable secretary had no vices but he sometimes relaxed his busy brain with a game of solitaire beyond baxter a cigar in his mouth and a weak highball at his side the earl of emsworth took his ease  the book the honorable freddie was reading was a small papercovered book its cover was decorated with a color scheme in red black and yellow depicting a tense moment in the lives of a man with a black beard a man with a yellow beard a man without any beard at all and a young woman who at first sight appeared to be all eyes and hair the man with the black beard to gain some private end had tied this young woman with ropes to a complicated system of machinery mostly wheels and pulleys the man with the yellow beard was in the act of pushing or pulling a lever the beardless man protruding through a trapdoor in the floor was pointing a large revolver at the parties of the second part  beneath this picture were the words hands up you scoundrels  above it in a meandering scroll across the page was gridley quayle investigator the adventure of the secret six by felix clovelly  the honorable freddie did not so much read as gulp the adventure of the secret six his face was crimson with excitement his hair was rumpled his eyes bulged he was absorbed  this is peculiarly an age in which each of us may if we do but search diligently find the literature suited to his mental powers grave and earnest men at eton and elsewhere had tried freddie threepwood with greek with latin and with english and the sheeplike stolidity with which he declined to be interested in the masterpieces of all three tongues had left them with the conviction that he would never read anything  and then years afterward he had suddenly blossomed out as a studentonly it is true a student of the adventures of gridley quayle but still a student his was a dull life and gridley quayle was the only person who brought romance into it existence for the honorable freddie was simply a sort of desert punctuated with monthly oases in the shape of new quayle adventures it was his ambition to meet the man who wrote them  lord emsworth sat and smoked and sipped and smoked again at peace with all the world his mind was as nearly a blank as it is possible for the human mind to be the hand that had not the task of holding the cigar was at rest in his trousers pocket the fingers of it fumbled idly with a small hard object  gradually it filtered into his lordships mind that this small hard object was not familiar it was something newsomething that was neither his keys nor his pencil nor was it his small change he yielded to a growing curiosity and drew it out he examined it it was a little something rather like a fossilized beetle it touched no chord in him he looked at it with amiable distaste  now how in the world did that get there he said  the honorable freddie paid no attention to the remark he was now at the very crest of his story when every line intensified the thrill incident was succeeding incident the secret six were here there and everywhere like so many malignant june bugs  annabel the heroine was having a perfectly rotten timekidnapped and imprisoned every few minutes gridley quayle hot on the scent was covering somebody or other with his revolver almost continuously freddie threepwood had no time for chatting with his father not so rupert baxter chatting with lord emsworth was one of the things for which he received his salary he looked up from his cards  lord emsworth  i have found a curious object in my pocket baxter i was wondering how it got there  he handed the thing to his secretary rupert baxters eyes lit up with sudden enthusiasm he gasped  magnificent he cried superb  lord emsworth looked at him inquiringly  it is a scarab lord emsworth and unless i am mistakenand i think i may claim to be something of an experta cheops of the fourth dynasty a wonderful addition to your museum  is it by gad you dont say so baxter  it is indeed if it is not a rude question how much did you give for it lord emsworth it must have been the gem of somebodys collection was there a sale at christies this afternoon  lord emsworth shook his head i did not get it at christies for i recollect that i had an important engagement which prevented my going to christies to be sure yesi had promised to call on mr peters and examine his collection ofnow i wonder what it was that mr peters said he collected  mr peters is one of the bestknown living collectors of scarabs  scarabs you are quite right baxter now that i recall the episode this is a scarab and mr peters gave it to me  gave it to you lord emsworth  yes the whole scene comes back to me mr peters after telling me a great many exceedingly interesting things about scarabs which i regret to say i cannot remember gave me this and you say it is really valuable baxter  it is from a collectors point of view of extraordinary value  bless my soul lord emsworth beamed this is extremely interesting baxter one has heard so much of the princely hospitality of americans how exceedingly kind of mr peters i shall certainly treasure it though i must confess that from a purely spectacular standpoint it leaves me a little cold however i must not look a gift horse in the moutheh baxter  from afar came the silver booming of a gong lord emsworth rose  time to dress for dinner i had no idea it was so late baxter you will be going past the museum door will you be a good fellow and place this among the exhibits you will know what to do with it better than i i always think of you as the curator of my little collection baxterhaha mind how you step when you are in the museum i was painting a chair there yesterday and i think i left the paint pot on the floor  he cast a less amiable glance at his studious son  get up frederick and go and dress for dinner what is that trash you are reading  the honorable freddie came out of his book much as a sleepwalker wakeswith a sense of having been violently assaulted he looked up with a kind of stunned plaintiveness  eh govnor  make haste beach rang the gong five minutes ago what is that you are reading  oh nothing govnorjust a book  i wonder you can waste your time on such trash make haste  he turned to the door and the benevolent expression once more wandered athwart his face  extremely kind of mr peters he said really there is something almost oriental in the lavish generosity of our american cousins                                  it had taken r jones just six hours to discover joan valentines address that it had not taken him longer is a proof of his energy and of the excellence of his system of obtaining information but r jones when he considered it worth his while could be extremely energetic and he was a past master at the art of finding out things  he poured himself out of his cab and rang the bell of number seven a disheveled maid answered the ring  miss valentine in  yes sir  r jones produced his card  on important business tell her half a minuteill write it  he wrote the words on the card and devoted the brief period of waiting to a careful scrutiny of his surroundings he looked out into the court and he looked as far as he could down the dingy passage and the conclusions he drew from what he saw were complimentary to miss valentine  if this girl is the sort of girl who would hold up freddies letters he mused she wouldnt be living in a place like this if she were on the make she would have more money than she evidently possesses therefore she is not on the make and i am prepared to bet that she destroyed the letters as fast as she got them  those were roughly the thoughts of r jones as he stood in the doorway of number seven and they were important thoughts inasmuch as they determined his attitude toward joan in the approaching interview he perceived that this matter must be handled delicatelythat he must be very much the gentleman it would be a strain but he must do it  the maid returned and directed him to joans room with a brief word and a sweeping gesture  eh said r jones first floor  front said the maid  r jones trudged laboriously up the short flight of stairs it was very dark on the stairs and he stumbled eventually however light came to him through an open door looking in he saw a girl standing at the table she had an air of expectation so he deduced that he had reached his journeys end  miss valentine  please come in  r jones waddled in  not much light on your stairs  no will you take a seat  thanks  one glance at the girl convinced r jones that he had been right circumstances had made him a rapid judge of character for in the profession of living by ones wits in a large city the first principle of offense and defense is to sum people up at first sight this girl was not on the make  joan valentine was a tall girl with wheatgold hair and eyes as brightly blue as a november sky when the sun is shining on a frosty world there was in them a little of novembers cold glitter too for joan had been through much in the last few years and experience even though it does not harden erects a defensive barrier between its children and the world  her eyes were eyes that looked straight and challenged they could thaw to the satin blue of the mediterranean sea where it purrs about the little villages of southern france but they did not thaw for everybody she looked what she wasa girl of action a girl whom life had made both reckless and warywary of friendly advances reckless when there was a venture afoot  her eyes as they met r jones now were cold and challenging she too had learned the trick of swift diagnosis of character and what she saw of r jones in that first glance did not impress her favorably  you wished to see me on business  yes said r jones yes    miss valentine may i begin by begging you to realize that i have no intention of insulting you  joans eyebrows rose for an instant she did her visitor the injustice of suspecting that he had been dining too well  i dont understand  let me explain i have come here r jones went on getting more gentlemanly every moment on a very distasteful errand to oblige a friend will you bear in mind that whatever i say is said entirely on his behalf  by this time joan had abandoned the idea that this stout person was a lifeinsurance tout and was inclining to the view that he was collecting funds for a charity  i came here at the request of the honorable frederick threepwood  i dont quite understand  you never met him miss valentine but when you were in the chorus at the piccadilly theatre i believe he wrote you some very foolish letters possibly you have forgotten them  i certainly have  you have probably destroyed themeh  certainly i never keep letters why do you ask  well you see miss valentine the honorable frederick threepwood is about to be married and he thought that possibly on the whole it would be better that the lettersand poetrywhich he wrote you were nonexistent  not all r jones gentlemanlinessand during this speech he diffused it like a powerful scent in waves about himcould hide the unpleasant meaning of the words  he was afraid i might try to blackmail him said joan with formidable calm  r jones raised and waved a fat hand deprecatingly  my dear miss valentine  joan rose and r jones followed her example the interview was plainly at an end  please tell mr threepwood to make his mind quite easy he is in no danger  exactlyexactly precisely i assured threepwood that my visit here would be a mere formality i was quite sure you had no intention whatever of worrying him i may tell him definitely then that you have destroyed the letters  yes goodevening  goodevening miss valentine  the closing of the door behind him left him in total darkness but he hardly liked to return and ask joan to reopen it in order to light him on his way he was glad to be out of her presence he was used to being looked at in an unfriendly way by his fellows but there had been something in joans eyes that had curiously discomfited him  r jones groped his way down relieved that all was over and had ended well he believed what she had told him and he could conscientiously assure freddie that the prospect of his sharing the fate of poor old percy was nonexistent it is true that he proposed to add in his report that the destruction of the letters had been purchased with difficulty at a cost of just five hundred pounds but that was a mere business formality  he had almost reached the last step when there was a ring at the front door with what he was afterward wont to call an inspiration he retreated with unusual nimbleness until he had almost reached joans door again then he leaned over the banister and listened  the disheveled maid opened the door a girls voice spoke  is miss valentine in  shes in but shes engaged  i wish you would go up and tell her that i want to see her say its miss petersmiss aline peters  the banister shook beneath r jones sudden clutch for a moment he felt almost faint then he began to think swiftly a great light had dawned on him and the thought outstanding in his mind was that never again would he trust a man or woman on the evidence of his senses he could have sworn that this valentine girl was on the level he had been perfectly satisfied with her statement that she had destroyed the letters and all the while she had been playing as deep a game as he had come across in the whole course of his professional career he almost admired her how she had taken him in  it was obvious now what her game was previous to his visit she had arranged a meeting with freddies fiancee with the view of opening negotiations for the sale of the letters she had held him jones at arms length because she was going to sell the letters to whoever would pay the best price but for the accident of his happening to be here when miss peters arrived freddie and his fiancee would have been bidding against each other and raising each others price he had worked the same game himself a dozen times and he resented the entry of female competition into what he regarded as essentially a male field of enterprise  as the maid stumped up the stairs he continued his retreat he heard joans door open and the stream of light showed him the disheveled maid standing in the doorway  ow i thought there was a gentleman with you miss  he left a moment ago why  theres a lady wants to see you miss peters her name is  will you ask her to come up  the disheveled maid was no polished mistress of ceremonies she leaned down into the void and hailed aline  she says will you come up  alines feet became audible on the staircase there were greetings  whatever brings you here aline  am i interrupting you joan dear  no do come in i was only surprised to see you so late i didnt know you paid calls at this hour is anything wrong come in  the door closed the maid retired to the depths and r jones stole cautiously down again he was feeling absolutely bewildered apparently his deductions his second thoughts had been all wrong and joan was after all the honest person he had imagined at first sight those two girls had talked to each other as though they were old friends as though they had known each other all their lives that was the thing which perplexed r jones  with the tread of a red indian he approached the door and put his ear to it he found he could hear quite comfortably  aline meantime inside the room had begun to draw comfort from joans very appearance she looked so capable  joans eyes had changed the expression they had contained during the recent interview they were soft now with a softness that was half compassionate half contemptuous it is the compensation which life gives to those whom it has handled roughly in order that they shall be able to regard with a certain contempt the small troubles of the sheltered joan remembered aline of old and knew her for a perennial victim of small troubles even in their schooldays she had always needed to be looked after and comforted her sweet temper had seemed to invite the minor slings and arrows of fortune aline was a girl who inspired protectiveness in a certain type of her fellow human beings it was this quality in her that kept george emerson awake at nights and it appealed to joan now  joan for whom life was a constant struggle to keep the wolf within a reasonable distance from the door and who counted that day happy on which she saw her way clear to paying her weekly rent and possibly having a trifle over for some coveted hat or pair of shoes could not help feeling as she looked at aline that her own troubles were as nothing and that the immediate need of the moment was to pet and comfort her friend her knowledge of aline told her the probable tragedy was that she had lost a brooch or had been spoken to crossly by somebody but it also told her that such tragedies bulked very large on alines horizon  trouble after all like beauty is in the eye of the beholder and aline was far less able to endure with fortitude the loss of a brooch than she herself to bear the loss of a position the emoluments of which meant the difference between having just enough to eat and starving  youre worried about something she said sit down and tell me all about it  aline sat down and looked about her at the shabby room by that curious process of the human mind which makes the spectacle of anothers misfortune a palliative for ones own she was feeling oddly comforted already her thoughts were not definite and she could not analyze them but what they amounted to was that though it was an unpleasant thing to be bullied by a dyspeptic father the world manifestly held worse tribulations which her fathers other outstanding quality besides dyspepsiawealth to witenabled her to avoid  it was at this point that the dim beginnings of philosophy began  to invade her mind the thing resolved itself almost into an equation if father had not had indigestion he would not have bullied her but if father had not made a fortune he would not have had indigestion therefore if father had not made a fortune he would not have bullied her practically in fact if father did not bully her he would not be rich and if he were not rich  she took in the faded carpet the stained wall paper and the soiled curtains with a comprehensive glance it certainly cut both ways she began to be a little ashamed of her misery  its nothing at all really she said i think ive been making rather a fuss about very little  joan was relieved the struggling life breeds moods of depression and such a mood had come to her just before alines arrival life at that moment had seemed to stretch before her like a dusty weary road without hope she was sick of fighting she wanted money and ease and a surcease from this perpetual race with the weekly bills the mood had been the outcome partly of r jones gentlemanlyveiled insinuations but still more though she did not realize it of her yesterdays meeting with aline  mr peters might be unguarded in his speech when conversing with his daughterhe might play the tyrant toward her in many ways but he did not stint her in the matter of dress allowance and on the occasion when she met joan aline had been wearing so parisian a hat and a tailormade suit of such obviously expensive simplicity that greeneyed envy had almost spoiled joans pleasure at meeting this friend of her opulent days  she had suppressed the envy and it had revenged itself by assaulting her afresh in the form of the worst fit of the blues she had had in two years  she had been loyally ready to sink her depression in order to alleviate alines but it was a distinct relief to find that the feat would not be necessary  never mind she said tell me what the very little thing was  it was only father said aline simply  joan cast her mind back to the days of school and placed father as a rather irritable person vaguely reputed to be something of an ogre in his home circle  was he angry with you about something she asked  not exactly angry with me butwell i was there  joans depression lifted slightly she had forgotten in the stunning anguish of the sudden spectacle of that hat and that tailormade suit that paris hats and hundredandtwentydollar suits not infrequently had what the vulgar term a string attached to them after all she was independent she might have to murder her beauty with hats and frocks that had never been nearer paris than the tottenham court road but at least no one bullied her because she happened to be at hand when tempers were short  what a shame she said tell me all about it  with a prefatory remark that it was all so ridiculous really aline embarked on the narrative of the afternoons events  joan heard her out checking a strong disposition to giggle her viewpoint was that of the average person and the average person cannot see the importance of the scarab in the scheme of things the opinion she formed of mr peters was of his being an eccentric old gentleman making a great todo about nothing at all losses had to have a concrete value before they could impress joan it was beyond her to grasp that mr peters would sooner have lost a diamond necklace if he had happened to possess one than his cheops of the fourth dynasty  it was not until aline having concluded her tale added one more strand to it that she found herself treating the matter seriously  father says he would give five thousand dollars to anyone who would get it back for him  what  the whole story took on a different complexion for joan money talks mr peters words might have been merely the rhetorical outburst of a heated moment but even discounting them there seemed to remain a certain exciting substratum a man who shouts that he will give five thousand dollars for a thing may very well mean he will give five hundred and joans finances were perpetually in a condition which makes five hundred dollars a sum to be gasped at  he wasnt serious surely  i think he was said aline  but five thousand dollars  it isnt really very much to father you know he gave away a hundred thousand a year ago to a university  but for a grubby little scarab  you dont understand how father loves his scarabs since he retired from business he has been simply wrapped up in them you know collectors are like that you read in the papers about men giving all sorts of money for funny things  outside the door r jones his ear close to the panel drank in all these things greedily he would have been willing to remain in that attitude indefinitely in return for this kind of special information but just as aline said these words a door opened on the floor above and somebody came out whistling and began to descend the stairs  r jones stood not on the order of his going he was down in the hall and fumbling with the handle of the front door with an agility of which few casual observers of his dimensions would have deemed him capable the next moment he was out in the street walking calmly toward leicester square pondering over what he had heard  much of r jones substantial annual income was derived from pondering over what he had heard  in the room joan was looking at aline with the distended eyes of one who sees visions or has inspirations she got up there are occasions when one must speak standing  then you mean to say that your father would really give five thousand dollars to anyone who got this thing back for him  i am sure he would but who could do it  i could said joan and what is more im going to  aline stared at her helplessly in their schooldays joan had always swept her off her feet then she had always had the feeling that with joan nothing was impossible heroine worship like hero worship dies hard she looked at joan now with the stricken sensation of one who has inadvertently set powerful machinery in motion  but joan it was all she could say  my dear child its perfectly simple this earl of yours has taken the thing off to his castle like a brigand you say you are going down there on friday for a visit all you have to do is to take me along with you and sit back and watch me get busy  but joan  wheres the difficulty  i dont see how i could take you down very well  why not  oh i dont know  but what is your objection  welldont you seeif you went down there as a friend of mine and were caught stealing the scarab there would be just the trouble father wants to avoidabout my engagement you see and so on  it was an aspect of the matter that had escaped joan she frowned thoughtfully  i see yes there is that but there must be a way  you mustnt joanreally dont think any more about it  not think any more about it my child do you even faintly realize what five thousand dollarsor a quarter of five thousand dollarsmeans to me i would do anything for itanything and theres the fun of it i dont suppose you can realize that either i want a change ive been grubbing away here on nothing a week for years and its time i had a vacation there must be a way by which you could get me downwhy of course why didnt i think of it before you shall take me on friday as your ladys maid  but joan i couldnt  why not  ii couldnt  why not  oh well  joan advanced on her where she sat and grasped her firmly by the shoulders her face was inflexible  aline my pet its no good arguing you might just as well argue with a wolf on the trail of a fat russian peasant i need that money i need it in my business i need it worse than anybody has ever needed anything and im going to have it from now on until further notice i am your ladys maid you can give your present one a holiday  aline met her eyes waveringly the spirit of the old schooldays when nothing was impossible where joan was concerned had her in its grip moreover the excitement of the scheme began to attract her  but joan she said you know its simply ridiculous you could never pass as a ladys maid the other servants would find you out i expect there are all sorts of things a ladys maid has got to do and not do  my dear aline i know them all you cant stump me on belowstairs etiquette ive been a ladys maid  joan  its quite truethree years ago when i was more than usually impecunious the wolf was glued to the door like a postage stamp so i answered an advertisement and became a ladys maid  you seem to have done everything  i havepretty nearly its all right for you idle rich alineyou can sit still and contemplate life but we poor working girls have got to hustle  aline laughed  you know you always could make me do anything you wanted in the old days joan i suppose i have got to look on this as quite settled now  absolutely settled oh aline theres one thing you must remember dont call me joan when im down at the castle you must call me valentine  she paused the recollection of the honorable freddie had come to her no valentine would not do  no not valentine she went onits too jaunty i used it once years ago but it never sounded just right i want something more respectable more suited to my position cant you suggest something  aline pondered  simpson  simpson its exactly right you must practice it simpson say it kindly and yet distantly as though i were a worm but a worm for whom you felt a mild liking roll it round your tongue  simpson  splendid now once againa little more haughtily  simpsonsimpsonsimpson  joan regarded her with affectionate approval  its wonderful she said you might have been doing it all your life  what are you laughing at asked aline  nothing said joan i was just thinking of something theres a young man who lives on the floor above this and i was lecturing him yesterday on enterprise i told him to go and find something exciting to do i wonder what he would say if he knew how thoroughly i am going to practice what i preach    chapter iv  in the morning following alines visit to joan valentine ashe sat in his room the morning post on the table before him the heady influence of joan had not yet ceased to work within him and he proposed in pursuance of his promise to her to go carefully through the columns of advertisements however pessimistic he might feel concerning the utility of that action  his first glance assured him that the vast fortunes of the philanthropists whose acquaintance he had already made in print were not yet exhausted brian macneill still dangled his gold before the public so did angus bruce so did duncan macfarlane and wallace mackintosh and donald macnab they still had the money and they still wanted to give it away  ashe was reading listlessly down the column when from the mass of advertisements one of an unusual sort detached itself     wanted young man of good appearance who is poor and    reckless to undertake a delicate and dangerous enterprise    good pay for the right man apply between the hours of ten    and twelve at offices of mainprice mainprice  boole    3 denvers street strand  and as he read it half past ten struck on the little clock on his mantelpiece it was probably this fact that decided ashe if he had been compelled to postpone his visit to the offices of messrs mainprice mainprice  boole until the afternoon it is possible that barriers of laziness might have reared themselves in the path of adventure for ashe an adventurer at heart was also uncommonly lazy as it was however he could make an immediate start  pausing but to put on his shoes and having satisfied himself by a glance in the mirror that his appearance was reasonably good he seized his hat shot out of the narrow mouth of arundell street like a shell and scrambled into a taxicab with the feeling thatshort of murderthey could not make it too delicate and dangerous for him  he was conscious of strange thrills this he told himself was the only possible mode of life with spring in the air he had always been partial to those historical novels in which the characters are perpetually vaulting on chargers and riding across country on perilous errands this leaping into taxicabs to answer stimulating advertisements in the morning post was very much the same sort of thing it was with fine fervor animating him that he entered the gloomy offices of mainprice mainprice  boole his brain was afire and he felt ready for anything  i have come in ans he began to the diminutive office boy who seemed to be the nearest thing visible to a mainprice or a boole  siddown gottatakeyerturn said the office boy and for the first time ashe perceived that the anteroom in which he stood was crowded to overflowing  this in the circumstances was something of a damper he had pictured himself during his ride in the cab striding into the office and saying the delicate and dangerous enterprise lead me to it he had not realized until now that he was not the only man in london who read the advertisement columns of the morning post and for an instant his heart sank at the sight of all this competition a second and more comprehensive glance at his rivals gave him confidence  the wanted column of the morning paper is a sort of dredger which churns up strange creatures from the mud of londons underworld only in response to the dredgers operations do they come to the surface in such numbers as to be noticeable for as a rule they are of a solitary habit and shun company but when they do come they bring with them something of the horror of the depths  it is the saddest spectacle in the worldthat of the crowd collected by a wanted advertisement they are so palpably not wanted by anyone for any purpose whatsoever yet every time they gather together with a sort of hopeful hopelessness what they were originallythe units of these collectionsheaven knows fate has battered out of them every trace of individuality each now is exactly like his neighborno worse no better  ashe as he sat and watched them was filled with conflicting emotions onehalf of him thrilled with the glamour of adventure was chafing at the delay and resentful of these poor creatures as of so many obstacles to the beginning of all the brisk and exciting things that lay behind the mysterious brevity of the advertisement the other pitifully alive to the tragedy of the occasion was grateful for the delay  on the whole he was glad to feel that if one of these derelicts did not secure the good pay for the right man it would not be his fault he had been the last to arrive and he would be the last to pass through that door which was the gateway of adventurethe door with mr boole inscribed on its ground glass behind which sat the author of the mysterious request for assistance interviewing applicants it would be through their own shortcomingsnot because of his superior attractionsif they failed to please that unseen arbiter  that they were so failing was plain scarcely had one scarred victim of londons unkindness passed through before the bell would ring the office boy who in the intervals of frowning sternly on the throng as much as to say that he would stand no nonsense would cry next and another dulleyed wreck would drift through to be followed a moment later by yet another the one fact at present ascertainable concerning the unknown searcher for reckless young men of good appearance was that he appeared to be possessed of considerable decision of character a man who did not take long to make up his mind he was rejecting applicants now at the rate of two a minute  expeditious though he was he kept ashe waiting for a considerable time it was not until the hands of the fat clock over the door pointed to twenty minutes past eleven that the office boys next found him the only survivor he gave his clothes a hasty smack with the palm of his hand and his hair a fleeting dab to accentuate his good appearance and turned the handle of the door of fate  the room assigned by the firm to their mr boole for his personal use was a small and dingy compartment redolent of that atmosphere of desolation which lawyers alone know how to achieve it gave the impression of not having been swept since the foundation of the firm in the year 1786 there was one small window covered with grime it was one of those windows you see only in lawyers offices possibly some reckless mainprice or harebrained boole had opened it in a fit of mad excitement induced by the news of the battle of waterloo in 1815 and had been instantly expelled from the firm since then no one had dared to tamper with it  gazing through this windowor rather gazing at it for xrays could hardly have succeeded in actually penetrating the alluvial deposits on the glasswas a little man as ashe entered he turned and looked at him as though he hurt him rather badly in some tender spot  ashe was obliged to own to himself that he felt a little nervous it is not every day that a young man of good appearance who has led a quiet life meets face to face one who is prepared to pay him well for doing something delicate and dangerous to ashe the sensation was entirely novel the most delicate and dangerous act he had performed to date had been the daily mastication of mrs bells breakfastincluded in the rent yes he had to admit ithe was nervous and the fact that he was nervous made him hot and uncomfortable  to judge him by his appearance the man at the window was also hot and uncomfortable he was a little truculentlooking man and his face at present was red with a flush that sat unnaturally on a normally leadcolored face his eyes looked out from under thick gray eyebrows with an almost tortured expression this was partly owing to the strain of interviewing ashes preposterous predecessors but principally to the fact that the little man had suddenly been seized with acute indigestion a malady to which he was peculiarly subject  he removed from his mouth the black cigar he was smoking inserted a digestive tabloid and replaced the cigar then he concentrated his attention on ashe as he did so the hostile expression of his face became modified he looked surprised andgrudginglypleased  well what do you want he said  i came in answer to  in answer to my advertisement i had given up hope of seeing anything part human i thought you must be one of the clerks youre certainly more like what i advertised for of all the seedy bunches of dead beats i ever struck the aggregation ive just been interviewing was the seediest when i spend good money in advertising for a young man of good appearance i want a young man of good appearancenot a tramp of fiftyfive  ashe was sorry for his predecessors but he was bound to admit that they certainly had corresponded somewhat faithfully to the description just given the comparative cordiality of his own reception removed the slight nervousness that had been troubling him he began to feel confidentalmost jaunty  im through said the little man wearily ive had enough of interviewing applicants youre the last one ill see are there any more hobos outside  not when i came in  then well get down to business ill tell you what i want done and if you are willing you can do it if you are not willing you can leave itand go to the devil sit down  ashe sat down he resented the little mans tone but this was not the moment for saying so his companion scrutinized him narrowly  so far as appearance goes he said you are what i want ashe felt inclined to bow whoever takes on this job has got to act as my valet and you look like a valet ashe felt less inclined to bow  youre tall and thin and ordinarylooking yes so far as appearance goes you fill the bill  it seemed to ashe that it was time to correct an impression the little man appeared to have formed  i am afraid he said if all you want is a valet you will have to look elsewhere i got the idea from your advertisement that something rather more exciting was in the air i can recommend you to several good employment agencies if you wish he rose goodmorning he said  he would have liked to fling the massive pewter inkwell at this little creature who had so keenly disappointed him  sit down snapped the other  ashe resumed his seat the hope of adventure dies hard on a spring morning when one is twentysix and he had the feeling that there was more to come  dont be a damned fool said the little man of course im not asking you to be a valet and nothing else  you would want me to do some cooking and plain sewing on the side perhaps  their eyes met in a hostile glare the flush on the little mans face deepened  are you trying to get fresh with me he demanded dangerously  yes said ashe  the answer seemed to disconcert his adversary he was silent for a moment  well he said at last maybe its all for the best if you werent full of gall probably you wouldnt have come here at all and whoever takes on this job of mine has got to have gall if he has nothing else i think we shall suit each other  what is the job  the little mans face showed doubt and perplexity  its awkward if im to make the thing clear to you ive got to trust you and i dont know a thing about you i wish i had thought of that before i inserted the advertisement  ashe appreciated the difficulty  couldnt you make an ab case out of it  maybe i could if i knew what an ab case was  call the people mixed up in it a and b  and forget halfway through who was which no i guess ill have to trust you  ill play square  the little man fastened his eyes on ashes in a piercing stare ashe met them smilingly his spirits always fairly cheerful had risen high by now there was something about the little man in spite of his brusqueness and ill temper which made him feel flippant  pure white said ashe  eh  my soul and thishe thumped the left section of his waistcoatsolid gold you may fire when ready gridley proceed professor  i dont know where to begin  without presuming to dictate why not at the beginning  its all so darned complicated that i dont rightly know which is the beginning well see here    i collect scarabs im crazy about scarabs ever since i quit business you might say that i have practically lived for scarabs  though it sounds like an unkind thing to say of anyone said ashe incidentally what are scarabs he held up his hand wait it all comes back to me expensive classical education now bearing belated fruit scarabaeuslatin noun nominativea beetle scarabaeevocativeo you beetle scarabaeum accusativethe beetle scarabaeiof the beetle scarabaeoto or for the beetle i remember now egyptramesespyramids sacred scarabs right  well i guess ive gotten together the best collection of scarabs outside the british museum and some of them are worth what you like to me i dont reckon money when it comes to a question of my scarabs do you understand  sure mike  displeasure clouded the little mans face  my name is not mike  i used the word figuratively as it were  well dont do it again my name is j preston peters and mr peters will do as well as anything else when you want to attract my attention  mine is marson you were saying mr peters  well its this way said the little man  shakespeare and pope have both emphasized the tediousness of a twicetold tale the episode of the stolen scarab need not be repeated at this point though it must be admitted that mr peters version of it differed considerably from the calm dispassionate description the author in his capacity of official historian has given earlier in the story  in mr peters version the earl of emsworth appeared as a smooth and purposeful robber a sort of elderly raffles worming his way into the homes of the innocent and only sparing that portion of their property which was too heavy for him to carry away mr peters indeed specifically described the earl of emsworth as an oily old secondstory man  it took ashe some little time to get a thorough grasp of the tangled situation but he did it at last  only one point perplexed him  you want to hire somebody to go to this castle and get this scarab back for you i follow that but why must he go as your valet  thats simple enough you dont think im asking him to buy a black mask and break in do you im making it as easy for him as possible i cant take a secretary down to the castle for everybody knows that now ive retired i havent got a secretary and if i engaged a new one and he was caught trying to steal my scarab from the earls collection it would look suspicious but a valet is different anyone can get fooled by a crook valet with bogus references  i see theres just one other point suppose your accomplice does get caughtwhat then  that said mr peters is the catch and its just because of that i am offering good pay to my man well suppose for the sake of argument that you accept the contract and get caught well if that happens youve got to look after yourself i couldnt say a word if i did it would all come out and so far as the breaking off of my daughters engagement to young threepwood is concerned it would be just as bad as though i had tried to get the thing back myself  youve got to bear that in mind youve got to remember it if you forget everything else i dont appear in this business in any way whatsoever if you get caught you take whats coming to you without a word you cant turn round and say i am innocent mr peters will explain allbecause mr peters certainly wont mr peters wont utter a syllable of protest if they want to hang you  no if you go into this young man you go into it with your eyes open you go into it with a full understanding of the risksbecause you think the reward if you are successful makes the taking of those risks worth while you and i know that what you are doing isnt really stealing its simply a tactful way of getting back my own property but the judge and jury will have different views  i am beginning to understand said ashe thoughtfully why you called the job delicate and dangerous  certainly it had been no overstatement as a writer of detective stories for the british office boy he had imagined in his time many undertakings that might be so described but few to which the description was more admirably suited  it is said mr peters and that is why im offering good pay whoever carries this job through gets one thousand pounds  ashe started  one thousand poundsfive thousand dollars  five thousand  when do i begin  youll do it  for five thousand dollars i certainly will  with your eyes open  wide open  a look of positive geniality illuminated mr peters pinched features he even went so far as to pat ashe on the shoulder  good boy he said meet me at paddington station at four oclock on friday and if theres anything more you want to know come round to this address  there remained the telling of joan valentine for it was obviously impossible not to tell her when you have revolutionized your life at the bidding of another you cannot well conceal the fact as though nothing had happened ashe had not the slightest desire to conceal the fact on the contrary he was glad to have such a capital excuse for renewing the acquaintance  he could not tell her of course the secret details of the thing naturally those must remain hidden no he would just go airily in and say  you know what you told me about doing something new well ive just got a job as a valet  so he went airily in and said it  to whom said joan  to a man named petersan american  women are trained from infancy up to conceal their feelings joan did not start or otherwise express emotion  not mr j preston peters  yes do you know him what a remarkable thing  his daughter said joan has just engaged me as a ladys maid  what  it will not be quite the same thing as three years ago joan explained it is just a cheap way of getting a holiday i used to know miss peters very well you see it will be more like traveling as her guest  butbut ashe had not yet overcome his amazement  yes  but what an extraordinary coincidence  yes by the way how did you get the situation and what put it into your head to be a valet at all it seems such a curious thing for you to think of doing  ashe was embarrassed  iiwell you see the experience will be useful to me of course in my writing  oh are you thinking of taking up my line of work dukes  no nonot exactly that  it seems so odd how did you happen to get in touch with mr peters  oh i answered an advertisement  i see  ashe was becoming conscious of an undercurrent of something not altogether agreeable in the conversation it lacked the gay ease of their first interview he was not apprehensive lest she might have guessed his secret there was he felt no possible means by which she could have done that yet the fact remained that those keen blue eyes of hers were looking at him in a peculiar and penetrating manner he felt damped  it will be nice being together he said feebly  very said joan  there was a pause  i thought i would come and tell you  quite so  there was another pause  it seems so funny that you should be going out as a ladys maid  yes  but of course you have done it before  yes  the really extraordinary thing is that we should be going to the same people  yes  itits remarkable isnt it  yes  ashe reflected no he did not appear to have any further remarks to make  goodby for the present he said  goodby  ashe drifted out he was conscious of a wish that he understood girls girls in his opinion were odd  when he had gone joan valentine hurried to the door and having opened it an inch stood listening when the sound of his door closing came to her she ran down the stairs and out into arundell street she went to the hotel mathis  i wonder she said to the sadeyed waiter if you have a copy of the morning post  the waiter a child of romantic italy was only too anxious to oblige youth and beauty he disappeared and presently returned with a crumpled copy joan thanked him with a bright smile  back in her room she turned to the advertisement pages she knew that life was full of what the unthinking call coincidences but the miracle of ashe having selected by chance the father of aline peters as an employer was too much of a coincidence for her suspicion furrowed her brow  it did not take her long to discover the advertisement that had sent ashe hurrying in a taxicab to the offices of messrs mainprice mainprice  boole she had been looking for something of the kind  she read it through twice and smiled everything was very clear to her she looked at the ceiling above her and shook her head  you are quite a nice young man mr marson she said softly but you mustnt try to jump my claim i dare say you need that money too but im afraid you must go without i am going to have itand nobody else    chapter v  the fourfifteen express slid softly out of paddington station and ashe marson settled himself in the corner seat of his secondclass compartment opposite him joan valentine had begun to read a magazine along the corridor in a firstclass smoking compartment mr peters was lighting a big black cigar still farther along the corridor in a firstclass nonsmoking compartment aline peters looked through the window and thought of many things  in english trains the tipping classes travel first valets ladys maids footmen nurses and head stillroom maids second and housemaids grooms and minor and inferior stillroom maids third but for these social distinctions the whole fabric of society would collapse and anarchy stalk naked through the landas in the united states  ashe was feeling remarkably lighthearted he wished he had not bought joan that magazine and thus deprived himself temporarily of the pleasure of her conversation but that was the only flaw in his happiness with the starting of the train which might be considered the formal and official beginning of the delicate and dangerous enterprise on which he had embarked he had definitely come to the conclusion that the life adventurous was the life for him he had frequently suspected this to be the case but it had required the actual experiment to bring certainty  almost more than physical courage the ideal adventurer needs a certain lively inquisitiveness the quality of not being content to mind his own affairs and in ashe this quality was highly developed from boyhood up he had always been interested in things that were none of his business and it is just that attribute which the modern young man as a rule so sadly lacks  the modern young man may do adventurous things if they are thrust on him but left to himself he will edge away uncomfortably and look in the other direction when the goddess of adventure smiles at him training and tradition alike pluck at his sleeve and urge him not to risk making himself ridiculous and from sheer horror of laying himself open to the charge of not minding his own business he falls into a stolid disregard of all that is out of the ordinary and exciting he tells himself that the shriek from the lonely house he passed just now was only the high note of some amateur songstress and that the maiden in distress whom he saw pursued by the ruffian with a knife was merely earning the salary paid her by some motionpicture firm and he proceeds on his way looking neither to left nor right  ashe had none of this degenerate coyness toward adventure though born within easy distance of boston and deposited by circumstances in london he possessed nevertheless to a remarkable degree that quality so essentially the property of the new yorkerthe quality known for want of a more polished word as rubber it is true that it had needed the eloquence of joan valentine to stir him from his groove but that was because he was also lazy he loved new sights and new experiences yes he was happy the rattle of the train shaped itself into a lively march he told himself that he had found the right occupation for a young man in the spring  joan meantime intrenched behind her magazine was also busy with her thoughts she was not reading the magazine she held it before her as a protection knowing that if she laid it down ashe would begin to talk and just at present she had no desire for conversation she like ashe was contemplating the immediate future but unlike him was not doing so with much pleasure she was regretting heartily that she had not resisted the temptation to uplift this young man and wishing that she had left him to wallow in the slothful peace in which she had found him  it is curious how frequently in this world our attempts to stimulate and uplift swoop back on us and smite us like boomerangs ashes presence was the direct outcome of her lecture on enterprise and it added a complication to an already complicated venture  she did her best to be fair to ashe it was not his fault that he was about to try to deprive her of five thousand dollars which she looked on as her personal property but illogically she found herself feeling a little hostile  she glanced furtively at him over the magazine choosing by ill chance a moment when he had just directed his gaze at her their eyes met and there was nothing for it but to talk so she tucked away her hostility in a corner of her mind where she could find it again when she wanted it and prepared for the time being to be friendly after all except for the fact that he was her rival this was a pleasant and amusing young man and one for whom until he made the announcement that had changed her whole attitude toward him she had entertained a distinct feeling of friendshipnothing warmer  there was something about him that made her feel that she would have liked to stroke his hair in a motherly way and straighten his tie and have cozy chats with him in darkened rooms by the light of open fires and make him tell her his inmost thoughts and stimulate him to do something really worth while with his life but this she held was merely the instinct of a generous nature to be kind and helpful even to a comparative stranger  well mr marson she said here we are  exactly what i was thinking said ashe  he was conscious of a marked increase in the exhilaration the starting of the expedition had brought to him at the back of his mind he realized there had been all along a kind of wistful resentment at the change in this girls manner toward him during the brief conversation when he had told her of his having secured his present situation and later only a few minutes back on the platform of paddington station he had sensed a coldness a certain hostilityso different from her pleasant friendliness at their first meeting  she had returned now to her earlier manner and he was surprised at the difference it made he felt somehow younger more alive the lilt of the trains rattle changed to a gay ragtime this was curious because joan was nothing more than a friend he was not in love with her one does not fall in love with a girl whom one has met only three times one is attractedyes but one does not fall in love  a moments reflection enabled him to diagnose his sensations correctly this odd impulse to leap across the compartment and kiss joan was not love it was merely the natural desire of a goodhearted young man to be decently chummy with his species  well what do you think of it all mr marson said joan are you sorry or glad that you let me persuade you to do this perfectly mad thing i feel responsible for you you know if it had not been for me you would have been comfortably in arundell street writing your wand of death  im glad  you dont feel any misgivings now that you are actually committed to domestic service  not one  joan against her will smiled approval on this uncompromising attitude this young man might be her rival but his demeanor on the eve of perilous times appealed to her that was the spirit she liked and admiredthat reckless acceptance of whatever might come it was the spirit in which she herself had gone into the affair and she was pleased to find that it animated ashe alsothough to be sure it had its drawbacks it made his rivalry the more dangerous this reflection injected a touch of the old hostility into her manner  i wonder whether you will continue to feel so brave  what do you mean  joan perceived that she was in danger of going too far she had no wish to unmask ashe at the expense of revealing her own secret she must resist the temptation to hint that she had discovered his  i meant she said quickly that from what i have seen of him mr peters seems likely to be a rather trying man to work for  ashes face cleared for a moment he had almost suspected that she had guessed his errand  yes i imagine he will be he is what you might call quicktempered he has dyspepsia you know  i know  what he wants is plenty of fresh air and no cigars and a regular course of those larsen exercises that amused you so much  joan laughed  are you going to try and persuade mr peters to twist himself about like that do let me see it if you do  i wish i could  do suggest it to him  dont you think he would resent it from a valet  i keep forgetting that you are a valet you look so unlike one  old peters didnt think so he rather complimented me on my appearance he said i was ordinarylooking  i shouldnt have called you that you look so very strong and fit  surely there are muscular valets  well yes i suppose there are  ashe looked at her he was thinking that never in his life had he seen a girl so amazingly pretty what it was that she had done to herself was beyond him but something some trick of dress had given her a touch of the demure that made her irresistible she was dressed in sober black the ideal background for her fairness  while on the subject he said i suppose you know you dont look in the least like a ladys maid you look like a disguised princess  she laughed  thats very nice of you mr marson but youre quite wrong anyone could tell i was a ladys maid a mile away you arent criticizing the dress surely  the dress is all right its the general effect i dont think your expression is right itsitstheres too much attack in it you arent meek enough  joans eyes opened wide  meek have you ever seen an english ladys maid mr marson  why no now that i come to think of it i dont believe i have  well let me tell you that meekness is her last quality why should she be meek doesnt she go in after the groom of the chambers  go in go in where  in to dinner she smiled at the sight of his bewildered face im afraid you dont know much about the etiquette of the new world you have entered so rashly didnt you know that the rules of precedence among the servants of a big house in england are more rigid and complicated than in english society  youre joking  im not joking you try going in to dinner out of your proper place when we get to blandings and see what happens a public rebuke from the butler is the least you could expect  a bead of perspiration appeared on ashes forehead  heavens he whispered if a butler publicly rebuked me i think i should commit suicide i couldnt survive it  he stared with fallen jaw into the abyss of horror into which he had leaped so lightheartedly the servant problem on this large scale had been nonexistent for him until now in the days of his youth at mayling massachusetts his needs had been ministered to by a muscular swede later at oxford there had been his scout and his bed maker harmless persons both provided you locked up your whisky and in london his last phase a succession of servitors of the type of the disheveled maid at number seven had tended him  that dotted about the land of his adoption there were houses in which larger staffs of domestics were maintained he had been vaguely aware indeed in gridley quayle investigator the adventure of the missing marquisnumber four of the serieshe had drawn a picture of the home life of a duke in which a butler and two powdered footmen had played their parts but he had had no idea that rigid and complicated rules of etiquette swayed the private lives of these individuals if he had given the matter a thought he had supposed that when the dinner hour arrived the butler and the two footmen would troop into the kitchen and squash in at the table wherever they found room  tell me he said tell me all you know i feel as though i had escaped a frightful disaster  you probably have i dont suppose there is anything so terrible as a snub from a butler  if there is i cant think of it when i was at oxford i used to go and stay with a friend of mine who had a butler that looked like a roman emperor in swallowtails he terrified me i used to grovel to the man please give me all the pointers you can  well as mr peters valet i suppose you will be rather a big man  i shant feel it  however large the house party is mr peters is sure to be the principal guest so your standing will be correspondingly magnificent you come after the butler the housekeeper the groom of the chambers lord emsworths valet lady ann warblingtons ladys maid  who is she  lady ann lord emsworths sister she has lived with him since his wife died what was i saying oh yes after them come the honorable frederick threepwoods valet and myselfand then you  im not so high up then after all  yes you are theres a whole crowd who come after you it all depends on how many other guests there are besides mr peters  i suppose i charge in at the head of a drove of housemaids and scullery maids  my dear mr marson if a housemaid or a scullery maid tried to get into the stewards room and have her meals with us she would be  rebuked by the butler  lynched i should think kitchen maids and scullery maids eat in the kitchen chauffeurs footmen underbutler pantry boys hall boy odd man and stewardsroom footman take their meals in the servants hall waited on by the hall boy the stillroom maids have breakfast and tea in the stillroom and dinner and supper in the hall the housemaids and nursery maids have breakfast and tea in the housemaids sittingroom and dinner and supper in the hall the head housemaid ranks next to the head stillroom maid the laundry maids have a place of their own near the laundry and the head laundry maid ranks above the head housemaid the chef has his meals in a room of his own near the kitchen is there anything else i can tell you mr marson  ashe was staring at her with vacant eyes he shook his head dumbly  we stop at swindon in half an hour said joan softly dont you think you would be wise to get out there and go straight back to london mr marson think of all you would avoid  ashe found speech  its a nightmare  you would be far happier in arundell street why dont you get out at swindon and go back  ashe shook his head  i cant therestheres a reason  joan picked up her magazine again hostility had come out from the corner into which she had tucked it away and was once more filling her mind she knew it was illogical but she could not help it for a moment during her revelations of servants etiquette she had allowed herself to hope that she had frightened her rival out of the field and the disappointment made her feel irritable she buried herself in a short story and countered ashes attempts at renewing the conversation with cold monosyllables until he ceased his efforts and fell into a moody silence  he was feeling hurt and angry her sudden coldness following on the friendliness with which she had talked so long puzzled and infuriated him he felt as though he had been snubbed and for no reason  he resented the defensive magazine though he had bought it for her himself he resented her attitude of having ceased to recognize his existence a sadness a filmy melancholy crept over him he brooded on the unutterable silliness of humanity especially the female portion of it in erecting artificial barriers to friendship it was so unreasonable  at their first meeting when she might have been excused for showing defensiveness she had treated him with unaffected ease when that meeting had ended there was a tacit understanding between them that all the preliminary awkwardnesses of the first stages of acquaintanceship were to be considered as having been passed and that when they met again if they ever did it would be as friends and here she was luring him on with apparent friendliness and then withdrawing into herself as though he had presumed  a rebellious spirit took possession of him he didnt care let her be cold and distant he would show her that she had no monopoly of those qualities he would not speak to her until she spoke to him and when she spoke to him he would freeze her with his courteous but bleakly aloof indifference  the train rattled on joan read her magazine silence reigned in the secondclass compartment swindon was reached and passed darkness fell on the land the journey began to seem interminable to ashe but presently there came a creaking of brakes and the train jerked itself to another stop a voice on the platform made itself heard calling  market blandings market blandings station                                  the village of market blandings is one of those sleepy english hamlets that modern progress has failed to touch except by the addition of a railroad station and a room over the grocers shop where moving pictures are on view on tuesdays and fridays the church is norman and the intelligence of the majority of the natives paleozoic to alight at market blandings station in the dusk of a rather chilly spring day when the southwest wind has shifted to due east and the thrifty inhabitants have not yet lit their windows is to be smitten with the feeling that one is at the edge of the world with no friends near  ashe as he stood beside mr peters baggage and raked the unsympathetic darkness with a dreary eye gave himself up to melancholy above him an oil lamp shed a meager light along the platform a small but sturdy porter was juggling with a milk can the east wind explored ashes system with chilly fingers  somewhere out in the darkness into which mr peters and aline had already vanished in a large automobile lay the castle with its butler and its fearful code of etiquette soon the cart that was to convey him and the trunks thither would be arriving he shivered  out of the gloom and into the feeble rays of the oil lamp came joan valentine she had been away tucking aline into the car she looked warm and cheerful she was smiling in the old friendly way  if girls realized their responsibilities they would be so careful when they smiled that they would probably abandon the practice altogether there are moments in a mans life when a girls smile can have as important results as an explosion of dynamite  in the course of their brief acquaintance joan had smiled at ashe many times but the conditions governing those occasions had not been such as to permit him to be seriously affected he had been pleased on such occasions he had admired her smile in a detached and critical spirit but he had not been overwhelmed by it the frame of mind necessary for that result had been lacking  now however after five minutes of solitude on the depressing platform of market blandings station he was what the spiritualists call a sensitive subject he had reached that depth of gloom and bodily discomfort when a sudden smile has all the effect of strong liquor and good news administered simultaneously warming the blood and comforting the soul and generally turning the world from a bleak desert into a land flowing with milk and honey  it is not too much to say that he reeled before joans smile it was so entirely unexpected he clutched mr peters steamer trunk in his emotion all his resolutions to be cold and distant were swept away he had the feeling that in a friendless universe here was somebody who was fond of him and glad to see him  a smile of such importance demands analysis and in this case repays it for many things lay behind this smile of joan valentines on the platform of market blandings station  in the first place she had had another of her swift changes of mood and had once again tucked away hostility into its corner she had thought it over and had come to the conclusion that as she had no logical grievance against ashe for anything he had done to be distant to him was the behavior of a cat consequently she resolved when they should meet again to resume her attitude of goodfellowship that in itself would have been enough to make her smile  there was another reason however which had nothing to do with ashe while she had been tucking aline into the automobile she met the eye of the driver of that vehicle and had perceived a curious look in ita look of amazement and sheer terror a moment later when aline called the driver freddie she had understood no wonder the honorable freddie had looked as though he had seen a ghost  it would be a relief to the poor fellow when as he undoubtedly would do in the course of the drive he inquired of aline the name of her maid and was told that it was simpson he would mutter something about reminds me of a girl i used to know and would brood on the remarkable way in which nature produces doubles but he had a bad moment and it was partly at the recollection of his face that joan smiled  a third reason was because the sight of the honorable freddie had reminded her that r jones had said he had written her poetry that thought too had contributed toward the smile which so dazzled ashe  ashe not being miraculously intuitive accepted the easier explanation that she smiled because she was glad to be in his company and this thought coming on top of his mood of despair and general dissatisfaction with everything mundane acted on him like some powerful chemical  in every mans life there is generally one moment to which in later years he can look back and say in this moment i fell in love such a moment came to ashe now            betwixt the stirrup and the ground           mercy i asked mercy i found  so sings the poet and so it was with ashe  in the almost incredibly brief time it took the small but sturdy porter to roll a milk can across the platform and hump it with a clang against other milk cans similarly treated a moment before ashe fell in love  the word is so loosely used to cover a thousand varying shades of emotionfrom the volcanic passion of an antony for a cleopatra to the tepid preference of a grocers assistant for the irish maid at the second house on main street as opposed to the norwegian maid at the first house past the post officethe mere statement that ashe fell in love is not a sufficient description of his feelings as he stood grasping mr peters steamer trunk analysis is required  from his fourteenth year onward ashe had been in love many times his sensations in the case of joan were neither the terrific upheaval that had caused him in his fifteenth year to collect twentyeight photographs of the heroine of the road company of a musical comedy which had visited the hayling opera house nor the milder flame that had caused him when at college to give up smoking for a week and try to read the complete works of ella wheeler wilcox  his love was something that lay between these two poles  he did not wish the station platform of market blandings to become suddenly congested with red indians so that he might save joans life and he did not wish to give up anything at all but he was consciousto the very depths of his beingthat a future in which joan did not figure would be so insupportable as not to bear considering and in the immediate present he very strongly favored the idea of clasping joan in his arms and kissing her until further notice  mingled with these feelings was an excited gratitude to her for coming to him like this with that electric smile on her face a stunned realization that she was a thousand times prettier than he had ever imagined and a humility that threatened to make him loose his clutch on the steamer trunk and roll about at her feet yapping like a dog  gratitude so far as he could dissect his tangled emotion was the predominating ingredient of his mood only once in his life had he felt so passionately grateful to any human being on that occasion too the object of his gratitude had been feminine  years before when a boy in his fathers home in distant hayling massachusetts those in authority had commanded that hein his eleventh year and as shy as one can be only at that interesting ageshould rise in the presence of a roomful of strangers adult guests and recite the wreck of the hesperus  he had risen he had blushed he had stammered he had contrived to whisper it was the schooner hesperus and then in a corner of the room a little girl for no properly explained reason had burst out crying she had yelled she had bellowed and would not be comforted and in the ensuing confusion ashe had escaped to the woodpile at the bottom of the garden saved by a miracle  all his life he had remembered the gratitude he had felt for that little timely girl and never until now had he experienced any other similar spasm but as he looked at joan he found himself renewing that emotion of fifteen years ago  she was about to speak in a sort of trance he watched her lips part he waited almost reverently for the first words she should speak to him in her new role of the only authentic goddess  isnt it a shame she said ive just put a penny in the chocolate slot machineand its empty ive a good mind to write to the company  ashe felt as though he were listening to the strains of some grand sweet anthem  the small but sturdy porter weary of his work among the milk cans or perhapslet us not do him an injustice even in thoughthaving finished it approached them  the cart from the castles here  in the gloom beyond him there gleamed a light which had not been there before the meditative snort of a horse supported his statement he began to deal as authoritatively with mr peters steamer trunk as he had dealt with the milk cans  at last said joan i hope its a covered cart im frozen lets go and see  ashe followed her with the gait of an automaton                                  cold is the ogre that drives all beautiful things into hiding below the surface of a frostbound garden there lurk hidden bulbs which are only biding their time to burst forth in a riot of laughing color but shivering nature dare not put forth her flowers until the ogre has gone not otherwise does cold suppress love a man in an open cart on an english spring night may continue to be in love but love is not the emotion uppermost in his bosom it shrinks within him and waits for better times  the cart was not a covered cart it was open to the four winds of heaven of which the one at present active proceeded from the bleak east to this fact may be attributed ashes swift recovery from the exalted mood into which joans smile had thrown him his almost instant emergence from the trance deep down in him he was aware that his attitude toward joan had not changed but his conscious self was too fully occupied with the almost hopeless task of keeping his blood circulating to permit of thoughts of love before the cart had traveled twenty yards he was a mere chunk of frozen misery  after an eternity of winding roads darkened cottages and black fields and hedges the cart turned in at a massive iron gate which stood open giving entrance to a smooth gravel drive here the way ran for nearly a mile through an open park of great trees and was then swallowed in the darkness of dense shrubberies presently to the left appeared lights at first in ones and twos shining out and vanishing again then as the shrubberies ended and the smooth lawns and terraces began blazing down on the travelers from a score of windows with the heartening effect of fires on a winter night  against the pale gray sky blandings castle stood out like a mountain it was a noble pile of early tudor building its history is recorded in englands history books and violletleduc has written of its architecture it dominated the surrounding country  the feature of it which impressed ashe most at this moment however was the fact that it looked warm and for the first time since the drive began he found himself in a mood that approximated cheerfulness it was a little early to begin feeling cheerful he discovered for the journey was by no means over arrived within sight of the castle the cart began a detour which ten minutes later brought it under an arch and over cobblestones to the rear of the building where it eventually pulled up in front of a great door  ashe descended painfully and beat his feet against the cobbles he helped joan to climb down joan was apparently in a gentle glow women seem impervious to cold  the door opened warm kitcheny scents came through it strong men hurried out to take down the trunks while fair women in the shape of two nervous scullery maids approached joan and ashe and bobbed curtsies this under more normal conditions would have been enough to unman ashe but in his frozen state a mere curtsying scullery maid expended herself harmlessly on him he even acknowledged the greeting with a kindly nod  the scullery maids it seemed were acting in much the same capacity as the attaches of royalty one was there to conduct joan to the presence of mrs twemlow the housekeeper the other to lead ashe to where beach the butler waited to do honor to the valet of the castles most important guest  after a short walk down a stoneflagged passage joan and her escort turned to the right ashes objective appeared to be located to the left he parted from joan with regret her moral support would have been welcome  presently his scullery maid stopped at a door and tapped thereon a fruity voice like old tawny port made audible said come in ashes guide opened the door  the gentleman mr beach said she and scuttled away to the less rarefied atmosphere of the kitchen  ashes first impression of beach the butler was one of tension other people confronted for the first time with beach had felt the same he had that strained air of being on the very point of bursting that one sees in bullfrogs and toy balloons nervous and imaginative men meeting beach braced themselves involuntarily stiffening their muscles for the explosion those who had the pleasure of more intimate acquaintance with him soon passed this stage just as people whose homes are on the slopes of mount vesuvius become immune to fear of eruptions  as far back as they could remember beach had always looked as though an apoplectic fit were a matter of minutes but he never had apoplexy and in time they came to ignore the possibility of it ashe however approaching him with a fresh eye had the feeling that this strain could not possibly continue and that within a very short space of time the worst must happen the prospect of this did much to rouse him from the coma into which he had been frozen by the rigors of the journey  butlers as a class seem to grow less and less like anything human in proportion to the magnificence of their surroundings there is a type of butler employed in the comparatively modest homes of small country gentlemen who is practically a man and a brother who hobnobs with the local tradesmen sings a good comic song at the village inn and in times of crisis will even turn to and work the pump when the water supply suddenly fails  the greater the house the more does the butler diverge from this type blandings castle was one of the more important of englands show places and beach accordingly had acquired a dignified inertia that almost qualified him for inclusion in the vegetable kingdom he movedwhen he moved at allslowly he distilled speech with the air of one measuring out drops of some precious drug his heavylidded eyes had the fixed expression of a statues  with an almost imperceptible wave of a fat white hand he conveyed to ashe that he desired him to sit down with a stately movement of his other hand he picked up a kettle which simmered on the hob with an inclination of his head he called ashes attention to a decanter on the table  in another moment ashe was sipping a whisky toddy with the feeling that he had been privileged to assist at some mystic rite mr beach posting himself before the fire and placing his hands behind his back permitted speech to drip from him  i have not the advantage of your name mr  ashe introduced himself beach acknowledged the information with a half bow  you must have had a cold ride mr marson the wind is in the east  ashe said yes the ride had been cold  when the wind is in the east continued mr beach letting each syllable escape with apparent reluctance i suffer from my feet  i beg your pardon  i suffer from my feet repeated the butler measuring out the drops you are a young man mr marson probably you do not know what it is to suffer from your feet he surveyed ashe his whisky toddy and the wall beyond him with heavylidded inscrutability corns he said  ashe said he was sorry  i suffer extremely from my feetnot only corns i have but recently recovered from an ingrowing toenail i suffered greatly from my ingrowing toenail i suffer from swollen joints  ashe regarded this martyr with increasing disfavor it is the flaw in the character of many excessively healthy young men that though kindhearted enough in most respects they listen with a regrettable feeling of impatience to the confessions of those less happily situated as regards the ills of the flesh rightly or wrongly they hold that these statements should be reserved for the ear of the medical profession and other and more general topics selected for conversation with laymen  im sorry he said hastily you must have had a bad time is there a large house party here just now  we are expecting said mr beach a number of guests we shall in all probability sit down thirty or more to dinner  a responsibility for you said ashe ingratiatingly well pleased to be quit of the feet topic  mr beach nodded  you are right mr marson few persons realize the responsibilities of a man in my position sometimes i can assure you it preys on my mind and i suffer from nervous headaches  ashe began to feel like a man trying to put out a fire which as fast as he checks it at one point breaks out at another  sometimes when i come off duty everything gets blurred the outlines of objects grow indistinct and misty i have to sit down in a chair the pain is excruciating  but it helps you to forget the pain in your feet  no no i suffer from my feet simultaneously  ashe gave up the struggle  tell me all about your feet he said  and mr beach told him all about his feet  the pleasantest functions must come to an end and the moment arrived when the final word on the subject of swollen joints was spoken ashe who had resigned himself to a permanent contemplation of the subject could hardly believe he heard correctly when at the end of some ten minutes his companion changed the conversation  you have been with mr peters some time mr marson  eh oh oh no only since last wednesday  indeed might i inquire whom you assisted before that  for a moment ashe did what he would not have believed himself capable of doingregretted that the topic of feet was no longer under discussion the question placed him in an awkward position if he lied and credited himself with a lengthy experience as a valet he risked exposing himself if he told the truth and confessed that this was his maiden effort in the capacity of gentlemans gentleman what would the butler think there were objections to each course but to tell the truth was the easier of the two so he told it  your first situation said mr beach indeed  i waserdoing something else before i met mr peters said ashe  mr beach was too wellbred to be inquisitive but his eyebrows were not  ah he said  cried his eyebrows   ashe ignored the eyebrows  something different he said  there was an awkward silence ashe appreciated its awkwardness he was conscious of a grievance against mr peters why could not mr peters have brought him down here as his secretary to be sure he had advanced some objection to that course in their conversation at the offices of mainprice mainprice  boole but merely a silly farfetched objection he wished he had had the sense to fight the point while there was time but at the moment when they were arranging plans he had been rather tickled by the thought of becoming a valet the notion had a pleasing musicalcomedy touch about it why had he not foreseen the complications that must ensue he could tell by the look on his face that this confounded butler was waiting for him to give a full explanation what would he think if he withheld it he would probably suppose that ashe had been in prison  well there was nothing to be done about it if beach was suspicious he must remain suspicious fortunately the suspicions of a butler do not matter much  mr beachs eyebrows were still mutely urging him to reveal all but ashe directed his gaze at that portion of the room which mr beach did not fill he would be hanged if he was going to let himself be hypnotized by a pair of eyebrows into incriminating himself he glared stolidly at the pattern of the wallpaper which represented a number of birds of an unknown species seated on a corresponding number of exotic shrubs  the silence was growing oppressive somebody had to break it soon and as mr beach was still confining himself to the language of the eyebrow and apparently intended to fight it out on that line if it took all summer ashe himself broke it  it seemed to him as he reconstructed the scene in bed that night that providence must have suggested the subject to mr peters indigestion for the mere mention of his employers sufferings acted like magic on the butler  i might have had better luck while i was looking for a place said ashe i dare say you know how badtempered mr peters is he is dyspeptic  so responded mr beach i have been informed he brooded for a space i too he proceeded suffer from my stomach i have a weak stomach the lining of my stomach is not what i could wish the lining of my stomach to be  tell me said ashe gratefully leaning forward in an attitude of attention all about the lining of your stomach  it was a quarter of an hour later when mr beach was checked in his discourse by the chiming of the little clock on the mantelpiece he turned round and gazed at it with surprise not unmixed with displeasure  so late he said i shall have to be going about my duties and you also mr marson if i may make the suggestion no doubt mr peters will be wishing to have your assistance in preparing for dinner if you go along the passage outside you will come to the door that separates our portion of the house from the other i must beg you to excuse me i have to go to the cellar  following his directions ashe came after a walk of a few yards to a greenbaize door which swinging at his push gave him a view of what he correctly took to be the main hall of the castlea wide comfortable space ringed with settees and warmed by a log fire burning in a mammoth fireplace on the right a broad staircase led to the upper regions  it was at this point that ashe realized the incompleteness of mr beachs directions doubtless the broad staircase would take him to the floor on which were the bedrooms but how was he to ascertain without the tedious process of knocking and inquiring at each door which was the one assigned to mr peters it was too late to go back and ask the butler for further guidance already he was on his way to the cellar in quest of the evenings wine  as he stood irresolute a door across the hall opened and a man of his own age came out through the doorway which the young man held open for an instant while he answered a question from somebody within ashe had a glimpse of glasstopped cases  could this be the museumhis goal the next moment the door opening a few inches more revealed the outlying portions of an egyptian mummy and brought certainty it flashed across ashes mind that the sooner he explored the museum and located mr peters scarab the better he decided to ask beach to take him there as soon as he had leisure  meantime the young man had closed the museum door and was crossing the hall he was a wiryhaired severelooking young man with a sharp nose and eyes that gleamed through rimless spectaclesnone other in fact than lord emsworths private secretary the efficient baxter ashe hailed him  i say old man would you mind telling me how i get to mr peters room ive lost my bearings  he did not reflect that this was hardly the way in which valets in the best society addressed their superiors that is the worst of adopting what might be called a character part one can manage the business well enough it is the dialogue that provides the pitfalls  mr baxter would have accorded a hearty agreement to the statement that this was not the way in which a valet should have spoken to him but at the moment he was not aware that ashe was a valet from his easy mode of address he assumed that he was one of the numerous guests who had been arriving at the castle all day as he had asked for mr peters he fancied that ashe must be the honorable freddies american friend george emerson whom he had not yet met consequently he replied with much cordiality that mr peters room was the second at the left on the second floor  he said ashe could not miss it ashe said he was much obliged  awfully good of you said ashe  not at all said mr baxter  you lose your way in a place like this said ashe  you certainly do said mr baxter  ashe went on his upward path and in a few moments was knocking at the door indicated and sure enough it was mr peters voice that invited him to enter  mr peters partially arrayed in the correct garb for gentlemen about to dine was standing in front of the mirror wrestling with his evening tie as ashe entered he removed his fingers and anxiously examined his handiwork it proved unsatisfactory with a yelp and an oath he tore the offending linen from his neck  damn the thing  it was plain to ashe that his employer was in no sunny mood there are few things less calculated to engender sunniness in a naturally badtempered man than a dress tie that will not let itself be pulled and twisted into the right shape even when things went well mr peters hated dressing for dinner words cannot describe his feelings when they went wrong  there is something to be said in excuse for this impatience it is a hollow mockery to be obliged to deck ones person as for a feast when that feast is to consist of a little asparagus and a few nuts  mr peters eye met ashes in the mirror  oh its you is it come in then dont stand staring close that door quick hustle dont scrape your feet on the floor try to look intelligent dont gape where have you been all this while why didnt you come before can you tie a tie all right thendo it  somewhat calmed by the snowwhite butterflyshaped creation that grew under ashes fingers he permitted himself to be helped into his coat he picked up the remnant of a black cigar from the dressingtable and relit it  ive been thinking about you he said  yes said ashe  have you located the scarab yet  no  what the devil have you been doing with yourself then youve had time to collar it a dozen times  i have been talking to the butler  what the devil do you waste time talking to butlers for i suppose you havent even located the museum yet  yes ive done that  oh you have have you well thats something and how do you propose setting about the job  the best plan would be to go there very late at night  well you didnt propose to stroll in in the afternoon did you how are you going to find the scarab when you do get in  ashe had not thought of that the deeper he went into this business the more things did there seem to be in it of which he had not thought  i dont know he confessed  you dont know tell me young man are you considered pretty bright as englishmen go  i am not english i was born near boston  oh you were were you you blanked boneheaded beaneating boob cried mr peters frothing over quite unexpectedly and waving his arms in a sudden burst of fury then if you are an american why dont you show a little more enterprise why dont you put something over why do you loaf about the place as though you were supposed to be an ornament i want resultsand i want them quick  ill tell you how you can recognize my scarab when you get into the museum that shameless old greengoods man who sneaked it from me has had the gall the nerve to put it all by itself with a notice as big as a circus poster alongside of it saying that it is a cheops of the fourth dynasty presentedmr peters chokedpresented by j preston peters esquire thats how youre going to recognize it  ashe did not laugh but he nearly dislocated a rib in his effort to abstain from doing so it seemed to him that this act on lord emsworths part effectually disposed of the theory that britons have no sense of humor to rob a man of his choicest possession and then thank him publicly for letting you have it appealed to ashe as excellent comedy  the thing isnt even in a glass case continued mr peters its lying on an open tray on top of a cabinet of roman coins anybody who was left alone for two minutes in the place could take it its criminal carelessness to leave a valuable scarab about like that if lord jesse james was going to steal my cheops he might at least have had the decency to treat it as though it was worth something  but it makes it easier for me to get it said ashe consolingly  its got to be made easy if you are to get it snapped mr peters heres another thing you say you are going to try for it late at night well what are you going to do if anyone catches you prowling round at that time have you considered that  no  you would have to say something wouldnt you you wouldnt chat about the weather would you you wouldnt discuss the latest play you would have to think up some mighty good reason for being out of bed at that time wouldnt you  i suppose so  oh you do admit that do you well what you would say is this you would explain that i had rung for you to come and read me to sleep do you understand  you think that would be a satisfactory explanation of my being in the museum  idiot i dont mean that youre to say it if youre caught actually in the museum if youre caught in the museum the best thing you can do is to say nothing and hope that the judge will let you off light because its your first offense youre to say it if youre found wandering about on your way there  it sounds thin to me  does it well let me tell you that it isnt so thin as you suppose for its what you will actually have to do most nights two nights out of three i have to be read to sleep my indigestion gives me insomnia as though to push this fact home mr peters suddenly bent double oof he said wow he removed the cigar from his mouth and inserted a digestive tabloid the lining of my stomach is all wrong he added  it is curious how trivial are the immediate causes that produce revolutions if mr peters had worded his complaint differently ashe would in all probability have borne it without active protest he had been growing more and more annoyed with this little person who buzzed and barked and bit at him yet the idea of definite revolt had not occurred to him but his sufferings at the hands of beach the butler had reduced him to a state where he could endure no further mention of stomachic linings there comes a time when our capacity for listening to detailed data about the linings of other peoples stomachs is exhausted  he looked at mr peters sternly he had ceased to be intimidated by the fiery little man and regarded him simply as a hypochondriac who needed to be told a few useful facts  how do you expect not to have indigestion you take no exercise and you smoke all day long  the novel sensation of being criticizedand by a beardless youth at thatheld mr peters silent he started convulsively but he did not speak ashe on his pet subject became eloquent in his opinion dyspeptics cumbered the earth to his mind they had the choice between health and sickness and they deliberately chose the latter  your sort of man makes me angry i know your type inside out you overwork and shirk exercise and let your temper run away with you and smoke strong cigars on an empty stomach and when you get indigestion as a natural result you look on yourself as a martyr nourish a perpetual grouch and make the lives of everybody you meet miserable if you would put yourself into my hands for a month i would have you eating bricks and thriving on them up in the morning larsen exercises cold bath a brisk rubdown sharp walk  who the devil asked your opinion you impertinent young hound inquired mr peters  dont interruptconfound you shouted ashe now you have made me forget what i was going to say  there was a tense silence then mr peters began to speak  youinfernalimpudent  dont talk to me like that  ill talk to you just  ashe took a step toward the door very well then he said ill quit im through you can get somebody else to do this job of yours for you  the sudden sagging of mr peters jaw the look of consternation that flashed on his face told ashe he had found the right weaponthat the game was in his hands he continued with a feeling of confidence  if i had known what being your valet involved i wouldnt have undertaken the thing for a hundred thousand dollars just because you had some idiotic prejudice against letting me come down here as your secretary which would have been the simple and obvious thing i find myself in a position where at any moment i may be publicly rebuked by the butler and have the head stillroom maid looking at me as though i were something the cat had brought in  his voice trembled with selfpity  do you realize a fraction of the awful things you have let me in for how on earth am i to remember whether i go in before the chef or after the third footman i shant have a peaceful minute while im in this place ive got to sit and listen by the hour to a bore of a butler who seems to be a sort of walking hospital ive got to steer my way through a complicated system of etiquette  and on top of all that you have the nerve the insolence to imagine that you can use me as a punching bag to work your bad temper off you have the immortal rind to suppose that i will stand for being nagged and bullied by you whenever your suicidal way of living brings on an attack of indigestion you have the supreme gall to fancy that you can talk as you please to me  very well ive had enough of it i resign if you want this scarab of yours recovered let somebody else do it ive retired from business  he took another step toward the door a shaking hand clutched at his sleeve  my boymy dear boybe reasonable  ashe was intoxicated with his own oratory the sensation of bullyragging a genuine millionaire was new and exhilarating he expanded his chest and spread his feet like a colossus  thats all very well he said coldly disentangling himself from the hand you cant get out of it like that we have got to come to an understanding the point is that if i am to be subjected to youryour senile malevolence every time you have a twinge of indigestion no amount of money could pay me to stop on  my dear boy it shall not occur again i was hasty  mr peters with agitated fingers relit the stump of his cigar  throw away that cigar  my boy  throw it away you say you were hasty of course you were hasty and as long as you abuse your digestion you will go on being hasty i want something better than apologies if i am to stop here we must get to the root of things you must put yourself in my hands as though i were your doctor no more cigars every morning regular exercises  no no  very well  no stop stop what sort of exercises  ill show you tomorrow morning brisk walks  i hate walking  cold baths  no no  very well  no stop a cold bath would kill me at my age  it would put new life into you do you consent to the cold baths no very well  yes yes yes  you promise  yes yes  all right then  the distant sound of the dinner gong floated in  we settled that just in time said ashe  mr peters regarded him fixedly  young man he said slowly if after all this you fail to recover my cheops for me illillby george ill skin you  dont talk like that said ashe thats another thing you have got to remember if my treatment is to be successful you must not let yourself think in that way you must exercise selfcontrol mentally you must think beautiful thoughts  the idea of skinning you is a beautiful thought said mr peters wistfully                                  in order that their gayety might not be diminishedand the food turned to ashes in their mouths by the absence from the festive board of mr beach it was the custom for the upper servants at blandings to postpone the start of their evening meal until dinner was nearly over abovestairs this enabled the butler to take his place at the head of the table without fear of interruption except for the few moments when coffee was being served  every night shortly before halfpast eightat which hour mr beach felt that he might safely withdraw from the diningroom and leave lord emsworth and his guests to the care of merridew the underbutler and james and alfred the footmen returning only for a few minutes to lend tone and distinction to the distribution of cigars and liqueursthose whose rank entitled them to do so made their way to the housekeepers room to pass in desultory conversation the interval before mr beach should arrive and a kitchen maid with the appearance of one who has been straining at the leash and has at last managed to get free opened the door with the announcement mr beach if you please dinner is served on which mr beach extending a crooked elbow toward the housekeeper would say mrs twemlow and lead the way high and disposedly down the passage followed in order of rank by the rest of the company in couples to the stewards room  for blandings was not one of those housesor shall we say hovelswhere the upper servants are expected not only to feed but to congregate before feeding in the stewards room under the auspices of mr beach and of mrs twemlow who saw eye to eye with him in these matters things were done properly at the castle with the correct solemnity to mr beach and mrs twemlow the suggestion that they and their peers should gather together in the same room in which they were to dine would have been as repellent as an announcement from lady ann warblington the chatelaine that the house party would eat in the drawingroom  when ashe returning from his interview with mr peters was intercepted by a respectful small boy and conducted to the housekeepers room he was conscious of a sensation of shrinking inferiority akin to his emotions on his first day at school the room was full and apparently on very cordial terms with itself everybody seemed to know everybody and conversation was proceeding in a manner reminiscent of an old home week  as a matter of fact the house party at blandings being in the main a gathering together of the emsworth clan by way of honor and as a means of introduction to mr peters and his daughter the brideofthehousetobe most of the occupants of the housekeepers room were old acquaintances and were renewing interrupted friendships at the top of their voices  a lull followed ashes arrival and all eyes to his great discomfort were turned in his direction his embarrassment was relieved by mrs twemlow who advanced to do the honors of mrs twemlow little need be attempted in the way of pen portraiture beyond the statement that she went as harmoniously with mr beach as one of a pair of vases or one of a brace of pheasants goes with its fellow she had the same appearance of imminent apoplexy the same air of belonging to some dignified and haughty branch of the vegetable kingdom  mr marson welcome to blandings castle  ashe had been waiting for somebody to say this and had been a little surprised that mr beach had not done so he was also surprised at the housekeepers ready recognition of his identity until he saw joan in the throng and deduced that she must have been the source of information  he envied joan in some amazing way she contrived to look not out of place in this gathering he himself he felt had impostor stamped in large characters all over him  mrs twemlow began to make the introductionsa long and tedious process which she performed relentlessly without haste and without scamping her work with each member of the aristocracy of his new profession ashe shook hands and on each member he smiled until his facial and dorsal muscles were like to crack under the strain it was amazing that so many highclass domestics could be collected into one moderatesized room  miss simpson you know said mrs twemlow and ashe was about to deny the charge when he perceived that joan was the individual referred to mr judson mr marson mr judson is the honorable fredericks gentleman  you have not the pleasure of our freddies acquaintance as yet i take it mr marson observed mr judson genially a smoothfaced lazylooking young man freddie repays inspection  mr marson permit me to introduce you to mr ferris lord stockheaths gentleman  mr ferris a dark cynical man with a high forehead shook ashe by the hand  happy to meet you mr marson  miss willoughby this is mr marson who will take you in to dinner miss willoughby is lady mildred mants lady as of course you are aware lady mildred our eldest daughter married colonel horace mant of the scots guards  ashe was not aware and he was rather surprised that mrs twemlow should have a daughter whose name was lady mildred but reason coming to his rescue suggested that by our she meant the offspring of the earl of emsworth and his late countess miss willoughby was a lighthearted damsel with a smiling face and chestnut hair done low over her forehead  since etiquette forbade that he should take joan in to dinner ashe was glad that at least an apparently pleasant substitute had been provided he had just been introduced to an appallingly statuesque lady of the name of chester lady ann warblingtons own maid and his somewhat hazy recollections of joans lecture on belowstairs precedence had left him with the impression that this was his destined partner he had frankly quailed at the prospect of being linked to so much aristocratic hauteur  when the final introduction had been made conversation broke out again it dealt almost exclusively so far as ashe could follow it with the idiosyncrasies of the employers of those present he took it that this happened down the entire social scale below stairs probably the lower servants in the servants hall discussed the upper servants in the room and the still lower servants in the housemaids sittingroom discussed their superiors of the servants hall and the stillroom gossiped about the housemaids sittingroom  he wondered which was the bottom circle of all and came to the conclusion that it was probably represented by the small respectful boy who had acted as his guide a short while before this boy having nobody to discuss anybody with presumably sat in solitary meditation brooding on the oddjob man  he thought of mentioning this theory to miss willoughby but decided that it was too abstruse for her and contented himself with speaking of some of the plays he had seen before leaving london miss willoughby was an enthusiast on the drama and colonel mants military duties keeping him much in town she had had wide opportunities of indulging her tastes miss willoughby did not like the country she thought it dull  dont you think the country dull mr marson  i shant find it dull here said ashe and he was surprised to discover through the medium of a pleased giggle that he was considered to have perpetrated a compliment  mr beach appeared in due season a little distrait as becomes a man who has just been engaged on important and responsible duties  alfred spilled the hock ashe heard him announce to mrs twemlow in a bitter undertone within half an inch of his lordships arm he spilled it  mrs twemlow murmured condolences mr beachs set expression was of one who is wondering how long the strain of existence can be supported  mr beach if you please dinner is served  the butler crushed down sad thoughts and crooked his elbow  mrs twemlow  ashe miscalculating degrees of rank in spite of all his caution was within a step of leaving the room out of his proper turn but the startled pressure of miss willoughbys hand on his arm warned him in time he stopped to allow the statuesque miss chester to sail out under escort of a wizened little man with a horseshoe pin in his tie whose name in company with nearly all the others that had been spoken to him since he came into the room had escaped ashes memory  you were nearly making a bloomer said miss willoughby brightly you must be absentminded mr marsonlike his lordship  is lord emsworth absentminded  miss willoughby laughed  why he forgets his own name sometimes if it wasnt for mr baxter goodness knows what would happen to him  i dont think i know mr baxter  you will if you stay here long you cant get away from him if youre in the same house dont tell anyone i said so but hes the real master here his lordships secretary he calls himself but hes really everything rolled into onelike the man in the play  ashe searching in his dramatic memories for such a person in a play inquired whether miss willoughby meant poohbah in the mikado of which there had been a revival in london recently miss willoughby did mean poohbah  but nosy parker is what i call him she said he minds everybodys business as well as his own  the last of the procession trickled into the stewards room  mr beach said grace somewhat patronizingly the meal began  youve seen miss peters of course mr marson said miss willoughby resuming conversation with the soup  just for a few minutes at paddington  oh you havent been with mr peters long then  ashe began to wonder whether everybody he met was going to ask him this dangerous question  only a day or so  where were you before that  ashe was conscious of a prickly sensation a little more of this and he might as well reveal his true mission at the castle and have done with it  oh i wasthat is to say  how are you feeling after the journey mr marson said a voice from the other side of the table and ashe looking up gratefully found joans eyes looking into his with a curiously amused expression  he was too grateful for the interruption to try to account for this he replied that he was feeling very well which was not the case miss willoughbys interest was diverted to a discussion of the defects of the various railroad systems of great britain  at the head of the table mr beach had started an intimate conversation with mr ferris the valet of lord stockheath the honorable freddies poor old percya cousin ashe had gathered of aline peters husbandtobe the butler spoke in more measured tones even than usual for he was speaking of tragedy  we were all extremely sorry mr ferris to read of your misfortune  ashe wondered what had been happening to mr ferris  yes mr beach replied the valet its a fact we made a pretty poor show he took a sip from his glass there is no concealing the facti have never tried to conceal itthat poor percy is not bright  miss chester entered the conversation  i couldnt see where the girlwhats her name was so very pretty all the papers had pieces where it said she was attractive and what not but she didnt look anything special to me from her photograph in the mirror what his lordship could see in her i cant understand  the photo didnt quite do her justice miss chester i was present in court and i must admit she was sveltedecidedly svelte and you must recollect that percy from childhood up has always been a highly susceptible young nut i speak as one who knows him  mr beach turned to joan  we are speaking of the stockheath breachofpromise case miss simpson of which you doubtless read in the newspapers lord stockheath is a nephew of ours i fancy his lordship was greatly shocked at the occurrence  he was chimed in mr judson from down the table i happened to overhear him speaking of it to young freddie it was in the library on the morning when the judge made his final summing up and slipped it into lord stockheath so proper if ever anything of this sort happens to you you young scalawag he says to freddie  mr beach coughed mr judson   oh its all right mr beach were all in the family here in a manner of speaking it wasnt as though i was telling it to a lot of outsiders im sure none of these ladies or gentlemen will let it go beyond this room  the company murmured virtuous acquiescence  he says to freddie you young scalawag if ever anything of this sort happens to you you can pack up and go off to canada for ill have nothing more to do with youor words to that effect and freddie says oh dash it all govnor you knowwhat  however short mr judsons imitation of his masters voice may have fallen of histrionic perfection it pleased the company the room shook with mirth  mr judson is clever isnt he mr marson whispered miss willoughby gazing with adoring eyes at the speaker  mr beach thought it expedient to deflect the conversation by the unwritten law of the room every individual had the right to speak as freely as he wished about his own personal employer but judson in his opinion sometimes went a trifle too far  tell me mr ferris he said does his lordship seem to bear it well  oh percy is bearing it well enough  ashe noted as a curious fact that though the actual valet of any person under discussion spoke of him almost affectionately by his christian name the rest of the company used the greatest ceremony and gave him his title with all respect lord stockheath was percy to mr ferris and the honorable frederick threepwood was freddie to mr judson but to ferris mr judsons freddie was the honorable frederick and to judson mr ferris percy was lord stockheath it was rather a pleasant form of etiquette and struck ashe as somehow vaguely feudal  percy went on mr ferris is bearing it like a little britonthe damages not having come out of his pocket its his old fatherwho had to pay themthats taking it to heart you might say hes doing himself proud he says its brought on his gout again and thats why hes gone to droitwich instead of coming here i dare say percy isnt sorry  it has been said mr beach summing up a most unfortunate occurrence the modern tendency of the lower classes to get above themselves is becoming more marked every day the young female in this case was i understand a barmaid it is deplorable that our young men should allow themselves to get into such entanglements  the wonder to me said the irrepressible mr judson is that more of these young chaps dont get put through it his lordship wasnt so wide of the mark when he spoke like that to freddie in the library that time i give you my word its a mercy young freddie hasnt been up against it when we were in london freddie and i he went on cutting through mr beachs disapproving cough before what you might call the crash when his lordship cut off supplies and had him come back and live here freddie was asking for itbelieve me fell in love with a girl in the chorus of one of the theaters used to send me to the stage door with notes and flowers every night for weeks as regular as clockwork  what was her name its on the tip of my tongue funny how you forget these things freddie was pretty far gone i recollect once happening to be looking round his room in his absence coming on a poem he had written to her it was hot stuffvery hot if that girl has kept those letters its my belief we shall see freddie following in lord stockheaths footsteps  there was a hush of delighted horror round the table  goo said miss chesters escort with unction you dont say so mr judson it wouldnt half make them look silly if the honorable frederick was sued for breach just now with the wedding coming on  there is no danger of that  it was joans voice and she had spoken with such decision that she had the ear of the table immediately all eyes looked in her direction ashe was struck with her expression her eyes were shining as though she were angry and there was a flush on her face a phrase he had used in the train came back to him she looked like a princess in disguise  what makes you say that miss simpson inquired judson annoyed he had been at pains to make the companys flesh creep and it appeared to be joans aim to undo his work  it seemed to ashe that joan made an effort of some sort as though she were pulling herself together and remembering where she was  well she said almost lamely i dont think it at all likely that he proposed marriage to this girl  you never can tell said judson my impression is that freddie did its my belief that theres something on his mind these days before he went to london with his lordship the other day he was behaving very strange and since he came back its my belief that he has been brooding and i happen to know he followed the affair of lord stockheath pretty closely for he clipped the clippings out of the paper i found them myself one day when i happened to be going through his things  beach cleared his throathis mode of indicating that he was about to monopolize the conversation  and in any case miss simpson he said solemnly with things come to the pass they have come to and the juriesdrawn from the lower classesin the nasty mood theyre in it dont seem hardly necessary in these affairs for there to have been any definite promise of marriage what with all this socialism rampant they seem so happy at the idea of being able to do one of us an injury that they give heavy damages without it a few ardent expressions and thats enough for them you recollect the havant case and when young lord mount anville was sued what it comes to is that anarchy is getting the upper hand and the lower classes are getting above themselves its all these here cheap newspapers that does it they tempt the lower classes to get above themselves  only this morning i had to speak severe to that young fellow james the footman he was a good young fellow once and did his work well and had a proper respect for people but now hes gone all to pieces and why because six months ago he had the rheumatism and had the audacity to send his picture and a testimonial saying that it had cured him of awful agonies to walkinshaws supreme ointment and they printed it in half a dozen papers and it has been the ruin of james he has got above himself and dont care for nobody  well all i can say is resumed judson that i hope to goodness nothing wont happen to freddie of that kind for its not every girl that would have him  there was a murmur of assent to this truth  now your miss peters said judson tolerantlyshe seems a nice little thing  she would be pleased to hear you say so said joan  joan valentine cried judson bringing his hands down on the tablecloth with a bang ive just remembered it that was the name of the girl freddie used to write the letters and poems to and thats who it is ive been trying all along to think you reminded me of miss simpson youre the living image of freddies miss joan valentine  ashe was not normally a young man of particularly ready wit but on this occasion it may have been that the shock of this revelation added to the fact that something must be done speedily if joans discomposure was not to become obvious to all present quickened his intelligence joan usually so sure of herself so ready of resource had gone temporarily to pieces she was quite white and her eyes met ashes with almost a hunted expression  if the attention of the company was to be diverted something drastic must be done a mere verbal attempt to change the conversation would be useless inspiration descended on ashe  in the days of his childhood in hayling massachusetts he had played truant from sunday school again and again in order to frequent the society of one eddie waffles the official bad boy of the locality it was not so much eddies charm of conversation which had attracted himthough that had been greatas the fact that eddie among his other accomplishments could give a lifelike imitation of two cats fighting in a back yard and ashe felt that he could never be happy until he had acquired this gift from the master  in course of time he had done so it might be that his absences from sunday school in the cause of art had left him in later years a trifle shaky on the subject of the kings of judah but his hardwon accomplishment had made him in request at every smoking concert at oxford and it saved the situation now  have you ever heard two cats fighting in a back yard he inquired casually of his neighbor miss willoughby  the next moment the performance was in full swing young master waffles who had devoted considerable study to his subject had conceived the combat of his imaginary cats in a broad almost homeric vein the unpleasantness opened with a low gurgling sound answered by another a shade louder and possibly more querulous a momentary silence was followed by a longdrawn note like rising wind cut off abruptly and succeeded by a grumbling mutter the response to this was a couple of sharp howls both parties to the contest then indulged in a discontented whining growing louder and louder until the air was full of electric menace and then after another sharp silence came war noisy and overwhelming  standing at master waffles side you could follow almost every movement of that intricate fray and mark how now one and now the other of the battlers gained a shortlived advantage it was a great fight shrewd blows were taken and given and in the eye of the imagination you could see the air thick with flying fur louder and louder grew the din and then at its height it ceased in one crescendo of tumult and all was still save for a faint angry moaning  such was the cat fight of master eddie waffles and ashe though falling short of the master as a pupil must rendered it faithfully and with energy  to say that the attention of the company was diverted from mr judson and his remarks by the extraordinary noises which proceeded from ashes lips would be to offer a mere shadowy suggestion of the sensation caused by his efforts at first stunned surprise then consternation greeted him beach the butler was staring as one watching a miracle nearer apparently to apoplexy than ever on the faces of the others every shade of emotion was to be seen  that this should be happening in the stewards room at blandings castle was scarcely less amazing than if it had taken place in a cathedral the upper servants rigid in their seats looked at each other like cortes soldierswith a wild surmise  the last faint moan of feline defiance died away and silence fell on the room ashe turned to miss willoughby  just like that he said i was telling miss willoughby he added apologetically to mrs twemlow about the cats in london they were a great trial  for perhaps three seconds his social reputation swayed to and fro in the balance while the company pondered on what he had done it was new but it was humorousor was it vulgar there is nothing the english upper servant so abhors as vulgarity that was what the stewards room was trying to make up its mind about  then miss willoughby threw her shapely head back and the squeal of her laughter smote the ceiling and at that the company made its decision everybody laughed everybody urged ashe to give an encore everybody was his friend and admirereverybody but beach the butler beach the butler was shocked to his very core his heavylidded eyes rested on ashe with disapproval it seemed to beach the butler that this young man marson had got above himself                                  ashe found joan at his side dinner was over and the diners were making for the housekeepers room  thank you mr marson that was very good of you and very clever her eyes twinkled but what a terrible chance you took you have made yourself a popular success but you might just as easily have become a social outcast as it is i am afraid mr beach did not approve  im afraid he didnt in a minute or so im going to fawn on him and make all well  joan lowered her voice  it was quite true what that odious little man said freddie threepwood did write me letters of course i destroyed them long ago  but werent you running the risk in coming here that he might recognize you wouldnt that make it rather unpleasant for you  i never met him you see he only wrote to me when he came to the station to meet us this evening he looked startled to see me so i suppose he remembers my appearance but aline will have told him that my name is simpson  that fellow judson said he was brooding i think you ought to put him out of his misery  mr judson must have been letting his imagination run away with him he is out of his misery he sent a horrid fat man named jones to see me in london about the letters and i told him i had destroyed them he must have let him know that by this time  i see  they went into the housekeepers room mr beach was standing before the fire ashe went up to him it was not an easy matter to mollify mr beach ashe tried the most tempting topics he mentioned swollen feethe dangled the lining of mr beachs stomach temptingly before his eyes but the butler was not to be softened only when ashe turned the conversation to the subject of the museum did a flicker of animation stir him  mr beach was fond and proud of the blandings castle museum it had been the means of getting him into print for the first and only time in his life a year before a representative of the intelligencer and echo from the neighboring town of blatchford had come to visit the castle on behalf of his paper and he had begun one section of his article with the words under the auspices of mr beach my genial cicerone i then visited his lordships museum mr beach treasured the clipping in a special writingdesk  he responded almost amiably to ashes questions yes he had seen the scarabhe pronounced it scayrubwhich mr peters had presented to his lordship he understood that his lordship thought very highly of mr peters scayrub he had overheard mr baxter telling his lordship that it was extremely valuable  mr beach said ashe i wonder whether you would take me to see lord emsworths museum  mr beach regarded him heavily  i shall be pleased to take you to see his lordships museum he replied                                  one can attribute only to the nervous mental condition following the interview he had had with ashe in his bedroom the rash act mr peters attempted shortly after dinner  mr peters shortly after dinner was in a dangerous and reckless mood he had had a wretched time all through the meal the blandings chef had extended himself in honor of the house party and had produced a succession of dishes which in happier days mr peters would have devoured eagerly to be compelled by considerations of health to pass these by was enough to damp the liveliest optimist mr peters had suffered terribly occasions of feasting and revelry like the present were for him so many battlefields on which greed fought with prudence  all through dinner he brooded on ashes defiance and the horrors which were to result from that defiance one of mr peters most painful memories was of a two weeks visit he had once paid to mr muldoon in his celebrated establishment at white plains he had been persuaded to go there by a brother millionaire whom until then he had always regarded as a friend the memory of mr muldoons cold shower baths and brisk system of physical exercise still lingered  the thought that under ashes rule he was to go through privately very much what he had gone through in the company of a gang of other unfortunates at muldoons froze him with horror he knew those health cranks who believed that all mortal ailments could be cured by cold showers and brisk walks they were all alike and they nearly killed you his worst nightmare was the one where he dreamed he was back at muldoons leading his horse up that endless hill outside the village  he would not stand it he would be hanged if hed stand it he would defy ashe but if he defied ashe ashe would go away and then whom could he find to recover his lost scarab  mr peters began to appreciate the true meaning of the phrase about the horns of a dilemma the horns of this dilemma occupied his attention until the end of the dinner he shifted uneasily from one to the other and back again he rose from the table in a thoroughly overwrought condition of mind and then somehow in the course of the evening he found himself alone in the hall not a dozen feet from the unlocked museum door  it was not immediately that he appreciated the significance of this fact he had come to the hall because its solitude suited his mood it was only after he had finished a cigarashe could not stop his smoking after dinnerthat it suddenly flashed on him that he had ready at hand a solution of all his troubles a brief minutes resolute action and the scarab would be his again and the menace of ashe a thing of the past he glanced about him yes he was alone  not once since the removal of the scarab had begun to exercise his mind had mr peters contemplated for an instant the possibility of recovering it himself the prospect of the unpleasantness that would ensue had been enough to make him regard such an action as out of the question the risk was too great to be considered for a moment but here he was in a position where the risk was negligible  like ashe he had always visualized the recovery of his scarab as a thing of the small hours a daring act to be performed when sleep held the castle in its grip that an opportunity would be presented to him of walking in quite calmly and walking out again with the cheops in his pocket had never occurred to him as a possibility  yet now this chance was presenting itself in all its simplicity and all he had to do was to grasp it the door of the museum was not even closed he could see from where he stood that it was ajar  he moved cautiously in its directionnot in a straight line as one going to a museum but circuitously as one strolling without an aim from time to time he glanced over his shoulder he reached the door hesitated and passed it he turned reached the door againand again passed it he stood for a moment darting his eyes about the hall then in a burst of resolution he dashed for the door and shot in like a rabbit  at the same moment the efficient baxter who from the shelter of a pillar on the gallery that ran around twothirds of the hall had been eyeing the peculiar movements of the distinguished guest with considerable interest for some minutes began to descend the stairs  rupert baxter the earl of emsworths indefatigable private secretary was one of those men whose chief characteristic is a vague suspicion of their fellow human beings he did not suspect them of this or that definite crime he simply suspected them he prowled through life as we are told the hosts of midian prowled  his powers in this respect were wellknown at blandings castle the earl of emsworth said baxter is invaluablepositively invaluable the honorable freddie said a chappie cant take a step in this bally house without stumbling over that damn feller baxter the manservant and the maidservant within the gates like miss willoughby employing that crisp gift for characterization which is the property of the english lower orders described him as a nosy parker  peering over the railing of the balcony and observing the curious movements of mr peters who as a matter of fact while making up his mind to approach the door had been backing and filling about the hall in a quaint serpentine manner like a man trying to invent a new variety of the tango the efficient baxter had found himself in some waywhy he did not knowof what he could not saybut in some nebulous way suspicious  he had not definitely accused mr peters in his mind of any specific tort or malfeasance he had merely felt that something fishy was toward he had a sixth sense in such matters  but when mr peters making up his mind leaped into the museum baxters suspicions lost their vagueness and became crystallized certainty descended on him like a bolt from the skies on oath before a notary the efficient baxter would have declared that j preston peters was about to try to purloin the scarab  lest we should seem to be attributing too miraculous powers of intuition to lord emsworths secretary it should be explained that the mystery which hung about that curio had exercised his mind not a little since his employer had given it to him to place in the museum he knew lord emsworths power of forgetting and he did not believe his account of the transaction scarab maniacs like mr peters did not give away specimens from their collections as presents but he had not divined the truth of what had happened in london  the conclusion at which he had arrived was that lord emsworth had bought the scarab and had forgotten all about it to support this theory was the fact that the latter had taken his check book to london with him baxters long acquaintance with the earl had left him with the conviction that there was no saying what he might not do if left loose in london with a check book  as to mr peters motive for entering the museum that too seemed completely clear to the secretary he was a curio enthusiast himself and he had served collectors in a secretarial capacity and he knew both from experience and observation that strange madness which may at any moment afflict the collector blotting out morality and the nice distinction between meum and tuum as with a sponge he knew that collectors who would not steal a loaf if they were starving mightand didfall before the temptation of a coveted curio  he descended the stairs three at a time and entered the museum at the very instant when mr peters twitching fingers were about to close on his treasure he handled the delicate situation with eminent tact mr peters at the sound of his step had executed a backward leap which was as good as a confession of guilt and his face was rigid with dismay but the efficient baxter pretended not to notice these phenomena his manner when he spoke was easy and unembarrassed  ah taking a look at our little collection mr peters you will see that we have given the place of honor to your cheops it is certainly a fine specimena wonderfully fine specimen  mr peters was recovering slowly baxter talked on to give him time he spoke of mut and bubastis of ammon and the book of the dead he directed the others attention to the roman coins  he was touching on some aspects of the princess gilukhipa of mitanni in whom his hearer could scarcely fail to be interested when the door opened and beach the butler came in accompanied by ashe in the bustle of the interruption mr peters escaped glad to be elsewhere and questioning for the first time in his life the dictum that if you want a thing well done you must do it yourself  i was not aware sir said beach the butler that you were in occupation of the museum i would not have intruded but this young man expressed a desire to examine the exhibits and i took the liberty of conducting him  come in beachcome in said baxter  the light fell on ashes face and he recognized him as the cheerful young man who had inquired the way to mr peters room before dinner and who he had by this time discovered was not the honorable freddies friend george emersonor indeed any other of the guests of the house he felt suspicious  oh beach  sir  just a moment  he drew the butler into the hall out of earshot  beach who is that man  mr peters valet sir  mr peters valet  yes sir  has he been in service long asked baxter remembering that a mere menial had addressed him as old man  beach lowered his voice he and the efficient baxter were old allies and it seemed right to beach to confide in him  he has only just joined mr peters sir and he has never been in service before he told me so himself and i was unable to elicit from him any information as to his antecedents his manner struck me sir as peculiar it crossed my mind to wonder whether mr peters happened to be aware of this i should dislike to do any young man an injury but it might be anyone coming to a gentleman without a character like this young man mr peters might have been deceived sir  the efficient baxters manner became distraught his mind was working rapidly  should he be informed sir  eh who  mr peters sirin case he should have been deceived  no no mr peters knows his own business  far from me be it to appear officious sir but  mr peters probably knows all about him tell me beach who was it suggested this visit to the museum did you  it was at the young mans express desire that i conducted him sir  the efficient baxter returned to the museum without a word ashe standing in the middle of the room was impressing the topography of the place on his memory he was unaware of the piercing stare of suspicion that was being directed at him from behind  he did not see baxter he was not even thinking of baxter but baxter was on the alert baxter was on the warpath baxter knew    chapter vi  among the compensations of advancing age is a wholesome pessimism which though it takes the fine edge off of whatever triumphs may come to us has the admirable effect of preventing fate from working off on us any of those gold bricks coins with strings attached and unhatched chickens at which ardent youth snatches with such enthusiasm to its subsequent disappointment as we emerge from the twenties we grow into a habit of mind that looks askance at fate bearing gifts we miss perhaps the occasional prize but we also avoid leaping lightheartedly into traps  ashe marson had yet to reach the age of tranquil mistrust and when fate seemed to be treating him kindly he was still young enough to accept such kindnesses on their face value and rejoice at them  as he sat on his bed at the end of his first night in castle blandings he was conscious to a remarkable degree that fortune was treating him well he had survivednot merely without discredit but with positive triumphthe initiatory plunge into the etiquette maelstrom of life below stairs so far from doing the wrong thing and drawing down on himself the just scorn of the stewards room he had been the life and soul of the party even if tomorrow in an absentminded fit he should anticipate the groom of the chambers in the march to the table he would be forgiven for the humorist has his privileges  so much for that but that was only a part of fortunes kindnesses to have discovered on the first day of their association the correct method of handling and reducing to subjection his irascible employer was an even greater boon a prolonged association with mr peters on the lines in which their acquaintance had begun would have been extremely trying now by virtue of a fortunate stand at the outset he had spiked the millionaires guns  thirdly and most important of all he had not only made himself familiar with the locality and surroundings of the scarab but he had seen beyond the possibility of doubt that the removal of it and the earning of the five thousand dollars would be the simplest possible task already he was spending the money in his mind and to such lengths had optimism led him that as he sat on his bed reviewing the events of the day his only doubt was whether to get the scarab at once or to let it remain where it was until he had the opportunity of doing mr peters interior good on the lines he had mapped out in their conversation for of course directly he had restored the scarab to its rightful owner and pocketed the reward his position as healer and trainer to the millionaire would cease automatically  he was sorry for that because it troubled him to think that a sick man would not be made well but on the whole looking at it from every aspect it would be best to get the scarab as soon as possible and leave mr peters digestion to look after itself being twentysix and an optimist he had no suspicion that fate might be playing with him that fate might have unpleasant surprises in store that fate even now was preparing to smite him in his hour of joy with that powerful weapon the efficient baxter  he looked at his watch it was five minutes to one he had no idea whether they kept early hours at blandings castle or not but he deemed it prudent to give the household another hour in which to settle down after which he would just trot down and collect the scarab  the novel he had brought down with him from london fortunately proved interesting two oclock came before he was ready for it he slipped the book into his pocket and opened the door  all was stillstill and uncommonly dark along the corridor on which his room was situated the snores of sleeping domestics exploded growled and twittered in the air every menial on the list seemed to be snoring some in one key some in another some defiantly some plaintively but the main fact was that they were all snoring somehow thus intimating that so far as this side of the house was concerned the coast might be considered clear and interruption of his plans a negligible risk  researches made at an earlier hour had familiarized him with the geography of the place he found his way to the greenbaize door without difficulty and stepping through was in the hall where the remains of the log fire still glowed a fitful red this however was the only illumination and it was fortunate that he did not require light to guide him to the museum  he knew the direction and had measured the distance it was precisely seventeen steps from where he stood cautiously and with avoidance of noise he began to make the seventeen steps  he was beginning the eleventh when he bumped into somebody somebody softsomebody whose hand as it touched his felt small and feminine  the fragment of a log fell on the ashes and the fire gave a dying spurt darkness succeeded the sudden glow the fire was out that little flame had been its last effort before expiring but it had been enough to enable him to recognize joan valentine  good lord he gasped  his astonishment was shortlived next moment the only thing that surprised him was the fact that he was not more surprised there was something about this girl that made the most bizarre happenings seem right and natural ever since he had met her his life had changed from an orderly succession of uninteresting days to a strange carnival of the unexpected and use was accustoming him to it life had taken on the quality of a dream in which anything might happen and in which everything that did happen was to be accepted with the calmness natural in dreams  it was strange that she should be here in the pitchdark hall in the middle of the night butafter allno stranger than that he should be in this dream world in which he now moved it had to be taken for granted that people did all sorts of odd things from all sorts of odd motives  hello he said  dont be alarmed  no no  i think we are both here for the same reason  you dont mean to say  yes i have come here to earn the five thousand dollars too mr marson we are rivals  in his present frame of mind it seemed so simple and intelligible to ashe that he wondered whether he was really hearing it the first time he had an odd feeling that he had known this all along  you are here to get the scarab  exactly  ashe was dimly conscious of some objection to this but at first it eluded him then he pinned it down  but you arent a young man of good appearance he said  i dont know what you mean but aline peters is an old friend of mine she told me her father would give a large reward to whoever recovered the scarab so i  look out whispered ashe run theres somebody coming  there was a soft footfall on the stairs a click and above ashes head a light flashed out he looked round he was alone and the greenbaize door was swaying gently to and fro  whos that whos there said a voice  the efficient baxter was coming down the broad staircase  a general suspicion of mankind and a definite and particular suspicion of one individual made a bad opiate for over an hour sleep had avoided the efficient baxter with an unconquerable coyness he had tried all the known ways of wooing slumber but they had failed him from the counting of sheep downward the events of the night had whipped his mind to a restless activity try as he might to lose consciousness the recollection of the plot he had discovered surged up and kept him wakeful  it is the penalty of the suspicious type of mind that it suffers from its own activity from the moment he detected mr peters in the act of rifling the museum and marked down ashe as an accomplice baxters repose was doomed nor poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy sirups of the world could ever medicine him to that sweet sleep which he owed yesterday  but it was the recollection that on previous occasions of wakefulness hot whisky and water had done the trick which had now brought him from his bed and downstairs his objective was the decanter on the table of the smokingroom which was one of the rooms opening on the gallery that looked down on the hall hot water he could achieve in his bedroom by means of his stove  so out of bed he had climbed and downstairs he had come and here he was to all appearances just in time to foil the very plot on which he had been brooding mr peters might be in bed but there in the hall below him stood the accomplice not ten paces from the museums door he arrived on the spot at racing speed and confronted ashe  what are you doing here  and then from the baxter viewpoint things began to go wrong by all the rules of the game ashe caught as it were redhanded should have wilted stammered and confessed all but ashe was fortified by that philosophic calm which comes to us in dreams and moreover he had his story ready  mr peters rang for me sir  he had never expected to feel grateful to the little firebrand who employed him but he had to admit that the millionaire in their late conversation had shown forethought the thought struck him that but for mr peters advice he might by now be in an extremely awkward position for his was not a swiftly inventive mind  rang for you at halfpast two in the morning  to read to him sir  to read to him at this hour  mr peters suffers from insomnia sir he has a weak digestion and pain sometimes prevents him from sleeping the lining of his stomach is not at all what it should be  i dont believe a word of it  with that meekness which makes the good man wronged so impressive a spectacle ashe produced and exhibited his novel  here is the book i am about to read to him i think sir if you will excuse me i had better be going to his room good night sir  he proceeded to mount the stairs he was sorry for mr peters so shortly about to be roused from a refreshing slumber but these were lifes tragedies and must be borne bravely  the efficient baxter dogged him the whole way sprinting silently in his wake and dodging into the shadows whenever the light of an occasional electric bulb made it inadvisable to keep to the open then abruptly he gave up the pursuit for the first time his comparative impotence in this silent conflict on which he had embarked was made manifest to him and he perceived that on mere suspicion however strong he could do nothing to accuse mr peters of theft or to accuse him of being accessory to a theft was out of the question  yet his whole being revolted at the thought of allowing the sanctity of the museum to be violated officially its contents belonged to lord emsworth but ever since his connection with the castle he had been put in charge of them and he had come to look on them as his own property if he was only a collector by proxy he had nevertheless the collectors devotion to his curios beside which the lioness attachment to her cubs is tepid and he was prepared to do anything to retain in his possession a scarab toward which he already entertained the feelings of a life proprietor  nonot quite anything he stopped short at the idea of causing unpleasantness between the father of the honorable freddie and the father of the honorable freddies fiancee his secretarial position at the castle was a valuable one and he was loath to jeopardize it  there was only one way in which this delicate affair could be brought to a satisfactory conclusion it was obvious from what he had seen that night that mr peters connection with the attempt on the scarab was to be merely sympathetic and that the actual theft was to be accomplished by ashe his only course therefore was to catch ashe actually in the museum then mr peters need not appear in the matter at all mr peters position in those circumstances would be simply that of a man who had happened to employ through no fault of his own a valet who happened to be a thief  he had made a mistake he perceived in locking the door of the museum in future he must leave it open as a trap is open and he must stay up nights and keep watch with these reflections the efficient baxter returned to his room  meantime ashe had entered mr peters bedroom and switched on the light mr peters who had just succeeded in dropping off to sleep sat up with a start  ive come to read to you said ashe  mr peters emitted a stifled howl in which wrath and selfpity were nicely blended  you fool dont you know i have just managed to get to sleep  and now youre awake again said ashe soothingly such is life a little rest a little folding of the hands in sleep and then bingoff we go again i hope you will like this novel i dipped into it and it seems good  what do you mean by coming in here at this time of night are you crazy  it was your suggestion and by the way i must thank you for it i apologize for calling it thin it worked like a charm i dont think he believed itin fact i know he didnt but it held him i couldnt have thought up anything half so good in an emergency  mr peters wrath changed to excitement  did you get it have you been after mymy cheops  i have been after your cheops but i didnt get it bad men were abroad that fellow with the spectacles who was in the museum when i met you there this evening swooped down from nowhere and i had to tell him that you had rung for me to read to you fortunately i had this novel on me i think he followed me upstairs to see whether i really did come to your room  mr peters groaned miserably  baxter he said hes a man named baxterlord emsworths private secretary and he suspects us hes the man wei mean youhave got to look out for  well never mind lets be happy while we can make yourself comfortable and ill start reading after all what could be pleasanter than a little literature in the small hours shall i begin                                  ashe marson found joan valentine in the stable yard after breakfast the next morning playing with a retriever puppy will you spare me a moment of your valuable time  certainly mr marson  shall we walk out into the open somewherewhere we cant be overheard  perhaps it would be better  they moved off  request your canine friend to withdraw said ashe he prevents me from marshaling my thoughts  im afraid he wont withdraw  never mind ill do my best in spite of him tell me was i dreaming or did i really meet you in the hall this morning at about twenty minutes after two  you did  and did you really tell me that you had come to the castle to steal  recover  recover mr peters scarab  i did  then its true  it is  ashe scraped the ground with a meditative toe  this he said seems to me to complicate matters somewhat  it complicates them abominably  i suppose you were surprised when you found that i was on the same game as yourself  not in the least  you werent  i knew it directly i saw the advertisement in the morning post and i hunted up the morning post directly you had told me that you had become mr peters valet  you have known all along  i have  ashe regarded her admiringly  youre wonderful  because i saw through you  partly that but chiefly because you had the pluck to undertake a thing like this  you undertook it  but im a man  and im a woman and my theory mr marson is that a woman can do nearly everything better than a man what a splendid test case this would make to settle the votesforwomen question once and for all here we areyou and ia man and a woman each trying for the same thing and each starting with equal chances suppose i beat you how about the inferiority of women then  i never said women were inferior  you did with your eyes  besides youre an exceptional woman  you cant get out of it with a compliment im an ordinary woman and im going to beat a real man  ashe frowned  i dont like to think of ourselves as working against each other  why not  because i like you  i like you mr marson but we must not let sentiment interfere with business you want mr peters five thousand dollars so do i  i hate the thought of being the instrument to prevent you from getting the money  you wont be i shall be the instrument to prevent you from getting it i dont like that thought either but one has got to face it  it makes me feel mean  thats simply your oldfashioned masculine attitude toward the female mr marson you look on woman as a weak creature to be shielded and petted we arent anything of the sort were terrors were as hard as nails were awful creatures you mustnt let my sex interfere with your trying to get this reward think of me as though i were another man were up against each other in a fair fight and i dont want any special privileges if you dont do your best from now onward i shall never forgive you do you understand  i suppose so  and we shall need to do our best that little man with the glasses is on his guard i was listening to you last night from behind the door by the way you shouldnt have told me to run away and then have stayed yourself to be caught that is an example of the sort of thing i mean it was chivalrynot business  i had a story ready to account for my being there you had not  and what a capital story it was i shall borrow it for my own use if i am caught i shall say i had to read aline to sleep because she suffers from insomnia and i shouldnt wonder if she didpoor girl she doesnt get enough to eat she is being starvedpoor child i heard one of the footmen say that she refused everything at dinner last night and though she vows it isnt my belief is that its all because she is afraid to make a stand against her old father its a shame  she is a weak creature to be shielded and petted said ashe solemnly  joan laughed  well yes you caught me there i admit that poor aline is not a shining example of the formidable modern woman but she stopped oh bother ive just thought of what i ought to have saidthe good repartee that would have crushed you i suppose its too late now  not at all im like that myselfonly it is generally the next day when i hit the right answer shall we go back    she is a weak creature to be shielded and petted  thank you so much said joan gratefully and why is she a weak creature because she has allowed herself to be shielded and petted because she has permitted man to give her special privileges and generallyno it isnt so good as i thought it was going to be  it should be crisper said ashe critically it lacks the punch  but it brings me back to my point which is that i am not going to imitate her and forfeit my independence of action in return for chivalry try to look at it from my point of view mr marson i know you need the money just as much as i do well dont you think i should feel a little mean if i thought you were not trying your hardest to get it simply because you didnt think it would be fair to try your hardest against a woman that would cripple me i should not feel as though i had the right to do anything its too important a matter for you to treat me like a child and let me win to avoid disappointing me i want the money but i dont want it handed to me  believe me said ashe earnestly it will not be handed to you i have studied the baxter question more deeply than you have and i can assure you that baxter is a menace what has put him so firmly on the right scent i dont know but he seems to have divined the exact state of affairs in its entiretyso far as i am concerned that is to say of course he has no idea you are mixed up in the business but i am afraid his suspicion of me will hit you as well what i mean is that for some time to come i fancy that man proposes to camp out on the rug in front of the museum door it would be madness for either of us to attempt to go there at present  it is being made very hard for us isnt it and i thought it was going to be so simple  i think we should give him at least a week to simmer down  fully that  let us look on the bright side we are in no hurry blandings castle is quite as comfortable as number seven arundell street and the commissariat department is a revelation to me i had no idea english servants did themselves so well and as for the social side i love it i revel in it for the first time in my life i feel as though i am somebody did you observe my manner toward the kitchen maid who waited on us at dinner last night a touch of the old noblesse about it i fancy dignified but not unkind i think and i can keep it up so far as i am concerned let this life continue indefinitely  but what about mr peters dont you think there is danger he may change his mind about that five thousand dollars if we keep him waiting too long  not a chance of it being almost within touch of the scarab has had the worst effect on him it has intensified the craving by the way have you seen the scarab  yes i got mrs twemlow to take me to the museum while you were talking to the butler it was dreadful to feel that it was lying there in the open waiting for somebody to take it and not be able to do anything  i felt exactly the same it isnt much to look at is it if it hadnt been for the label i wouldnt have believed it was the thing for which peters was offering five thousand dollars reward but thats his affair a thing is worth what somebody will give for it ours not to reason why ours but to elude baxter and gather it in  ours indeed you speak as though we were partners instead of rivals  ashe uttered an exclamation youve hit it why not why any cutthroat competition why shouldnt we form a company it would solve everything  joan looked thoughtful  you mean divide the reward  exactlyinto two equal parts  and the labor  the labor  how shall we divide that  ashe hesitated  my idea he said was that i should do what i might call the rough work and  you mean you should do the actual taking of the scarab  exactly i would look after that end of it  and what would my duties be  well youyou would as it werehow shall i put it you would so to speak lend moral support  by lying snugly in bed fast asleep  ashe avoided her eye  well yesersomething on those lines  while you ran all the risks  no no the risks are practically nonexistent  i thought you said just now that it would be madness for either of us to attempt to go to the museum at present joan laughed it wont do mr marson you remind me of an old cat i once had whenever he killed a mouse he would bring it into the drawingroom and lay it affectionately at my feet i would reject the corpse with horror and turn him out but back he would come with his loathsome gift i simply couldnt make him understand that he was not doing me a kindness he thought highly of his mouse and it was beyond him to realize that i did not want it  you are just the same with your chivalry its very kind of you to keep offering me your dead mouse but honestly i have no use for it i wont take favors just because i happen to be a female if we are going to form this partnership i insist on doing my fair share of the work and running my fair share of the risksthe practically nonexistent risks  youre veryresolute  say pigheaded i shant mind certainly i am a girl has got to be even nowadays if she wants to play fair listen mr marson i will not have the dead mouse i do not like dead mice if you attempt to work off your dead mouse on me this partnership ceases before it has begun if we are to work together we are going to make alternate attempts to get the scarab no other arrangement will satisfy me  then i claim the right to make the first one  you dont do anything of the sort we toss up for first chance like little ladies and gentlemen have you a coin i will spin and you call  ashe made a last stand  this is perfectly  mr marson  ashe gave in he produced a coin and handed it to her gloomily  under protest he said  head or tail said joan unmoved  ashe watched the coin gyrating in the sunshine  tail he cried  the coin stopped rolling  tail it is said joan what a nuisance well never mind ill get my chance if you fail  i shant fail said ashe fervently if i have to pull the museum down i wont fail thank heaven theres no chance now of your doing anything foolish  dont be too sure well good luck mr marson  thank you partner  they shook hands  as they parted at the door joan made one further remark theres just one thing mr marson  yes  if i could have accepted the mouse from anyone i should certainly have accepted it from you    chapter vii  it is worthy of record in the light of after events that at the beginning of their visit it was the general opinion of the guests gathered together at blandings castle that the place was dull the house party had that air of torpor which one sees in the saloon passengers of an atlantic linerthat appearance of resignation to an enforced idleness and a monotony to be broken only by meals lord emsworths guests gave the impression collectively of being just about to yawn and look at their watches  this was partly the fault of the time of year for most house parties are dull if they happen to fall between the hunting and the shooting seasons but must be attributed chiefly to lord emsworths extremely sketchy notions of the duties of a host  a host has no right to interne a regiment of his relations in his house unless he also invites lively and agreeable outsiders to meet them if he does commit this solecism the least he can do is to work himself to the bone in the effort to invent amusements and diversions for his victims lord emsworth had failed badly in both these matters with the exception of mr peters his daughter aline and george emerson there was nobody in the house who did not belong to the clan and as for his exerting himself to entertain the company was lucky if it caught a glimpse of its host at meals  lord emsworth belonged to the peoplewholiketobeleftalone toamusethemselveswhentheycometoaplace school of hosts he pottered about the garden in an old coatnow uprooting a weed now wrangling with the autocrat from scotland who was theoretically in his service as head gardenerdreamily satisfied when he thought of them at all that his guests were as perfectly happy as he was  apart from his son freddie whom he had long since dismissed as a youth of abnormal tastes from whom nothing reasonable was to be expected he could not imagine anyone not being content merely to be at blandings when the buds were bursting on the trees  a resolute hostess might have saved the situation but lady ann warblingtons abilities in that direction stopped short at leaving everything to mrs twemlow and writing letters in her bedroom when lady ann warblington was not writing letters in her bedroomwhich was seldom for she had an apparently inexhaustible correspondenceshe was nursing sick headaches in it she was one of those hostesses whom a guest never sees except when he goes into the library and espies the tail of her skirt vanishing through the other door  as for the ordinary recreations of the country house the guests could frequent the billiard room where they were sure to find lord stockheath playing a hundred up with his cousin algernon woostera spectacle of the liveliest interestor they could if fond of golf console themselves for the absence of links in the neighborhood with the exhilarating pastime of clock golf or they could stroll about the terraces with such of their relations as they happened to be on speaking terms with at the moment and abuse their host and the rest of their relations  this was the favorite amusement and after breakfast on a morning ten days after joan and ashe had formed their compact the terraces were full of perambulating couples here colonel horace mant walking with the bishop of godalming was soothing that dignitary by clothing in soldierly words thoughts that the latter had not been able to crush down but which his holy office scarcely permitted him to utter  there lady mildred mant linked to mrs jack hale of the collateral branch of the family was saying things about her father in his capacity of host and entertainer that were making her companion feel like another woman farther on stopping occasionally to gesticulate could be seen other emsworth relations and connections it was a typical scene of quiet peaceful english family life  leaning on the broad stone balustrade of the upper terrace aline peters and george emerson surveyed the malcontents aline gave a little sigh almost inaudible but georges hearing was good  i was wondering when you are going to admit it he said shifting his position so that he faced her  admit what  that you cant stand the prospect that the idea of being stuck for life with this crowd like a fly on fly paper is too much for you that you are ready to break off your engagement to freddie and come away and marry me and live happily ever after  george  well wasnt that what it meant be honest  what what meant  that sigh  i didnt sigh i was just breathing  then you can breathe in this atmosphere you surprise me he raked the terraces with hostile eyes look at them look at themcrawling round like doped beetles my dear girl its no use your pretending that this sort of thing wouldnt kill you youre pining away already youre thinner and paler since you came here gee how we shall look back at this and thank our stars that were out of it when were back in old new york with the elevated rattling and the street cars squealing over the points and something doing every step you take i shall call you on the phone from the office and have you meet me down town somewhere and well have a bite to eat and go to some show and a bit of supper afterward and a dance or two and then go home to our cozy  george you mustntreally  why mustnt i  its wrong you cant talk like that when we are both enjoying the hospitality  a wild laugh almost a howl disturbed the talk of the most adjacent of the perambulating relations colonel horace mant checked in midsentence looked up resentfully at the cause of the interruption  i wish somebody would tell me whether its that american fellow emerson or young freddie whos supposed to be engaged to miss peters hanged if you ever see her and freddie together but she and emerson are never to be found apart if my respected fatherinlaw had any sense i should have thought he would have had sense enough to stop that  you forget my dear horace said the bishop charitably miss peters and mr emerson have known each other since they were children  they were never nearly such children as emsworth is now snorted the colonel if that girl isnt in love with emerson ill beill eat my hat  no no said the bishop no no surely not horace what were you saying when you broke off  i was saying that if a man wanted his relations never to speak to each other again for the rest of their lives the best thing he could do would be to herd them all together in a dashed barrack of a house a hundred miles from anywhere and then go off and spend all his time prodding dashed flower beds with a spuddash it  just so just so so you were go on horace i find a curious comfort in your words  on the terrace above them aline was looking at george with startled eyes  george  im sorry but you shouldnt spring these jokes on me so suddenly you said enjoying yesreveling in it arent we  its a lovely old place said aline defensively  and when youve said that youve said everything you cant live on scenery and architecture for the rest of your life theres the human element to be thought of and youre beginning  there goes father interrupted aline how fast he is walking george have you noticed a sort of difference in father these last few days  i havent my specialty is keeping an eye on the rest of the peters family  he seems better somehow he seems to have almost stopped smokingand im very glad for those cigars were awfully bad for him the doctor expressly told him he must stop them but he wouldnt pay any attention to him and he seems to take so much more exercise my bedroom is next to his you know and every morning i can hear things going on through the wallfather dancing about and puffing a good deal and one morning i met his valet going in with a pair of indian clubs i believe father is really taking himself in hand at last  george emerson exploded  and about time too how much longer are you to go on starving yourself to death just to give him the resolution to stick to his dieting it maddens me to see you at dinner and its killing you youre getting pale and thin you cant go on like this  a wistful look came over alines face  i do get a little hungry sometimeslate at night generally  you want somebody to take care of you and look after you im the man you may think you can fool me but i can tell youre weakening on this freddie proposition youre beginning to see that it wont do one of these days youre going to come to me and say george you were right i take the count me for the quiet sneak to the station without anybody knowing and the break for london and the wedding at the registrars oh i know i couldnt have loved you all this time and not know youre weakening  the trouble with these supermen is that they lack reticence they do not know how to omit they expand their chests and whoop and a girl even the mildest and sweetest of girlseven a girl like aline peterscannot help resenting the note of triumph but supermen despise tact as far as one can gather that is the chief difference between them and the ordinary man  a little frown appeared on alines forehead and she set her mouth mutinously  im not weakening at all she said and her voice wasfor herquite acid youyou take too much for granted  george was contemplating the landscape with a conquerors eye  you are beginning to see that it is impossiblethis freddie foolishness  it is not foolishness said aline pettishly tears of annoyance in her eyes and i wish you wouldnt call him freddie  he asked me to he asked me to  aline stamped her foot  well never mind please dont do it  very well little girl said george softly i wouldnt do anything to hurt you  the fact that it never even occurred to george emerson he was being offensively patronizing shows the stern stuff of which these supermen are made                                  the efficient baxter bicycled broodingly to market blandings for tobacco he brooded for several reasons he had just seen aline peters and george emerson in confidential talk on the upper terrace and that was one thing which exercised his mind for he suspected george emerson he suspected him nebulously as a snake in the grass as an influence working against the orderly progress of events concerning the marriage that had been arranged and would shortly take place between miss peters and the honorable frederick threepwood  it would be too much to say that he had any idea that george was putting in such hard and consistent work in his serpentine role indeed if he could have overheard the conversation just recorded it is probable that rupert baxter would have had heart failure but he had observed the intimacy between the two as he observed most things in his immediate neighborhood and he disapproved of it it was all very well to say that george emerson had known aline peters since she was a child if that was so then in the opinion of the efficient baxter he had known her quite long enough and ought to start making the acquaintance of somebody else  he blamed the honorable freddie if the honorable freddie had been a more ardent lover he would have spent his time with aline and george emerson would have taken his proper place as one of the crowd at the back of the stage but freddies view of the matter seemed to be that he had done all that could be expected of a chappie in getting engaged to the girl and that now he might consider himself at liberty to drop her for a while  so baxter as he bicycled to market blandings for tobacco brooded on freddie aline peters and george emerson he also brooded on mr peters and ashe marson finally he brooded in a general way because he had had very little sleep the past week  the spectacle of a young man doing his duty and enduring considerable discomforts while doing it is painful but there is such uplift in it it affords so excellent a moral picture that i cannot omit a short description of the manner in which rupert baxter had spent the nights which had elapsed since his meeting with ashe in the small hours in the hall  in the gallery which ran above the hall there was a large chair situated a few paces from the great staircase on this in an overcoatfor the nights were chillyand rubbersoled shoes the efficient baxter had sat without missing a single night from one in the morning until daybreak waiting waiting waiting it had been an ordeal to try the stoutest determination nature had never intended baxter for a night bird he loved his bed he knew that doctors held that insufficient sleep made a man pale and sallow and he had always aimed at the peachbloom complexion which comes from a sensible eight hours between the sheets  one of the king georges of englandi forget whichonce said that a certain number of hours sleep each nighti cannot recall at the moment how manymade a man something which for the time being has slipped my memory baxter agreed with him it went against all his instincts to sit up in this fashion but it was his duty and he did it  it troubled him that as night after night went by and ashe the suspect did not walk into the trap so carefully laid for him he found an increasing difficulty in keeping awake the first two or three of his series of vigils he had passed in an unimpeachable wakefulness his chin resting on the rail of the gallery and his ears alert for the slightest sound but he had not been able to maintain this standard of excellence  on several occasions he had caught himself in the act of dropping off and the last night he had actually wakened with a start to find it quite light as his last recollection before that was of an inky darkness impenetrable to the eye dismay gripped him with a sudden clutch and he ran swiftly down to the museum his relief on finding that the scarab was still there had been tempered by thoughts of what might have been  baxter then as he bicycled to market blandings for tobacco had good reason to brood having bought his tobacco and observed the life and thought of the town for half an hourit was market day and the normal stagnation of the place was temporarily relieved and brightened by pigs that eluded their keepers and a bull calf which caught a stout farmer at the psychological moment when he was tying his shoe lace and lifted him six feethe made his way to the emsworth arms the most respectable of the eleven inns the citizens of market blandings contrived in some miraculous way to support  in english country towns if the public houses do not actually outnumber the inhabitants they all do an excellent trade it is only when they are two to one that hard times hit them and set the innkeepers to blaming the government  it was not the busy bar full to overflowing with honest british yeomenmany of them in a similar conditionthat baxter sought his goal was the genteel diningroom on the first floor where a bald and shuffling waiter own cousin to a tortoise served luncheon to those desiring it lack of sleep had reduced baxter to a condition where the presence and chatter of the house party were insupportable it was his purpose to lunch at the emsworth arms and take a nap in an armchair afterward  he had relied on having the room to himself for market blandings did not lunch to a great extent but to his annoyance and disappointment the room was already occupied by a man in brown tweeds  occupied is the correct word for at first sight this man seemed to fill the room never since almost forgotten days when he used to frequent circuses and side shows had baxter seen a fellow human being so extraordinarily obese he was a man about fifty years old grayhaired of a mauve complexion and his general appearance suggested joviality  to baxters chagrin this person engaged him in conversation directly he took his seat at the table there was only one table in the room as is customary in english inns and it had the disadvantage that it collected those seated at it into one party it was impossible for baxter to withdraw into himself and ignore this persons advances  it is doubtful whether he could have done it however had they been separated by yards of floor for the fat man was not only naturally talkative but as appeared from his opening remarks speech had been dammed up within him for some time by lack of a suitable victim  morning he began nice day good for the farmers ill move up to your end of the table if i may sir waiter bring my beef to this gentlemans end of the table  he creaked into a chair at baxters side and resumed  infernally quiet place this sir i havent found a soul to speak to since i arrived yesterday afternoon except deafanddumb rustics are you making a long stay here  i live outside the town  i pity you wouldnt care to do it myself had to come here on business and shant be sorry when its finished i give you my word i couldnt sleep a wink last night because of the quiet i was just dropping off when a beast of a bird outside the window gave a chirrup and it brought me up with a jerk as though somebody had fired a gun theres a damned cat somewhere near my room that mews i lie in bed waiting for the next mew all worked up  heaven save me from the country it may be all right for you if youve got a comfortable home and a pal or two to chat with after dinner but youve no conception what its like in this infernal towni suppose it calls itself a town what a hole theres a church down the street im told its norman or something anyway its old im not much of a man for churches as a rule but i went and took a look at it  then somebody told me there was a fine view from the end of high street so i went and took a look at that and now so far as i can make out ive done the sights and exhausted every possibility of entertainment the town has to provideunless theres another church im so reduced that ill go and see the methodist chapel if there is one  fresh air want of sleep and the closeness of the diningroom combined to make baxter drowsy he ate his lunch in a torpor hardly replying to his companions remarks who for his part did not seem to wish or to expect replies it was enough for him to be talking  what do people do with themselves in a place like this when they want amusement i mean i suppose its different if youve been brought up to it like being born colorblind or something you dont notice its the visitor who suffers theyve no enterprise in this sort of place theres a bit of land just outside here that would make a sweet steeplechase course natural barriers everything it hasnt occurred to em to do anything with it it makes you despair of your speciesthat sort of thing now if i  baxter dozed with his fork still impaling a piece of cold beef he dropped into that halfawake halfasleep state which is natures daytime substitute for the true slumber of the night the fat man either not noticing or not caring talked on his voice was a steady drone lulling baxter to rest  suddenly there was a break baxter sat up blinking he had a curious impression that his companion had said hello freddie and that the door had just opened and closed  eh he said  yes said the fat man  what did you say  i was speaking of  i thought you said hello freddie  his companion eyed him indulgently  i thought you were dropping off when i looked at you youve been dreaming what should i say hello freddie for  the conundrum was unanswerable baxter did not attempt to answer it but there remained at the back of his mind a quaint idea that he had caught sight as he woke of the honorable frederick threepwood his face warningly contorted vanishing through the doorway yet what could the honorable freddie be doing at the emsworth arms  a solution of the difficulty occurred to him he had dreamed he had seen freddie and that had suggested the words which reason pointed out his companion could hardly have spoken even if the honorable freddie should enter the room this fat man who was apparently a drummer of some kind would certainly not know who he was nor would he address him so familiarly  yes that must be the explanation after all the quaintest things happened in dreams last night when he had fallen asleep in his chair he had dreamed that he was sitting in a glass case in the museum making faces at lord emsworth mr peters and beach the butler who were trying to steal him under the impression that he was a scarab of the reign of cheops of the fourth dynastya thing he would never have done when awake yes he must certainly have been dreaming  in the bedroom into which he had dashed to hide himself on discovering that the diningroom was in possession of the efficient baxter the honorable freddie sat on a rickety chair scowling he elaborated a favorite dictum of his  you cant take a step anywhere without stumbling over that damn feller baxter  he wondered whether baxter had seen him he wondered whether baxter had recognized him he wondered whether baxter had heard r jones say hello freddie  he wondered if such should be the case whether r jones presence of mind and native resource had been equal to explaining away the remark    chapter viii  put the butter or drippings in a kettle on the range and when hot add the onions and fry them add the veal and cook until brown add the water cover closely and cook very slowly until the meat is tender then add the seasoning and place the potatoes on top of the meat cover and cook until the potatoes are tender but not falling to pieces  sure said mr petersnot falling to pieces thats right go on  then add the cream and cook five minutes longer read ashe  is that all  thats all of that one  mr peters settled himself more comfortably in bed  read me the piece where it tells about curried lobster  ashe cleared his throat  curried lobster he read materials two onepound lobsters two teaspoonfuls lemon juice half a spoonful curry powder two tablespoonfuls butter a tablespoonful flour one cupful scalded milk one cupful cracker crumbs half teaspoonful salt quarter teaspoonful pepper  go on  way of preparing cream the butter and flour and add the scalded milk then add the lemon juice curry powder salt and pepper remove the lobster meat from the shells and cut into halfinch cubes  halfinch cubes sighed mr peters wistfully yes  add the latter to the sauce  you didnt say anything about the latter oh i see it means the halfinch cubes yes  refill the lobster shells cover with buttered crumbs and bake until the crumbs are brown this will serve six persons  and make them feel an hour afterward as though they had swallowed a live wild cat said mr peters ruefully  not necessarily said ashe i could eat two portions of that at this very minute and go off to bed and sleep like a little child  mr peters raised himself on his elbow and stared at him they were in the millionaires bedroom the time being one in the morning and mr peters had expressed a wish that ashe should read him to sleep he had voted against ashes novel and produced from the recesses of his suitcase a muchthumbed cookbook he explained that since his digestive misfortunes had come on him he had derived a certain solace from its perusal  it may be that to some men sorrows crown of sorrow is remembering happier things but mr peters had not found that to be the case in his hour of affliction it soothed him to read of hungarian goulash and escaloped brains and to remember that he too the nutandgrass eater of today had once dwelt in arcadia  the passage of the days which had so sapped the stamina of the efficient baxter had had the opposite effect on mr peters his was one of those natures that cannot deal in half measures whatever he did he did with the same driving energy after the first passionate burst of resistance he had settled down into a model pupil in ashes oneman school of physical culture it had been the same now that he came to look back on it at muldoons  now that he remembered he had come away from white plains hoping indeed never to see the place again but undeniably a different man physically it was not the habit of professor muldoon to let his patients loaf but mr peters after the initial plunge had needed no driving he had worked hard at his cure then because it was the job in hand he worked hard now under the guidance of ashe because once he had begun the thing interested and gripped him  ashe who had expected continued reluctance had been astonished and delighted at the way in which the millionaire had behaved nature had really intended ashe for a trainer he identified himself so thoroughly with his man and rejoiced at the least signs of improvement  in mr peters case there had been distinct improvement already miracles do not happen nowadays and it was too much to expect one who had maltreated his body so consistently for so many years to become whole in a day but to an optimist like ashe signs were not wanting that in due season mr peters would rise on steppingstones of his dead self to higher things and though never soaring into the class that devours lobster a la newburg and smiles after it might yet prove himself a devil of a fellow among the mutton chops  youre a wonder said mr peters youre fresh and you have no respect for your elders and betters but you deliver the goods thats the point why im beginning to feel great say do you know i felt a new muscle in the small of my back this morning they are coming out on me like a rash  thats the larsen exercises they develop the whole body  well youre a pretty good advertisement for them if they need one what were you before you came to mea prizefighter  thats the question everybody i have met since i arrived here has asked me i believe it made the butler think i was some sort of crook when i couldnt answer it i used to write stories detective stories  what you ought to be doing is running a place over here in england like muldoon has back home but you will be able to write one more story out of this business here if you want to when are you going to have another try for my scarab  tonight  tonight how about baxter  i shall have to risk baxter  mr peters hesitated he had fallen out of the habit of being magnanimous during the past few years for dyspepsia brooks no divided allegiance and magnanimity has to take a back seat when it has its grip on you  see here he said awkwardly ive been thinking this over latelyand whats the use its a queer thing and if anybody had told me a week ago that i should be saying it i wouldnt have believed him but i am beginning to like you i dont want to get you into trouble let the old scarab go whats a scarab anyway forget about it and stick on here as my private muldoon if its the five thousand thats worrying you forget that too ill give it to you as your fee  ashe was astounded that it could really be his peppery employer who spoke was almost unbelievable ashes was a friendly nature and he could never be long associated with anyone without trying to establish pleasant relations but he had resigned himself in the present case to perpetual warfare  he was touched and if he had ever contemplated abandoning his venture this he felt would have spurred him on to see it through this sudden revelation of the human in mr peters was like a trumpet call  i wouldnt think of it he said its great of you to suggest such a thing but i know just how you feel about the thing and im going to get it for you if i have to wring baxters neck probably baxter will have given up waiting as a bad job by now if he has been watching all this while weve given him ten nights to cool off i expect he is in bed dreaming pleasant dreams its nearly two oclock ill wait another ten minutes and then go down he picked up the cookbook lie back and make yourself comfortable and ill read you to sleep first  youre a good boy said mr peters drowsily  are you ready pork tenderloin larded half pound fat pork a faint smile curved mr peters lips his eyes were closed and he breathed softly ashe went on in a low voice four large pork tenderloins one cupful cracker crumbs one cupful boiling water two tablespoonfuls butter one teaspoonful salt half teaspoonful pepper one teaspoonful poultry seasoning  a little sigh came from the bed  way of preparing wipe the tenderloins with a damp cloth with a sharp knife make a deep pocket lengthwise in each tenderloin cut your pork into long thin strips and with a needle lard each tenderloin melt the butter in the water add the seasoning and the cracker crumbs combining all thoroughly now fill each pocket in the tenderloin with this stuffing place the tenderloins  a snore sounded from the pillows punctuating the recital like a mark of exclamation ashe laid down the book and peered into the darkness beyond the rays of the bed lamp his employer slept  ashe switched off the light and crept to the door out in the passage he stopped and listened all was still he stole downstairs                                  george emerson sat in his bedroom in the bachelors wing of the castle smoking a cigarette a light of resolution was in his eyes he glanced at the table beside his bed and at what was on that table and the light of resolution flamed into a glare of fanatic determination so might a medieval knight have looked on the eve of setting forth to rescue a maiden from a dragon  his cigarette burned down he looked at his watch put it back and lit another cigarette his aspect was the aspect of one waiting for the appointed hour smoking his second cigarette he resumed his meditations they had to do with aline peters  george emerson was troubled about aline peters watching over her as he did with a lovers eye he had perceived that about her which distressed him on the terrace that morning she had been abrupt to himwhat in a girl of less angelic disposition one might have called snappy yes to be just she had snapped at him that meant something it meant that aline was not well it meant what her pallor and tired eyes meantthat the life she was leading was doing her no good  eleven nights had george dined at blandings castle and on each of the eleven nights he had been distressed to see the manner in which aline declining the baked meats had restricted herself to the miserable vegetable messes which were all that doctors orders permitted to her suffering father georges pity had its limits his heart did not bleed for mr peters mr peters diet was his own affair but that aline should starve herself in this fashion purely by way of moral support for her parent was another matter  george was perhaps a shade material himself a robust young man and taking what might be called an outsize in meals he attached perhaps too much importance to food as an adjunct to the perfect life in his survey of aline he took a line through his own requirements and believing that eleven such dinners as he had seen aline partake of would have killed him he decided that his loved one was on the point of starvation  no human being he held could exist on such barmecide feasts that mr peters continued to do so did not occur to him as a flaw in his reasoning he looked on mr peters as a sort of machine successful business men often give that impression to the young if george had been told that mr peters went along on gasoline like an automobile he would not have been much surprised but that alinehis alineshould have to deny herself the exercise of that mastication of rich meats which together with the gift of speech raises man above the beasts of the field that was what tortured george  he had devoted the day to thinking out a solution of the problem such was the overflowing goodness of alines heart that not even he could persuade her to withdraw her moral support from her father and devote herself to keeping up her strength as she should do it was necessary to think of some other plan  and then a speech of hers had come back to him she had saidpoor child  i do get a little hungry sometimeslate at night generally  the problem was solved food should be brought to her late at night  on the table by his bed was a stout sheet of packing paper on this lay like one of those pictures in still life that one sees on suburban parlor walls a tongue some bread a knife a fork salt a corkscrew and a small bottle of white wine  it is a pleasure when one has been able hitherto to portray georges devotion only through the medium of his speeches to produce these comestibles as exhibit a to show that he loved aline with no common love for it had not been an easy task to get them there in a house of smaller dimensions he would have raided the larder without shame but at blandings castle there was no saying where the larder might be all he knew was that it lay somewhere beyond that greenbaize door opening on the hall past which he was wont to go on his way to bed to prowl through the maze of the servants quarters in search of it was impossible the only thing to be done was to go to market blandings and buy the things  fortune had helped him at the start by arranging that the honorable freddie also should be going to market blandings in the little runabout which seated two he had acquiesced in georges suggestion that he george should occupy the other seat but with a certain lack of enthusiasm it seemed to george he had not volunteered any reason as to why he was going to market blandings in the little runabout and on arrival there had betrayed an unmistakable desire to get rid of george at the earliest opportunity  as this had suited george to perfection he being desirous of getting rid of the honorable freddie at the earliest opportunity he had not been inquisitive and they had parted on the outskirts of the town without mutual confidences  george had then proceeded to the grocers and after that to another of the market blandings inns not the emsworth arms where he had bought the white wine he did not believe in the local white wine for he was a young man with a palate and mistrusted country cellars but he assumed that whatever its quality it would cheer aline in the small hours  he had then tramped the whole five miles back to the castle with his purchases it was here that his real troubles began and the quality of his love was tested the walk to a heavily laden man was bad enough but it was as nothing compared with the ordeal of smuggling the cargo up to his bedroom superhuman though he was george was alive to the delicacy of the situation one cannot convey food and drink to ones room in a strange house without if detected seeming to cast a slur on the table of the host it was as one who carries dispatches through an enemys lines that george took cover emerged from cover dodged ducked and ran and the moment when he sank down on his bed the door locked behind him was one of the happiest of his life  the recollection of that ordeal made the one he proposed to embark on now seem slight in comparison all he had to do was to go to alines room on the other side of the house knock softly on the door until signs of wakefulness made themselves heard from within and then dart away into the shadows whence he had come and so back to bed he gave aline credit for the intelligence that would enable her on finding a tongue some bread a knife a fork salt a corkscrew and a bottle of white wine on the mat to know what to do with themand perhaps to guess whose was the loving hand that had laid them there  the second clause however was not important for he proposed to tell her whose was the hand next morning other people might hide their light under a bushelnot george emerson  it only remained now to allow time to pass until the hour should be sufficiently advanced to insure safety for the expedition he looked at his watch again it was nearly two by this time the house must be asleep  he gathered up the tongue the bread the knife the fork the salt the corkscrew and the bottle of white wine and left the room all was still he stole downstairs                                  on his chair in the gallery that ran round the hall swathed in an overcoat and wearing rubbersoled shoes the efficient baxter sat and gazed into the darkness he had lost the first fine careless rapture as it were which had helped him to endure these vigils and a great weariness was on him he found difficulty in keeping his eyes open and when they were open the darkness seemed to press on them painfully take him for all in all the efficient baxter had had about enough of it  time stood still baxters thoughts began to wander he knew that this was fatal and exerted himself to drag them back he tried to concentrate his mind on some one definite thing he selected the scarab as a suitable object but it played him false he had hardly concentrated on the scarab before his mind was straying off to ancient egypt to mr peters dyspepsia and on a dozen other branch lines of thought  he blamed the fat man at the inn for this if the fat man had not thrust his presence and conversation on him he would have been able to enjoy a sound sleep in the afternoon and would have come fresh to his nocturnal task he began to muse on the fat man and by a curious coincidence whom should he meet a few moments later but this same man  it happened in a somewhat singular manner though it all seemed perfectly logical and consecutive to baxter he was climbing up the outer wall of westminster abbey in his pyjamas and a tall hat when the fat man suddenly thrusting his head out of a window which baxter had not noticed until that moment said hello freddie  baxter was about to explain that his name was not freddie when he found himself walking down piccadilly with ashe marson ashe said to him nobody loves me everybody steals my grapefruit and the pathos of it cut the efficient baxter like a knife he was on the point of replying when ashe vanished and baxter discovered that he was not in piccadilly as he had supposed but in an aeroplane with mr peters hovering over the castle  mr peters had a bomb in his hand which he was fondling with loving care he explained to baxter that he had stolen it from the earl of emsworths museum i did it with a slice of cold beef and a pickle he explained and baxter found himself realizing that that was the only way now watch me drop it said mr peters closing one eye and taking aim at the castle i have to do this by the doctors orders  he loosed the bomb and immediately baxter was lying in bed watching it drop he was frightened but the idea of moving did not occur to him the bomb fell very slowly dipping and fluttering like a feather it came closer and closer then it struck with a roar and a sheet of flame  baxter woke to a sound of tumult and crashing for a moment he hovered between dreaming and waking and then sleep passed from him and he was aware that something noisy and exciting was in progress in the hall below                                  coming down to first causes the only reason why collisions of any kind occur is because two bodies defy natures law that a given spot on a given plane shall at a given moment of time be occupied by only one body  there was a certain spot near the foot of the great staircase which ashe coming downstairs from mr peters room and george emerson coming up to alines room had to pass on their respective routes george reached it at one minute and three seconds after two am moving silently but swiftly and ashe also maintaining a good rate of speed arrived there at one minute and four seconds after the hour when he ceased to walk and began to fly accompanied by george emerson now going down his arms were round georges neck and george was clinging to his waist  in due season they reached the foot of the stairs and a small table covered with occasional china and photographs in frames which lay adjacent to the foot of the stairs thatespecially the occasional chinawas what baxter had heard  george emerson thought it was a burglar ashe did not know what it was but he knew he wanted to shake it off so he insinuated a hand beneath georges chin and pushed upward george by this time parted forever from the tongue the bread the knife the fork the salt the corkscrew and the bottle of white wine and having both hands free for the work of the moment held ashe with the left and punched him in the ribs with the right  ashe removing his left arm from georges neck brought it up as a reinforcement to his right and used both as a means of throttling george this led george now permanently underneath to grasp ashes ears firmly and twist them relieving the pressure on his throat and causing ashe to utter the first vocal sound of the evening other than the explosive ugh that both had emitted at the instant of impact  ashe dislodged georges hands from his ears and hit george in the ribs with his elbow george kicked ashe on the left ankle ashe rediscovered georges throat and began to squeeze it afresh and a pleasant time was being had by all when the efficient baxter whizzing down the stairs tripped over ashes legs shot forward and cannoned into another table also covered with occasional china and photographs in frames  the hall at blandings castle was more an extra drawingroom than a hall and when not nursing a sick headache in her bedroom lady ann warblington would dispense afternoon tea there to her guests consequently it was dotted pretty freely with small tables there were indeed no fewer than five more in various spots waiting to be bumped into and smashed  the bumping into and smashing of small tables however is a task that calls for plenty of time a leisured pursuit and neither george nor ashe a third party having been added to their little affair felt a desire to stay on and do the thing properly ashe was strongly opposed to being discovered and called on to account for his presence there at that hour and george conscious of the tongue and its adjuncts now strewn about the hall had a similar prejudice against the tedious explanations that detection must involve  as though by mutual consent each relaxed his grip they stood panting for an instant then ashe in the direction where he supposed the greenbaize door of the servants quarters to be george to the staircase that led to his bedroom they went away from that place  they had hardly done so when baxter having disassociated himself from the contents of the table he had upset began to grope his way toward the electriclight switch the same being situated near the foot of the main staircase he went on all fours as a safer method of locomotion though slower than the one he had attempted before  noises began to make themselves heard on the floors above roused by the merry crackle of occasional china the house party was bestirring itself to investigate voices sounded muffled and inquiring  meantime baxter crawled steadily on his hands and knees toward the light switch he was in much the same condition as one white hope of the ring is after he has put his chin in the way of the fist of a rival member of the truck drivers union he knew that he was still alive more he could not say the mists of sleep which still shrouded his brain and the shakeup he had had from his encounter with the table a corner of which he had rammed with the top of his head combined to produce a dreamlike state  and so the efficient baxter crawled on and as he crawled his hand advancing cautiously fell on somethingsomething that was not alive something clammy and icecold the touch of which filled him with a nameless horror  to say that baxters heart stood still would be physiologically inexact the heart does not stand still whatever the emotions of its owner it goes on beating it would be more accurate to say that baxter felt like a man taking his first ride in an express elevator who has outstripped his vital organs by several floors and sees no immediate prospect of their ever catching up with him again there was a great cold void where the more intimate parts of his body should have been his throat was dry and contracted the flesh of his back crawled for he knew what it was he had touched  painful and absorbing as had been his encounter with the table baxter had never lost sight of the fact that close beside him a furious battle between unseen forces was in progress he had heard the bumping and the thumping and the tense breathing even as he picked occasional china from his person such a combat he had felt could hardly fail to result in personal injury to either the party of the first part or the party of the second part or both he knew now that worse than mere injury had happened and that he knelt in the presence of death  there was no doubt that the man was dead insensibility alone could never have produced this icy chill he raised his head in the darkness and cried aloud to those approaching he meant to cry help murder but fear prevented clear articulation what he shouted was heh mer on which from the neighborhood of the staircase somebody began to fire a revolver  the earl of emsworth had been sleeping a sound and peaceful sleep when the imbroglio began downstairs he sat up and listened yes undoubtedly burglars he switched on his light and jumped out of bed he took a pistol from a drawer and thus armed went to look into the matter the dreamy peer was no poltroon  it was quite dark when he arrived on the scene of conflict in the van of a mixed bevy of pyjamaed and dressinggowned relations he was in the van because meeting these relations in the passage above he had said to them let me go first i have a pistol and they had let him go first they were indeed awfully nice about it not thrusting themselves forward or jostling or anything but behaving in a modest and selfeffacing manner that was pretty to watch  when lord emsworth said let me go first young algernon wooster who was on the very point of leaping to the fore said yes by jove sound scheme by gadand withdrew into the background and the bishop of godalming said by all means clarence undoubtedly most certainly precede us  when his sense of touch told him he had reached the foot of the stairs lord emsworth paused the hall was very dark and the burglars seemed temporarily to have suspended activities and then one of them a man with a ruffianly grating voice spoke what it was he said lord emsworth could not understand it sounded like heh merprobably some secret signal to his confederates lord emsworth raised his revolver and emptied it in the direction of the sound  extremely fortunately for him the efficient baxter had not changed his allfours attitude this undoubtedly saved lord emsworth the worry of engaging a new secretary the shots sang above baxters head one after the other six in all and found other billets than his person they disposed themselves as follows the first shot broke a window and whistled out into the night the second shot hit the dinner gong and made a perfectly extraordinary noise like the last trump the third fourth and fifth shots embedded themselves in the wall the sixth and final shot hit a lifesize picture of his lordships grandmother in the face and improved it out of all knowledge  one thinks no worse of lord emsworths grandmother because she looked like eddie foy and had allowed herself to be painted after the heavy classic manner of some of the portraits of a hundred years ago in the character of venussuitably draped of course rising from the sea but it was beyond the possibility of denial that her grandsons bullet permanently removed one of blandings castles most prominent eyesores  having emptied his revolver lord emsworth said who is there speak in rather an aggrieved tone as though he felt he had done his part in breaking the ice and it was now for the intruder to exert himself and bear his share of the social amenities  the efficient baxter did not reply nothing in the world could have induced him to speak at that moment or to make any sound whatsoever that might betray his position to a dangerous maniac who might at any instant reload his pistol and resume the fusillade explanations in his opinion could be deferred until somebody had the presence of mind to switch on the lights he flattened himself on the carpet and hoped for better things his cheek touched the corpse beside him but though he winced and shuddered he made no outcry after those six shots he was through with outcries  a voice from above the bishops voice said i think you have killed him clarence  another voice that of colonel horace mant said switch on those dashed lights why doesnt somebody dash it  the whole strength of the company began to demand light  when the lights came it was from the other side of the hall six revolver shots fired at quarter past two in the morning will rouse even sleeping domestics the servants quarters were buzzing like a hive shrill feminine screams were puncturing the air mr beach the butler in a suit of pink silk pajamas of which no one would have suspected him was leading a party of men servants down the stairsnot so much because he wanted to lead them as because they pushed him  the passage beyond the greenbaize door became congested and there were cries for mr beach to open it and look through and see what was the matter but mr beach was smarter than that and wriggled back so that he no longer headed the procession this done he shouted  open that door there open that door look and see what the matter is  ashe opened the door since his escape from the hall he had been lurking in the neighborhood of the greenbaize door and had been engulfed by the swirling throng finding himself with elbowroom for the first time he pushed through swung the door open and switched on the lights  they shone on a collection of semidressed figures crowding the staircase on a hall littered with china and glass on a dented dinner gong on an edited and improved portrait of the late countess of emsworth and on the efficient baxter in an overcoat and rubbersoled shoes lying beside a cold tongue at no great distance lay a number of other objectsa knife a fork some bread salt a corkscrew and a bottle of white wine  using the word in the sense of saying something coherent the earl of emsworth was the first to speak he peered down at his recumbent secretary and said  baxter my dear fellowwhat the devil  the feeling of the company was one of profound disappointment they were disgusted at the anticlimax for an instant when the efficient one did not move a hope began to stir but as soon as it was seen that he was not even injured gloom reigned one of two things would have satisfied themeither a burglar or a corpse a burglar would have been welcome dead or alive but if baxter proposed to fill the part adequately it was imperative that he be dead he had disappointed them deeply by turning out to be the object of their quest that he should not have been even grazed was too much  there was a cold silence as he slowly raised himself from the floor as his eyes fell on the tongue he started and remained gazing fixedly at it surprise paralyzed him  lord emsworth was also looking at the tongue and he leaped to a not unreasonable conclusion he spoke coldly and haughtily for he was not only annoyed like the others at the anticlimax but offended he knew that he was not one of your energetic hosts who exert themselves unceasingly to supply their guests with entertainment but there was one thing on which as a host he did pride himselfin the material matters of life he did his guests well he kept an admirable table  my dear baxter he said in the tones he usually reserved for the correction of his son freddie if your hunger is so great that you are unable to wait for breakfast and have to raid my larder in the middle of the night i wish to goodness you would contrive to make less noise about it i do not grudge you the foodhelp yourself when you pleasebut do remember that people who have not such keen appetites as yourself like to sleep during the night a far better plan my dear fellow would be to have sandwiches or bunsor whatever you consider most sustaining sent up to your bedroom  not even the bullets had disordered baxters faculties so much as this monstrous accusation explanations pushed and jostled one another in his fermenting brain but he could not utter them on every side he met gravely reproachful eyes george emerson was looking at him in pained disgust ashe marsons face was the face of one who could never have believed this had he not seen it with his own eyes the scrutiny of the knifeandshoe boy was unendurable  he stammered words began to proceed from him tripping and stumbling over each other lord emsworths frigid disapproval did not relax  pray do not apologize baxter the desire for food is human it is your boisterous mode of securing and conveying it that i deprecate let us all go to bed  but lord emsworth  to bed repeated his lordship firmly  the company began to stream moodily upstairs the lights were switched off the efficient baxter dragged himself away from the darkness in the direction of the servants door a voice spoke  greedy pig said the voice scornfully  it sounded like the fresh young voice of the knifeandshoe boy but baxter was too broken to investigate he continued his retreat without pausing  stuffin of isself at all hours said the voice  there was a murmur of approval from the unseen throng of domestics    chapter ix  as we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people one must assume that the efficient baxter had not reached the age when this comes home to a man for the fact that he had given genuine pleasure to some dozens of his fellowmen brought him no balm  there was no doubt about the pleasure he had given once they had got over their disappointment at finding that he was not a dead burglar the house party rejoiced wholeheartedly at the break in the monotony of life at blandings castle relations who had not been on speaking terms for years forgot their quarrels and strolled about the grounds in perfect harmony abusing baxter the general verdict was that he was insane  dont tell me that young fellows all there said colonel horace mant because i know better have you noticed his eye furtive shifty nasty gleam in it besidesdash itdid you happen to take a look at the hall last night after he had been there it was in ruins my dear sirabsolute dashed ruins it was positively littered with broken china and tables that had been bowled over dont tell me that was just an accidental collision in the dark  my dear sir the man must have been thrashing aboutabsolutely thrashing about like a dashed salmon on a dashed hook he must have had a paroxysm of some kindsome kind of a dashed fit a doctor could give you the name for it its a wellknown form of insanity paranoiaisnt that what they call it rush of blood to the head followed by a general running amuck  ive heard fellows who have been in india talk of it natives get it dont know what theyre doing and charge through the streets taking cracks at people with dashed whacking great knives same with this young man probably in a modified form at present he ought to be in a home one of these nights if this grows on him he will be massacring emsworth in his bed  my dear horace the bishop of godalmings voice was properly horrorstricken but there was a certain unctuous relish in it  take my word for it though mind you i dont say they arent well suited everyone knows that emsworth has been to all practical intents and purposes a dashed lunatic for years what was it that young fellow emerson freddies american friend was saying the other day about some acquaintance of his who is not quite right in the head nobody in the houseis that it something to that effect at any rate i felt at the time it was a perfect description of emsworth  my dear horace your fatherinlaw the head of the family  a dashed lunatic my dear sirhead of the family or no head of the family a man as absentminded as he is has no right to call himself sane nobody in the housei recollect it nownobody in the house except gas and that has not been turned on thats emsworth  the efficient baxter who had just left his presence was feeling much the same about his noble employer after a sleepless night he had begun at an early hour to try and corner lord emsworth in order to explain to him the true inwardness of last nights happenings eventually he had tracked him to the museum where he found him happily engaged in painting a cabinet of birds eggs he was seated on a small stool a large pot of red paint on the floor beside him dabbing at the cabinet with a dripping brush he was absorbed and made no attempt whatever to follow his secretarys remarks  for ten minutes baxter gave a vivid picture of his vigil and the manner in which it had been interrupted  just so just so my dear fellow said the earl when he had finished i quite understand all i say is if you do require additional food in the night let one of the servants bring it to your room before bedtime then there will be no danger of these disturbances there is no possible objection to your eating a hundred meals a day my good baxter provided you do not rouse the whole house over them some of us like to sleep during the night  but lord emsworth i have just explainedit was noti was not  never mind my dear fellow never mind why make such an important thing of it many people like a light snack before actually retiring doctors i believe sometimes recommend it tell me baxter how do you think the museum looks now a little brighter better for the dash of color i think so museums are generally such gloomy places  lord emsworth may i explain once again  the earl looked annoyed  my dear baxter i have told you that there is nothing to explain you are getting a little tedious what a deep rich red this is and how clean new paint smells do you know baxter i have been longing to mess about with paint ever since i was a boy i recollect my old father beating me with a walking stick    that would be before your time of course by the way if you see freddie will you tell him i want to speak to him he probably is in the smokingroom send him to me here  it was an overwrought baxter who delivered the message to the honorable freddie who as predicted was in the smokingroom lounging in a deep armchair  there are times when life presses hard on a man and it pressed hard on baxter now fate had played him a sorry trick it had put him in a position where he had to choose between two courses each as disagreeable as the other he must either face a possible second fiasco like that of last night or else he must abandon his post and cease to mount guard over his threatened treasure  his imagination quailed at the thought of a repetition of last nights horrors he had been badly shaken by his collision with the table and even more so by the events that had followed it those revolver shots still rang in his ears  it was probably the memory of those shots that turned the scale it was unlikely he would again become entangled with a man bearing a tongue and the other thingshe had given up in despair the attempt to unravel the mystery of the tongue it completely baffled himbut it was by no means unlikely that if he spent another night in the gallery looking on the hall he might not again become a target for lord emsworths irresponsible firearm nothing in fact was more likely for in the disturbed state of the public mind the slightest sound after nightfall would be sufficient cause for a fusillade  he had actually overheard young algernon wooster telling lord stockheath he had a jolly good mind to sit on the stairs that night with a shotgun because it was his opinion that there was a jolly sight more in this business than there seemed to be and what he thought of the bally affair was that there was a gang of some kind at work and that that fellerwhatshisnamethat feller baxter was some sort of an accomplice  with these things in his mind baxter decided to remain that night in the security of his bedroom he had lost his nerve he formed this decision with the utmost reluctance for the thought of leaving the road to the museum clear for marauders was bitter in the extreme if he could have overheard a conversation between joan valentine and ashe marson it is probable he would have risked lord emsworths revolver and the shotgun of the honorable algernon wooster  ashe when he met joan and recounted the events of the night at which joan who was a sound sleeper had not been present was inclined to blame himself as a failure true fate had been against him but the fact remained that he had achieved nothing joan however was not of this opinion  you have done wonders she said you have cleared the way for me that is my idea of real teamwork im so glad now that we formed our partnership it would have been too bad if i had got all the advantage of your work and had jumped in and deprived you of the reward as it is i shall go down and finish the thing off tonight with a clear conscience  you cant mean that you dream of going down to the museum tonight  of course i do  but its madness  on the contrary tonight is the one night when there ought to be no risk at all  after what happened last night  because of what happened last night do you imagine mr baxter will dare to stir from his bed after that if ever there was a chance of getting this thing finished it will be tonight  youre quite right i never looked at it in that way baxter wouldnt risk a second disaster ill certainly make a success of it this time  joan raised her eyebrows  i dont quite understand you mr marson do you propose to try to get the scarab tonight  yes it will be as easy as  are you forgetting that by the terms of our agreement it is my turn  you surely dont intend to hold me to that  certainly i do  but good heavens consider my position do you seriously expect me to lie in bed while you do all the work and then to take a half share in the reward  i do  its ridiculous  its no more ridiculous than that i should do the same mr marson theres no use in our going over all this again we settled it long ago  joan refused to discuss the matter further leaving ashe in a condition of anxious misery comparable only to that which as night began to draw near gnawed the vitals of the efficient baxter                                  breakfast at blandings castle was an informal meal there was food and drink in the long dininghall for such as were energetic enough to come down and get it but the majority of the house party breakfasted in their rooms lord emsworth whom nothing in the world would have induced to begin the day in the company of a crowd of his relations most of whom he disliked setting them the example  when therefore baxter yielding to nature after having remained awake until the early morning fell asleep at nine oclock nobody came to rouse him he did not ring his bell so he was not disturbed and he slept on until half past eleven by which time it being sunday morning and the house party including one bishop and several of the minor clergy most of the occupants of the place had gone off to church  baxter shaved and dressed hastily for he was in state of nervous apprehension he blamed himself for having lain in bed so long when every minute he was away might mean the loss of the scarab he had passed several hours in dreamy sloth he had wakened with a presentiment something told him the scarab had been stolen in the night and he wished now that he had risked all and kept guard  the house was very quiet as he made his way rapidly to the hall as he passed a window he perceived lord emsworth in an unsabbatarian suit of tweeds and bearing a garden forkwhich must have pained the bishopbending earnestly over a flower bed but he was the only occupant of the grounds and indoors there was a feeling of emptiness the hall had that sundaymorning air of wanting to be left to itself and disapproving of the entry of anything human until lunch time which can be felt only by a guest in a large house who remains at home when his fellows have gone to church  the portraits on the walls especially the one of the countess of emsworth in the character of venus rising from the sea stared at baxter as he entered with cold reproof the very chairs seemed distant and unfriendly but baxter was in no mood to appreciate their attitude his conscience slept his mind was occupied to the exclusion of all other things by the scarab and its probable fate how disastrously remiss it had been of him not to keep guard last night long before he opened the museum door he was feeling the absolute certainty that the worst had happened  it had the card which announced that here was an egyptian scarab of the reign of cheops of the fourth dynasty presented by j preston peters esquire still lay on the cabinet in its wonted place but now its neat lettering was false and misleading the scarab was gone                                  for all that he had expected this for all his premonition of disaster it was an appreciable time before the efficient baxter rallied from the blow he stood transfixed goggling at the empty place  then his mind resumed its functions all he perceived was not yet lost baxter the watchdog must retire to be succeeded by baxter the sleuthhound he had been unable to prevent the theft of the scarab but he might still detect the thief  for the doctor watsons of this world as opposed to the sherlock holmeses success in the province of detective work must always be to a very large extent the result of luck sherlock holmes can extract a clew from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash but doctor watson has to have it taken out for him and dusted and exhibited clearly with a label attached  the average man is a doctor watson we are wont to scoff in a patronizing manner at that humble follower of the great investigator but as a matter of fact we should have been just as dull ourselves we should not even have risen to the modest height of a scotland yard bungler  baxter was a doctor watson what he wanted was a clew but it is so hard for the novice to tell what is a clew and what is not and then he happened to look downand there on the floor was a clew that nobody could have overlooked  baxter saw it but did not immediately recognize it for what it was what he saw at first was not a clew but just a mess he had a tidy soul and abhorred messes and this was a particularly messy mess a considerable portion of the floor was a sea of red paint the can from which it had flowed was lying on its sidenear the wall he had noticed that the smell of paint had seemed particularly pungent but had attributed this to a new freshet of energy on the part of lord emsworth he had not perceived that paint had been spilled  pah said baxter  then suddenly beneath the disguise of the mess he saw the clew a footmark no less a crimson footmark on the polished wood it was as clear and distinct as though it had been left there for the purpose of assisting him it was a feminine footmark the print of a slim and pointed shoe  this perplexed baxter he had looked on the siege of the scarab as an exclusively male affair but he was not perplexed long what could be simpler than that mr peters should have enlisted female aid the female of the species is more deadly than the male probably she makes a better purloiner of scarabs at any rate there the footprint was unmistakably feminine  inspiration came to him aline peters had a maid what more likely than that secretly she should be a hireling of mr peters on whom he had now come to look as a man of the blackest and most sinister character mr peters was a collector and when a collector makes up his mind to secure a treasure he employs baxter knew every possible means to that end  baxter was now in a state of great excitement he was hot on the scent and his brain was working like a buzz saw in an ice box according to his reasoning if aline peters maid had done this thing there should be red paint in the hall marking her retreat and possibly a faint stain on the stairs leading to the servants bedrooms  he hastened from the museum and subjected the hall to a keen scrutiny yes there was red paint on the carpet he passed through the greenbaize door and examined the stairs on the bottom step there was a faint but conclusive stain of crimson  he was wondering how best to follow up this clew when he perceived ashe coming down the stairs ashe like baxter and as the result of a night disturbed by anxious thoughts had also overslept himself  there are moments when the giddy excitement of being right on the trail causes the amateuror watsoniandetective to be incautious if baxter had been wise he would have achieved his objectthe getting a glimpse of joans shoesby a devious and snaky route as it was zeal getting the better of prudence he rushed straight on his early suspicion of ashe had been temporarily obscured whatever ashes claims to be a suspect it had not been his footprint baxter had seen in the museum  here you said the efficient baxter excitedly  sir  the shoes  i beg your pardon  i wish to see the servants shoes where are they  i expect they have them on sir  yesterdays shoes manyesterdays shoes where are they  where are the shoes of yesteryear murmured ashe i should say at a venture sir that they would be in a large basket somewhere near the kitchen our genial knifeandshoe boy collects them i believe at early dawn  would they have been cleaned yet  if i know the lad sirno  go and bring that basket to me bring it to me in this room                                  the room to which he referred was none other than the private sanctum of mr beach the butler the door of which standing open showed it to be empty it was not baxters plan excited as he was to risk being discovered sifting shoes in the middle of a passage in the servants quarters  ashes brain was working rapidly as he made for the shoe cupboard that little den of darkness and smells where billy the knifeandshoe boy better known in the circle in which he moved as young bonehead pursued his menial tasks what exactly was at the back of the efficient baxters mind prompting these maneuvers he did not know but that there was something he was certain  he had not yet seen joan this morning and he did not know whether or not she had carried out her resolve of attempting to steal the scarab on the previous night but this activity and mystery on the part of their enemy must have some sinister significance he gathered up the shoe basket thoughtfully he staggered back with it and dumped it down on the floor of mr beachs room the efficient baxter stooped eagerly over it ashe leaning against the wall straightened the creases in his clothes and flicked disgustedly at an inky spot which the journey had transferred from the basket to his coat  we have here sir he said a fair selection of our various foot coverings  you did not drop any on your way  not one sir  the efficient baxter uttered a grunt of satisfaction and bent once more to his task shoes flew about the room baxter knelt on the floor beside the basket and dug like a terrier at a rat hole at last he made a find and with an exclamation of triumph rose to his feet in his hand he held a shoe  put those back he said  ashe began to pick up the scattered footgear  thats the lot sir he said rising  now come with me leave the basket there you can carry it back when you return  shall i put back that shoe sir  certainly not i shall take this one with me  shall i carry it for you sir  baxter reflected  yes i think that would be best  trouble had shaken his nerve he was not certain that there might not be others besides lord emsworth in the garden and it occurred to him that especially after his reputation for eccentric conduct had been so firmly established by his misfortunes that night in the hall it might cause comment should he appear before them carrying a shoe  ashe took the shoe and doing so understood what before had puzzled him across the toe was a broad splash of red paint though he had nothing else to go on he saw all the shoe he held was a female shoe his own researches in the museum had made him aware of the presence there of red paint it was not difficult to build up on these data a pretty accurate estimate of the position of affairs  come with me said baxter  he left the room ashe followed him  in the garden lord emsworth garden fork in hand was dealing summarily with a green young weed that had incautiously shown its head in the middle of a flower bed he listened to baxters statement with more interest than he usually showed in anybodys statements he resented the loss of the scarab not so much on account of its intrinsic worth as because it had been the gift of his friend mr peters  indeed he said when baxter had finished really dear me it certainly seemsit is extremely suggestive you are certain there was red paint on this shoe  i have it with me i brought it on purpose to show you he looked at ashe who stood in close attendance the shoe  lord emsworth polished his glasses and bent over the exhibit  ah he said now let me look atthis you say is thejust so just so justmy dear baxter it may be that i have not examined this shoe with sufficient care butcan you point out to me exactly where this paint is that you speak of  the efficient baxter stood staring at the shoe with wild fixed stare of any suspicion of paint red or otherwise it was absolutely and entirely innocent  the shoe became the center of attraction the center of all eyes the efficient baxter fixed it with the piercing glare of one who feels that his brain is tottering lord emsworth looked at it with a mildly puzzled expression ashe marson examined it with a sort of affectionate interest as though he were waiting for it to do a trick of some kind baxter was the first to break the silence  there was paint on this shoe he said vehemently i tell you there was a splash of red paint across the toe this man here will bear me out in this you saw paint on this shoe  paint sir  what do you mean to tell me you did not see it  no sir there was no paint on this shoe  this is ridiculous i saw it with my own eyes it was a broad splash right across the toe  lord emsworth interposed  you must have made a mistake my dear baxter there is certainly no trace of paint on this shoe these momentary optical delusions are i fancy not uncommon any doctor will tell you  i had an aunt your lordship said ashe chattily who was remarkably subject  it is absurd i cannot have been mistaken said baxter i am positively certain the toe of this shoe was red when i found it  it is quite black now my dear baxter  a sort of chameleon shoe murmured ashe  the goaded secretary turned on him  what did you say  nothing sir  baxters old suspicion of this smooth young man came surging back to him  i strongly suspect you of having had something to do with this  really baxter said the earl that is surely the least probable of solutions this young man could hardly have cleaned the shoe on his way from the house a few days ago when painting in the museum i inadvertently splashed some paint on my own shoe i can assure you it does not brush off it needs a very systematic cleaning before all traces are removed  exactly your lordship said ashe my theory if i may  yes  my theory your lordship is that mr baxter was deceived by the lightandshade effects on the toe of the shoe the morning sun streaming in through the window must have shone on the shoe in such a manner as to give it a momentary and fictitious aspect of redness if mr baxter recollects he did not look long at the shoe the picture on the retina of the eye consequently had not time to fade i myself remember thinking at the moment that the shoe appeared to have a certain reddish tint the mistake  bah said baxter shortly  lord emsworth now thoroughly bored with the whole affair and desiring nothing more than to be left alone with his weeds and his garden fork put in his word baxter he felt was curiously irritating these days he always seemed to be bobbing up the earl of emsworth was conscious of a strong desire to be free from his secretarys company he was efficient yesinvaluable indeedhe did not know what he should do without baxter but there was no denying that his company tended after a while to become a trifle tedious he took a fresh grip on his garden fork and shifted it about in the air as a hint that the interview had lasted long enough  it seems to me my dear fellow he said the only explanation that will square with the facts a shoe that is really smeared with red paint does not become black of itself in the course of a few minutes  you are very right your lordship said ashe approvingly may i go now your lordship  certainlycertainly by all means  shall i take the shoe with me your lordship  if you do not want it baxter  the secretary passed the fraudulent piece of evidence to ashe without a word and the latter having included both gentlemen in a kindly smile left the garden  on returning to the butlers room ashes first act was to remove a shoe from the top of the pile in the basket he was about to leave the room with it when the sound of footsteps in the passage outside halted him  i do not in the least understand why you wish me to come here my dear baxter said a voice and you are completely spoiling my morning but  for a moment ashe was at a loss it was a crisis that called for swift action and it was a little hard to know exactly what to do it had been his intention to carry the paintsplashed shoe back to his own room there to clean it at his leisure but it appeared that his strategic line of retreat was blocked plainly the possibilitynay the certaintythat ashe had substituted another shoe for the one with the incriminating splash of paint on it had occurred to the efficient baxter almost directly the former had left the garden  the window was open ashe looked out there were bushes below it was a makeshift policy and one which did not commend itself to him as the ideal method but it seemed the only thing to be done for already the footsteps had reached the door he threw the shoe out of window and it sank beneath the friendly surface of the long grass round a wisteria bush  ashe turned relieved and the next moment the door opened and baxter walked in accompaniedwith obvious reluctanceby his bored employer  baxter was brisk and peremptory  i wish to look at those shoes again he said coldly  certainly sir said ashe  i can manage without your assistance said baxter  very good sir  leaning against the wall ashe watched him with silent interest as he burrowed among the contents of the basket like a terrier digging for rats the earl of emsworth took no notice of the proceedings he yawned plaintively and pottered about the room he was one of natures potterers  the scrutiny of the man whom he had now placed definitely as a malefactor irritated baxter ashe was looking at him in an insufferably tolerant manner as if he were an indulgent father brooding over his infant son while engaged in some childish frolic he lodged a protest  dont stand there staring at me  i was interested in what you were doing sir  never mind dont stare at me in that idiotic way  may i read a book sir  yes read if you like  thank you sir  ashe took a volume from the butlers slenderly stocked shelf the shoeexpert resumed his investigations in the basket he went through it twice but each time without success after the second search he stood up and looked wildly about the room he was as certain as he could be of anything that the missing piece of evidence was somewhere within those four walls there was very little cover in the room even for so small a fugitive as a shoe he raised the tablecloth and peered beneath the table  are you looking for mr beach sir said ashe i think he has gone to church  baxter pink with his exertions fastened a baleful glance upon him  you had better be careful he said  at this point the earl of emsworth having done all the pottering possible in the restricted area yawned like an alligator  now my dear baxter he began querulously  baxter was not listening he was on the trail he had caught sight of a small closet in the wall next to the mantelpiece and it had stimulated him  what is in this closet  that closet sir  yes this closet he rapped the door irritably  i could not say sir mr beach to whom the closet belongs possibly keeps a few odd trifles there a ball of string perhaps maybe an old pipe or something of that kind probably nothing of value or interest  open it  it appears to be locked sir  unlock it  but where is the key  baxter thought for a moment  lord emsworth he said i have my reasons for thinking that this man is deliberately keeping the contents of this closet from me i am convinced that the shoe is in there have i your leave to break open the door  the earl looked a little dazed as if he were unequal to the intellectual pressure of the conversation  now my dear baxter said the earl impatiently please tell me once again why you have brought me in here i cannot make head or tail of what you have been saying apparently you accuse this young man of keeping his shoes in a closet why should you suspect him of keeping his shoes in a closet and if he wishes to do so why on earth should not he keep his shoes in a closet this is a free country  exactly your lordship said ashe approvingly you have touched the spot  it all has to do with the theft of your scarab lord emsworth somebody got into the museum and stole the scarab  ah yes ah yesso they did i remember now you told me bad business that my dear baxter mr peters gave me that scarab he will be most deucedly annoyed if its lost yes indeed  whoever stole it upset the can of red paint and stepped in it  devilish careless of them it must have made the dickens of a mess why dont people look where they are walking  i suspect this man of shielding the criminal by hiding her shoe in this closet  oh its not his own shoes that this young man keeps in closets  it is a womans shoe lord emsworth  the deuce it is then it was a woman who stole the scarab is that the way you figure it out bless my soul baxter one wonders what women are coming to nowadays its all this movement i suppose the vote and all thateh i recollect having a chat with the marquis of petersfield some time ago he is in the cabinet and he tells me it is perfectly infernal the way these women carry on he said sometimes it got to such a pitch with them waving banners and presenting petitions and throwing flour and things at a fellow that if he saw his own mother coming toward him with a hand behind her back he would run like a rabbit told me so himself  so said the efficient baxter cutting in on the flow of speech what i wish to do is to break open this closet  eh why  to get the shoe  the shoe    ah yes i recollect now you were telling me  if your lordship has no objection  objection my dear fellow none in the world why should i have any objection let me see what is it you wish to do  this said baxter shortly  he seized the poker from the fireplace and delivered two rapid blows on the closet door the wood was splintered a third blow smashed the flimsy lock the closet with any skeletons it might contain was open for all to view  it contained a corkscrew a box of matches a papercovered copy of a book entitled mary the beautiful millhand a bottle of embrocation a spool of cotton two pencilstubs and other useful and entertaining objects it contained in fact almost everything except a paintsplashed shoe and baxter gazed at the collection in dumb disappointment  are you satisfied now my dear baxter said the earl or is there any more furniture that you would like to break you know this furniture breaking is becoming a positive craze with you my dear fellow you ought to fight against it the night before last i dont know how many tables broken in the hall and now this closet you will ruin me no purse can stand the constant drain  baxter did not reply he was still trying to rally from the blow a chance remark of lord emsworths set him off on the trail once more lord emsworth having said his say had dismissed the affair from his mind and begun to potter again the course of his pottering had brought him to the fireplace where a little pile of soot on the fender caught his eye he bent down to inspect it  dear me he said i must remember to tell beach to have his chimney swept it seems to need it badly  no trumpetcall ever acted more instantaneously on old warhorse than this simple remark on the efficient baxter he was still convinced that ashe had hidden the shoe somewhere in the room and now that the closet had proved an alibi the chimney was the only spot that remained unsearched he dived forward with a rush nearly knocking lord emsworth off his feet and thrust an arm up into the unknown the startled peer having recovered his balance met ashes respectfully pitying gaze  we must humor him said the gaze more plainly than speech  baxter continued to grope the chimney was a roomy chimney and needed careful examination he wriggled his hand about clutchingly from time to time soot fell in gentle showers  my dear baxter  baxter was baffled he withdrew his hand from the chimney and straightened himself he brushed a bead of perspiration from his face with the back of his hand unfortunately he used the sooty hand and the result was too much for lord emsworths politeness he burst into a series of pleased chuckles  your face my dear baxter your face it is positively covered with sootpositively you must go and wash it you are quite black really my dear fellow you present rather an extraordinary appearance run off to your room  against this crowning blow the efficient baxter could not stand up it was the end  soot he murmured weakly soot  your face is covered my dear fellowquite covered  it certainly has a faintly sooty aspect sir said ashe  his voice roused the sufferer to one last flicker of spirit  you will hear more of this he said you will  at this moment slightly muffled by the intervening door and passageway there came from the direction of the hall a sound like the delivery of a ton of coal a heavy body bumped down the stairs and a voice which all three recognized as that of the honorable freddie uttered an oath that lost itself in a final crash and a musical splintering sound which baxter for one had no difficulty in recognizing as the dissolution of occasional china  even if they had not so able a detective as baxter with them lord emsworth and ashe would have been at no loss to guess what had happened doctor watson himself could have deduced it from the evidence the honorable freddie had fallen downstairs                                  with a little ingenuity this portion of the story of mr peters scarab could be converted into an excellent tract driving home the perils even in this world of absenting ones self from church on sunday morning if the honorable freddie had gone to church he would not have been running down the great staircase at the castle at this hour and if he had not been running down the great staircase at the castle at that hour he would not have encountered muriel  muriel was a persian cat belonging to lady ann warblington lady ann had breakfasted in bed and lain there late as she rather fancied she had one of her sick headaches coming on muriel had left her room in the wake of the breakfast tray being anxious to be present at the obsequies of a fried sole that had formed lady anns simple morning meal and had followed the maid who bore it until she had reached the hall  at this point the maid who disliked muriel stopped and made a noise like an exploding pop bottle at the same time taking a little run in muriels direction and kicking at her with a menacing foot muriel wounded and startled had turned in her tracks and sprinted back up the staircase at the exact moment when the honorable freddie who for some reason was in a great hurry ran lightly down  there was an instant when freddie could have saved himself by planting a numberten shoe on muriels spine but even in that crisis he bethought him that he hardly stood solid enough with the authorities to risk adding to his misdeeds the slaughter of his aunts favorite cat and he executed a rapid swerve the spared cat proceeded on her journey upstairs while freddie touching the staircase at intervals went on down  having reached the bottom he sat amid the occasional china like marius among the ruins of carthage and endeavored to ascertain the extent of his injuries he had a dazed suspicion that he was irretrievably fractured in a dozen places it was in this attitude that the rescue party found him he gazed up at them with silent pathos  in the name of goodness frederick said lord emsworth peevishly what do you imagine you are doing  freddie endeavored to rise but sank back again with a stifled howl  it was that bally cat of aunt anns he said it came legging it up the stairs i think ive broken my leg  you have certainly broken everything else said his father unsympathetically between you and baxter i wonder theres a stick of furniture standing in the house  thanks old chap said freddie gratefully as ashe stepped forward and lent him an arm i think my bally ankle must have got twisted i wish you would give me a hand up to my room  and baxter my dear fellow said lord emsworth you might telephone to doctor bird in market blandings and ask him to be good enough to drive out i am sorry freddie he added that you should have met with this accident butbut everything is soso disturbing nowadays that i feeli feel most disturbed  ashe and the honorable freddie began to move across the hallfreddie hopping ashe advancing with a sort of polka step as they reached the stairs there was a sound of wheels outside and the vanguard of the house party returned from church entered the house  its all very well to give it out officially that freddie has fallen downstairs and sprained his ankle said colonel horace mant discussing the affair with the bishop of godalming later in the afternoon but its my firm belief that that fellow baxter did precisely as i said he wouldran amuck and inflicted dashed frightful injuries on young freddie when i got into the house there was freddie being helped up the stairs while baxter with his face covered with soot was looking after him with a sort of evil grin what had he smeared his face with soot for i should like to know if he were perfectly sane  the whole thing is dashed fishy and mysterious and the sooner i can get mildred safely out of the place the better i shall be pleased the fellows as mad as a hatter    chapter x  when lord emsworth sighting mr peters in the group of returned churchgoers drew him aside and broke the news that the valuable scarab so kindly presented by him to the castle museum had been stolen in the night by some person unknown he thought the millionaire took it exceedingly well though the stolen object no longer belonged to him mr peters no doubt still continued to take an affectionate interest in it and might have been excused had he shown annoyance that his gift had been so carelessly guarded  mr peters was however thoroughly magnanimous about the matter he deprecated the notion that the earl could possibly have prevented this unfortunate occurrence he quite understood he was not in the least hurt nobody could have foreseen such a calamity these things happened and one had to accept them he himself had once suffered in much the same way the gem of his collection having been removed almost beneath his eyes in the smoothest possible fashion  altogether he relieved lord emsworths mind very much and when he had finished doing so he departed swiftly and rang for ashe when ashe arrived he bubbled over with enthusiasm he was lyrical in his praise he went so far as to slap ashe on the back it was only when the latter disclaimed all credit for what had occurred that he checked the flow of approbation  it wasnt you who got it who was it then  it was miss peters maid its a long story but we were working in partnership i tried for the thing and failed and she succeeded  it was with mixed feelings that ashe listened while mr peters transferred his adjectives of commendation to joan he admired joans courage he was relieved that her venture had ended without disaster and he knew that she deserved whatever anyone could find to say in praise of her enterprise but at first though he tried to crush it down he could not help feeling a certain amount of chagrin that a girl should have succeeded where he though having the advantage of first chance had failed the terms of his partnership with joan had jarred on him from the beginning  a man may be in sympathy with the modern movement for the emancipation of woman and yet feel aggrieved when a mere girl proves herself a more efficient thief than himself woman is invading mans sphere more successfully every day but there are still certain fields in which man may consider that he is rightfully entitled to a monopolyand the purloining of scarabs in the watches of the night is surely one of them joan in ashes opinion should have played a meeker and less active part  these unworthy emotions did not last long whatever his other shortcomings ashe possessed a just mind by the time he had found joan after mr peters had said his say and dispatched him below stairs for that purpose he had purged himself of petty regrets and was prepared to congratulate her wholeheartedly he was however resolved that nothing should induce him to share in the reward on that point he resolved he would refuse to be shaken  i have just left mr peters he began all is well his check book lies before him on the table and he is trying to make his fountain pen work long enough to write a check but there is just one thing i want to say  she interrupted him to his surprise she was eyeing him coldly and with disapproval  and there is just one thing i want to say she said and that is if you imagine i shall consent to accept a penny of the reward  exactly what i was going to say of course i couldnt dream of taking any of it  i dont understand you you are certainly going to have it all i told you when we made our agreement that i should only take my share if you let me do my share of the work now that you have broken that agreement nothing could induce me to take it i know you meant it kindly mr marson but i simply cant feel grateful i told you that ours was a business contract and that i wouldnt have any chivalry and i thought that after you had given me your promise  one moment said ashe bewildered i cant follow this what do you mean  what do i mean why that you went down to the museum last night before me and took the scarab though you had promised to stay away and give me my chance  but i didnt do anything of the sort  it was joans turn to look bewildered  but you have got the scarab mr marson  why you have got it  no  butbut it has gone  i know i went down to the museum last night as we had arranged and when i got there there was no scarab it had disappeared  they looked at each other in consternation ashe was the first to speak  it was gone when you got to the museum  there wasnt a trace of it i took it for granted that you had been down before me i was furious  but this is ridiculous said ashe who can have taken it there was nobody beside ourselves who knew mr peters was offering the reward what exactly happened last night  i waited until one oclock then i slipped down got into the museum struck a match and looked for the scarab it wasnt there i couldnt believe it at first i struck some more matchesquite a numberbut it was no good the scarab was gone so i went back to bed and thought hard thoughts about you it was silly of me i ought to have known you would not break your word but there didnt seem any other solution of the things disappearance  well somebody must have taken it and the question is what are we to do she laughed it seems to me that we were a little premature in quarreling about how we are to divide that reward it looks as though there wasnt going to be any reward  meantime said ashe gloomily i suppose i have got to go back and tell peters i expect it will break his heart    chapter xi  blandings castle dozed in the calm of an english sunday afternoon all was peace freddie was in bed with orders from the doctor to stay there until further notice baxter had washed his face lord emsworth had returned to his garden fork the rest of the house party strolled about the grounds or sat in them for the day was one of those late spring days that are warm with a premature suggestion of midsummer  aline peters was sitting at the open window of her bedroom which commanded an extensive view of the terraces a pile of letters lay on the table beside her for she had just finished reading her mail the postman came late to the castle on sundays and she had not been able to do this until luncheon was over  aline was puzzled she was conscious of a fit of depression for which she could in no way account she had a feeling that all was not well with the world which was the more remarkable in that she was usually keenly susceptible to weather conditions and reveled in sunshine like a kitten yet here was a day nearly as fine as an american dayand she found no solace in it  she looked down on the terrace as she looked the figure of george emerson appeared walking swiftly and at the sight of him something seemed to tell her that she had found the key to her gloom  there are many kinds of walk george emersons was the walk of mental unrest his hands were clasped behind his back his eyes stared straight in front of him from beneath lowering brows and between his teeth was an unlighted cigar no man who is not a professional politician holds an unlighted cigar in his mouth unless he wishes to irritate and baffle a ticket chopper in the subway or because unpleasant meditations have caused him to forget he has it there plainly then all was not well with george emerson  aline had suspected as much at luncheon and looking back she realized that it was at luncheon her depression had begun the discovery startled her a little she had not been aware or she had refused to admit to herself that georges troubles bulked so large on her horizon she had always told herself that she liked george that george was a dear old friend that george amused and stimulated her but she would have denied she was so wrapped up in george that the sight of him in trouble would be enough to spoil for her the finest day she had seen since she left america  there was something not only startling but shocking in the thought for she was honest enough with herself to recognize that freddie her official loved one might have paced the grounds of the castle chewing an unlighted cigar by the hour without stirring any emotion in her at all  and she was to marry freddie next month this was surely a matter that called for thought she proceeded gazing down the while at the perambulating george to give it thought  alines was not a deep nature she had never pretended to herself that she loved the honorable freddie in the sense in which the word is used in books she liked him and she liked the idea of being connected with the peerage her father liked the idea and she liked her father and the combination of these likings had caused her to reply yes when last autumn freddie swelling himself out like an embarrassed frog and gulping had uttered that memorable speech beginning i say you know its like this dont you knowand ending what i mean is will you marry mewhat  she had looked forward to being placidly happy as the honorable mrs frederick threepwood and then george emerson had reappeared in her life a disturbing element  until today she would have resented the suggestion that she was in love with george she liked to be with him partly because he was so easy to talk to and partly because it was exciting to be continually resisting the will power he made no secret of trying to exercise but today there was a difference she had suspected it at luncheon and she realized it now as she looked down at him from behind the curtain and marked his air of gloom she could no longer disguise it from herself  she felt maternalhorribly maternal george was in trouble and she wanted to comfort him  freddie too was in trouble but did she want to comfort freddie no on the contrary she was already regretting her promise so lightly given before luncheon to go and sit with him that afternoon a wellmarked feeling of annoyance that he should have been so silly as to tumble downstairs and sprain his ankle was her chief sentiment respecting freddie  george emerson continued to perambulate and aline continued to watch him at last she could endure it no longer she gathered up her letters stacked them in a corner of the dressingtable and left the room george had reached the end of the terrace and turned when she began to descend the stone steps outside the front door he quickened his pace as he caught sight of her he halted before her and surveyed her morosely  i have been looking for you he said  and here i am cheer up george whatever is the matter ive been sitting in my room looking at you and you have been simply prowling what has gone wrong  everything  how do you meaneverything  exactly what i say im done for read this  aline took the yellow slip of paper a cable added george i got it this morningmailed on from my rooms in london read it  im trying to it doesnt seem to make sense  george laughed grimly  it makes sense all right  i dont see how you can say that meredith elephant kangaroo  office cipher i was forgetting elephant means seriously ill and unable to attend to duty meredith is one of the partners in my firm in new york  oh im so sorry do you think he is very sick are you very fond of mr meredith  meredith is a good fellow and i like him but if it was simply a matter of his being ill im afraid i could manage to bear up under the news unfortunately kangaroo means return without fail by the next boat  you must return by the next boat aline looked at him in her eyes a slowgrowing comprehension of the situation oh she said at length  i put it stronger than that said george  butthe next boat that means on wednesday  wednesday morning from southampton i shall have to leave here tomorrow  alines eyes were fixed on the blue hills across the valley but she did not see them there was a mist between she was feeling crushed and illtreated and lonely it was as though george was already gone and she left alone in an alien land  but george she said she could find no other words for her protest against the inevitable  its bad luck said emerson quietly but i shouldnt wonder if it is not the best thing that really could have happened it finishes me cleanly instead of letting me drag on and make both of us miserable if this cable hadnt come i suppose i should have gone on bothering you up to the day of your wedding i should have fancied to the last moment that there was a chance for me but this ends me with one punch  even i havent the nerve to imagine that i can work a miracle in the few hours before the train leaves tomorrow i must just make the best of it if we ever meet againand i dont see why we shouldyou will be married my particular brand of mental suggestion doesnt work at long range i shant hope to influence you by telepathy  he leaned on the balustrade at her side and spoke in a low level voice  this thing he said coming as a shock coming out of the blue sky without warningmeredith is the last man in the world you would expect to crack up he looked as fit as a dray horse the last time i saw himsomehow seems to have hammered a certain amount of sense into me odd it never struck me before but i suppose i have been about the most bumptious conceited fool that ever happened  why i should have imagined that there was a sort of irresistible fascination in me which was bound to make you break off your engagement and upset the whole universe simply to win the wonderful reward of marrying me is more than i can understand i suppose it takes a shock to make a fellow see exactly what he really amounts to i couldnt think any more of you than i do but if i could the way you have put up with my mouthing and swaggering and posing as a sort of superman would make me do it you have been wonderful  aline could not speak she felt as though her whole world had been turned upside down in the last quarter of an hour this was a new george emerson a george at whom it was impossible to laugh but an insidiously attractive george her heart beat quickly her mind was not clear but dimly she realized that he had pulled down her chief barrier of defense and that she was more open to attack than she had ever been obstinacy the automatic desire to resist the pressure of a will that attempted to overcome her own had kept her cool and levelheaded in the past with masterfulness she had been able to cope humility was another thing altogether  softheartedness was alines weakness she had never clearly recognized it but it had been partly pity that had induced her to accept freddie he had seemed so downtrodden and sorry for himself during those autumn days when they had first met prudence warned her that strange things might happen if once she allowed herself to pity george emerson  the silence lengthened aline could find nothing to say in her present mood there was danger in speech  we have known each other so long said emerson and i have told you so often that i love you we have come to make almost a joke of it as though we were playing some game it just happens that that is our wayto laugh at things but i am going to say it once again even though it has come to be a sort of catch phrase i love you im reconciled to the fact that i am done for out of the running and that you are going to marry somebody else but i am not going to stop loving you  it isnt a question of whether i should be happier if i forgot you i cant do it its just an impossibilityand thats all there is to it whatever i may be to you you are part of me and you always will be part of me i might just as well try to go on living without breathing as living without loving you  he stopped and straightened himself  thats all i dont want to spoil a perfectly good spring afternoon for you by pulling out the tragic stop i had to say all that but its the last time it shant occur again there will be no tragedy when i step into the train tomorrow is there any chance that you might come and see me off  aline nodded  you will that will be splendid now ill go and pack and break it to my host that i must leave him i expect it will be news to him to learn that i am here i doubt if he knows me by sight  aline stood where he had left her leaning on the balustrade in the fullness of time there came to her the recollection she had promised freddie that shortly after luncheon she would sit with him                                  the honorable freddie draped in purple pyjamas and propped up with many pillows was lying in bed reading gridley quayle investigator alines entrance occurred at a peculiarly poignant moment in the story and gave him a feeling of having been brought violently to earth from a flight in the clouds it is not often an author has the good fortune to grip a reader as the author of gridley quayle gripped freddie  one of the results of his absorbed mood was that he greeted aline with a stare of an even glassier quality than usual his eyes were by nature a trifle prominent and to aline in the overstrung condition in which her talk with george emerson had left her they seemed to bulge at her like a snails a man seldom looks his best in bed and to aline seeing him for the first time at this disadvantage the honorable freddie seemed quite repulsive it was with a feeling of positive panic that she wondered whether he would want her to kiss him  freddie made no such demand he was not one of your demonstrative lovers he contented himself with rolling over in bed and dropping his lower jaw  hello aline  aline sat down on the edge of the bed  well freddie  her betrothed improved his appearance a little by hitching up his jaw as though feeling that would be too extreme a measure he did not close his mouth altogether but he diminished the abyss the honorable freddie belonged to the class of persons who move through life with their mouths always restfully open  it seemed to aline that on this particular afternoon a strange dumbness had descended on her she had been unable to speak to george and now she could not think of anything to say to freddie she looked at him and he looked at her and the clock on the mantelpiece went on ticking  it was that bally cat of aunt anns said freddie at length essaying light conversation it came legging it up the stairs and i took the most frightful toss i hate cats do you hate cats i knew a fellow in london who couldnt stand cats  aline began to wonder whether there was not something permanently wrong with her organs of speech it should have been a simple matter to develop the cat theme but she found herself unable to do so her mind was concentrated to the exclusion of all else on the repellent nature of the spectacle provided by her loved one in pyjamas freddie resumed the conversation  i was just reading a corking book have you ever read these things they come out every month and theyre corking the fellow who writes them must be a corker it beats me how he thinks of these things they are about a detectivea chap called gridley quayle frightfully exciting  an obvious remedy for dumbness struck aline  shall i read to you freddie  rightho good scheme ive got to the top of this page  aline took the papercovered book  seven guns covered him with deadly precision did you get as far as that  yes just beyond its a bit thick dont you know this chappie quayle has been trapped in a lonely house thinking he was going to see a pal in distress and instead of the pal there pop out a whole squad of masked blighters with guns i dont see how hes going to get out of it myself but ill bet he does hes a corker  if anybody could have pitied aline more than she pitied herself as she waded through the adventures of mr quayle it would have been ashe marson he had writhed as he wrote the words and she writhed as she read them the honorable freddie also writhed but with tense excitement  whats the matter dont stop he cried as alines voice ceased  im getting hoarse freddie  freddie hesitated the desire to remain on the trail with gridley struggled with rudimentary politeness  how would it bewould you mind if i just took a look at the rest of it myself we could talk afterward you know i shant be long  of course do read if you want to but do you really like this sort of thing freddie  me rather whydont you  i dont know it seems a littlei dont know  freddie had become absorbed in his story aline did not attempt further analysis of her attitude toward mr quayle she relapsed into silence  it was a silence pregnant with thought for the first time in their relations she was trying to visualize to herself exactly what marriage with this young man would mean hitherto it struck her she had really seen so little of freddie that she had scarcely had a chance of examining him in the crowded world outside he had always seemed a tolerable enough person today somehow he was different everything was different today  this she took it was a fair sample of what she might expect after marriage marriage meantto come to essentialsthat two people were very often and for lengthy periods alone together dependent on each other for mutual entertainment what exactly would it be like being alone often and for lengthy periods with freddie well it would she assumed be like this  its all right said freddie without looking up he did get out he had a bomb on him and he threatened to drop it and blow the place to pieces unless the blighters let him go so they cheesed it i knew he had something up his sleeve  like this aline drew a deep breath it would be like thisforever and ever and everuntil she died she bent forward and stared at him  freddie she said do you love me there was no reply freddie do you love me am i a part of you if you hadnt me would it be like trying to go on living without breathing  the honorable freddie raised a flushed face and gazed at her with an absent eye  eh what he said do ioh yes rather i say one of the blighters has just loosed a rattlesnake into gridley quayles bedroom through the transom  aline rose from her seat and left the room softly the honorable freddie read on unheeding                                  ashe marson had not fallen far short of the truth in his estimate of the probable effect on mr peters of the information that his precious scarab had once more been removed by alien hands and was now farther from his grasp than ever a drawback to success in life is that failure when it does come acquires an exaggerated importance success had made mr peters in certain aspects of his character a spoiled child  at the moment when ashe broke the news he would have parted with half his fortune to recover the scarab its recovery had become a point of honor he saw it as the prize of a contest between his will and that of whatever malignant powers there might be ranged against him in the effort to show him that there were limits to what he could achieve he felt as he had felt in the old days when people sneaked up on him in wall street and tried to loosen his grip on a railroad or a pet stock he was suffering from that form of paranoia which makes men multimillionaires nobody would be foolish enough to become a multimillionaire if it were not for the desire to prove himself irresistible  mr peters obtained a small relief for his feelings by doubling the existing reward and ashe went off in search of joan hoping that this new stimulus acting on their joint brains might develop inspiration  have any fresh ideas been vouchsafed to you he asked you may look on me as baffled  joan shook her head  dont give up she urged think again try to realize what this means mr marson between us we have lost ten thousand dollars in a single night i cant afford it it is like losing a legacy i absolutely refuse to give in without an effort and go back to writing dukeandearl stories for home gossip  the prospect of tackling gridley quayle again  why i was forgetting that you were a writer of detective stories you ought to be able to solve this mystery in a moment ask yourself what would gridley quayle have done  i can answer that gridley quayle would have waited helplessly for some coincidence to happen to help him out  had he no methods  he was full of methods but they never led him anywhere without the coincidence however we might try to figure it out what time did you get to the museum  one oclock  and you found the scarab gone what does that suggest to you  nothing what does it suggest to you  absolutely nothing let us try again whoever took the scarab must have had special information that peters was offering the reward  then why hasnt he been to mr peters and claimed it  true that would seem to be a flaw in the reasoning once again whoever took it must have been in urgent and immediate need of money  and how are we to find out who was in urgent and immediate need of money  exactly how indeed  there was a pause  i should think your mr quayle must have been a great comfort to his clients wasnt he said joan  inductive reasoning i admit seems to have fallen down to a certain extent said ashe we must wait for the coincidence i have a feeling that it will come he paused i am very fortunate in the way of coincidences  are you  ashe looked about him and was relieved to find that they appeared to be out of earshot of their species it was not easy to achieve this position at the castle if you happened to be there as a domestic servant the space provided for the ladies and gentlemen attached to the guests was limited and it was rarely that you could enjoy a stroll without bumping into a maid a valet or a footman but now they appeared to be alone the drive leading to the back regions of the castle was empty as far as the eye could reach there were no signs of servantsupper or lower nevertheless ashe lowered his voice  was it not a strange coincidence he said that you should have come into my life at all  not very said joan prosaically it was quite likely that we should meet sooner or later as we lived on different floors of the same house  it was a coincidence that you should have taken that room  why  ashe felt damped logically no doubt she was right but surely she might have helped him out a little in this difficult situation surely her womans intuition should have told her that a man who has been speaking in a loud and cheerful voice does not lower it to a husky whisper without some reason the hopelessness of his task began to weigh on him  ever since that evening at market blandings station when he realized that he loved her he had been trying to find an opportunity to tell her so and every time they had met the talk had seemed to be drawn irresistibly into practical and unsentimental channels and now when he was doing his best to reason it out that they were twin souls who had been brought together by a destiny it would be foolish to struggle against when he was trying to convey the impression that fate had designed them for each othershe said why it was hard  he was about to go deeper into the matter when from the direction of the castle he perceived the honorable freddies valetmr judsonapproaching that it was this repellent young mans object to break in on them and rob him of his one small chance of inducing joan to appreciate as he did the mysterious workings of providence as they affected herself and him was obvious there was no mistaking the valets desire for conversation he had the air of one brimming over with speech his wonted indolence was cast aside and as he drew nearer he positively ran he was talking before he reached them  miss simpson mr marson its truewhat i said that night its a fact  ashe regarded the intruder with a malevolent eye never fond of mr judson he looked on him now with positive loathing it had not been easy for him to work himself up to the point where he could discuss with joan the mysterious ways of providence for there was that about her which made it hard to achieve sentiment that indefinable something in joan valentine which made for nocturnal raids on other peoples museums also rendered her a somewhat difficult person to talk to about twin souls and destiny the qualities that ashe loved in herher strength her capability her valiant selfsufficingnesswere the very qualities which seemed to check him when he tried to tell her that he loved them  mr judson was still babbling  its true there aint a doubt of it now its been and happened just as i said that night  what did you say which night inquired ashe  that night at dinnerthe first night you two came here dont you remember me talking about freddie and the girl he used to write letters to in londonthe girl i said was so like you miss simpson what was her name again joan valentine that was it the girl at the theater that freddie used to send me with letters to pretty nearly every evening well shes been and done it same as i told you all that night she was jolly likely to go and do shes sticking young freddie up for his letters just as he ought to have known she would do if he hadnt been a young fathead theyre all alike these girlsevery one of them  mr judson paused subjected the surrounding scenery to a cautious scrutiny and resumed  i took a suit of freddies clothes away to brush just now and happeningmr judson paused and gave a little coughhappening to glance at the contents of his pockets i come across a letter i took a sort of look at it before setting it aside and it was from a fellow named jones and it said that this girl valentine was sticking onto young freddies letters what hed written her and would see him blowed if she parted with them under another thousand and as i made it out freddie had already given her five hundred  where he got it is more than i can understand but thats what the letter said this fellow jones said he had passed it to her with his own hands but she wasnt satisfied and if she didnt get the other thousand she was going to bring an action for breach and now freddie has given me a note to take to this jones who is stopping in market blandings  joan had listened to this remarkable speech with a stunned amazement at this point she made her first comment  but that cant be true  saw the letter with my own eyes miss simpson  but  she looked at ashe helplessly their eyes methers wide with perplexity his bright with the light of comprehension  it shows said ashe slowly that he was in immediate and urgent need of money  you bet it does said mr judson with relish it looks to me as though young freddie had about reached the end of his tether this time my word there wont half be a kickup if she does sue him for breach im off to tell mr beach and the rest theyll jump out of their skins his face fell oh lord i was forgetting this note he told me to take it at once  ill take it for you said ashe im not doing anything  mr judsons gratitude was effusive  youre a good fellow marson he said ill do as much for you another time i couldnt hardly bear not to tell a bit of news like this right away i should burst or something  and mr judson with shining face hurried off to the housekeepers room  i simply cant understand it said joan at length my head is going round  cant understand it why its perfectly clear this is the coincidence for which in my capacity of gridley quayle i was waiting i can now resume inductive reasoning weighing the evidence what do we find that young sweep freddie is the man he has the scarab  but its all such a muddle im not holding his letters  for jones purposes you are lets get this jones element in the affair straightened out what do you know of him  he was an enormously fat man who came to see me one night and said he had been sent to get back some letters i told him i had destroyed them ages ago and he went away  well that part of it is clear then he is working a simple but ingenious game on freddie it wouldnt succeed with everybody i suppose but from what i have seen and heard of him freddie isnt strong on intellect he seems to have accepted the story without a murmur what does he do he has to raise a thousand pounds immediately and the raising of the first five hundred has exhausted his credit he gets the idea of stealing the scarab  but why why should he have thought of the scarab at all that is what i cant understand he couldnt have meant to give it to mr peters and claim the reward he couldnt have known that mr peters was offering a reward he couldnt have known that lord emsworth had not got the scarab quite properly he couldnt have knownhe couldnt have known anything  ashes enthusiasm was a trifle damped  theres something in that buti have it jones must have known about the scarab and told him  but how could he have known  yes theres something in that too how could jones have known  he couldnt he had gone by the time aline came that night  i dont quite understand which night  it was the night of the day i first met you i was wondering for a moment whether he could by any chance have overheard aline telling me about the scarab and the reward mr peters was offering for it  overheard that word is like a bugle blast to me nine out of ten of gridley quayles triumphs were due to his having overheard something i think we are now on the right track  i dont how could he have overheard us the door was closed and he was in the street by that time  how do you know he was in the street did you see him out  no but he went  he might have waited on the stairsyou remember how dark they are at number sevenand listened  why  ashe reflected  why why what a beast of a word that isthe detectives bugbear i thought i had it until you saidgreat scott ill tell you why i see it all i have him with the goods his object in coming to see you about the letters was because freddie wanted them back owing to his approaching marriage with miss peterswasnt it  yes  you tell him you have destroyed the letters he goes off am i right  yes  before he is out of the house miss peters is giving her name at the front door put yourself in jones place what does he think he is suspicious he thinks there is some game on he skips upstairs again waits until miss peters has gone into your room then stands outside and listens how about that  i do believe you are right he might quite easily have done that  he did do exactly that i know it as though i had been there in fact it is highly probable i was there you say all this happened on the night we first met i remember coming downstairs that nighti was going out to a vaudeville showand hearing voices in your room i remember it distinctly in all probability i nearly ran into jones  it does all seem to fit in doesnt it  its a clear case there isnt a flaw in it the only question is can i on the evidence go to young freddie and choke the scarab out of him on the whole i think i had better take this note to jones as i promised judson and see whether i cant work something through him yes thats the best plan ill be starting at once                                  perhaps the greatest hardship in being an invalid is the fact that people come and see you and keep your spirits up the honorable freddie threepwood suffered extremely from this his was not a gregarious nature and it fatigued his limited brain powers to have to find conversation for his numerous visitors all he wanted was to be left alone to read the adventures of gridley quayle and when tired of doing that to lie on his back and look at the ceiling and think of nothing  it is your dynamic person your energetic worlds worker who chafes at being laid up with a sprained ankle the honorable freddie enjoyed it from boyhood up he had loved lying in bed and now that fate had allowed him to do this without incurring rebuke he objected to having his reveries broken up by officious relations  he spent his rare intervals of solitude in trying to decide in his mind which of his cousins uncles and aunts was all things considered the greatest nuisance sometimes he would give the palm to colonel horace mant who struck the soldierly notei recollect in a hill campaign in the winter of the year 93 giving my ankle the deuce of a twist anon the more spiritual attitude of the bishop of godalming seemed to annoy him more keenly  sometimes he would head the list with the name of his cousin percylord stockheathwho refused to talk of anything except his late breachofpromise case and the effect the verdict had had on his old governor freddie was in no mood just now to be sympathetic with others on their breachofpromise cases  as he lay in bed reading on monday morning the only flaw in his enjoyment of this unaccustomed solitude was the thought that presently the door was bound to open and some kind inquirer insinuate himself into the room  his apprehensions proved well founded scarcely had he got well into the details of an ingenious plot on the part of a secret society to eliminate gridley quayle by bribing his cooka bad lotto sprinkle choppedup horsehair in his chicken fricassee when the doorknob turned and ashe marson came in  freddie was not the only person who had found the influx of visitors into the sick room a source of irritation the fact that the invalid seemed unable to get a moment to himself had annoyed ashe considerably for some little time he had hung about the passage in which freddies room was situated full of enterprise but unable to make a forward move owing to the throng of sympathizers what he had to say to the sufferer could not be said in the presence of a third party  freddies sensation on perceiving him was one of relief he had been half afraid it was the bishop he recognized ashe as the valet chappie who had helped him to bed on the occasion of his accident it might be that he had come in a respectful way to make inquiries but he was not likely to stop long he nodded and went on reading and then glancing up he perceived ashe standing beside the bed fixing him with a piercing stare  the honorable freddie hated piercing stares one of the reasons why he objected to being left alone with his future fatherinlaw mr j preston peters was that nature had given the millionaire a penetrating pair of eyes and the stress of business life in new york had developed in him a habit of boring holes in people with them a young man had to have a stronger nerve and a clearer conscience than the honorable freddie to enjoy a teteatete with mr peters  though he accepted alines father as a necessary evil and recognized that his position entitled him to look at people as sharply as he liked whatever their feelings he would be hanged if he was going to extend this privilege to mr peters valet this man standing beside him was giving him a look that seemed to his sensitive imagination to have been fired redhot from a gun and this annoyed and exasperated freddie  what do you want he said querulously what are you staring at me like that for  ashe sat down leaned his elbows on the bed and applied the look again from a lower elevation  ah he said  whatever may have been ashes defects so far as the handling of the inductivereasoning side of gridley quayles character was concerned there was one scene in each of his stories in which he never failed that was the scene in the last chapter where quayle confronting his quarry unmasked him quayle might have floundered in the earlier part of the story but in his big scene he was exactly right he was curt crisp and mercilessly compelling  ashe rehearsing this interview in the passage before his entry had decided that he could hardly do better than model himself on the detective so he began to be curt crisp and mercilessly compelling to freddie and after the first few sentences he had that youth gasping for air  i will tell you he said if you can spare me a few moments of your valuable time i will put the facts before you yes press that bell if you wishand i will put them before witnesses lord emsworth will no doubt be pleased to learn that his son whom he trusted is a thief  freddies hand fell limply the bell remained untouched his mouth opened to its fullest extent in the midst of his panic he had a curious feeling that he had heard or read that last sentence somewhere before then he remembered those very words occurred in gridley quayle investigatorthe adventure of the blue ruby  whatwhat do you mean he stammered  i will tell you what i mean on saturday night a valuable scarab was stolen from lord emsworths private museum the case was put into my hands  great scott are you a detective  ah said ashe  life as many a worthy writer has pointed out is full of ironies it seemed to freddie that here was a supreme example of this fact all these years he had wanted to meet a detective and now that his wish had been gratified the detective was detecting him  the case continued ashe severely was placed in my hands i investigated it i discovered that you were in urgent and immediate need of money  how on earth did you do that  ah said ashe i further discovered that you were in communication with an individual named jones  good lord how  ashe smiled quietly  yesterday i had a talk with this man jones who is staying in market blandings why is he staying in market blandings because he had a reason for keeping in touch with you because you were about to transfer to his care something you could get possession of but which only he could dispose ofthe scarab  the honorable freddie was beyond speech he made no comment on this statement ashe continued  i interviewed this man jones i said to him i am in the honorable frederick threepwoods confidence i know everything have you any instructions for me he replied what do you know i answered i know that the honorable frederick threepwood has something he wishes to hand to you but which he has been unable to hand to you owing to having had an accident and being confined to his room he then told me to tell you to let him have the scarab by messenger  freddie pulled himself together with an effort he was in sore straits but he saw one last chance his researches in detective fiction had given him the knowledge that detectives occasionally relaxed their austerity when dealing with a deserving case even gridley quayle could sometimes be softened by a hardluck story freddie could recall half a dozen times when a detected criminal had been spared by him because he had done it all from the best motives he determined to throw himself on ashes mercy  i say you know he said ingratiatingly i think its bally marvelous the way youve deduced everything and so on  well  but i believe you would chuck it if you heard my side of the case  i know your side of the case you think you are being blackmailed by a miss valentine for some letters you once wrote her you are not miss valentine has destroyed the letters she told the man jones so when he went to see her in london he kept your five hundred pounds and is trying to get another thousand out of you under false pretenses  what you cant be right  i am always right  you must be mistaken  i am never mistaken  but how do you know  i have my sources of information  she isnt going to sue me for breach of promise  she never had any intention of doing so  the honorable freddie sank back on the pillows  good egg he said with fervor he beamed happily this he observed is a bit of all right  for a space relief held him dumb then another aspect of the matter struck him and he sat up again with a jerk  i say you dont mean to say that that rotter jones was such a rotter as to do a rotten thing like that  i do  freddie grew plaintive  i trusted that man he said i jolly well trusted him absolutely  i know said ashe there is one born every minute  butthe thing seemed to be filtering slowly into freddies intelligence what i mean to say is iithought he was such a good chap  my short acquaintance with mr jones said ashe leads me to think that he probably isto himself  i wont have anything more to do with him  i shouldnt  dash it ill tell you what ill do the very next time i meet the blighter ill cut him dead i will the rotter five hundred quid hes had off me for nothing and if it hadnt been for you hed have had another thousand im beginning to think that my old governor wasnt so far wrong when he used to curse me for going around with jones and the rest of that crowd he knew a bit by gad well im through with them if the governor ever lets me go to london again i wont have anything to do with them ill jolly well cut the whole bunch and to think that if it hadnt been for you     never mind that said ashe give me the scarab where is it  what are you going to do with it  restore it to its rightful owner  are you going to give me away to the governor  i am not  it strikes me said freddie gratefully that you are a dashed good sort you seem to me to have the making of an absolute topper its under the mattress i had it on me when i fell downstairs and i had to shove it in there  ashe drew it out he stood looking at it absorbed he could hardly believe his quest was at an end and that a small fortune lay in the palm of his hand freddie was eyeing him admiringly  you know he said ive always wanted to meet a detective what beats me is how you chappies find out things  we have our methods  i believe you youre a blooming marvel what first put you on my track  that said ashe would take too long to explain of course i had to do some tense inductive reasoning but i cannot trace every link in the chain for you it would be tedious  not to me  some other time  i say i wonder whether youve ever read any of these thingsthese gridley quayle stories i know them by heart  with the scarab safely in his pocket ashe could contemplate the brightlycolored volume the other extended toward him without active repulsion already he was beginning to feel a sort of sentiment for the depressing quayle as something that had once formed part of his life  do you read these things  i should say not i write them  there are certain supreme moments that cannot be adequately described freddies appreciation of the fact that such a moment had occurred in his life expressed itself in a startled cry and a convulsive movement of all his limbs he shot up from the pillows and gaped at ashe  you write them you dont mean write them  yes  great scott  he would have gone on doubtless to say more but at this moment voices made themselves heard outside the door there was a movement of feet then the door opened and a small procession entered  it was headed by the earl of emsworth following him came mr peters and in the wake of the millionaire were colonel horace mant and the efficient baxter they filed into the room and stood by the bedside ashe seized the opportunity to slip out  freddie glanced at the deputation without interest his mind was occupied with other matters he supposed they had come to inquire after his ankle and he was mildly thankful that they had come in a body instead of one by one the deputation grouped itself about the bed and shuffled its feet there was an atmosphere of awkwardness  erfrederick said lord emsworth freddie my boy  mr peters fiddled dumbly with the coverlet colonel mant cleared his throat the efficient baxter scowled erfreddie my dear boy i fear we have a painfulertask to perform  the words struck straight home at the honorable freddies guilty conscience had they too tracked him down and was he now to be accused of having stolen that infernal scarab a wave of relief swept over him as he realized that he had got rid of the thing a decent chappie like that detective would not give him away all he had to do was to keep his head and stick to stout denial that was the gamestout denial  i dont know what you mean he said defensively  of course you dontdash it said colonel mant were coming to that and i should like to begin by saying that though in a sense it was my fault i fail to see how i could have acted  horace  oh very well i was only trying to explain  lord emsworth adjusted his pincenez and sought inspiration from the wall paper  freddie my boy he began we have a somewhat unpleasanta somewhat erdisturbingwe are compelled to break it to you we are all most pained and astounded and  the efficient baxter spoke it was plain he was in a bad temper  miss peters he snapped has eloped with your friend emerson  lord emsworth breathed a sigh of relief  exactly baxter precisely you have put the thing in a nutshell really my dear fellow you are invaluable  all eyes searched freddies face for signs of uncontrollable emotion the deputation waited anxiously for his first griefstricken cry  eh what said freddie  it is quite true freddie my dear boy she went to london with him on the tenfifty  and if i had not been forcibly restrained said baxter acidly casting a vindictive look at colonel mant i could have prevented it  colonel mant cleared his throat again and put a hand to his mustache  im afraid that is true freddie it was a most unfortunate misunderstanding ill tell you how it happened i chanced to be at the station bookstall when the train came in mr baxter was also in the station the train pulled up and this young fellow emerson got insaid goodby to us dont you know and got in just as the train was about to start miss peters exclaiming george dear im going with you dash it or some such speechproceeded to gohell for leatherto the door of young emersons compartment on which  on which interrupted baxter i made a spring to try and catch her apart from any other consideration the train was already moving and miss peters ran considerable risk of injury i had hardly moved when i felt a violent jerk at my ankle and fell to the ground after i had recovered from the shock which was not immediately i found  the fact is freddie my boy the colonel went on i acted under a misapprehension nobody can be sorrier for the mistake than i but recent events in this house had left me with the impression that mr baxter here was not quite responsible for his actionsoverwork or something i imagined i have seen it happen so often in india dont you know where fellows run amuck and kick up the deuces own delight i am bound to admit that i have been watching mr baxter rather closely lately in the expectation that something of this very kind might happen  of course i now realize my mistake and i have apologized apologized humblydash it but at the moment i was firmly under the impression that our friend here had an attack of some kind and was about to inflict injuries on miss peters if ive seen it happen once in india ive seen it happen a dozen times  i recollect in the hot weather of the year 99or was it 93i think 93one of my native bearershowever i sprang forward and caught the crook of my walking stick on mr baxters ankle and brought him down and by the time explanations were made it was too late the train had gone with miss peters in it  and a telegram has just arrived said lord emsworth to say that they are being married this afternoon at a registrars the whole occurrence is most disturbing  bear it like a man my boy urged colonel mant  to all appearances freddie was bearing it magnificently not a single exclamation either of wrath or pain had escaped his lips one would have said the shock had stunned him or that he had not heard for his face expressed no emotion whatever  the fact was the story had made very little impression on the honorable freddie of any sort his relief at ashes news about joan valentine the stunning joy of having met in the flesh the author of the adventures of gridley quayle the general feeling that all was now right with the worldthese things deprived him of the ability to be greatly distressed  and there was a distinct feeling of reliefactual reliefthat now it would not be necessary for him to get married he had liked aline but whenever he really thought of it the prospect of getting married rather appalled him a chappie looked such an ass getting married it appeared however that some verbal comment on the state of affairs was required of him he searched his mind for something adequate  you mean to say aline has bolted with emerson  the deputation nodded pained nods freddie searched in his mind again the deputation held its breath  well im blowed said freddie fancy that                                  mr peters walked heavily into his room ashe marson was waiting for him there he eyed ashe dully  pack he said  pack  pack were getting out of here by the afternoon train  has anything happened  my daughter has eloped with emerson  what  dont stand there saying what pack  ashe put his hand in his pocket  where shall i put this he asked  for a moment mr peters looked without comprehension at what ashe was holding out then his whole demeanor altered his eyes lit up he uttered a howl of pure rapture  you got it  i got it  where was it who took it how did you choke it out of them how did you find it who had it  i dont know whether i ought to say i dont want to start anything you wont tell anyone  tell anyone what do you take me for do you think i am going about advertising this if i can sneak out without that fellow baxter jumping on my back i shall be satisfied you can take it from me that there wont be any sensational exposures if i can help it who had it  young threepwood  threepwood why did he want it  he needed money and he was going to raise it on  mr peters exploded  and i have been kicking because aline cant marry him and has gone off with a regular fellow like young emerson hes a good boyyoung emerson i knew his folks hell make a name for himself one of these days hes got getup in him and i have been waiting to shoot him because he has taken aline away from that goggleeyed chump up in bed there  why if she had married threepwood i should have had grandchildren who would have sneaked my watch while i was dancing them on my knee there is a taint of some sort in the whole family father sneaks my cheops and sonny sneaks it from father what a gang and the best blood in england if thats englands idea of good blood give me hoboken this settles it i was a chump ever to come to a country like this property isnt safe here im going back to america on the next boat  wheres my check book im going to write you that check right away youve earned it listen young man i dont know what your ideas are but if you arent chained to this country ill make it worth your while to stay on with me they say no ones indispensable but you come mighty near it if i had you at my elbow for a few years id get right back into shape im feeling better now than i have felt in yearsand youve only just started in on me  how about it you can call yourself what you likesecretary or trainer or whatever suits you best what you will be is the fellow who makes me take exercise and stop smoking cigars and generally looks after me how do you feel about it  it was a proposition that appealed both to ashes commercial and to his missionary instincts his only regret had been that the scarab recovered he and mr peters would now he supposed part company he had not liked the idea of sending the millionaire back to the world a halfcured man already he had begun to look on him in the light of a piece of creative work to which he had just set his hand  but the thought of joan gave him pause if this meant separation from joan it was not to be considered  let me think it over he said  well think quick said mr peters                                  it has been said by those who have been through fires earthquakes and shipwrecks that in such times of stress the social barriers are temporarily broken down and the spectacle may be seen of persons of the highest social standing speaking quite freely to persons who are not in society at all and of quite nice people addressing others to whom they have never been introduced the news of aline peters elopement with george emerson carried beyond the greenbaize door by slingsby the chauffeur produced very much the same state of affairs in the servants quarters at blandings castle  it was not only that slingsby was permitted to penetrate into the housekeepers room and tell his story to his social superiors there though that was an absolutely unprecedented occurrence what was really extraordinary was that mere menials discussed the affair with the personal ladies and gentlemen of the castle guests and were allowed to do so uncrushed james the footmanthat pushing individualactually shoved his way into the room and was heard by witnesses to remark to no less a person than mr beach that it was a bit thick  and it is on record that his fellow footman alfred meeting the groom of the chambers in the passage outside positively prodded him in the lower ribs winked and said what a day were having one has to go back to the worst excesses of the french revolution to parallel these outrages it was held by mr beach and mrs twemlow afterward that the social fabric of the castle never fully recovered from this upheaval it may be they took an extreme view of the matter but it cannot be denied that it wrought changes the rise of slingsby is a case in point until this affair took place the chauffeurs standing had never been satisfactorily settled mr beach and mrs twemlow led the party which considered that he was merely a species of coachman but there was a smaller group which dazzled by slingsbys personality openly declared it was not right that he should take his meals in the servants hall with such admitted plebeians as the odd man and the stewardsroom footman  the alinegeorge elopement settled the point once and for all slingsby had carried georges bag to the train slingsby had been standing a few yards from the spot where aline began her dash for the carriage door slingsby was able to exhibit the actual half sovereign with which george had tipped him only five minutes before the great event to send such a public man back to the servants hall was impossible by unspoken consent the chauffeur dined that night in the stewards room from which he was never dislodged  mr judson alone stood apart from the throng that clustered about the chauffeur he was suffering the bitterness of the supplanted a brief while before and he had been the central figure with his story of the letter he had found in the honorable freddies coat pocket now the importance of his story had been engulfed in that of this later and greater sensation mr judson was learning for the first time on what unstable foundations popularity stands  joan was nowhere to be seen in none of the spots where she might have been expected to be at such a time was she to be found ashe had almost given up the search when going to the back door and looking out as a last chance he perceived her walking slowly on the gravel drive  she greeted ashe with a smile but something was plainly troubling her she did not speak for a moment and they walked side by side  what is it said ashe at length what is the matter  she looked at him gravely  gloom she said despondency mr marsona sort of flat feeling dont you hate things happening  i dont quite understand  well this affair of aline for instance its so big it makes one feel as though the whole world had altered i should like nothing to happen ever and life just to jog peacefully along thats not the gospel i preached to you in arundell street is it i thought i was an advanced apostle of action but i seem to have changed im afraid i shall never be able to make clear what i do mean i only know i feel as though i have suddenly grown old these things are such milestones already i am beginning to look on the time before aline behaved so sensationally as terribly remote tomorrow it will be worse and the day after that worse still i can see that you dont in the least understand what i mean  yes i door i think i do what it comes to in a few words is that somebody you were fond of has gone out of your life is that it  joan nodded  yesat least that is partly it i didnt really know aline particularly well beyond having been at school with her but youre right its not so much what has happened as what it represents that matters this elopement has marked the end of a phase of my life i think i have it now my life has been such a series of jerks i dash alongthen something happens which stops that bit of my life with a jerk and then i have to start over againa new bit i think im getting tired of jerks i want something stodgy and continuous  im like one of the old bus horses that could go on forever if people got off without making them stop its the having to get the bus moving again that wears one out this little section of my life since we came here is over and it is finished for good ive got to start the bus going again on a new road and with a new set of passengers i wonder whether the old horses used to be sorry when they dropped one lot of passengers and took on a lot of strangers  a sudden dryness invaded ashes throat he tried to speak but found no words joan went on  do you ever get moods when life seems absolutely meaningless its like a badlyconstructed story with all sorts of characters moving in and out who have nothing to do with the plot and when somebody comes along that you think really has something to do with the plot he suddenly drops out after a while you begin to wonder what the story is about and you feel that its about nothingjust a jumble  there is one thing said ashe that knits it together  what is that  the love interest  their eyes met and suddenly there descended on ashe confidence he felt cool and alert sure of himself as in the old days he had felt when he ran races and the nerveracking hours of waiting past he listened for the starters gun subconsciously he was aware he had always been a little afraid of joan and that now he was no longer afraid  joan will you marry me  her eyes wandered from his face he waited  i wonder she said softly you think that is the solution  yes  how can you tell she broke out we scarcely know each other i shant always be in this mood i may get restless again i may find it is the jerks that i really like  you wont  youre very confident  i am absolutely confident  she travels fastest who travels alone misquoted joan  what is the good said ashe of traveling fast if youre going round in a circle i know how you feel ive felt the same myself you are an individualist you think there is something tremendous just round the corner and that you can get it if you try hard enough there isntor if there is it isnt worth getting life is nothing but a mutual aid association i am going to help old petersyou are going to help mei am going to help you  help me to do what  make life coherent instead of a jumble  mr marson  dont call me mr marson  ashe you dont know what you are doing you dont know me ive been knocking about the world for five years and im hardhard right through i should make you wretched  you are not in the least hardand you know it listen to me joan wheres your sense of fairness you crash into my life turn it upside down dig me out of my quiet groove revolutionize my whole existence and now you propose to drop me and pay no further attention to me is it fair  but i dont we shall always be the best of friends  we shallbut we will get married first  you are determined  i am  joan laughed happily  how perfectly splendid i was terrified lest i might have made you change your mind i had to say all i did to preserve my selfrespect after proposing to you yes i did how strange it is that men never seem to understand a woman however plainly she talks you dont think i was really worrying because i had lost aline do you i thought i was going to lose you and it made me miserable you couldnt expect me to say it in so many words but i thoughti was hopingyou guessed i practically said it ashe what are you doing  ashe paused for a moment to reply  i am kissing you he said  but you mustnt theres a scullery maid or somebody looking through the kitchen window she will see us  ashe drew her to him  scullery maids have few pleasures he said theirs is a dull life let her see us    chapter xii  the earl of emsworth sat by the sick bed and regarded the honorable freddie almost tenderly  i fear freddie my dear boy this has been a great shock to you  eh what yesrather deuce of a shock govnor  i have been thinking it over my boy and perhaps i have been a little hard on you when your ankle is better i have decided to renew your allowance and you may return to london as you do not seem happy in the country though how any reasonable being can prefer  the honorable freddie started popeyed to a sitting posture  my word not really  his father nodded  i say govnor you really are a topper you really are you know i know just how you feel about the country and the jolly old birds and trees and chasing the bally slugs off the young geraniums and all that sort of thing but somehow its never quite hit me the same way its the way im built i suppose i like asphalt streets and crowds and dodging taxis and meeting chappies at the club and popping in at the empire for half an hour and so forth and theres something about having an allowancei dont know    sort of makes you chuck your chest out and feel youre someone i dont know how to thank you govnor youreyoure an absolute sportsman this is the most priceless bit of work youve ever done i feel like a twoyearold i dont know when ive felt so braced iireally you know govnor im most awfully grateful  exactly said lord emsworth ahprecisely but freddie my boy he added not without pathos there is just one thing more do you think thatwith an effortfor my sakeyou could endeavor this time not to make aa damned fool of yourself  he eyed his offspring wistfully  govnor said the honorable freddie firmly ill have a jolly good stab at it
