18873301	confidence  by henry james      chapter i  it was in the early days of april bernard longueville had been spending the winter in rome he had travelled northward with the consciousness of several social duties that appealed to him from the further side of the alps but he was under the charm of the italian spring and he made a pretext for lingering he had spent five days at siena where he had intended to spend but two and still it was impossible to continue his journey he was a young man of a contemplative and speculative turn and this was his first visit to italy so that if he dallied by the way he should not be harshly judged he had a fancy for sketching and it was on his conscience to take a few pictorial notes there were two old inns at siena both of them very shabby and very dirty the one at which longueville had taken up his abode was entered by a dark pestiferous archway surmounted by a sign which at a distance might have been read by the travellers as the dantean injunction to renounce all hope the other was not far off and the day after his arrival as he passed it he saw two ladies going in who evidently belonged to the large fraternity of anglosaxon tourists and one of whom was young and carried herself very well longueville had his shareor more than his shareof gallantry and this incident awakened a regret if he had gone to the other inn he might have had charming company at his own establishment there was no one but an aesthetic german who smoked bad tobacco in the diningroom he remarked to himself that this was always his luck and the remark was characteristic of the man it was charged with the feeling of the moment but it was not absolutely just it was the result of an acute impression made by the particular occasion but it failed in appreciation of a providence which had sprinkled longuevilles career with happy accidentsaccidents especially in which his characteristic gallantry was not allowed to rust for want of exercise he lounged however contentedly enough through these bright still days of a tuscan april drawing much entertainment from the high picturesqueness of the things about him siena a few years since was a flawless gift of the middle ages to the modern imagination no other italian city could have been more interesting to an observer fond of reconstructing obsolete manners this was a taste of bernard longuevilles who had a relish for serious literature and at one time had made several lively excursions into mediaeval history his friends thought him very clever and at the same time had an easy feeling about him which was a tribute to his freedom from pedantry he was clever indeed and an excellent companion but the real measure of his brilliancy was in the success with which he entertained himself he was much addicted to conversing with his own wit and he greatly enjoyed his own society clever as he often was in talking with his friends i am not sure that his best things as the phrase is were not for his own ears and this was not on account of any cynical contempt for the understanding of his fellowcreatures it was simply because what i have called his own society was more of a stimulus than that of most other people and yet he was not for this reason fond of solitude he was on the contrary a very sociable animal it must be admitted at the outset that he had a nature which seemed at several points to contradict itself as will probably be perceived in the course of this narration  he entertained himself greatly with his reflections and meditations upon sienese architecture and early tuscan art upon italian streetlife and the geological idiosyncrasies of the apennines if he had only gone to the other inn that nicelooking girl whom he had seen passing under the dusky portal with her face turned away from him might have broken bread with him at this intellectual banquet then came a day however when it seemed for a moment that if she were disposed she might gather up the crumbs of the feast longueville every morning after breakfast took a turn in the great square of sienathe vast piazza shaped like a horseshoe where the market is held beneath the windows of that crenellated palace from whose overhanging cornice a tall straight tower springs up with a movement as light as that of a single plume in the bonnet of a captain here he strolled about watching a brown contadino disembarrass his donkey noting the progress of half an hours chaffer over a bundle of carrots wishing a young girl with eyes like animated agates would let him sketch her and gazing up at intervals at the beautiful slim tower as it played at contrasts with the large blue air after he had spent the greater part of a week in these grave considerations he made up his mind to leave siena but he was not content with what he had done for his portfolio siena was eminently sketchable but he had not been industrious on the last morning of his visit as he stood staring about him in the crowded piazza and feeling that in spite of its picturesqueness this was an awkward place for setting up an easel he bethought himself by contrast of a quiet corner in another part of the town which he had chanced upon in one of his first walksan angle of a lonely terrace that abutted upon the citywall where three or four superannuated objects seemed to slumber in the sunshinethe open door of an empty church with a faded fresco exposed to the air in the arch above it and an ancient beggarwoman sitting beside it on a threelegged stool the little terrace had an old polished parapet about as high as a mans breast above which was a view of strange sadcolored hills outside to the left the wall of the town made an outward bend and exposed its rugged and rusty complexion there was a smooth stone bench set into the wall of the church on which longueville had rested for an hour observing the composition of the little picture of which i have indicated the elements and of which the parapet of the terrace would form the foreground the thing was what painters call a subject and he had promised himself to come back with his utensils this morning he returned to the inn and took possession of them and then he made his way through a labyrinth of empty streets lying on the edge of the town within the wall like the superfluous folds of a garment whose wearer has shrunken with old age he reached his little grassgrown terrace and found it as sunny and as private as before the old mendicant was mumbling petitions sacred and profane at the church door but save for this the stillness was unbroken the yellow sunshine warmed the brown surface of the citywall and lighted the hollows of the etruscan hills longueville settled himself on the empty bench and arranging his little portable apparatus began to ply his brushes he worked for some time smoothly and rapidly with an agreeable sense of the absence of obstacles it seemed almost an interruption when in the silent air he heard a distant bell in the town strike noon shortly after this there was another interruption the sound of a soft footstep caused him to look up whereupon he saw a young woman standing there and bending her eyes upon the graceful artist a second glance assured him that she was that nice girl whom he had seen going into the other inn with her mother and suggested that she had just emerged from the little church he suspected howeveri hardly know whythat she had been looking at him for some moments before he perceived her it would perhaps be impertinent to inquire what she thought of him but longueville in the space of an instant made two or three reflections upon the young lady one of them was to the effect that she was a handsome creature but that she looked rather bold the burden of the other was thatyes decidedlyshe was a compatriot she turned away almost as soon as she met his eyes he had hardly time to raise his hat as after a moments hesitation he proceeded to do she herself appeared to feel a certain hesitation she glanced back at the church door as if under the impulse to retrace her steps she stood there a moment longerlong enough to let him see that she was a person of easy attitudesand then she walked away slowly to the parapet of the terrace here she stationed herself leaning her arms upon the high stone ledge presenting her back to longueville and gazing at rural italy longueville went on with his sketch but less attentively than before he wondered what this young lady was doing there alone and then it occurred to him that her companionher mother presumablywas in the church the two ladies had been in the church when he arrived women liked to sit in churches they had been there more than half an hour and the mother had not enough of it even yet the young lady however at present preferred the view that longueville was painting he became aware that she had placed herself in the very centre of his foreground his first feeling was that she would spoil it his second was that she would improve it little by little she turned more into profile leaning only one arm upon the parapet while the other hand holding her folded parasol hung down at her side she was motionless it was almost as if she were standing there on purpose to be drawn yes certainly she improved the picture her profile delicate and thin defined itself against the sky in the clear shadow of a coquettish hat her figure was light she bent and leaned easily she wore a gray dress fastened up as was then the fashion and displaying the broad edge of a crimson petticoat she kept her position she seemed absorbed in the view is she posingis she attitudinizing for my benefit longueville asked of himself and then it seemed to him that this was a needless assumption for the prospect was quite beautiful enough to be looked at for itself and there was nothing impossible in a pretty girl having a love of fine landscape but posing or not he went on i will put her into my sketch she has simply put herself in it will give it a human interest there is nothing like having a human interest so with the ready skill that he possessed he introduced the young girls figure into his foreground and at the end of ten minutes he had almost made something that had the form of a likeness if she will only be quiet for another ten minutes he said the thing will really be a picture unfortunately the young lady was not quiet she had apparently had enough of her attitude and her view she turned away facing longueville again and slowly came back as if to reenter the church to do so she had to pass near him and as she approached he instinctively got up holding his drawing in one hand she looked at him again with that expression that he had mentally characterized as bold a few minutes beforewith dark intelligent eyes her hair was dark and dense she was a strikingly handsome girl  i am so sorry you moved he said confidently in english you were soso beautiful  she stopped looking at him more directly than ever and she looked at his sketch which he held out toward her at the sketch however she only glanced whereas there was observation in the eye that she bent upon longueville he never knew whether she had blushed he afterward thought she might have been frightened nevertheless it was not exactly terror that appeared to dictate her answer to longuevilles speech  i am much obliged to you dont you think you have looked at me enough  by no means i should like so much to finish my drawing  i am not a professional model said the young lady  no that s my difficulty longueville answered laughing i cant propose to remunerate you  the young lady seemed to think this joke in indifferent taste she turned away in silence but something in her expression in his feeling at the time in the situation incited longueville to higher play he felt a lively need of carrying his point  you see it will be pure kindness he went ona simple act of charity five minutes will be enough treat me as an italian beggar  she had laid down his sketch and had stepped forward he stood there obsequious clasping his hands and smiling  his interruptress stopped and looked at him again as if she thought him a very odd person but she seemed amused now at any rate she was not frightened she seemed even disposed to provoke him a little  i wish to go to my mother she said  where is your mother the young man asked  in the church of course i did nt come here alone  of course not but you may be sure that your mother is very contented i have been in that little church it is charming she is just resting there she is probably tired if you will kindly give me five minutes more she will come out to you  five minutes the young girl asked  five minutes will do i shall be eternally grateful longueville was amused at himself as he said this he cared infinitely less for his sketch than the words appeared to imply but somehow he cared greatly that this graceful stranger should do what he had proposed  the graceful stranger dropped an eye on the sketch again  is your picture so good as that she asked  i have a great deal of talent he answered laughing you shall see for yourself when it is finished  she turned slowly toward the terrace again  you certainly have a great deal of talent to induce me to do what you ask and she walked to where she had stood before longueville made a movement to go with her as if to show her the attitude he meant but pointing with decision to his easel she said  you have only five minutes he immediately went back to his work and she made a vague attempt to take up her position you must tell me if this will do she added in a moment  it will do beautifully longueville answered in a happy tone looking at her and plying his brush it is immensely good of you to take so much trouble  for a moment she made no rejoinder but presently she said  of course if i pose at all i wish to pose well  you pose admirably said longueville  after this she said nothing and for several minutes he painted rapidly and in silence he felt a certain excitement and the movement of his thoughts kept pace with that of his brush it was very true that she posed admirably she was a fine creature to paint her prettiness inspired him and also her audacity as he was content to regard it for the moment he wondered about herwho she was and what she wasperceiving that the socalled audacity was not vulgar boldness but the play of an original and probably interesting character it was obvious that she was a perfect lady but it was equally obvious that she was irregularly clever longuevilles little figure was a successa charming success he thought as he put on the last touches while he was doing this his models companion came into view she came out of the church pausing a moment as she looked from her daughter to the young man in the corner of the terrace then she walked straight over to the young girl she was a delicate little gentlewoman with a light quick step  longuevilles five minutes were up so leaving his place he approached the two ladies sketch in hand the elder one who had passed her hand into her daughters arm looked up at him with clear surprised eyes she was a charming old woman her eyes were very pretty and on either side of them above a pair of fine dark brows was a band of silvery hair rather coquettishly arranged  it is my portrait said her daughter as longueville drew near this gentleman has been sketching me  sketching you dearest murmured her mother was nt it rather sudden  very suddenvery abrupt exclaimed the young girl with a laugh  considering all that it s very good said longueville offering his picture to the elder lady who took it and began to examine it i cant tell you how much i thank you he said to his model  it s very well for you to thank me now she replied you really had no right to begin  the temptation was so great  we should resist temptation and you should have asked my leave  i was afraid you would refuse it and you stood there just in my line of vision  you should have asked me to get out of it  i should have been very sorry besides it would have been extremely rude  the young girl looked at him a moment  yes i think it would but what you have done is ruder  it is a hard case said longueville what could i have done then decently  it s a beautiful drawing murmured the elder lady handing the thing back to longueville her daughter meanwhile had not even glanced at it  you might have waited till i should go away this argumentative young person continued  longueville shook his head  i never lose opportunities  you might have sketched me afterwards from memory  longueville looked at her smiling  judge how much better my memory will be now  she also smiled a little but instantly became serious  for myself it s an episode i shall try to forget i dont like the part i have played in it  may you never play a less becoming one cried longueville i hope that your mother at least will accept a memento of the occasion and he turned again with his sketch to her companion who had been listening to the girls conversation with this enterprising stranger and looking from one to the other with an air of earnest confusion wont you do me the honor of keeping my sketch he said i think it really looks like your daughter  oh thank you thank you i hardly dare murmured the lady with a deprecating gesture  it will serve as a kind of amends for the liberty i have taken longueville added and he began to remove the drawing from its paper block  it makes it worse for you to give it to us said the young girl  oh my dear i am sure it s lovely exclaimed her mother it s wonderfully like you  i think that also makes it worse  longueville was at last nettled the young ladys perversity was perhaps not exactly malignant but it was certainly ungracious she seemed to desire to present herself as a beautiful tormentress  how does it make it worse he asked with a frown  he believed she was clever and she was certainly ready now however she reflected a moment before answering  that you should give us your sketch she said at last  it was to your mother i offered it longueville observed  but this observation the fruit of his irritation appeared to have no effect upon the young girl  is nt it what painters call a study she went on a study is of use to the painter himself your justification would be that you should keep your sketch and that it might be of use to you  my daughter is a study sir you will say said the elder lady in a little light conciliating voice and graciously accepting the drawing again  i will admit said longueville that i am very inconsistent set it down to my esteem madam he added looking at the mother  that s for you mamma said his model disengaging her arm from her mothers hand and turning away  the mamma stood looking at the sketch with a smile which seemed to express a tender desire to reconcile all accidents  it s extremely beautiful she murmured and if you insist on my taking it  i shall regard it as a great honor  very well then with many thanks i will keep it she looked at the young man a moment while her daughter walked away longueville thought her a delightful little person she struck him as a sort of transfigured quakeressa mystic with a practical side i am sure you think she s a strange girl she said  she is extremely pretty  she is very clever said the mother  she is wonderfully graceful  ah but she s good cried the old lady  i am sure she comes honestly by that said longueville expressively while his companion returning his salutation with a certain scrupulous grace of her own hurried after her daughter  longueville remained there staring at the view but not especially seeing it he felt as if he had at once enjoyed and lost an opportunity after a while he tried to make a sketch of the old beggarwoman who sat there in a sort of palsied immobility like a rickety statue at a churchdoor but his attempt to reproduce her features was not gratifying and he suddenly laid down his brush she was not pretty enoughshe had a bad profile        chapter ii  two months later bernard longueville was at venice still under the impression that he was leaving italy he was not a man who made plans and held to them he made them indeedfew men made morebut he made them as a basis for variation he had gone to venice to spend a fortnight and his fortnight had taken the form of eight enchanting weeks he had still a sort of conviction that he was carrying out his plans for it must be confessed that where his pleasure was concerned he had considerable skill in accommodating his theory to his practice his enjoyment of venice was extreme but he was roused from it by a summons he was indisposed to resist this consisted of a letter from an intimate friend who was living in germanya friend whose name was gordon wright he had been spending the winter in dresden but his letter bore the date of badenbaden as it was not long i may give it entire  i wish very much that you would come to this place i think you have been here before so that you know how pretty it is and how amusing i shall probably be here the rest of the summer there are some people i know and whom i want you to know be so good as to arrive then i will thank you properly for your various italian rhapsodies i cant reply on the same scalei have nt the time do you know what i am doing i am making love i find it a most absorbing occupation that is literally why i have not written to you before i have been making love ever since the last of may it takes an immense amount of time and everything else has got terribly behindhand i dont mean to say that the experiment itself has gone on very fast but i am trying to push it forward i have nt yet had time to test its success but in this i want your help you know we great physicists never make an experiment without an assistanta humble individual who burns his fingers and stains his clothes in the cause of science but whose interest in the problem is only indirect i want you to be my assistant and i will guarantee that your burns and stains shall not be dangerous she is an extremely interesting girl and i really want you to see heri want to know what you think of her she wants to know you too for i have talked a good deal about you there you have it if gratified vanity will help you on the way seriously this is a real request i want your opinion your impression i want to see how she will affect you i dont say i ask for your advice that of course you will not undertake to give but i desire a definition a characterization you know you toss off those things i dont see why i should nt tell you all thisi have always told you everything i have never pretended to know anything about women but i have always supposed that you knew everything you certainly have always had the tone of that sort of omniscience so come here as soon as possible and let me see that you are not a humbug she s a very handsome girl  longueville was so much amused with this appeal that he very soon started for germany in the reader gordon wrights letter will perhaps excite surprise rather than hilarity but longueville thought it highly characteristic of his friend what it especially pointed to was gordons want of imaginationa deficiency which was a matter of common jocular allusion between the two young men each of whom kept a collection of acknowledged oddities as a playground for the others wit bernard had often spoken of his comrades want of imagination as a bottomless pit into which gordon was perpetually inviting him to lower himself my dear fellow bernard said you must really excuse me i cannot take these subterranean excursions i should lose my breath down there i should never come up alive you know i have dropped things downlittle jokes and metaphors little fantasies and paradoxesand i have never heard them touch bottom this was an epigram on the part of a young man who had a lively play of fancy but it was none the less true that gordon wright had a firmlytreading rather than a winged intellect every phrase in his letter seemed to bernard to march in stoutsoled walkingboots and nothing could better express his attachment to the process of reasoning things out than this proposal that his friend should come and make a chemical analysisa geometrical surveyof the lady of his love that i shall have any difficulty in forming an opinion and any difficulty in expressing it when formedof this he has as little idea as that he shall have any difficulty in accepting it when expressed so bernard reflected as he rolled in the train to munich gordons mind he went on has no atmosphere his intellectual process goes on in the void there are no currents and eddies to affect it no high winds nor hot suns no changes of season and temperature his premises are neatly arranged and his conclusions are perfectly calculable  yet for the man on whose character he so freely exercised his wit bernard longueville had a strong affection it is nothing against the validity of a friendship that the parties to it have not a mutual resemblance there must be a basis of agreement but the structure reared upon it may contain a thousand disparities these two young men had formed an alliance of old in college days and the bond between them had been strengthened by the simple fact of its having survived the sentimental revolutions of early life its strongest link was a sort of mutual respect their tastes their pursuits were different but each of them had a high esteem for the others character it may be said that they were easily pleased for it is certain that neither of them had performed any very conspicuous action they were highly civilized young americans born to an easy fortune and a tranquil destiny and unfamiliar with the glitter of golden opportunities if i did not shrink from disparaging the constitution of their native land for their own credit i should say that it had never been very definitely proposed to these young gentlemen to distinguish themselves on reaching manhood they had each come into property sufficient to make violent exertion superfluous gordon wright indeed had inherited a large estate their wants being tolerably modest they had not been tempted to strive for the glory of building up commercial fortunesthe most obvious career open to young americans they had indeed embraced no career at all and if summoned to give an account of themselves would perhaps have found it hard to tell any very impressive story gordon wright was much interested in physical science and had ideas of his own on what is called the endowment of research his ideas had taken a practical shape and he had distributed money very freely among the investigating classes after which he had gone to spend a couple of years in germany supposing it to be the land of laboratories here we find him at present cultivating relations with several learned bodies and promoting the study of various tough branches of human knowledge by paying the expenses of difficult experiments the experiments it must be added were often of his own making and he must have the honor of whatever brilliancy attaches in the estimation of the world to such pursuits it was not indeed a brilliancy that dazzled bernard longueville who however was not easily dazzled by anything it was because he regarded him in so plain and direct a fashion that bernard had an affection for his friendan affection to which it would perhaps be difficult to assign a definite cause personal sympathies are doubtless caused by something but the causes are remote mysterious to our daily vision like those of the particular state of the weather we content ourselves with remarking that it is fine or that it rains and the enjoyment of our likes and dislikes is by no means apt to borrow its edge from the keenness of our analysis longueville had a relish for fine qualitysuperior savour and he was sensible of this merit in the simple candid manly affectionate nature of his comrade which seemed to him an excellent thing of its kind gordon wright had a tender heart and a strong willa combination which when the understanding is not too limited is often the motive of admirable actions there might sometimes be a question whether gordons understanding were sufficiently unlimited but the impulses of a generous temper often play a useful part in filling up the gaps of an incomplete imagination and the general impression that wright produced was certainly that of intelligent goodnature the reasons for appreciating bernard longueville were much more manifest he pleased superficially as well as fundamentally nature had sent him into the world with an armful of good gifts he was very goodlookingtall dark agile perfectly finished so goodlooking that he might have been a fool and yet be forgiven as has already been intimated however he was far from being a fool he had a number of talents which during three or four years that followed his leaving college had received the discipline of the study of the law he had not made much of the law but he had made something of his talents he was almost always spoken of as accomplished people asked why he did nt do something this question was never satisfactorily answered the feeling being that longueville did more than many people in causing it to be asked moreover there was one thing he did constantlyhe enjoyed himself this is manifestly not a career and it has been said at the outset that he was not attached to any of the recognized professions but without going into details he was a charming fellowclever urbane freehanded and with that fortunate quality in his appearance which is known as distinction       chapter iii  he had not specified in writing to gordon wright the day on which he should arrive at badenbaden it must be confessed that he was not addicted to specifying days he came to his journeys end in the evening and on presenting himself at the hotel from which his friend had dated his letter he learned that gordon wright had betaken himself after dinner according to the custom of badenbaden to the grounds of the conversationhouse it was eight oclock and longueville after removing the stains of travel sat down to dine his first impulse had been to send for gordon to come and keep him company at his repast but on second thought he determined to make it as brief as possible having brought it to a close he took his way to the kursaal the great german wateringplace is one of the prettiest nooks in europe and of a summer evening in the gaming days fiveandtwenty years ago it was one of the most brilliant scenes the lighted windows of the great temple of hazard of as chaste an architecture as if it had been devoted to a much purer divinity opened wide upon the gardens and groves the little river that issues from the bosky mountains of the black forest flowed with an air of brooklike innocence past the expensive hotels and lodginghouses the orchestra in a high pavilion on the terrace of the kursaal played a discreet accompaniment to the conversation of the ladies and gentlemen who scattered over the large expanse on a thousand little chairs preferred for the time the beauties of nature to the shuffle of coin and the calculation of chance while the faint summer stars twinkling above the vague black hills and woods looked down at the indifferent groups without venturing to drop their light upon them  longueville noting all this went straight into the gamingrooms he was curious to see whether his friend being fond of experiments was trying combinations at roulette but he was not to be found in any of the gilded chambers among the crowd that pressed in silence about the tables so that bernard presently came and began to wander about the lamplit terrace where innumerable groups seated and strolling made the place a gigantic conversazione it seemed to him very agreeable and amusing and he remarked to himself that for a man who was supposed not to take especially the epicurean view of life gordon wright in coming to baden had certainly made himself comfortable longueville went his way glancing from one cluster of talkers to another and at last he saw a face which brought him to a stop he stood a moment looking at it he knew he had seen it before he had an excellent memory for faces but it was some time before he was able to attach an identity to this one where had he seen a little elderly lady with an expression of timorous vigilance and a band of hair as softly white as a doves wing the answer to the question presently camewhere but in a grassgrown corner of an old italian town the lady was the mother of his inconsequent model so that this mysterious personage was probably herself not far off before longueville had time to verify this induction he found his eyes resting upon the broad back of a gentleman seated close to the old lady and who turning away from her was talking to a young girl it was nothing but the back of this gentleman that he saw but nevertheless with the instinct of true friendship he recognized in this featureless expanse the robust personality of gordon wright in a moment he had stepped forward and laid his hand upon wrights shoulder  his friend looked round and then sprang up with a joyous exclamation and grasp of the hand  my dear fellowmy dear bernard what on earthwhen did you arrive  while bernard answered and explained a little he glanced from his friends good gratified face at the young girl with whom wright had been talking and then at the lady on the other side who was giving him a bright little stare he raised his hat to her and to the young girl and he became conscious as regards the latter of a certain disappointment she was very pretty she was looking at him but she was not the heroine of the little incident of the terrace at siena  it s just like longueville you know gordon wright went on he always comes at you from behind he s so awfully fond of surprises he was laughing he was greatly pleased he introduced bernard to the two ladies you must know mrs vivian you must know miss blanche evers  bernard took his place in the little circle he wondered whether he ought to venture upon a special recognition of mrs vivian then it seemed to him that he should leave the option of this step with the lady especially as he had detected recognition in her eye but mrs vivian ventured upon nothing special she contented herself with soft generalitieswith remarking that she always liked to know when people would arrive that for herself she never enjoyed surprises  and yet i imagine you have had your share said longueville with a smile he thought this might remind her of the moment when she came out of the little church at siena and found her daughter posturing to an unknown painter  but mrs vivian turning her benignant head about gave but a superficial reply  oh i have had my share of everything good and bad i dont complain of anything and she gave a little deprecating laugh  gordon wright shook hands with bernard again he seemed really very glad to see him longueville remembering that gordon had written to him that he had been making love began to seek in his countenance for the ravages of passion for the moment however they were not apparent the excellent honest fellow looked placid and contented gordon wright had a clear gray eye short straight flaxen hair and a healthy diffusion of color his features were thick and rather irregular but his countenancein addition to the merit of its expressionderived a certain grace from a powerful yellow moustache to which its wearer occasionally gave a martial twist gordon wright was not tall but he was strong and in his whole person there was something wellplanted and sturdy he almost always dressed in lightcolored garments and he wore round his neck an eternal blue cravat when he was agitated he grew very red while he questioned longueville about his journey and his health his whereabouts and his intentions the latter among his own replies endeavored to read in wrights eyes some account of his present situation was that pretty girl at his side the ambiguous object of his adoration and in that case what was the function of the elder lady and what had become of her argumentative daughter perhaps this was another a younger daughter though indeed she bore no resemblance to either of longuevilles friends gordon wright in spite of bernards interrogative glances indulged in no optical confidences he had too much to tell he would keep his story till they should be alone together it was impossible that they should adjourn just yet to social solitude the two ladies were under gordons protection mrs vivianbernard felt a satisfaction in learning her name it was as if a curtain half pulled up and stopped by a hitch had suddenly been raised altogethermrs vivian sat looking up and down the terrace at the crowd of loungers and talkers with an air of tender expectation she was probably looking for her elder daughter and longueville could not help wishing also that this young lady would arrive meanwhile he saw that the young girl to whom gordon had been devoting himself was extremely pretty and appeared eminently approachable longueville had some talk with her reflecting that if she were the person concerning whom gordon had written him it behooved him to appear to take an interest in her this view of the case was confirmed by gordon wrights presently turning away to talk with mrs vivian so that his friend might be at liberty to make acquaintance with their companion  though she had not been with the others at siena it seemed to longueville with regard to her too that this was not the first time he had seen her she was simply the american pretty girl whom he had seen a thousand times it was a numerous sisterhood pervaded by a strong family likeness this young lady had charming eyes of the color of gordons cravats which looked everywhere at once and yet found time to linger in some places where longuevilles own eyes frequently met them she had soft brown hair with a silkygolden thread in it beautifully arranged and crowned by a smart little hat that savoured of paris she had also a slender little figure neatly rounded and delicate narrow hands prettily gloved she moved about a great deal in her place twisted her little flexible body and tossed her head fingered her hair and examined the ornaments of her dress she had a great deal of conversation longueville speedily learned and she expressed herself with extreme frankness and decision he asked her to begin with if she had been long at baden but the impetus of this question was all she required turning her charming conscious coquettish little face upon him she instantly began to chatter  i have been here about four weeks i dont know whether you call that long it does nt seem long to me i have had such a lovely time i have met ever so many people here i knowevery day some one turns up now you have turned up today  ah but you dont know me said longueville laughing  well i have heard a great deal about you cried the young girl with a pretty little stare of contradiction i think you know a great friend of mine miss ella maclane of baltimore she s travelling in europe now longuevilles memory did not instantly respond to this signal but he expressed that rapturous assent which the occasion demanded and even risked the observation that the young lady from baltimore was very pretty she s far too lovely his companion went on i have often heard her speak of you i think you know her sister rather better than you know her she has not been out very long she is just as interesting as she can be her hair comes down to her feet she s travelling in norway she has been

and captain lovelock captain lovelock has gone with her into the rooms to explain the gamblingmiss vivian always wants everything explained i am sure i understood it the first time i looked at the tables have you ever seen miss vivian she s very much admired she s so very unusual black hair s so uncommoni see you have got it toobut i mean for young ladies i am sure one sees everything here there s a woman that comes to the tablesa portuguese countesswho has hair that is positively blue i cant say i admire it when it comes to that shade blue s my favorite color but i prefer it in the eyes continued longuevilles companion resting upon him her own two brilliant little specimens of the tint  he listened with that expression of clear amusement which is not always an indication of high esteem but which even pretty chatterers who are not the reverse of estimable often prefer to masculine inattention and while he listened bernard according to his wont made his reflections he said to himself that there were two kinds of pretty girlsthe acutely conscious and the finely unconscious mrs vivians protege was a member of the former category she belonged to the genus coquette we all have our conception of the indispensable and the indispensable to this young lady was a spectator almost any male biped would serve the purpose to her spectator she addressed for the moment the whole volume of her beingaddressed it in her glances her attitudes her exclamations in a hundred little experiments of tone and gesture and position and these rustling artifices were so innocent and obvious that the directness of her desire to be well with her observer became in itself a grace it led bernard afterward to say to himself that the natural vocation and metier of little girls for whom existence was but a shimmering surface was to prattle and ruffle their plumage their view of life and its duties was as simple and superficial as that of an oriental bayadere it surely could not be with regard to this transparent little flirt that gordon wright desired advice you could literally see the daylightor rather the baden gaslighton the other side of her she sat there for a minute turning her little empty head to and fro and catching bernards eye every time she moved she had for the instant the air of having exhausted all topics just then a young lady with a gentleman at her side drew near to the little group and longueville perceiving her instantly got up from his chair  there s a beauty of the unconscious class he said to himself he knew her face very well he had spent half an hour in copying it  here comes miss vivian said gordon wright also getting up as if to make room for the daughter near the mother  she stopped in front of them smiling slightly and then she rested her eyes upon longueville their gaze at first was full and direct but it expressed nothing more than civil curiosity this was immediately followed however by the light of recognitionrecognition embarrassed and signalling itself by a blush  miss vivians companion was a powerful handsome fellow with a remarkable auburn beard who struck the observer immediately as being uncommonly well dressed he carried his hands in the pockets of a little jacket the buttonhole of which was adorned with a blooming rose he approached blanche evers smiling and dandling his body a little and making her two or three jocular bows  well i hope you have lost every penny you put on the table said the young girl by way of response to his obeisances  he began to laugh and repeat them  i dont care what i lose so longso long  so long as what pray  so long as you let me sit down by you and he dropped very gallantly into a chair on the other side of her  i wish you would lose all your property she replied glancing at bernard  it would be a very small stake said captain lovelock would you really like to see me reduced to misery  while this graceful dialogue rapidly established itself miss vivian removed her eyes from longuevilles face and turned toward her mother but gordon wright checked this movement by laying his hand on longuevilles shoulder and proceeding to introduce his friend  this is the accomplished creature mr bernard longueville of whom you have heard me speak one of his accomplishments as you see is to drop down from the moon  no i dont drop from the moon said bernard laughing i drop fromsiena he offered his hand to miss vivian who for an appreciable instant hesitated to extend her own then she returned his salutation without any response to his allusion to siena  she declined to take a seat and said she was tired and preferred to go home with this suggestion her mother immediately complied and the two ladies appealed to the indulgence of little miss evers who was obliged to renounce the society of captain lovelock she enjoyed this luxury however on the way to mrs vivians lodgings toward which they all slowly strolled in the sociable baden fashion longueville might naturally have found himself next miss vivian but he received an impression that she avoided him she walked in front and gordon wright strolled beside her though longueville noticed that they appeared to exchange but few words he himself offered his arm to mrs vivian who paced along with a little lightlywavering step making observations upon the beauties of baden and the respective merits of the hotels       chapter iv  which of them is it asked longueville of his friend after they had bidden goodnight to the three ladies and to captain lovelock who went off to begin as he said the evening they stood when they had turned away from the door of mrs vivians lodgings in the little roughpaved german street  which of them is what gordon asked staring at his companion  oh come said longueville you are not going to begin to play at modesty at this hour did nt you write to me that you had been making violent love  violent no  the more shame to you has your lovemaking been feeble  his friend looked at him a moment rather soberly  i suppose you thought it a queer documentthat letter i wrote you  i thought it characteristic said longueville smiling  is nt that the same thing  not in the least i have never thought you a man of oddities gordon stood there looking at him with a serious eye half appealing half questioning but at these last words he glanced away even a very modest man may wince a little at hearing himself denied the distinction of a few variations from the common type longueville made this reflection and it struck him also that his companion was in a graver mood than he had expected though why after all should he have been in a state of exhilaration your letter was a very natural interesting one bernard added  well you see said gordon facing his companion again i have been a good deal preoccupied  obviously my dear fellow  i want very much to marry  it s a capital idea said longueville  i think almost as well of it his friend declared as if i had invented it it has struck me for the first time  these words were uttered with a mild simplicity which provoked longueville to violent laughter  my dear fellow he exclaimed you have after all your little oddities  singularly enough however gordon wright failed to appear flattered by this concession  i did nt send for you to laugh at me he said  ah but i have nt travelled three hundred miles to cry seriously solemnly then it is one of these young ladies that has put marriage into your head  not at all i had it in my head  having a desire to marry you proceeded to fall in love  i am not in love said gordon wright with some energy  ah then my dear fellow why did you send for me  wright looked at him an instant in silence  because i thought you were a good fellow as well as a clever one  a good fellow repeated longueville i dont understand your confounded scientific nomenclature but excuse me i wont laugh i am not a clever fellow but i am a good one he paused a moment and then laid his hand on his companions shoulder my dear gordon it s no use you are in love  well i dont want to be said wright  heavens what a horrible sentiment  i want to marry with my eyes open i want to know my wife you dont know people when you are in love with them your impressions are colored  they are supposed to be slightly and you object to color  well as i say i want to know the woman i marry as i should know any one else i want to see her as clearly  depend upon it you have too great an appetite for knowledge you set too high an esteem upon the dry light of science  ah said gordon promptly of course i want to be fond of her  bernard in spite of his protest began to laugh again  my dear gordon you are better than your theories your passionate heart contradicts your frigid intellect i repeat ityou are in love  please dont repeat it again said wright  bernard took his arm and they walked along  what shall i call it then you are engaged in making studies for matrimony  i dont in the least object to your calling it that my studies are of extreme interest  and one of those young ladies is the fair volume that contains the precious lesson said longueville or perhaps your textbook is in two volumes  no there is one of them i am not studying at all i never could do two things at once  that proves you are in love one cant be in love with two women at once but one may perfectly have two of themor as many as you pleaseup for a competitive examination however as i asked you before which of these young ladies is it that you have selected  gordon wright stopped abruptly eying his friend  which should you say  ah that s not a fair question bernard urged it would be invidious for me to name one rather than the other and if i were to mention the wrong one i should feel as if i had been guilty of a rudeness towards the other dont you see  gordon saw perhaps but he held to his idea of making his companion commit himself  never mind the rudeness i will do the same by you some day to make it up which of them should you think me likely to have taken a fancy to on general grounds now from what you know of me he proposed this problem with an animated eye  you forget his friend said that though i know thank heaven a good deal of you i know very little of either of those girls i have had too little evidence  yes but you are a man who notices that s why i wanted you to come  i spoke only to miss evers  yes i know you have never spoken to miss vivian gordon wright stood looking at bernard and urging his point as he pronounced these words bernard felt peculiarly conscious of his gaze the words represented an illusion and longueville asked himself quickly whether it were not his duty to dispel it the answer came more slowly than the question but still it came in the shape of a negative the illusion was but a trifling one and it was not for him after all to let his friend know that he had already met miss vivian it was for the young girl herself and since she had not done soalthough she had the opportunitylongueville said to himself that he was bound in honor not to speak these reflections were very soon made but in the midst of them our young man thanks to a great agility of mind found time to observe tacitly that it was odd just there to see his honor thrusting in its nose miss vivian in her own good time would doubtless mention to gordon the little incident of siena it was bernards fancy for a moment that he already knew it and that the remark he had just uttered had an ironical accent but this impression was completely dissipated by the tone in which he addedall the same you noticed her  oh yes she is very noticeable  well then said gordon you will see i should like you to make it out of course if i am really giving my attention to one to the exclusion of the other it will be easy to discover  longueville was half amused half irritated by his friends own relish of his little puzzle the exclusion of the other has an awkward sound he answered as they walked on am i to notice that you are very rude to one of the young ladies  oh dear no do you think there is a danger of that  well said longueville i have already guessed  gordon wright remonstrated dont guess yetwait a few days i wont tell you now  let us see if he does nt tell me said bernard privately and he meditated a moment when i presented myself you were sitting very close to miss evers and talking very earnestly your head was bent toward herit was very loverlike decidedly miss evers is the object  for a single instant gordon wright hesitated and theni hope i have nt seemed rude to miss vivian he exclaimed  bernard broke into a light laugh my dear gordon you are very much in love he remarked as they arrived at their hotel       chapter v  life at badenbaden proved a very sociable affair and bernard longueville perceived that he should not lack opportunity for the exercise of those gifts of intelligence to which gordon wright had appealed the two friends took long walks through the woods and over the mountains and they mingled with human life in the crowded precincts of the conversationhouse they engaged in a ramble on the morning after bernards arrival and wandered far away over hill and dale the baden forests are superb and the composition of the landscape is most effective there is always a bosky dell in the foreground and a purple crag embellished with a ruined tower at a proper angle a little timberandplaster village peeps out from a tangle of plumtrees and a wayside tavern in comfortable recurrence solicits concessions to the national custom of frequent refreshment gordon wright who was a dogged pedestrian always enjoyed doing his ten miles and longueville who was an incorrigible stroller felt a keen relish for the picturesqueness of the country but it was not on this occasion of the charms of the landscape or the pleasures of locomotion that they chiefly discoursed their talk took a more closely personal turn it was a year since they had met and there were many questions to ask and answer many arrears of gossip to make up as they stretched themselves on the grass on a sunwarmed hillside beneath a great german oak whose arms were quiet in the blue summer air there was a lively exchange of impressions opinions speculations anecdotes gordon wright was surely an excellent friend he took an interest in you he asked no idle questions and made no vague professions but he entered into your situation he examined it in detail and what he learned he never forgot months afterwards he asked you about things which you yourself had forgotten he was not a man of whom it would be generally said that he had the gift of sympathy but he gave his attention to a friends circumstances with a conscientious fixedness which was at least very far removed from indifference bernard had the gift of sympathyor at least he was supposed to have it but even he familiar as he must therefore have been with the practice of this charming virtue was at times so struck with his friends fine faculty of taking other peoples affairs seriously that he constantly exclaimed to himself the excellent fellowthe admirable nature  bernard had two or three questions to ask about the three persons who appeared to have formed for some time his companions principal society but he was indisposed to press them he felt that he should see for himself and at a prospect of entertainment of this kind his fancy always kindled gordon was moreover at first rather shy of confidences though after they had lain on the grass ten minutes there was a good deal said  now what do you think of her face gordon asked after staring a while at the sky through the oakboughs  of course in future said longueville whenever you make use of the personal pronoun feminine i am to understand that miss vivian is indicated  her name is angela said gordon but of course i can scarcely call her that  it s a beautiful name longueville rejoined but i may say in answer to your question that i am not struck with the fact that her face corresponds to it  you dont think her face beautiful then  i dont think it angelic but how can i tell i have only had a glimpse of her  wait till she looks at you and speakswait till she smiles said gordon  i dont think i saw her smileat least not at me directly i hope she will longueville went on but who is shethis beautiful girl with the beautiful name  she is her mothers daughter said gordon wright i dont really know a great deal more about her than that  and who is her mother  a delightful little woman devoted to miss vivian she is a widow and angela is her only child they have lived a great deal in europe they have but a modest income over here mrs vivian says they can get a lot of things for their money that they cant get at home so they stay you see when they are at home they live in new york they know some of my people there when they are in europe they live about in different places they are fond of italy they are extremely nice it s impossible to be nicer they are very fond of books fond of music and art and all that they always read in the morning they only come out rather late in the day  i see they are very superior people said bernard and little miss everswhat does she do in the morning i know what she does in the evening  i dont know what her regular habits are i have nt paid much attention to her she is very pretty  wunderschon said bernard but you were certainly talking to her last evening  of course i talk to her sometimes she is totally different from angela viviannot nearly so cultivated but she seems very charming  a little silly eh bernard suggested  she certainly is not so wise as miss vivian  that would be too much to ask eh but the vivians as kind as they are wise have taken her under their protection  yes said gordon they are to keep her another month or two her mother has gone to marienbad which i believe is thought a dull place for a young girl so that as they were coming here they offered to bring her with them mrs evers is an old friend of mrs vivian who on leaving italy had come up to dresden to be with her they spent a month there together mrs evers had been there since the winter i think mrs vivian really came to badenbadenshe would have preferred a less expensive placeto bring blanche evers her mother wanted her so much to come  and was it for her sake that captain lovelock came too bernard asked  gordon wright stared a moment  i m sure i dont know  of course you cant be interested in that said bernard smiling who is captain lovelock  he is an englishman i believe he is what s called aristocratically connectedthe younger brother of a lord or something of that sort  is he a clever man  i have nt talked with him much but i doubt it he is rather rakish he plays a great deal  but is that considered here a proof of rakishness asked bernard have nt you played a little yourself  gordon hesitated a moment  yes i have played a little i wanted to try some experiments i had made some arithmetical calculations of probabilities which i wished to test  bernard gave a long laugh  i am delighted with the reasons you give for amusing yourself arithmetical calculations  i assure you they are the real reasons said gordon blushing a little  that s just the beauty of it you were not afraid of being drawn in as little miss evers says  i am never drawn in whatever the thing may be i go in or i stay out but i am not drawn said gordon wright  you were not drawn into coming with mrs vivian and her daughter from dresden to this place  i did nt come with them i came a week later  my dear fellow said bernard that distinction is unworthy of your habitual candor  well i was not fascinated i was not overmastered i wanted to come to baden  i have no doubt you did had you become very intimate with your friends in dresden  i had only seen them three times  after which you followed them to this place ah dont say you were not fascinated cried bernard laughing and springing to his feet       chapter vi  that evening in the gardens of the kursaal he renewed acquaintance with angela vivian her mother came as usual to sit and listen to the music accompanied by blanche evers who was in turn attended by captain lovelock this little party found privacy in the crowd they seated themselves in a quiet corner in an angle of one of the barriers of the terrace while the movement of the brilliant baden world went on around them gordon wright engaged in conversation with mrs vivian while bernard enjoyed an interview with her daughter this young lady continued to ignore the fact of their previous meeting and our hero said to himself that all he wished was to know what she preferredhe would rigidly conform to it he conformed to her present programme he had ventured to pronounce the word siena the evening before but he was careful not to pronounce it again she had her reasons for her own reserve he wondered what they were and it gave him a certain pleasure to wonder he enjoyed the consciousness of their having a secret together and it became a kind of entertaining suspense to see how long she would continue to keep it for himself he was in no hurry to let the daylight in the little incident at siena had been in itself a charming affair but miss vivians present attitude gave it a sort of mystic consecration he thought she carried it off very wellthe theory that she had not seen him before last evening she had been slightly confused but now she was as selfpossessed as if the line she had taken were a matter of conscience why should it be a matter of conscience was she in love with gordon wright and did she wish in consequence to forgetand wish him not to suspectthat she had ever received an expression of admiration from another man this was not likely it was not likely at least that miss vivian wished to pass for a prodigy of innocence for if to be admired is to pay a tribute to corruption it was perfectly obvious that so handsome a girl must have tasted of the tree of knowledge as for her being in love with gordon wright that of course was another affair and bernard did not pretend as yet to have an opinion on this point beyond hoping very much that she might be  he was not wrong in the impression of her good looks that he had carried away from the short interview at siena she had a charmingly chiselled face with a free pure outline a clear fair complexion and the eyes and hair of a dusky beauty her features had a firmness which suggested tranquillity and yet her expression was light and quick a combinationor a contradictionwhich gave an original stamp to her beauty bernard remembered that he had thought it a trifle bold but he now perceived that this had been but a vulgar misreading of her dark direct observant eye the eye was a charming one bernard discovered in it little by little all sorts of things and miss vivian was for the present simply a handsome intelligent smiling girl he gave her an opportunity to make an allusion to siena he said to her that his friend told him that she and her mother had been spending the winter in italy  oh yes said angela vivian we were in the far south we were five months at sorrento  and nowhere else  we spent a few days in rome we usually prefer the quiet places that is my mothers taste  it was not your mothers taste then said bernard that brought you to baden  she looked at him a moment  you mean that baden is not quiet  longueville glanced about at the moving murmuring crowd at the lighted windows of the conversationhouse at the great orchestra perched up in its pagoda  this is not my idea of absolute tranquillity  nor mine either said miss vivian i am not fond of absolute tranquillity  how do you arrange it then with your mother  again she looked at him a moment with her clever slightly mocking smile  as you see by making her come where i wish  you have a strong will said bernard i see that  no i have simply a weak mother but i make sacrifices too sometimes  what do you call sacrifices  well spending the winter at sorrento  bernard began to laugh and then he told her she must have had a very happy lifeto call a winter at sorrento a sacrifice  it depends upon what one gives up said miss vivian  what did you give up  she touched him with her mocking smile again  that is not a very civil question asked in that way  you mean that i seem to doubt your abnegation  you seem to insinuate that i had nothing to renounce i gave upi gave up and she looked about her considering a littlei gave up society  i am glad you remember what it was said bernard if i have seemed uncivil let me make it up when a woman speaks of giving up society what she means is giving up admiration you can never have given up thatyou can never have escaped from it you must have found it even at sorrento  it may have been there but i never found it it was very respectfulit never expressed itself  that is the deepest kind said bernard  i prefer the shallower varieties the young girl answered  well said bernard you must remember that although shallow admiration expresses itself all the admiration that expresses itself is not shallow  miss vivian hesitated a moment  some of it is impertinent she said looking straight at him rather gravely  bernard hesitated about as long  when it is impertinent it is shallow that comes to the same thing  the young girl frowned a little  i am not sure that i understandi am rather stupid but you see how right i am in my taste for such places as this i have to come here to hear such ingenious remarks  you should add that my coming as well has something to do with it  everything said miss vivian  everything does no one else make ingenious remarks does nt my friend wright  mr wright says excellent things but i should not exactly call them ingenious remarks  it is not what wright says it s what he does that s the charm said bernard  his companion was silent for a moment that s not usually a charm good conduct is not thought pleasing  it surely is not thought the reverse bernard exclaimed  it does nt rankin the opinion of most peopleamong the things that make men agreeable  it depends upon what you call agreeable  exactly so said miss vivian it all depends on that  but the agreeable bernard went onit is nt after all fortunately such a subtle idea the world certainly is agreed to think that virtue is a beautiful thing  miss vivian dropped her eyes a moment and then looking up  is it a charm she asked  for me there is no charm without it bernard declared  i am afraid that for me there is said the young girl  bernard was puzzledhe who was not often puzzled his companion struck him as altogether too clever to be likely to indulge in a silly affectation of cynicism and yet without this how could one account for her sneering at virtue  you talk as if you had sounded the depths of vice he said laughing what do you know about other than virtuous charms  i know of course nothing about vice but i have known virtue when it was very tiresome  ah then it was a poor affair it was poor virtue the best virtue is never tiresome  miss vivian looked at him a little with her fine discriminating eye  what a dreadful thing to have to think any virtue poor  this was a touching reflection and it might have gone further had not the conversation been interrupted by mrs vivians appealing to her daughter to aid a defective recollection of a story about a spanish family they had met at biarritz with which she had undertaken to entertain gordon wright after this the little circle was joined by a party of american friends who were spending a week at baden and the conversation became general       chapter vii  but on the following evening bernard again found himself seated in friendly colloquy with this interesting girl while gordon wright discoursed with her mother on one side and little blanche evers chattered to the admiring eyes of captain lovelock on the other  you and your mother are very kind to that little girl our hero said you must be a great advantage to her  angela vivian directed her eyes to her neighbors and let them rest a while on the young girls little fidgeting figure and her fresh coquettish face for some moments she said nothing and to longueville turning over several things in his mind and watching her it seemed that her glance was one of disfavor he divined he scarcely knew how that her esteem for her pretty companion was small  i dont know that i am very kind said miss vivian i have done nothing in particular for her  mr wright tells me you came to this place mainly on her account  i came for myself said miss vivian the consideration you speak of perhaps had weight with my mother  you are not an easy person to say appreciative things to bernard rejoined one is tempted to say them but you dont take them  the young girl colored as she listened to this observation  i dont think you know she murmured looking away then set it down to modesty she added  that of course is what i have done to what else could one possibly attribute an indifference to compliments  there is something else one might be proud  there you are again bernard exclaimed you wont even let me praise your modesty  i would rather you should rebuke my pride  that is so humble a speech that it leaves no room for rebuke  for a moment miss vivian said nothing  men are singularly base she declared presently with a little smile they dont care in the least to say things that might help a person they only care to say things that may seem effective and agreeable  i see you think that to say agreeable things is a great misdemeanor  it comes from their vanity miss vivian went on as if she had not heard him they wish to appear agreeable and get credit for cleverness and tendresse no matter how silly it would be for another person to believe them  bernard was a good deal amused and a little nettled  women then he said have rather a fondness for producing a bad impressionthey like to appear disagreeable  his companion bent her eyes upon her fan for a moment as she opened and closed it  they are capable of resigning themselves to itfor a purpose  bernard was moved to extreme merriment  for what purpose  i dont know that i mean for a purpose said miss vivian but for a necessity  ah what an odious necessity  necessities usually are odious but women meet them men evade them and shirk them  i contest your proposition women are themselves necessities but they are not odious ones and bernard added in a moment one could nt evade them if they were  i object to being called a necessity said angela vivian it diminishes ones merit  ah but it enhances the charm of life  for men doubtless  the charm of life is very great bernard went on looking up at the dusky hills and the summer stars seen through a sort of mist of music and talk and of powdery light projected from the softly lurid windows of the gamingrooms the charm of life is extreme i am unacquainted with odious necessities i object to nothing  angela vivian looked about her as he had donelooked perhaps a moment longer at the summer stars and if she had not already proved herself a young lady of a contradictory turn it might have been supposed she was just then tacitly admitting the charm of life to be considerable  do you suppose miss evers often resigns herself to being disagreeablefor a purpose asked longueville who had glanced at captain lovelocks companion again  she cant be disagreeable she is too gentle too soft  do you mean too silly  i dont know that i call her silly she is not very wise but she has no pretensionsabsolutely noneso that one is not struck with anything incongruous  what a terrible description i suppose one ought to have a few pretensions  you see one comes off more easily without them said miss vivian  do you call that coming off easily  she looked at him a moment gravely  i am very fond of blanche she said  captain lovelock is rather fond of her bernard went on  the girl assented  he is completely fascinatedhe is very much in love with her  and do they mean to make an international match  i hope not my mother and i are greatly troubled  is nt he a good fellow  he is a good fellow but he is a mere trifler he has nt a penny i believe and he has very expensive habits he gambles a great deal we dont know what to do  you should send for the young ladys mother  we have written to her pressingly she answers that blanche can take care of herself and that she must stay at marienbad to finish her cure she has just begun a new one  ah well said bernard doubtless blanche can take care of herself  for a moment his companion said nothing then she exclaimed  it s what a girl ought to be able to do  i am sure you are said bernard  she met his eyes and she was going to make some rejoinder but before she had time to speak her mothers little clear conciliatory voice interposed mrs vivian appealed to her daughter as she had done the night before  dear angela what was the name of the gentleman who delivered that delightful course of lectures that we heard in geneva onwhat was the titlethe redeeming features of the pagan morality  angela flushed a little  i have quite forgotten his name mamma she said without looking round  come and sit by me my dear and we will talk them over i wish mr wright to hear about them mrs vivian went on  do you wish to convert him to paganism bernard asked  the lectures were very dull they had no redeeming features said angela getting up but turning away from her mother she stood looking at bernard longueville he saw she was annoyed at her mothers interference every now and then she said i take a turn through the gamingrooms the last time captain lovelock went with me will you come tonight  bernard assented with expressive alacrity he was charmed with her not wishing to break off her conversation with him  ah we ll all go said mrs vivian who had been listening and she invited the others to accompany her to the kursaal  they left their places but angela went first with bernard longueville by her side and the idea of her having publicly braved her mother as it were for the sake of his society lent for the moment an almost ecstatic energy to his tread if he had been tempted to presume upon his triumph however he would have found a check in the fact that the young girl herself tasted very soberly of the sweets of defiance she was silent and grave she had a manner which took the edge from the wantonness of filial independence yet for all this bernard was pleased with his position and as he walked with her through the lighted and crowded rooms where they soon detached themselves from their companions he felt that peculiar satisfaction which best expresses itself in silence angela looked a while at the rows of still attentive faces fixed upon the luminous green circle across which little heaps of louis dor were being pushed to and fro and she continued to say nothing then at last she exclaimed simply come away they turned away and passed into another chamber in which there was no gambling it was an immense apartment apparently a ballroom but at present it was quite unoccupied there were green velvet benches all around it and a great polished floor stretched away shining in the light of chandeliers adorned with innumerable glass drops miss vivian stood a moment on the threshold then she passed in and they stopped in the middle of the place facing each other and with their figures reflected as if they had been standing on a sheet of ice there was no one in the room they were entirely alone  why dont you recognize me bernard murmured quickly  recognize you  why do you seem to forget our meeting at siena  she might have answered if she had answered immediately but she hesitated and while she did so something happened at the other end of the room which caused her to shift her glance a green velvet portiere suspended in one of the doorwaysnot that through which our friends had passedwas lifted and gordon wright stood there holding it up and looking at them his companions were behind him  ah here they are cried gordon in his loud clear voice  this appeared to strike angela vivian as an interruption and bernard saw it very much in the same light       chapter viii  he forbore to ask her his question againshe might tell him at her convenience but the days passed by and she never told himshe had her own reasons bernard talked with her very often conversation formed indeed the chief entertainment of the quiet little circle of which he was a member they sat on the terrace and talked in the mingled starlight and lamplight and they strolled in the deep green forests and wound along the side of the gentle baden hills under the influence of colloquial tendencies the black forest is a country of almost unbroken shade and in the still days of midsummer the whole place was covered with a motionless canopy of verdure our friends were not extravagant or audacious people and they looked at baden life very much from the outsidethey sat aloof from the brightly lighted drama of professional revelry among themselves as well however a little drama went forward in which each member of the company had a part to play bernard longueville had been surprised at first at what he would have called miss vivians approachablenessat the frequency with which he encountered opportunities for sitting near her and entering into conversation he had expected that gordon wright would deem himself to have established an anticipatory claim upon the young ladys attention and that in pursuance of this claim he would occupy a recognized place at her side gordon was after all wooing her it was very natural he should seek her society in fact he was never very far off but bernard for three or four days had the anomalous consciousness of being still nearer presently however he perceived that he owed this privilege simply to his friends desire that he should become acquainted with miss vivianshould receive a vivid impression of a person in whom gordon was so deeply interested after this result might have been supposed to be attained gordon wright stepped back into his usual place and showed her those small civilities which were the only homage that the quiet conditions of their life rendered possiblewalked with her talked with her brought her a book to read a chair to sit upon a couple of flowers to place in the bosom of her gown treated her in a word with a sober but by no means inexpressive gallantry he had not been making violent love as he told longueville and these demonstrations were certainly not violent bernard said to himself that if he were not in the secret a spectator would scarcely make the discovery that gordon cherished an even very safely tended flame angela vivian on her side was not strikingly responsive there was nothing in her deportment to indicate that she was in love with her systematic suitor she was perfectly gracious and civil she smiled in his face when he shook hands with her she looked at him and listened when he talked she let him stroll beside her in the lichtenthal alley she read or appeared to read the books he lent her and she decorated herself with the flowers he offered she seemed neither bored nor embarrassed neither irritated nor oppressed but it was bernards belief that she took no more pleasure in his attentions than a pretty girl must always take in any recognition of her charms if she s not indifferent he said to himself she is at any rate impartialprofoundly impartial  it was not till the end of a week that gordon wright told him exactly how his business stood with miss vivian and what he had reason to expect and hopea week during which their relations had been of the happiest and most comfortable cast and during which bernard rejoicing in their long walks and talks in the charming weather in the beauty and entertainment of the place and in other things besides had not ceased to congratulate himself on coming to baden bernard after the first day had asked his friend no questions he had a great respect for opportunity coming either to others or to himself and he left gordon to turn his lantern as fitfully as might be upon the subject which was tacitly open between them but of which as yet only the mere edges had emerged into light gordon on his side seemed content for the moment with having his clever friend under his hand he reserved him for final appeal or for some other mysterious use  you cant tell me you dont know her now he said one evening as the two young men strolled along the lichtenthal alleynow that you have had a whole weeks observation of her  what is a weeks observation of a singularly clever and complicated woman bernard asked  ah your week has been of some use you have found out she is complicated gordon rejoined  my dear gordon longueville exclaimed i dont see what it signifies to you that i should find miss vivian out when a man s in love what need he care what other people think of the loved object  it would certainly be a pity to care too much but there is some excuse for him in the loved object being as you say complicated  nonsense that s no excuse the loved object is always complicated  gordon walked on in silence a moment  well then i dont care a button what you think  bravo that s the way a man should talk cried longueville  gordon indulged in another fit of meditation and then he said  now that leaves you at liberty to say what you please  ah my dear fellow you are ridiculous said bernard  that s precisely what i want you to say you always think me too reasonable  well i go back to my first assertion i dont know miss viviani mean i dont know her to have opinions about her i dont suppose you wish me to string you off a dozen mere banalitesshe s a charming girlevidently a superior personhas a great deal of style  oh no said gordon i know all that but at any rate he added you like her eh  i do more said longueville i admire her  is that doing more asked gordon reflectively  well the greater whichever it is includes the less  you wont commit yourself said gordon my dear bernard he added i thought you knew such an immense deal about women  gordon wright was of so kindly and candid a nature that it is hardly conceivable that this remark should have been framed to make bernard commit himself by putting him on his mettle such a view would imply indeed on gordons part a greater familiarity with the uses of irony than he had ever possessed as well as a livelier conviction of the irritable nature of his friends vanity in fact however it may be confided to the reader that bernard was pricked in a tender place though the resentment of vanity was not visible in his answer  you were quite wrong he simply said i am as ignorant of women as a monk in his cloister  you try to prove too much you dont think her sympathetic and as regards this last remark gordon wright must be credited with a certain ironical impulse  bernard stopped impatiently  i ask you again what does it matter to you what i think of her  it matters in this sensethat she has refused me  refused you then it is all over and nothing matters  no it is nt over said gordon with a positive headshake dont you see it is nt over  bernard smiled laid his hand on his friends shoulder and patted it a little  your attitude might almost pass for that of resignation  i m not resigned said gordon wright  of course not but when were you refused  gordon stood a minute with his eyes fixed on the ground then at last looking up  three weeks agoa fortnight before you came but let us walk along he said and i will tell you all about it  i proposed to her three weeks ago said gordon as they walked along my heart was very much set upon it i was very hard hiti was deeply smitten she had been very kind to meshe had been charmingi thought she liked me then i thought her mother was pleased and would have liked it mrs vivian in fact told me as much for of course i spoke to her first well angela does like meor at least she didand i see no reason to suppose she has changed only she did nt like me enough she said the friendliest and pleasantest things to me but she thought that she knew me too little and that i knew her even less she made a great point of thatthat i had no right as yet to trust her i told her that if she would trust me i was perfectly willing to trust her but she answered that this was poor reasoning she said that i was trustworthy and that she was not andin short all sorts of nonsense she abused herself roundlyaccused herself of no end of defects  what defects for instance  oh i have nt remembered them she said she had a bad temperthat she led her mother a dreadful life now poor mrs vivian says she is an angel  ah yes bernard observed mrs vivian says that very freely  angela declared that she was jealous ungenerous unforgivingall sorts of things i remember she said i am very false and i think she remarked that she was cruel  but this did nt put you off said bernard  not at all she was making up  she makes up very well bernard exclaimed laughing  do you call that well  i mean it was very clever  it was not clever from the point of view of wishing to discourage me  possibly but i am sure said bernard that if i had been present at your interviewexcuse the impudence of the hypothesisi should have been struck with the young ladys and he paused a moment  with her what  with her ability  well her ability was not sufficient to induce me to give up my idea she told me that after i had known her six months i should detest her  i have no doubt she could make you do it if she should try that s what i mean by her ability  she calls herself cruel said gordon but she has not had the cruelty to try she has been very reasonableshe has been perfect i agreed with her that i would drop the subject for a while and that meanwhile we should be good friends we should take time to know each other better and act in accordance with further knowledge there was no hurry since we trusted each otherwrong as my trust might be she had no wish that i should go away i was not in the least disagreeable to her she liked me extremely and i was perfectly free to try and please her only i should drop my proposal and be free to take it up again or leave it alone later as i should choose if she felt differently then i should have the benefit of it and if i myself felt differently i should also have the benefit of it  that s a very comfortable arrangement and that s your present situation asked bernard  gordon hesitated a moment  more or less but not exactly  miss vivian feels differently said bernard  not that i know of  gordons companion with a laugh clapped him on the shoulder again  admirable youth you are a capital match  are you alluding to my money  to your money and to your modesty there is as much of one as of the otherwhich is saying a great deal  well said gordon in spite of that enviable combination i am not happy  i thought you seemed pensive bernard exclaimed it s you then who feel differently  gordon gave a sigh  to say that is to say too much  what shall we say then his companion asked kindly  gordon stopped again he stood there looking up at a certain particularly lustrous star which twinkledthe night was cloudyin an open patch of sky and the vague brightness shone down on his honest and serious visage  i dont understand her he said  oh i ll say that with you any day cried bernard i cant help you there  you must help me and gordon wright deserted his star you must keep me in good humor  please to walk on then i dont in the least pity you she is very charming with you  true enough but insisting on that is not the way to keep me in good humorwhen i feel as i do  how is it you feel  puzzled to deathbewildereddepressed  this was but the beginning of gordon wrights list he went on to say that though he thought as highly of miss vivian as he had ever done he felt less at his ease with her than in the first weeks of their acquaintance and this condition made him uncomfortable and unhappy  i dont know what s the matter said poor gordon i dont know what has come between us it is nt her faulti dont make her responsible for it i began to notice it about a fortnight agobefore you came shortly after that talk i had with her that i have just described to you her manner has nt changed and i have no reason to suppose that she likes me any the less but she makes a strange impression on meshe makes me uneasy it s only her nature coming out i supposewhat you might call her originality she s thoroughly originalshe s a kind of mysterious creature i suppose that what i feel is a sort of fascination but that is just what i dont like hang it i dont want to be fascinatedi object to being fascinated  this little story had taken some time in the telling so that the two young men had now reached their hotel  ah my dear gordon said bernard we speak a different language if you dont want to be fascinated what is one to say to you object to being fascinated there s a man easy to satisfy raffine va  well see here now said gordon stopping in the doorway of the inn when it comes to the point do you like it yourself  when it comes to the point bernard exclaimed i assure you i dont wait till then i like the beginningi delight in the approach of iti revel in the prospect  thats just what i did but now that the thing has comei dont revel to be fascinated is to be mystified damn it i like my libertyi like my judgment  so do ilike yours said bernard laughing as they took their bedroom candles       chapter ix  bernard talked of this matter rather theoretically inasmuch as to his own sense he was in a state neither of incipient nor of absorbed fascination he got on very easily however with angela vivian and felt none of the mysterious discomfort alluded to by his friend the element of mystery attached itself rather to the young ladys mother who gave him the impression that for undiscoverable reasons she avoided his society he regretted her evasive deportment for he found something agreeable in this shy and scrupulous little woman who struck him as a curious specimen of a society of which he had once been very fond he learned that she was of old new england stock but he had not needed this information to perceive that mrs vivian was animated by the genius of boston she has the boston temperament he said using a phrase with which he had become familiar and which evoked a train of associations but then he immediately added that if mrs vivian was a daughter of the puritans the puritan strain in her disposition had been mingled with another element it is the boston temperament sophisticated he said perverted a littleperhaps even corrupted it is the local eastwind with an infusion from climates less tonic it seemed to him that mrs vivian was a puritan grown worldlya bostonian relaxed and this impression oddly enough contributed to his wish to know more of her he felt like going up to her very politely and saying dear lady and most honored compatriot what in the world have i done to displease you you dont approve of me and i am dying to know the reason why i should be so happy to exert myself to be agreeable to you it s no use you give me the cold shoulder when i speak to you you look the other way it is only when i speak to your daughter that you look at me it is true that at those times you look at me very hard and if i am not greatly mistaken you are not gratified by what you see you count the words i address to your beautiful angelayou time our harmless little interviews you interrupt them indeed whenever you can you call her awayyou appeal to her you cut across the conversation you are always laying plots to keep us apart why cant you leave me alone i assure you i am the most innocent of men your beautiful angela cant possibly be injured by my conversation and i have no designs whatever upon her peace of mind what on earth have i done to offend you  these observations bernard longueville was disposed to make and one afternoon the opportunity offering they rose to his lips and came very near passing them in fact however at the last moment his eloquence took another turn it was the custom of the orchestra at the kursaal to play in the afternoon and as the music was often good a great many people assembled under the trees at three oclock to listen to it this was not as a regular thing an hour of reunion for the little group in which we are especially interested miss vivian in particular unless an excursion of some sort had been agreed upon the day before was usually not to be seen in the precincts of the conversationhouse until the evening bernard one afternoon at three oclock directed his steps to this small worldcentre of baden and passing along the terrace soon encountered little blanche evers strolling there under a pink parasol and accompanied by captain lovelock this young lady was always extremely sociable it was quite in accordance with her habitual geniality that she should stop and say how d ye do to our hero  mr longueville is growing very frivolous she said coming to the kursaal at all sorts of hours  there is nothing frivolous in coming here with the hope of finding you the young man answered that is very serious  it would be more serious to lose miss evers than to find her remarked captain lovelock with gallant jocosity  i wish you would lose me cried the young girl i think i should like to be lost i might have all kinds of adventures  i guess so said captain lovelock hilariously  oh i should find my way i can take care of myself blanche went on  mrs vivian does nt think so said bernard who had just perceived this lady seated under a tree with a book over the top of which she was observing her pretty protege blanche looked toward her and gave her a little nod and a smile then chattering on to the young men  she s awfully careful i never saw any one so careful but i suppose she is right she promised my mother she would be tremendously particular but i dont know what she thinks i would do  that is nt flattering to me said captain lovelock mrs vivian does nt approve of meshe wishes me in jamaica what does she think me capable of  and me now bernard asked she likes me least of all and i on my side think she s so nice  cant say i m very sweet on her said the captain she strikes me as feline  blanche evers gave a little cry of horror  stop sir this instant i wont have you talk that way about a lady who has been so kind to me  she is nt so kind to you she would like to lock you up where i can never see you  i m sure i should nt mind that cried the young girl with a little laugh and a toss of her head mrs vivian has the most perfect characterthat s why my mother wanted me to come with her and if she promised my mother she would be careful is nt she right to keep her promise she s a great deal more careful than mamma ever was and that s just what mamma wanted she would never take the trouble herself and then she was always scolding me mrs vivian never scolds me she only watches me but i dont mind that  i wish she would watch you a little less and scold you a little more said captain lovelock  i have no doubt you wish a great many horrid things his companion rejoined with delightful asperity  ah unfortunately i never have anything i wish sighed lovelock  your wishes must be comprehensive said bernard it seems to me you have a good deal  the englishman gave a shrug  it s less than you might think she is watching us more furiously than ever he added in a moment looking at mrs vivian mr gordon wright is the only man she likes she is awfully fond of mr gordon wright  ah mrs vivian shows her wisdom said bernard  he is certainly very handsome murmured blanche evers glancing several times with a very pretty aggressiveness at captain lovelock i must say i like mr gordon wright why in the world did you come here without him she went on addressing herself to bernard you two are so awfully inseparable i dont think i ever saw you alone before  oh i have often seen mr gordon wright alone said captain lovelockthat is alone with miss vivian that s what the old lady likes she cant have too much of that  the young girl poised for an instant in one of her pretty attitudes looked at him from head to foot  well i call that scandalous do you mean that she wants to make a match  i mean that the young man has six thousand a year  it s no matter what he hassix thousand a year is nt much and we dont do things in that way in our country we have nt those horrid matchmaking arrangements that you have in your dreadful country american mothers are not like english mothers  oh any one can see of course said captain lovelock that mr gordon wright is dying of love for miss vivian  i cant see it cried blanche  he dies easier than i eh  i wish you would die said blanche at any rate angela is not dying of love for mr wright  well she will marry him all the same lovelock declared  blanche evers glanced at bernard  why dont you contradict that she asked why dont you speak up for your friend  i am quite ready to speak for my friend said bernard but i am not ready to speak for miss vivian  well i am blanche declared she wont marry him  if she does nt i ll eat my hat said captain lovelock what do you mean he went on by saying that in america a pretty girls mother does nt care for a young fellows property  well they dontwe consider that dreadful why dont you say so mr longueville blanche demanded i never saw any one take things so quietly have nt you got any patriotism  my patriotism is modified by an indisposition to generalize said bernard laughing on this point permit me not to generalize i am interested in the particular casein ascertaining whether mrs vivian thinks very often of gordon wrights income  miss evers gave a little toss of disgust  if you are so awfully impartial you had better go and ask her  that s a good ideai think i will go and ask her said bernard  captain lovelock returned to his argument  do you mean to say that your mother would be indifferent to the fact that i have nt a shilling in the world  indifferent blanche demanded oh no she would be sorry for you she is very charitableshe would give you a shilling  she would nt let you marry me said lovelock  she would nt have much trouble to prevent it cried the young girl  bernard had had enough of this intellectual fencing  yes i will go and ask mrs vivian he repeated and he left his companions to resume their walk       chapter x  it had seemed to him a good idea to interrogate mrs vivian but there are a great many good ideas that are never put into execution as he approached her with a smile and a salutation and with the air of asking leave to take a liberty seated himself in the empty chair beside her he felt a humorous relish of her own probable dismay which relaxed the investigating impulse his impulse was now simply to prove to her that he was the most unobjectionable fellow in the worlda proposition which resolved itself into several ingenious observations upon the weather the music the charms and the drawbacks of baden the merits of the volume that she held in her lap if mrs vivian should be annoyed should be fluttered bernard would feel very sorry for her there was nothing in the world that he respected more than the moral consciousness of a little boston woman whose view of life was serious and whose imagination was subject to alarms he held it to be a temple of delicacy where one should walk on tiptoe and he wished to exhibit to mrs vivian the possible lightness of his own step she herself was incapable of being rude or ungracious and now that she was fairly confronted with the plausible object of her mistrust she composed herself to her usual attitude of refined liberality her book was a volume of victor cousin  you must have an extraordinary power of abstracting your mind bernard said to her observing it studying philosophy at the baden kursaal strikes me as a real intellectual feat  dont you think we need a little philosophy here  by all meanswhat we bring with us but i should nt attempt the use of the textbook on the spot  you should nt speak of yourself as if you were not clever said mrs vivian every one says you are so very clever  longueville stared there was an unexpectedness in the speech and an incongruity in mrs vivians beginning to flatter him he needed to remind himself that if she was a bostonian she was a bostonian perverted  ah my dear madam every one is no one he said laughing  it was mr wright in particular she rejoined he has always told us that  he is blinded by friendship  ah yes we know about your friendship said mrs vivian he has told us about that  you are making him out a terrible talker  we think he talks so wellwe are so very fond of his conversation  it s usually excellent said bernard but it depends a good deal on the subject  oh rejoined mrs vivian we always let him choose his subjects and dropping her eyes as if in sudden reflection she began to smooth down the crumpled corner of her volume  it occurred to bernard thatby some mysterious impulseshe was suddenly presenting him with a chance to ask her the question that blanche evers had just suggested two or three other things as well occurred to him captain lovelock had been struck with the fact that she favored gordon wrights addresses to her daughter and captain lovelock had a grotesque theory that she had set her heart upon seeing this young lady come into six thousand a year miss everss devoted swain had never struck bernard as a brilliant reasoner but our friend suddenly found himself regarding him as one of the inspired the form of depravity into which the new england conscience had lapsed on mrs vivians part was an undue appreciation of a possible soninlaws income in this illuminating discovery everything else became clear mrs vivian disliked her humble servant because he had not thirty thousand dollars a year and because at a moment when it was angelas prime duty to concentrate her thoughts upon gordon wrights great advantages a clever young man of paltry fortune was a superfluous diversion  when you say clever everything is relative he presently observed now there is captain lovelock he has a certain kind of cleverness he is very observant  mrs vivian glanced up with a preoccupied air  we dont like captain lovelock she said  i have heard him say capital things bernard answered  we think him brutal said mrs vivian please dont praise captain lovelock  oh i only want to be just  mrs vivian for a moment said nothing  do you want very much to be just she presently asked  it s my most ardent desire  i m glad to hear thatand i can easily believe it said mrs vivian  bernard gave her a grateful smile but while he smiled he asked himself a serious question why the deuce does she go on flattering meyou have always been very kind to me he said aloud  it s on mr wrights account she answered demurely  in speaking the words i have just quoted bernard longueville had felt himself with a certain compunction to be skirting the edge of clever impudence but mrs vivians quiet little reply suggested to him that her cleverness if not her impudence was almost equal to his own he remarked to himself that he had not yet done her justice  you bring everything back to gordon wright he said continuing to smile  mrs vivian blushed a little  it is because he is really at the foundation of everything that is pleasant for us here when we first came we had some very disagreeable rooms and as soon as he arrived he found us some excellent onesthat were less expensive and then mr longueville she added with a soft sweet emphasis which should properly have contradicted the idea of audacity but which to bernards awakened sense seemed really to impart a vivid color to it he was also the cause of your joining our little party  oh among his services that should never be forgotten you should set up a tablet to commemorate it in the wall of the kursaalthe wicked little woman bernard mentally subjoined  mrs vivian appeared quite unruffled by his sportive sarcasm and she continued to enumerate her obligations to gordon wright  there are so many ways in which a gentleman can be of assistance to three poor lonely women especially when he is at the same time so friendly and so delicate as mr wright i dont know what we should have done without him and i feel as if every one ought to know it he seems like a very old friend my daughter and i quite worship him i will not conceal from you that when i saw you coming through the grounds a short time ago without him i was very much disappointed i hope he is not ill  bernard sat listening with his eyes on the ground  oh no he is simply at home writing letters  mrs vivian was silent a moment  i suppose he has a very large correspondence  i really dont know just now that i am with him he has a smaller one than usual  ah yes when you are separated i suppose you write volumes to each other but he must have a great many business letters  it is very likely said bernard and if he has you may be sure he writes them  order and method mrs vivian exclaimed with his immense property those virtues are necessary  bernard glanced at her a moment  my dear lovelock he said to himself you are not such a fool as you seemgordons virtues are always necessary doubtless he went on but should you say his property was immense  mrs vivian made a delicate little movement of deprecation oh dont ask me to say i know nothing about it i only supposed he was rich  he is rich but he is not a croesus  oh you fashionable young men have a standard of luxury said mrs vivian with a little laugh to a povertystricken widow such a fortune as mr wrights seems magnificent  dont call me such horrible names exclaimed bernard our friend has certainly money enough and to spare  that was all i meant he once had occasion to allude to his property but he was so modest so reserved in the tone he took about it that one hardly knew what to think  he is ashamed of being rich said bernard he would be sure to represent everything unfavorably  that s just what i thought this ejaculation was more eager than mrs vivian might have intended but even had it been less so bernard was in a mood to appreciate it i felt that we should make allowances for his modesty but it was in very good taste mrs vivian added  he s a fortunate man said bernard he gets credit for his good tasteand he gets credit for the full figure of his income as well  ah murmured mrs vivian rising lightly as if to make her words appear more casual i dont know the full figure of his income  she was turning away and bernard as he raised his hat and separated from her felt that it was rather cruel that he should let her go without enlightening her ignorance but he said to himself that she knew quite enough indeed he took a walk along the lichtenthal alley and carried out this line of reflection whether or no miss vivian were in love with gordon wright her mother was enamored of gordons fortune and it had suddenly occurred to her that instead of treating the friend of her daughters suitor with civil mistrust she would help her case better by giving him a hint of her state of mind and appealing to his sense of propriety nothing could be more natural than that mrs vivian should suppose that bernard desired his friends success for as our thoughtful hero said to himself what she had hitherto taken it into her head to fear was not that bernard should fall in love with her daughter but that her daughter should fall in love with him wateringplace life is notoriously conducive to idleness of mind and bernard strolled for half an hour along the overarched avenue glancing alternately at these two insupposable cases  a few days afterward late in the evening gordon wright came to his room at the hotel  i have just received a letter from my sister he said i am afraid i shall have to go away  ah i m sorry for that said bernard who was so well pleased with the actual that he desired no mutation  i mean only for a short time gordon explained my poor sister writes from england telling me that my brotherinlaw is suddenly obliged to go home she has decided not to remain behind and they are to sail a fortnight hence she wants very much to see me before she goes and as i dont know when i shall see her again i feel as if i ought to join her immediately and spend the interval with her that will take about a fortnight  i appreciate the sanctity of family ties and i project myself into your situation said bernard on the other hand i dont envy you a breathless journey from baden to folkestone  it s the coming back that will be breathless exclaimed gordon smiling  you will certainly come back then  most certainly mrs vivian is to be here another month  i understand well we shall miss you very much  gordon wright looked for a moment at his companion  you will stay here then i am so glad of that  i was taking it for granted but on reflectionwhat do you recommend  i recommend you to stay  my dear fellow your word is law said bernard  i want you to take care of those ladies his friend went on i dont like to leave them alone  you are joking cried bernard when did you ever hear of my taking care of any one it s as much as i can do to take care of myself  this is very easy said gordon i simply want to feel that they have a man about them  they will have a man at any ratethey have the devoted lovelock  that s just why i want them to have another he has only an eye to miss evers who by the way is extremely bored with him you look after the others you have made yourself very agreeable to them and they like you extremely  ah said bernard laughing if you are going to be coarse and flattering i collapse if you are going to titillate my vanity i succumb  it wont be so disagreeable gordon observed with an intention vaguely humorous  oh no it wont be disagreeable i will go to mrs vivian every morning hat in hand for my orders  gordon wright with his hands in his pockets and a meditative expression took several turns about the room  it will be a capital chance he said at last stopping in front of his companion  a chance for what  a chance to arrive at a conclusion about my young friend  bernard gave a gentle groan  are you coming back to that did nt i arrive at a conclusion long ago did nt i tell you she was a delightful girl  do you call that a conclusion the first comer could tell me that at the end of an hour  do you want me to invent something different bernard asked i cant invent anything better  i dont want you to invent anything i only want you to observe herto study her in complete independence you will have her to yourselfmy absence will leave you at liberty hang it sir gordon declared i should think you would like it  damn it sir you re delicious bernard answered and he broke into an irrepressible laugh i dont suppose it s for my pleasure that you suggest the arrangement  gordon took a turn about the room again  no it s for mine at least it s for my benefit  for your benefit  i have got all sorts of ideasi told you the other day they are all mixed up together and i want a fresh impression  my impressions are never fresh bernard replied  they would be if you had a little goodwillif you entered a little into my dilemma the note of reproach was so distinct in these words that bernard stood staring you never take anything seriously his companion went on  bernard tried to answer as seriously as possible  your dilemma seems to me of all dilemmas the strangest  that may be but different people take things differently dont you see gordon went on with a sudden outbreak of passiondont you see that i am horribly divided in mind i care immensely for angela vivianand yetand yeti am afraid of her  afraid of her  i am afraid she s cleverer than ithat she would be a difficult wife that she might do strange things  what sort of things  well that she might flirt for instance  that s not a thing for a man to fear  not when he supposes his wife to be fond of himno but i dont suppose thati have given that up if i should induce angela vivian to accept me she would do it on grounds purely reasonable she would think it best simply that would give her a chance to repent  bernard sat for some time looking at his friend  you say she is cleverer than you it s impossible to be cleverer than you  oh come longueville said gordon angrily  i am speaking very seriously you have done a remarkably clever thing you have impressed me with the reality and withwhat shall i term itthe estimable character of what you call your dilemma now this fresh impression of minewhat do you propose to do with it when you get it  such things are always useful it will be a good thing to have  i am much obliged to you but do you propose to let anything depend upon it do you propose to take or to leave miss vivianthat is to return to the charge or to give up tryingin consequence of my fresh impression  gordon seemed perfectly unembarrassed by this question in spite of the ironical light which it projected upon his sentimental perplexity  i propose to do what i choose he said  that s a relief to me bernard rejoined this idea of yours is after all only the play of the scientific mind  i shall contradict you flat if i choose gordon went on  ah it s well to warn me of that said bernard laughing even the most sincere judgment in the world likes to be notified a little of the danger of being contradicted  is yours the most sincere judgment in the world gordon demanded  that s a very pertinent question does nt it occur to you that you may have reason to be jealousleaving me alone with an open field with the woman of your choice  i wish to heaven i could be jealous gordon exclaimed that would simplify the thingthat would give me a lift  and the next day after some more talk it seemed really with a hope of this contingencythough indeed he laughed about itthat he started for england       chapter xi  for the three or four days that followed gordon wrights departure bernard saw nothing of the ladies who had been committed to his charge they chose to remain in seclusion and he was at liberty to interpret this fact as an expression of regret at the loss of gordons good offices he knew other people at baden and he went to see them and endeavored by cultivating their society to await in patience the reappearance of mrs vivian and her companions but on the fourth day he became conscious that other people were much less interesting than the trio of american ladies who had lodgings above the confectioners and he made bold to go and knock at their door he had been asked to take care of them and this function presupposed contact he had met captain lovelock the day before wandering about with a rather crestfallen aspect and the young englishman had questioned him eagerly as to the whereabouts of mrs vivian  gad i believe they ve left the placeleft the place without giving a fellow warning cried lovelock  oh no i think they are here still said bernard my friend wright has gone away for a week or two but i suspect the ladies are simply staying at home  gad i was afraid your friend wright had taken them away with him he seems to keep them all in his pocket i was afraid he had given them marching orders they d have been sure to gothey re so awfully fond of his pocket i went to look them up yesterdayupon my word i did they live at a bakers in a little backstreet people do live in rum places when they come abroad but i assure you when i got there i m damned if i could make out whether they were there or not i dont speak a word of german and there was no one there but the bakers wife she was a low brute of a womanshe could nt understand a word i said though she gave me plenty of her own tongue i had to give it up they were not at home but whether they had left baden or notthat was beyond my finding out if they are here why the deuce dont they show fancy coming to badenbaden to sit moping at a pastrycooks  captain lovelock was evidently irritated and it was bernards impression that the turn of luck over yonder where the goldpieces were chinking had something to do with the state of his temper but more fortunate himself he ascertained from the bakers wife that though mrs vivian and her daughter had gone out their companion the youngest ladythe little young ladywas above in the sittingroom  blanche evers was sitting at the window with a book but she relinquished the volume with an alacrity that showed it had not been absorbing and began to chatter with her customary frankness  well i must say i am glad to see some one cried the young girl passing before the mirror and giving a touch to her charming tresses  even if it s only me bernard exclaimed laughing  i did nt mean that i am sure i am very glad to see youi should think you would have found out that by this time i mean i m glad to see any oneespecially a man i suppose it s improper for me to say thatespecially to you thereyou see i do think more of you than of some gentlemen why especially to you well because you always seem to me to want to take advantage i did nt say a base advantage i did nt accuse you of anything dreadful i m sure i want to take advantage tooi take it whenever i can you see i take advantage of your being herei ve got so many things to say i have nt spoken a word in three days and i m sure it is a pleasant changea gentlemans visit all of a sudden we have gone into mourning i m sure i dont know who s dead is it mr gordon wright it s some idea of mrs viviansi m sure it is nt mine she thinks we have been often enough to the kursaal i dont know whether she thinks it s wicked or what if it s wicked the harm s already done i cant be any worse than i am now i have seen all the improper people and i have learnt all their names captain lovelock has told me their names plenty of times i dont see what good it does me to be shut up here with all those names running in my ears i must say i do prefer society we have nt been to the kursaal for four dayswe have only gone out for a drive we have taken the most interminable drives i do believe we have seen every old ruin in the whole country mrs vivian and angela are so awfully fond of scenerythey talk about it by the halfhour they talk about the mountains and trees as if they were people they knewas if they were gentlemen i mean as if the mountains and trees were gentlemen of course scenery s lovely but you cant walk about with a tree at any rate that has been all our societyfoliage foliage and women but i suppose women are a sort of foliage they are always rustling about and dropping off that s why i could nt make up my mind to go out with them this afternoon they ve gone to see the waterworthsthe waterworths arrived yesterday and are staying at some hotel five daughtersall unmarried i dont know what kind of foliage they are some peculiar kindthey dont drop off i thought i had had about enough ladies societythree women all sticking together i dont think it s good for a young girl to have nothing but ladies societyit s so awfully limited i suppose i ought to stand up for my own sex and tell you that when we are alone together we want for nothing but we want for everything as it happens womens talk is limitedevery one knows that that s just what mamma did nt want when she asked mrs vivian to take charge of me now mr longueville what are you laughing atyou are always laughing at me she wanted me to be unlimitedis that what you say well she did nt want me to be narrowed down she wanted me to have plenty of conversation she wanted me to be fitted for societythat s what mamma wanted she wanted me to have ease of manner she thinks that if you dont acquire it when you are young you never have it at all she was so happy to think i should come to baden but she would nt approve of the life i ve been leading the last four days that s no way to acquire ease of mannersitting all day in a small parlor with two persons of ones own sex of course mrs vivians influencethat s the great thing mamma said it was like the odor of a flower but you dont want to keep smelling a flower all day even the sweetest that s the shortest way to get a headache apropos of flowers do you happen to have heard whether captain lovelock is alive or dead do i call him a flower no i call him a flowerpot he always has some fine young plant in his buttonhole he has nt been near me these ten yearsi never heard of anything so rude  captain lovelock came on the morrow bernard finding him in mrs vivians little sittingroom on paying a second visit on this occasion the two other ladies were at home and bernard was not exclusively indebted to miss evers for entertainment it was to this source of hospitality however that lovelock mainly appealed following the young girl out upon the little balcony that was suspended above the confectioners window mrs vivian sat writing at one of the windows of the sittingroom and bernard addressed his conversation to angela  wright requested me to keep an eye on you he said but you seem very much inclined to keep out of my jurisdiction  i supposed you had gone away she answerednow that your friend is gone  by no means gordon is a charming fellow but he is by no means the only attraction of baden besides i have promised him to look after youto take care of you  the girl looked at him a moment in silencea little askance  i thought you had probably undertaken something of that sort she presently said  it was of course a very natural request for gordon to make  angela got up and turned away she wandered about the room and went and stood at one of the windows bernard found the movement abrupt and not particularly gracious but the young man was not easy to snub he followed her and they stood at the second windowthe long window that opened upon the balcony miss evers and captain lovelock were leaning on the railing looking into the street and apparently amusing themselves highly with what they saw  i am not sure it was a natural request for him to make said angela  what could have been more sodevoted as he is to you  she hesitated a moment then with a little laugh  he ought to have locked us up and said nothing about it  it s not so easy to lock you up said bernard i know wright has great influence with you but you are after all independent beings  i am not an independent being if my mother and mr wright were to agree together to put me out of harms way they could easily manage it  you seem to have been trying something of that sort said bernard you have been so terribly invisible  it was because i thought you had designs upon us that you were watching for usto take care of us  you contradict yourself you said just now that you believed i had left baden  that was an artificiala conventional speech is nt a lady always supposed to say something of that sort to a visitor by way of pretending to have noticed that she has not seen him  you know i would never have left baden without coming to bid you goodbye said bernard  the girl made no rejoinder she stood looking out at the little sunny slanting roughpaved german street  are you taking care of us now she asked in a moment has the operation begun have you heard the news mamma she went on do you know that mr wright has made us over to mr longueville to be kept till called for suppose mr wright should never call for us  mrs vivian left her writingtable and came toward bernard smiling at him and pressing her hands together  there is no fear of that i think she said i am sure i am very glad we have a gentleman near us i think you will be a very good caretaker mr longueville and i recommend my daughter to put great faith in your judgment and mrs vivian gave him an intensea pleading almost affectinglittle smile  i am greatly touched by your confidence and i shall do everything i can think of to merit it said the young man  ah mammas confidence is wonderful angela exclaimed there was never anything like mammas confidence i am very different i have no confidence and then i dont like being deposited like a parcel or being watched like a curious animal i am too fond of my liberty  that is the second time you have contradicted yourself said bernard you said just now that you were not an independent being  angela turned toward him quickly smiling and frowning at once  you do watch one certainly i see it has already begun mrs vivian laid her hand upon her daughters with a little murmur of tender deprecation and the girl bent over and kissed her mamma will tell you it s the effect of agitation she saidthat i am nervous and dont know what i say i am supposed to be agitated by mr wrights departure is nt that it mamma  mrs vivian turned away with a certain soft severity  i dont know my daughter i dont understand you  a charming pink flush had come into angelas cheek and a noticeable light into her eye she looked admirably handsome and bernard frankly gazed at her she met his gaze an instant and then she went on  mr longueville does nt understand me either you must know that i am agitated she continued every now and then i have moments of talking nonsense it s the air of baden i think it s too exciting it s only lately i have been so when you go away i shall be horribly ashamed  if the air of baden has such an effect upon you said bernard it is only a proof the more that you need the solicitous attention of your friends  that may be but as i told you just now i have no confidencenone whatever in any one or anything therefore for the present i shall withdraw from the worldi shall seclude myself let us go on being quiet mamma three or four days of it have been so charming let the parcel lie till it s called for it is much safer it should nt be touched at all i shall assume that metaphorically speaking mr wright who as you have intimated is our earthly providence has turned the key upon us i am locked up i shall not go out except upon the balcony and with this angela stepped out of the long window and went and stood beside miss evers  bernard was extremely amused but he was also a good deal puzzled and it came over him that it was not a wonder that poor wright should not have found this young ladys disposition a perfectly decipherable page he remained in the room with mrs vivianhe stood there looking at her with his agreeably mystified smile she had turned away but on perceiving that her daughter had gone outside she came toward bernard again with her habitual little air of eagerness mitigated by discretion there instantly rose before his mind the vision of that moment when he had stood face to face with this same apologetic mamma after angela had turned her back on the grassgrown terrace at siena to make the vision complete mrs vivian took it into her head to utter the same words  i am sure you think she is a strange girl  bernard recognized them and he gave a light laugh  you told me that the first time you ever saw mein that quiet little corner of an italian town  mrs vivian gave a little faded elderly blush  dont speak of that she murmured glancing at the open window it was a little accident of travel  i am dying to speak of it said bernard it was such a charming accident for me tell me this at leasthave you kept my sketch  mrs vivian colored more deeply and glanced at the window again  no she just whispered  bernard looked out of the window too angela was leaning against the railing of the balcony in profile just as she had stood while he painted her against the polished parapet at siena the young mans eyes rested on her a moment then as he glanced back at her mother  has she kept it he asked  i dont know said mrs vivian with decision  the decision was excessiveit expressed the poor ladys distress at having her veracity tested dear little daughter of the puritansshe cant tell a fib bernard exclaimed to himself and with this flattering conclusion he took leave of her       chapter xii  it was affirmed at an early stage of this narrative that he was a young man of a contemplative and speculative turn and he had perhaps never been more true to his character than during an hour or two that evening as he sat by himself on the terrace of the conversationhouse surrounded by the crowd of its frequenters but lost in his meditations the place was full of movement and sound but he had tilted back his chair against the great green box of an orangetree and in this easy attitude vaguely and agreeably conscious of the music he directed his gaze to the starsprinkled vault of the night there were people coming and going whom he knew but he said nothing to any onehe preferred to be alone he found his own company quite absorbing he felt very happy very much amused very curiously preoccupied the feeling was a singular one it partook of the nature of intellectual excitement he had a sense of having received carte blanche for the expenditure of his wits bernard liked to feel his intelligence at play this is perhaps the highest luxury of a clever man it played at present over the whole field of angela vivians oddities of conductfor since his visit in the afternoon bernard had felt that the spectacle was considerably enlarged he had come to feel also that poor gordons predicament was by no means an unnatural one longueville had begun to take his friends dilemma very seriously indeed the girl was certainly a curious study  the evening drew to a close and the crowd of bernards fellowloungers dispersed the lighted windows of the kursaal still glittered in the bosky darkness and the lamps along the terrace had not been extinguished but the great promenade was almost deserted here and there only a lingering couplethe red tip of a cigar and the vague radiance of a light dressgave animation to the place but bernard sat there still in his tilted chair beneath his orangetree his imagination had wandered very far and he was awaiting its return to the fold he was on the point of rising however when he saw three figures come down the empty vista of the terracefigures which even at a distance had a familiar air he immediately left his seat and taking a dozen steps recognized angela vivian blanche evers and captain lovelock in a moment he met them in the middle of the terrace  blanche immediately announced that they had come for a midnight walk  and if you think it s improper she exclaimed it s not my inventionit s miss vivians  i beg pardonit s mine said captain lovelock i desire the credit of it i started the idea you never would have come without me  i think it would have been more proper to come without you than with you blanche declared you know you re a dreadful character  i m much worse when i m away from you than when i m with you said lovelock you keep me in order  the young girl gave a little cry  i dont know what you call order you cant be worse than you have been tonight  angela was not listening to this she turned away a little looking about at the empty garden  this is the third time today that you have contradicted yourself he said though he spoke softly he went nearer to her but she appeared not to hear himshe looked away  you ought to have been there mr longueville blanche went on we have had a most lovely night we sat all the evening on mrs vivians balcony eating ices to sit on a balcony eating icesthat s my idea of heaven  with an angel by your side said captain lovelock  you are not my idea of an angel retorted blanche  i m afraid you ll never learn what the angels are really like said the captain that s why miss evers got mrs vivian to take rooms over the bakersso that she could have ices sent up several times a day well i m bound to say the bakers ices are not bad  considering that they have been baked but they affect the mind blanche went on they would have affected captain lovelocksonly he has nt any they certainly affected angelasputting it into her head at eleven oclock to come out to walk  angela did nothing whatever to defend herself against this ingenious sally she simply stood there in graceful abstraction bernard was vaguely vexed at her neither looking at him nor speaking to him her indifference seemed a contravention of that right of criticism which gordon had bequeathed to him  i supposed people went to bed at eleven oclock he said  angela glanced about her without meeting his eye  they seem to have gone  miss evers strolled on and her captain of course kept pace with her so that bernard and miss vivian were left standing together he looked at her a moment in silence but her eye still avoided his own  you are remarkably inconsistent bernard presently said you take a solemn vow of seclusion this afternoon and no sooner have you taken it than you proceed to break it in this outrageous manner  she looked at him nowa long timelonger than she had ever done before  this is part of the examination i suppose she said  bernard hesitated an instant  what examination  the one you have undertakenon mr wrights behalf  what do you know about that  ah you admit it then the girl exclaimed with an eager laugh  i dont in the least admit it said bernard conscious only for the moment of the duty of loyalty to his friend and feeling that negation here was simply a point of honor  i trust more to my own conviction than to your denial you have engaged to bring your superior wisdom and your immense experience to bear upon me that s the understanding  you must think us a pretty pair of wiseacres said bernard  there it isyou already begin to answer for what i think when mr wright comes back you will be able to tell him that i am outrageous and she turned away and walked on slowly following her companions  what do you care what i tell him bernard asked you dont care a straw  she said nothing for a moment then suddenly she stopped again dropping her eyes  i beg your pardon she said very gently i care a great deal it s as well that you should know that  bernard stood looking at her her eyes were still lowered  do you know what i shall tell him i shall tell him that about eleven oclock at night you become peculiarly attractive  she went on again a few steps miss evers and captain lovelock had turned round and were coming toward her  it is very true that i am outrageous she said it was extremely silly and in very bad taste to come out at this hour mamma was not at all pleased and i was very unkind to her i only wanted to take a turn and now we will go back on the others coming up she announced this resolution and though captain lovelock and his companion made a great outcry she carried her point bernard offered no opposition he contented himself with walking back to her mothers lodging with her almost in silence the little winding streets were still and empty there was no sound but the chatter and laughter of blanche and her attendant swain angela said nothing  this incident presented itself at first to bernards mind as a sort of declaration of war the girl had guessed that she was to be made a subject of speculative scrutiny the idea was not agreeable to her independent spirit and she placed herself boldly on the defensive she took her stand upon her right to defeat his purpose by every possible meansto perplex elude deceive himin plain english to make a fool of him this was the construction which for several days bernard put upon her deportment at the same time that he thought it immensely clever of her to have guessed what had been going on in his mind she made him feel very much ashamed of his critical attitude and he did everything he could think of to put her off her guard and persuade her that for the moment he had ceased to be an observer his position at moments seemed to him an odious one for he was firmly resolved that between him and the woman to whom his friend had proposed there should be nothing in the way of a vulgar flirtation under the circumstances it savoured both of flirtation and of vulgarity that they should even fall out with each othera consummation which appeared to be more or less definitely impending bernard remarked to himself that his own only reasonable line of conduct would be instantly to leave baden but i am almost ashamed to mention the fact which led him to modify this decision it was simply that he was induced to make the reflection that he had really succeeded in putting miss vivian off her guard how he had done so he would have found it difficult to explain inasmuch as in one way or another for a week he had spent several hours in talk with her the most effective way of putting her off her guard would have been to leave her alone to forswear the privilege of conversation with her to pass the days in other society this course would have had the drawback of not enabling him to measure the operation of so ingenious a policy and bernard liked of all the things in the world to know when he was successful he believed at all events that he was successful now and that the virtue of his conversation itself had persuaded this keen and brilliant girl that he was thinking of anything in the world but herself he flattered himself that the civil indifference of his manner the abstract character of the topics he selected the irrelevancy of his allusions and the laxity of his attention all contributed to this result  such a result was certainly a remarkable one for it is almost superfluous to intimate that miss vivian was in fact perpetually in his thoughts he made it a point of conscience not to think of her but he was thinking of her most when his conscience was most lively bernard had a consciencea conscience which though a little irregular in its motions gave itself in the long run a great deal of exercise but nothing could have been more natural than that curious imaginative audacious as he was and delighting as i have said in the play of his singularly nimble intelligence he should have given himself up to a sort of unconscious experimentation i will leave her alonei will be hanged if i attempt to draw her out he said to himself and meanwhile he was roaming afield and plucking personal impressions in great fragrant handfuls all this as i say was natural given the man and the situation the only oddity is that he should have fancied himself able to persuade the person most interested that he had renounced his advantage  he remembered her telling him that she cared very much what he should say of her on gordon wrights return and he felt that this declaration had a particular significance after this of her own movement she never spoke of gordon and bernard made up his mind that she had promised her mother to accept him if he should repeat his proposal and that as her heart was not in the matter she preferred to drop a veil over the prospect she is going to marry him for his money he said because her mother has brought out the advantages of the thing mrs vivians persuasive powers have carried the day and the girl has made herself believe that it does nt matter that she does nt love him perhaps it does ntto her it s hard in such a case to put ones self in the womans point of view but i should think it would matter some day or other to poor gordon she herself cant help suspecting it may make a difference in his happiness and she therefore does nt wish to seem any worse to him than is necessary she wants me to speak well of her if she intends to deceive him she expects me to back her up the wish is doubtless natural but for a proud girl it is rather an odd favor to ask oh yes she s a proud girl even though she has been able to arrange it with her conscience to make a mercenary marriage to expect me to help her is perhaps to treat me as a friend but she ought to rememberor at least i ought to rememberthat gordon is an older friend than she inviting me to help her as against my oldest friendis nt there a grain of impudence in that  it will be gathered that bernards meditations were not on the whole favorable to this young lady and it must be affirmed that he was forcibly struck with an element of cynicism in her conduct on the evening of her socalled midnight visit to the kursaal she had suddenly sounded a note of sweet submissiveness which reappeared again at frequent intervals she was gentle accessible tenderly gracious expressive demonstrative almost flattering from his own personal point of view bernard had no complaint to make of this maidenly urbanity but he kept reminding himself that he was not in question and that everything must be looked at in the light of gordons requirements there was all this time an absurd logical twist in his view of things in the first place he was not to judge at all and in the second he was to judge strictly on gordons behalf this latter clause always served as a justification when the former had failed to serve as a deterrent when bernard reproached himself for thinking too much of the girl he drew comfort from the reflection that he was not thinking well to let it gradually filter into ones mind through a superficial complexity of more reverent preconceptions that she was an extremely clever coquettethis surely was not to think well bernard had luminous glimpses of another situation in which angela vivians coquetry should meet with a different appreciation but just now it was not an item to be entered on the credit side of wrights account bernard wiped his pen mentally speaking as he made this reflection and felt like a grizzled old bookkeeper of incorruptible probity he saw her as i have said very often she continued to break her vow of shutting herself up and at the end of a fortnight she had reduced it to imperceptible particles on four different occasions presenting himself at mrs vivians lodgings bernard found angela there alone she made him welcome receiving him as an american girl in such circumstances is free to receive the most gallant of visitors she smiled and talked and gave herself up to charming gayety so that there was nothing for bernard to say but that now at least she was off her guard with a vengeance happily he was on his own he flattered himself that he remained so on occasions that were even more insidiously relaxingwhen in the evening she strolled away with him to parts of the grounds of the conversationhouse where the music sank to sweeter softness and the murmur of the treetops of the black forest stirred by the warm nightair became almost audible or when in the long afternoons they wandered in the woods apart from the othersfrom mrs vivian and the amiable object of her more avowed solicitude the object of the sportive adoration of the irrepressible the everpresent lovelock they were constantly having parties in the woods at this timedriving over the hills to points of interest which bernard had looked out in the guidebook bernard in such matters was extremely alert and considerate he developed an unexpected talent for arranging excursions and he had taken regularly into his service the redwaistcoated proprietor of a big teutonic landau which had a couriers seat behind and was always at the service of the ladies the functionary in the red waistcoat was a capital charioteer he was constantly proposing new drives and he introduced our little party to treasures of romantic scenery       chapter xiii  more than a fortnight had elapsed but gordon wright had not reappeared and bernard suddenly decided that he would leave baden he found mrs vivian and her daughter very opportunely in the garden of the pleasant homely schloss which forms the residence of the grand dukes of baden during their visits to the scene of our narrative and which perched upon the hillside directly above the little town is surrounded with charming old shrubberies and terraces to this garden a portion of the public is admitted and bernard who liked the place had been there more than once one of the terraces had a high parapet against which angela was leaning looking across the valley mrs vivian was not at first in sight but bernard presently perceived her seated under a tree with victor cousin in her hand as bernard approached the young girl angela who had not seen him turned round  dont move he said you were just in the position in which i painted your portrait at siena  dont speak of that she answered  i have never understood said bernard why you insist upon ignoring that charming incident  she resumed for a moment her former position and stood looking at the opposite hills  that s just how you werein profilewith your head a little thrown back  it was an odious incident angela exclaimed rapidly changing her attitude  bernard was on the point of making a rejoinder but he thought of gordon wright and held his tongue he presently told her that he intended to leave baden on the morrow  they were walking toward her mother she looked round at him quickly  where are you going  to paris he said quite at hazard for he had not in the least determined where to go  to parisin the month of august and she gave a little laugh what a happy inspiration  she gave a little laugh but she said nothing more and bernard gave no further account of his plan they went and sat down near mrs vivian for ten minutes and then they got up again and strolled to another part of the garden they had it all to themselves and it was filled with things that bernard likedinequalities of level with mossy steps connecting them rosetrees trained upon old brick walls horizontal trellises arranged like italian pergolas and here and there a towering poplar looking as if it had survived from some more primitive stage of culture with its stiff boughs motionless and its leaves forever trembling they made almost the whole circuit of the garden and then angela mentioned very quietly that she had heard that morning from mr wright and that he would not return for another week  you had better stay she presently added as if gordons continued absence were an added reason  i dont know said bernard it is sometimes difficult to say what one had better do  i hesitate to bring against him that most inglorious of all charges an accusation of sentimental fatuity of the disposition to invent obstacles to enjoyment so that he might have the pleasure of seeing a pretty girl attempt to remove them but it must be admitted that if bernard really thought at present that he had better leave baden the observation i have just quoted was not so much a sign of this conviction as of the hope that his companion would proceed to gainsay it the hope was not disappointed though i must add that no sooner had it been gratified than bernard began to feel ashamed of it  this certainly is not one of those cases said angela the thing is surely very simple now  what makes it so simple  she hesitated a moment  the fact that i ask you to stay  you ask me he repeated softly  ah she exclaimed one does nt say those things twice  she turned away and they went back to her mother who gave bernard a wonderful little look of half urgent half remonstrant inquiry as they left the garden he walked beside mrs vivian angela going in front of them at a distance the elder lady began immediately to talk to him of gordon wright  he s not coming back for another week you know she said i am sorry he stays away so long  ah yes bernard answered it seems very long indeed  and it had in fact seemed to him very long  i suppose he is always likely to have business said mrs vivian  you may be very sure it is not for his pleasure that he stays away  i know he is faithful to old friends said mrs vivian i am sure he has not forgotten us  i certainly count upon that bernard exclaimedremembering him as we do  mrs vivian glanced at him gratefully  oh yes we remember himwe remember him daily hourly at least i can speak for my daughter and myself he has been so very kind to us bernard said nothing and she went on and you have been so very kind to us too mr longueville i want so much to thank you  oh no dont said bernard frowning i would rather you should nt  of course mrs vivian added i know it s all on his account but that makes me wish to thank you all the more let me express my gratitude in advance for the rest of the time till he comes back that s more responsibility than you bargained for she said with a little nervous laugh  yes it s more than i bargained for i am thinking of going away  mrs vivian almost gave a little jump and then she paused on the baden cobblestones looking up at him  if you must go mr longuevilledont sacrifice yourself  the exclamation fell upon bernards ear with a certain softly mocking cadence which was sufficient however to make this organ tingle  oh after all you know he said as they walked onafter all you know i am not like wrighti have no business  he walked with the ladies to the door of their lodging angela kept always in front she stood there however at the little confectioners window until the others came up she let her mother pass in and then she said to bernard looking at him  shall i see you again  some time i hope  i meanare you going away  bernard looked for a moment at a little pink sugar cheruba species of cupid with a gilded bowwhich figured among the pastrycooks enticements then he said  i will come and tell you this evening  and in the evening he went to tell her she had mentioned during the walk in the garden of the schloss that they should not go out as he approached mrs vivians door he saw a figure in a light dress standing in the little balcony he stopped and looked up and then the person in the light dress leaning her hands on the railing with her shoulders a little raised bent over and looked down at him it was very dark but even through the thick dusk he thought he perceived the finest brilliancy of angela vivians smile  i shall not go away he said lifting his voice a little  she made no answer she only stood looking down at him through the warm dusk and smiling he went into the house and he remained at badenbaden till gordon came back       chapter xiv  gordon asked him no questions for twentyfour hours after his return then suddenly he began  well have nt you something to say to me  it was at the hotel in gordons apartment late in the afternoon a heavy thunderstorm had broken over the place an hour before and bernard had been standing at one of his friends windows rather idly with his hands in his pockets watching the raintorrents dance upon the empty pavements at last the deluge abated the clouds began to breakthere was a promise of a fine evening gordon wright while the storm was at its climax sat down to write letters and wrote half a dozen it was after he had sealed directed and affixed a postagestamp to the last of the series that he addressed to his companion the question i have just quoted  do you mean about miss vivian bernard asked without turning round from the window  about miss vivian of course bernard said nothing and his companion went on have you nothing to tell me about miss vivian  bernard presently turned round looking at gordon and smiling a little  she s a delightful creature  that wont doyou have tried that before said gordon no he added in a moment that wont do bernard turned back to the window and gordon continued as he remained silent i shall have a right to consider your saying nothing a proof of an unfavorable judgment you dont like her  bernard faced quickly about again and for an instant the two men looked at each other  ah my dear gordon longueville murmured  do you like her then asked wright getting up  no said longueville  that s just what i wanted to know and i am much obliged to you for telling me  i am not obliged to you for asking me i was in hopes you would nt  you dislike her very much then gordon exclaimed gravely  wont disliking her simply do said bernard  it will do very well but it will do a little better if you will tell me why give me a reason or two  well said bernard i tried to make love to her and she boxed my ears  the devil cried gordon  i mean morally you know  gordon stared he seemed a little puzzled  you tried to make love to her morally  she boxed my ears morally said bernard laughing out  why did you try to make love to her  this inquiry was made in a tone so expressive of an unbiassed truthseeking habit that bernards mirth was not immediately quenched nevertheless he replied with sufficient gravity  to test her fidelity to you could you have expected anything else you told me you were afraid she was a latent coquette you gave me a chance and i tried to ascertain  and you found she was not is that what you mean  she s as firm as a rock my dear gordon miss vivian is as firm as the firmest of your geological formations  gordon shook his head with a strange positive persistence  you are talking nonsense you are not serious you are not telling me the truth i dont believe that you attempted to make love to her you would nt have played such a game as that it would nt have been honorable  bernard flushed a little he was irritated  oh come dont make too much of a point of that did nt you tell me before that it was a great opportunity  an opportunity to be wisenot to be foolish  ah there is only one sort of opportunity cried bernard you exaggerate the reach of human wisdom  suppose she had let you make love to her said gordon that would have been a beautiful result of your experiment  i should have seemed to you a rascal perhaps but i should have saved you from a latent coquette you would owe some thanks for that  and now you have nt saved me said gordon with a simple air of noting a fact  you assumein spite of what i saythat she is a coquette  i assume something because you evidently conceal something i want the whole truth  bernard turned back to the window with increasing irritation  if he wants the whole truth he shall have it he said to himself  he stood a moment in thought and then he looked at his companion again  i think she would marry youbut i dont think she cares for you  gordon turned a little pale but he clapped his hands together  very good he exclaimed that s exactly how i want you to speak  her mother has taken a great fancy to your fortune and it has rubbed off on the girl who has made up her mind that it would be a pleasant thing to have thirty thousand a year and that her not caring for you is an unimportant detail  i seei see said gordon looking at his friend with an air of admiration for his frank and lucid way of putting things  now that he had begun to be frank and lucid bernard found a charm in it and the impulse under which he had spoken urged him almost violently forward  the mother and daughter have agreed together to bag you and angela i am sure has made a vow to be as nice to you after marriage as possible mrs vivian has insisted upon the importance of that mrs vivian is a great moralist  gordon kept gazing at his friend he seemed positively fascinated  yes i have noticed that in mrs vivian he said  ah she s a very nice woman  it s not true then said gordon that you tried to make love to angela  bernard hesitated a single instant    no it is nt true i calumniated myself to save her reputation you insisted on my giving you a reason for my not liking heri gave you that one  and your real reason  my real reason is that i believe she would do you what i cant help regarding as an injury  of course and gordon dropping his interested eyes stared for some moments at the carpet but it is nt true then that you discovered her to be a coquette  ah that s another matter  you did discover it all the same  since you want the whole truthi did  how did you discover it gordon asked clinging to his right of interrogation  bernard hesitated  you must remember that i saw a great deal of her  you mean that she encouraged you  if i had not been a very faithful friend i might have thought so  gordon laid his hand appreciatively gratefully on bernards shoulder  and even that did nt make you like her  confound it you make me blush cried bernard blushing a little in fact i have said quite enough excuse me from drawing the portrait of too insensible a man it was my point of view i kept thinking of you  gordon with his hand still on his friends arm patted it an instant in response to this declaration then he turned away  i am much obliged to you that s my notion of friendship you have spoken out like a man  like a man yes remember that not in the least like an oracle  i prefer an honest man to all the oracles said gordon  an honest man has his impressions i have given you minethey pretend to be nothing more i hope they have nt offended you  not in the least  nor distressed nor depressed nor in any way discomposed you    for what do you take me i asked you a favora service i imposed it on you you have done the thing and my part is simple gratitude  thank you for nothing said bernard smiling you have asked me a great many questions there is one that in turn i have a right to ask you what do you propose to do in consequence of what i have told you  i propose to do nothing  this declaration closed the colloquy and the young men separated bernard saw gordon no more that evening he took for granted he had gone to mrs vivians the burden of longuevilles confidences was a heavy load to carry there but bernard ventured to hope that he would deposit it at the door he had given gordon his impressions and the latter might do with them what he chosetoss them out of the window or let them grow stale with heedless keeping so bernard meditated as he wandered about alone for the rest of the evening it was useless to look for mrs vivians little circle on the terrace of the conversationhouse for the storm in the afternoon had made the place so damp that it was almost forsaken of its frequenters bernard spent the evening in the gamingrooms in the thick of the crowd that pressed about the tables and by way of a changehe had hitherto been almost nothing of a gamblerhe laid down a couple of pieces at roulette he had played but two or three times without winning a penny but now he had the agreeable sensation of drawing in a small handful of gold he continued to play and he continued to win his luck surprised and excited himso much so that after it had repeated itself half a dozen times he left the place and walked about for half an hour in the outer darkness he felt amused and exhilarated but the feeling amounted almost to agitation he nevertheless returned to the tables where he again found success awaiting him again and again he put his money on a happy number and so steady a run of luck began at last to attract attention the rumor of it spread through the rooms and the crowd about the roulette received a large contingent of spectators bernard felt that they were looking more or less eagerly for a turn of the tide but he was in the humor for disappointing them and he left the place while his luck was still running high with ten thousand francs in his pocket it was very late when he returned to the innso late that he forbore to knock at gordons door but though he betook himself to his own quarters he was far from finding or even seeking immediate rest he knocked about as he would have said for half the nightnot because he was delighted at having won ten thousand francs but rather because all of a sudden he found himself disgusted at the manner in which he had spent the evening it was extremely characteristic of bernard longueville that his pleasure should suddenly transform itself into flatness what he felt was not regret or repentance he had it not in the least on his conscience that he had given countenance to the reprehensible practice of gaming it was annoyance that he had passed out of his own controlthat he had obeyed a force which he was unable to measure at the time he had been drunk and he was turning sober in spite of a great momentary appearance of frankness and a lively relish of any conjunction of agreeable circumstances exerting a pressure to which one could respond bernard had really little taste for giving himself up and he never did so without very soon wishing to take himself back he had now given himself to something that was not himself and the fact that he had gained ten thousand francs by it was an insufficient salve to an aching sense of having ceased to be his own master he had not been playinghe had been played with he had been the sport of a blind brutal chance and he felt humiliated by having been favored by so rudelyoperating a divinity good luck and bad luck bernard felt very scornful of the distinction save that good luck seemed to him rather the more vulgar as the night went on his disgust deepened and at last the weariness it brought with it sent him to sleep he slept very late and woke up to a disagreeable consciousness at first before collecting his thoughts he could not imagine what he had on his mindwas it that he had spoken ill of angela vivian it brought him extraordinary relief to remember that he had gone to bed in extreme illhumor with his exploits at roulette after he had dressed himself and just as he was leaving his room a servant brought him a note superscribed in gordons handa note of which the following proved to be the contents  seven oclock am  my dear bernard circumstances have determined me to leave baden immediately and i shall take the train that starts an hour hence i am told that you came in very late last night so i wont disturb you for a painful parting at this unnatural hour i came to this decision last evening and i put up my things so i have nothing to do but to take myself off i shall go to basel but after that i dont know where and in so comfortless an uncertainty i dont ask you to follow me perhaps i shall go to america but in any case i shall see you sooner or later meanwhile my dear bernard be as happy as your brilliant talents should properly make you and believe me yours ever  gw  ps it is perhaps as well that i should say that i am leaving in consequence of something that happened last evening but notby any traceable processin consequence of the talk we had together i may also add that i am in very good health and spirits  bernard lost no time in learning that his friend had in fact departed by the eight oclock trainthe morning was now well advanced and then over his breakfast he gave himself up to meditative surprise what had happened during the eveningwhat had happened after their conversation in gordons room he had gone to mrs vivianswhat had happened there bernard found it difficult to believe that he had gone there simply to notify her that having talked it over with an intimate friend he gave up her daughter or to mention to the young lady herself that he had ceased to desire the honor of her hand gordon alluded to some definite occurrence yet it was inconceivable that he should have allowed himself to be determined by bernards wordshis diffident and irresponsible impression bernard resented this idea as an injury to himself yet it was difficult to imagine what else could have happened there was gordons word for it however that there was no traceable connection between the circumstances which led to his sudden departure and the information he had succeeded in extracting from his friend what did he mean by a traceable connection gordon never used words idly and he meant to make of this point an intelligible distinction it was this sense of his usual accuracy of expression that assisted bernard in fitting a meaning to his late companions letter he intended to intimate that he had come back to baden with his mind made up to relinquish his suit and that he had questioned bernard simply from moral curiosityfor the sake of intellectual satisfaction nothing was altered by the fact that bernard had told him a sorry tale it had not modified his behaviorthat effect would have been traceable it had simply affected his imagination which was a consequence of the imponderable sort this view of the case was supported by gordons mention of his good spirits a man always had good spirits when he had acted in harmony with a conviction of course after renouncing the attempt to make himself acceptable to miss vivian the only possible thing for gordon had been to leave baden bernard continuing to meditate at last convinced himself that there had been no explicit rupture that gordons last visit had simply been a visit of farewell that its character had sufficiently signified his withdrawal and that he had now gone away because after giving the girl up he wished very naturally not to meet her again this was on bernards part a sufficiently coherent view of the case but nevertheless an hour afterward as he strolled along the lichtenthal alley he found himself stopping suddenly and exclaiming under his breathhave i done her an injury have i affected her prospects later in the day he said to himself half a dozen times that he had simply warned gordon against an incongruous union       chapter xv  now that gordon was gone at any rate gone for good and not to return he felt a sudden and singular sense of freedom it was a feeling of unbounded expansion quite out of proportion as he said to himself to any assignable cause everything suddenly appeared to have become very optional but he was quite at a loss what to do with his liberty it seemed a harmless use to make of it in the afternoon to go and pay another visit to the ladies who lived at the confectioners here however he met a reception which introduced a fresh element of perplexity into the situation that gordon had left behind him the door was opened to him by mrs vivians maidservant a sturdy daughter of the schwartzwald who informed him that the ladieswith much regretwere unable to receive any one  they are very busyand they are ill said the young woman by way of explanation  bernard was disappointed and he felt like arguing the case  surely he said they are not both ill and busy when you make excuses you should make them agree with each other  the teutonic soubrette fixed her round blue eyes a minute upon the patch of blue sky revealed to her by her open door  i say what i can lieber herr it s not my fault if i m not so clever as a french mamsell one of the ladies is busy the other is ill there you have it  not quite said bernard you must remember that there are three of them  oh the little onethe little one weeps  miss evers weeps exclaimed bernard to whom the vision of this young lady in tears had never presented itself  that happens to young ladies when they are unhappy said the girl and with an artless yet significant smile she carried a big red hand to the left side of a broad bosom  i am sorry she is unhappy but which of the other ladies is ill  the mother is very busy  and the daughter is ill  the young woman looked at him an instant smiling again and the light in her little blue eyes indicated confusion but not perversity  no the mamma is ill she exclaimed and the daughter is very busy they are preparing to leave baden  to leave baden when do they go  i dont quite know lieber herr but very soon  with this information bernard turned away he was rather surprised but he reflected that mrs vivian had not proposed to spend her life on the banks of the oos and that people were leaving baden every day in the year in the evening at the kursaal he met captain lovelock who was wandering about with an air of explosive sadness  damn it they re goingyes they re going said the captain after the two young men had exchanged a few allusions to current events fancy their leaving us in that heartless manner it s not the time to run awayit s the time to keep your rooms if you re so lucky as to have any the races begin next week and there ll be a tremendous crowd all the grandducal people are coming miss evers wanted awfully to see the grand duke and i promised her an introduction i cant make out what mrs vivian is up to i bet you a tenpound note she s giving chase our friend wright has come back and gone off again and mrs vivian means to strike camp and follow she ll pot him yet you see if she does nt  she is running away from you dangerous man said bernard  do you mean on account of miss evers well i admire miss eversi dont mind admitting that but i aint dangerous said captain lovelock with a lustreless eye how can a fellow be dangerous when he has nt ten shillings in his pocket desperation do you call it but miss evers has nt money so far as i have heard i dont ask you lovelock continuedi dont care a damn whether she has or not she s a devilish charming girl and i dont mind telling you i m hit i stand no chancei know i stand no chance mrs vivian s down on me and by jove mrs vivian s right i m not the husband to pick out for a young woman of expensive habits and no expectations gordon wrights the sort of young man that s wanted and hang me if mrs vivian did nt want him so much for her own daughter i believe she d try and bag him for the little one gad i believe that to keep me off she would like to cut him in two and give half to each of them i m afraid of that little woman she has got a little voice like a screwdriver but for all that if i could get away from this cursed place i would keep the girl in sighthang me if i would nt i d cut the racesdash me if i would nt but i m in pawn if you know what that means i owe a beastly lot of money at the inn and that impudent little beggar of a landlord wont let me out of his sight the luck s dead against me at those filthy tables i have nt won a farthing in three weeks i wrote to my brother the other day and this morning i got an answer from hima cursed canting letter of good advice remarking that he had already paid my debts seven times it does nt happen to be seven it s only six or six and a half does he expect me to spend the rest of my life at the hotel de hollande perhaps he would like me to engage as a waiter there and pay it off by serving at the table dhote it would be convenient for him the next time he comes abroad with his seven daughters and two governesses i hate the smell of their beastly table dhote you re sorry i m hard up i m sure i m much obliged to you can you be of any service my dear fellow if you are bent on throwing your money about the place i m not the man to stop you bernards winnings of the previous night were burning a hole as the phrase is in his pocket ten thousand francs had never before seemed to him so heavy a load to carry and to lighten the weight of his good luck by lending fifty pounds to a less fortunate fellowplayer was an operation that not only gratified his goodnature but strongly commended itself to his conscience his conscience however made its conditions my dear longueville lovelock went on i have always gone in for family feeling early associations and all that sort of thing that s what made me confide my difficulties to dovedale but upon my honor you remind me of the good samaritan or that sort of person you are fonder of me than my own brother i ll take fifty pounds with pleasure thank you and you shall have them againat the earliest opportunity my earliest conveniencewill that do damn it it is a convenience is nt it you make your conditions my dear fellow i accept them in advance that i m not to follow up miss eversis that what you mean have you been commissioned by the family to buy me off it s devilish cruel to take advantage of my poverty though i m poor i m honest but i am honest my dear longueville that s the point i ll give you my word and i ll keep it i wont go near that girl againi wont think of her till i ve got rid of your fifty pounds it s a dreadful encouragement to extravagance but that s your lookout i ll stop for their beastly races and the young lady shall be sacred  longueville called the next morning at mrs vivians and learned that the three ladies had left baden by the early train a couple of hours before this fact produced in his mind a variety of emotionssurprise annoyance embarrassment in spite of his effort to think it natural they should go he found something precipitate and inexplicable in the manner of their going and he declared to himself that one of the party at least had been unkind and ungracious in not giving him a chance to say goodbye he took refuge by anticipation as it were in this reflection whenever for the next three or four days he foresaw himself stopping short as he had done before and asking himself whether he had done an injury to angela vivian this was an idle and unpractical question inasmuch as the answer was not forthcoming whereas it was quite simple and conclusive to say without the note of interrogation that she was in spite of many attractive points an abrupt and capricious young woman during the three or four days in question bernard lingered on at baden uncertain what to do or where to go feeling as if he had received a sudden checka sort of spiritual snubwhich arrested the accumulation of motive lovelock also whom bernard saw every day appeared to think that destiny had given him a slap in the face for he had not enjoyed the satisfaction of a last interview with miss evers  i thought she might have written me a note said the captain but it appears she does nt write some girls dont write you know  bernard remarked that it was possible lovelock would still have news of miss blanche and before he left baden he learned that she had addressed her forsaken swain a charming little note from lausanne where the three ladies had paused in their flight from baden and where mrs vivian had decreed that for the present they should remain  i m devilish glad she writes said captain lovelock some girls do write you know  blanche found lausanne most horrid after baden for whose delights she languished the delights of baden however were not obvious just now to her correspondent who had taken bernards fifty pounds into the kursaal and left them there bernard on learning his misfortune lent him another fifty with which he performed a second series of unsuccessful experiments and our hero was not at his ease until he had passed over to his luckless friend the whole amount of his own winnings every penny of which found its way through captain lovelocks fingers back into the bank when this operation was completed bernard left baden the captain gloomily accompanying him to the station  i have said that there had come over bernard a singular sense of freedom one of the uses he made of his freedom was to undertake a long journey he went to the east and remained absent from europe for upward of two yearsa period of his life of which it is not proposed to offer a complete history the east is a wonderful region and bernard investigating the mysteries of asia saw a great many curious and beautiful things he had moments of keen enjoyment he laid up a great store of impressions and even a considerable sum of knowledge but nevertheless he was not destined to look back upon this episode with any particular complacency it was less delightful than it was supposed to be it was less successful than it might have been by what unnatural element the cup of pleasure was adulterated he would have been very much at a loss to say but it was an incontestable fact that at times he sipped it as a medicine rather than quaffed it as a nectar when people congratulated him on his opportunity of seeing the world and said they envied him the privilege of seeing it so well he felt even more than the usual degree of irritation produced by an insinuation that fortune thinks so poorly of us as to give us easy terms misplaced sympathy is the least available of superfluities and bernard at this time found himself thinking that there was a good deal of impertinence in the world he would however readily have confessed that in so far as he failed to enjoy his oriental wanderings the fault was his own though he would have made mentally the gratifying reflection that never was a fault less deliberate if during the period of which i speak his natural gayety had sunk to a minor key a partial explanation may be found in the fact that he was deprived of the society of his late companion it was an odd circumstance that the two young men had not met since gordons abrupt departure from baden gordon went to berlin and shortly afterward to america so that they were on opposite sides of the globe before he returned to his own country bernard made by letter two or three offers to join him in europe anywhere that was agreeable to him gordon answered that his movements were very uncertain and that he should be sorry to trouble bernard to follow him about he had put him to this inconvenience in making him travel from venice to baden and one such favor at a time was enough to ask even of the most obliging of men bernard was of course afraid that what he had told gordon about angela vivian was really the cause of a state of things which as between two such good friends wore a perceptible resemblance to alienation gordon had given her up but he bore bernard a grudge for speaking ill of her and so long as this disagreeable impression should last he preferred not to see him bernard was frank enough to charge the poor fellow with a lingering rancor of which he made indeed no great crime but gordon denied the allegation and assured him that to his own perception there was no decline in their intimacy he only requested as a favor and as a tribute to just susceptibilities that bernard would allude no more either to miss vivian or to what had happened at baden this request was easy to comply with and bernard in writing strictly conformed to it but it seemed to him that the act of doing so was in itself a coolingoff what would be a better proof of what is called a tension than an agreement to avoid a natural topic bernard moralized a little over gordons just susceptibilities and felt that the existence of a perverse resentment in so honest a nature was a fact gained to his acquaintance with psychological science it cannot be said however that he suffered this fact to occupy at all times the foreground of his consciousness bernard was like some great painters his foregrounds were very happily arranged he heard nothing of mrs vivian and her daughter beyond a rumor that they had gone to italy and he learned on apparently good authority that blanche evers had returned to new york with her mother he wondered whether captain lovelock was still in pawn at the hotel de hollande if he did not allow himself to wonder too curiously whether he had done a harm to gordon it may be affirmed that he was haunted by the recurrence of that other question of which mention has already been made had he done a harm to angela vivian and did she know that he had done it this inquiry by no means made him miserable and it was far from awaiting him regularly on his pillow but it visited him at intervals and sometimes in the strangest placessuddenly abruptly in the stillness of an indian temple or amid the shrillness of an oriental crowd he became familiar with it at last he called it his jackinthebox some invisible touch of circumstance would press the spring and the little image would pop up staring him in the face and grinning an interrogation bernard always clapped down the lid for he regarded this phenomenon as strikingly inane but if it was more frequent than any pang of conscience connected with the remembrance of gordon himself this last sentiment was certainly lively enough to make it a great relief to hear at last a rumor that the excellent fellow was about to be married the rumor reached him at athens it was vague and indirect and it omitted the name of his betrothed but bernard made the most of it and took comfort in the thought that his friend had recovered his spirits and his appetite for matrimony       chapter xvi  it was not till our hero reached paris on his return from the distant east that the rumor i have just mentioned acquired an appreciable consistency here indeed it took the shape of authentic information among a number of delayed letters which had been awaiting him at his bankers he found a communication from gordon wright during the previous year or two his correspondence with this trustedand trustingfriend had not been frequent and bernard had received little direct news of him three or four short letters had overtaken him in his wanderingsletters as cordial to all appearance if not as voluminous as the punctual missives of an earlier time bernard made a point of satisfying himself that they were as cordial he weighed them in the scales of impartial suspicion it seemed to him on the whole that there was no relaxation of gordons epistolary tone if he wrote less often than he used to do that was a thing that very commonly happened as men grew older the closest intimacies moreover had phases and seasons intermissions and revivals and even if his friend had in fact averted his countenance from him this was simply the accomplishment of a periodical revolution which would bring them in due order face to face again bernard made a point himself of writing tolerably often and writing always in the friendliest tone he made it a matter of consciencehe liked to feel that he was treating gordon generously and not demanding an eye for an eye the letter he found in paris was so short that i may give it entire  my dear bernard it ran i must write to you before i write to any one else though unfortunately you are so far away that you cant be the first to congratulate me try and not be the last however i am going to be marriedas soon as possible you know the young lady so you can appreciate the situation do you remember little blanche evers whom we used to see three years ago at badenbaden of course you remember her for i know you used often to talk with her you will be rather surprised perhaps at my having selected her as the partner of a lifetime but we manage these matters according to our lights i am very much in love with her and i hold that an excellent reason i have been ready any time this year or two to fall in love with some simple trusting childlike nature i find this in perfection in this charming young girl i find her so natural and fresh i remember telling you once that i did nt wish to be fascinatedthat i wanted to estimate scientifically the woman i should marry i have altogether got over that and i dont know how i ever came to talk such nonsense i am fascinated now and i assure you i like it the best of it is that i find it does nt in the least prevent my estimating blanche i judge her very fairlyi see just what she is she s simplethat s what i want she s tenderthat s what i long for you will remember how pretty she is i need nt remind you of that she was much younger then and she has greatly developed and improved in these two or three years but she will always be young and innocenti dont want her to improve too much she came back to america with her mother the winter after we met her at baden but i never saw her again till three months ago then i saw her with new eyes and i wondered i could have been so blind but i was nt ready for her till then and what makes me so happy now is to know that i have come to my present way of feeling by experience that gives me confidenceyou see i am a reasoner still but i am under the charm for all my reason we are to be married in a monthtry and come back to the wedding blanche sends you a message which i will give you verbatim tell him i am not such a silly little chatterbox as i used to be at baden i am a great deal wiser i am almost as clever as angela vivian she has an idea you thought miss vivian very cleverbut it is not true that she is equally so i am very happy come home and see  bernard went home but he was not able to reach the united states in time for gordons wedding which took place at midsummer bernard arriving late in the autumn found his friend a married man of some months standing and was able to judge according to his invitation whether he appeared happy the first effect of the letter i have just quoted had been an immense surprise the second had been a series of reflections which were quite the negative of surprise and these operations of bernards mind had finally merged themselves in a simple sentiment of jollity he was delighted that gordon should be married he felt jovial about it he was almost indifferent to the question of whom he had chosen certainly at first the choice of blanche evers seemed highly incongruous it was difficult to imagine a young woman less shaped to minister to gordons strenuous needs than the lighthearted and emptyheaded little flirt whose inconsequent prattle had remained for bernard one of the least importunate memories of a charming time blanche evers was a pretty little goosethe prettiest of little geese perhaps and doubtless the most amiable but she was not a companion for a peculiarly serious man who would like his wife to share his view of human responsibilities what a singular selectionwhat a queer infatuation bernard had no sooner committed himself to this line of criticism than he stopped short with the sudden consciousness of error carried almost to the point of naivetae he exclaimed that blanche evers was exactly the sort of girl that men of gordon wrights stamp always ended by falling in love with and that poor gordon knew very much better what he was about in this case than he had done in trying to solve the deep problem of a comfortable life with angela vivian this was what your strong solid sensible fellows always came to they paid in this particular a larger tribute to pure fancy than the people who were supposed habitually to cultivate that muse blanche evers was what the french call an article of fantasy and gordon had taken a pleasure in finding her deliciously useless he cultivated utility in other ways and it pleased and flattered him to feel that he could afford morally speaking to have a kittenish wife he had within himself a fund of common sense to draw upon so that to espouse a paragon of wisdom would be but to carry water to the fountain he could easily make up for the deficiencies of a wife who was a little silly and if she charmed and amused him he could treat himself to the luxury of these sensations for themselves he was not in the least afraid of being ruined by it and if blanches birdlike chatter and turns of the head had made a fool of him he knew it perfectly well and simply took his stand upon his rights every man has a right to a little flowerbed and life is not all mere kitchengardening bernard rapidly extemporized this rough explanation of the surprise his friend had offered him and he found it allsufficient for his immediate needs he wrote blanche a charming note to which she replied with a great deal of spirit and grace her little letter was very prettily turned and bernard reading it over two or three times said to himself that to do her justice she might very well have polished her intellect a trifle during these two or three years as she was older she could hardly help being wiser it even occurred to bernard that she might have profited by the sort of experience that is known as the discipline of suffering what had become of captain lovelock and that tender passion which was apparently none the less genuine for having been expressed in the slang of a humorous period had they been permanently separated by judicious guardians and had she been obliged to obliterate his image from her lightlybeating little heart bernard had felt sure at baden that beneath her contemptuous airs and that impertinent consciousness of the difficulties of conquest by which a pretty american girl attests her allegiance to a civilization in which young women occupy the highest placehe had felt sure that blanche had a high appreciation of her handsome englishman and that if lovelock should continue to relish her charms he might count upon the advantages of reciprocity but it occurred to bernard that captain lovelock had perhaps been faithless that at least the discourtesy of chance and the inhumanity of an elder brother might have kept him an eternal prisoner at the hotel de hollande where for all bernard knew to the contrary he had been obliged to work out his destiny in the arduous character of a polyglot waiter so that the poor young girl casting backward glances along the path of mrs vivians retreat and failing to detect the onward rush of a rescuing cavalier had perforce believed herself forsaken and had been obliged to summon philosophy to her aid it was very possible that her philosophic studies had taught her the art of reflection and that as she would have said herself she was tremendously toned down once at baden when gordon wright happened to take upon himself to remark that little miss evers was bored by her english gallant bernard had ventured to observe in petto that gordon knew nothing about it but all this was of no consequence now and bernard steered further and further away from the liability to detect fallacies in his friend gordon had engaged himself to marry and our critical hero had not a grain of fault to find with this resolution it was a capital thing it was just what he wanted it would do him a world of good bernard rejoiced with him sincerely and regretted extremely that a series of solemn engagements to pay visits in england should prevent his being present at the nuptials  they were well over as i have said when he reached new york the honeymoon had waned and the business of married life had begun bernard at the end had sailed from england rather abruptly a friend who had a remarkably good cabin on one of the steamers was obliged by a sudden detention to give it up and on his offering it to longueville the latter availed himself gratefully of this opportunity of being a little less discomposed than usual by the atlantic billows he therefore embarked at two days notice a fortnight earlier than he had intended and than he had written to gordon to expect him gordon of course had written that he was to seek no hospitality but that which blanche was now preparedthey had a charming houseso graciously to dispense but bernard nevertheless leaving the ship early in the morning had betaken himself to an hotel he wished not to anticipate his welcome and he determined to report himself to gordon first and to come back with his luggage later in the day after purifying himself of his seastains he left his hotel and walked up the fifth avenue with all a newlylanded voyagers enjoyment of terrestrial locomotion it was a charming autumn day there was a golden haze in the air he supposed it was the indian summer the broad sidewalk of the fifth avenue was scattered over with dry leavescrimson and orange and amber he tossed them with his stick as he passed they rustled and murmured with the motion and it reminded him of the way he used to kick them in front of him over these same pavements in his riotous infancy it was a pleasure after many wanderings to find himself in his native land again and bernard longueville as he went paid his compliments to his mothercity the brightness and gayety of the place seemed a greeting to a returning son and he felt a throb of affection for the freshest the youngest the easiest and most goodnatured of great capitals on presenting himself at gordons door bernard was told that the master of the house was not at home he went in however to see the mistress she was in her drawingroom alone she had on her bonnet as if she had been going out she gave him a joyous demonstrative little welcome she was evidently very glad to see him bernard had thought it possible she had improved and she was certainly prettier than ever he instantly perceived that she was still a chatterbox it remained to be seen whether the quality of her discourse were finer  well mr longueville she exclaimed where in the world did you drop from and how long did it take you to cross the atlantic three days eh it could nt have taken you many more for it was only the other day that gordon told me you were not to sail till the 20th you changed your mind eh i did nt know you ever changed your mind gordon never changes his that s not a reason eh because you are not a bit like gordon well i never thought you were except that you are a man now what are you laughing at what should you like me call you you are a man i suppose you are not a god that s what you would like me to call you i have no doubt i must keep that for gordon i shall certainly keep it a good while i know a good deal more about gentlemen than i did when i last saw you and i assure you i dont think they are a bit godlike i suppose that s why you always drop down from the skyyou think it s more divine i remember that s the way you arrived at baden when we were there together the first thing we knew you were standing in the midst of us do you remember that evening when you presented yourself you came up and touched gordon on the shoulder and he gave a little jump he will give another little jump when he sees you today he gives a great many little jumps i keep him skipping about i remember perfectly the way we were sitting that evening at baden and the way you looked at me when you came up i saw you before gordoni see a good many things before gordon what did you look at me that way for i always meant to ask you i was dying to know  for the simplest reason in the world said bernard because you were so pretty  ah no it was nt that i know all about that look it was something elseas if you knew something about me i dont know what you can have known there was very little to know about me except that i was intensely silly really i was awfully silly that summer at badenyou would nt believe how silly i was but i dont see how you could have known thatbefore you had spoken to me it came out in my conversationit came out awfully my mother was a good deal disappointed in mrs vivians influence she had expected so much from it but it was not poor mrs vivians fault it was some ones else have you ever seen the vivians again they are always in europe they have gone to live in paris that evening when you came up and spoke to gordon i never thought that three years afterward i should be married to him and i dont suppose you did either is that what you meant by looking at me perhaps you can tell the future i wish you would tell my future  oh i can tell that easily said bernard  what will happen to me  nothing particular it will be a little dullthe perfect happiness of a charming woman married to the best fellow in the world  ah what a horrid future cried blanche with a little petulant cry i want to be happy but i certainly dont want to be dull if you say that again you will make me repent of having married the best fellow in the world i mean to be happy but i certainly shall not be dull if i can help it  i was wrong to say that said bernard because after all my dear young lady there must be an excitement in having so kind a husband as you have got gordons devotion is quite capable of taking a new formof inventing a new kindnessevery day in the year  blanche looked at him an instant with less than her usual consciousness of her momentary pose  my husband is very kind she said gently  she had hardly spoken the words when gordon came in he stopped a moment on seeing bernard glanced at his wife blushed flushed and with a loud frank exclamation of pleasure grasped his friend by both hands it was so long since he had seen bernard that he seemed a good deal moved he stood there smiling clasping his hands looking him in the eyes unable for some moments to speak bernard on his side was greatly pleased it was delightful to him to look into gordons honest face again and to return his manly grasp and he looked wellhe looked happy to see that was more delightful yet during these few instants while they exchanged a silent pledge of renewed friendship bernards elastic perception embraced several things besides the consciousness of his own pleasure he saw that gordon looked well and happy but that he looked older too and more serious more marked by life he looked as if something had happened to himas in fact something had bernard saw a latent spark in his friends eye that seemed to question his own for an impression of blancheto question it eagerly and yet to deprecate judgment he saw toowith the fact made more vivid by gordons standing there beside her in his manly sincerity and throwing it into contrastthat blanche was the same little posturing coquette of a blanche whom at baden he would have treated it as a broad joke that gordon wright should dream of marrying he saw in a word that it was what it had first struck him as beingan incongruous union all this was a good deal for bernard to see in the course of half a minute especially through the rather opaque medium of a feeling of irreflective joy and his impressions at this moment have a value only in so far as they were destined to be confirmed by larger opportunity  you have come a little sooner than we expected said gordon but you are all the more welcome  it was rather a risk blanche observed one should be notified when one wishes to make a good impression  ah my dear lady said bernard you made your impressionas far as i am concerneda long time ago and i doubt whether it would have gained anything today by your having prepared an effect  they were standing before the fireplace on the great hearthrug and blanche while she listened to this speech was feeling with uplifted arm for a curl that had strayed from her chignon  she prepares her effects very quickly said gordon laughing gently they follow each other very fast  blanche kept her hand behind her head which was bent slightly forward her bare arm emerged from her hanging sleeve and with her eyes glancing upward from under her lowered brows she smiled at her two spectators her husband laid his hand on bernards arm  is nt she pretty he cried and he spoke with a sort of tender delight in being sure at least of this point  tremendously pretty said bernard i told her so half an hour before you came in  ah it was time i should arrive gordon exclaimed  blanche was manifestly not in the least discomposed by this frank discussion of her charms for the air of distinguished esteem adopted by both of her companions diminished the crudity of their remarks but she gave a little pout of irritated modestyit was more becoming than anything she had done yetand declared that if they wished to talk her over they were very welcome but she should prefer their waiting till she got out of the room so she left them reminding bernard that he was to send for his luggage and remain and promising to give immediate orders for the preparation of his apartment bernard opened the door for her to pass out she gave him a charming nod as he stood there and he turned back to gordon with the reflection of her smile in his face gordon was watching him gordon was dying to know what he thought of her it was a curious mania of gordons this wanting to know what one thought of the women he loved but bernard just now felt abundantly able to humor it he was so pleased at seeing him tightly married  she s a delightful creature bernard said with cordial vagueness shaking hands with his friend again  gordon glanced at him a moment and then coloring a little looked straight out of the window whereupon bernard remembered that these were just the terms in which at baden after his companions absence he had attempted to qualify angela vivian gordon was conscioushe was conscious of the oddity of his situation  of course it surprised you he said in a moment still looking out of the window  what my dear fellow  my marriage  well you know said bernard everything surprises me i am of a very conjectural habit of mind all sorts of ideas come into my head and yet when the simplest things happen i am always rather startled i live in a reverie and i am perpetually waked up by people doing things  gordon transferred his eyes from the window to bernards faceto his whole person  you are waked up but you fall asleep again  i fall asleep very easily said bernard  gordon looked at him from head to foot smiling and shaking his head  you are not changed he said you have travelled in unknown lands you have had i suppose all sorts of adventures but you are the same man i used to know  i am sorry for that  you have the same way of representingof misrepresenting yourself  well if i am not changed said bernard i can ill afford to lose so valuable an art  taking you altogether i am glad you are the same gordon answered simply but you must come into my part of the house       chapter xvii  yes he was conscioushe was very conscious so bernard reflected during the two or three first days of his visit to his friend gordon knew it must seem strange to so irreverent a critic that a man who had once aspired to the hand of so intelligent a girlputting other things asideas angela vivian should as the ghost in hamlet says have declined upon a young lady who in force of understanding was so very much miss vivians inferior and this knowledge kept him ill at his ease and gave him a certain pitiable awkwardness bernards sense of the anomaly grew rapidly less acute he made various observations which helped it to seem natural blanche was wonderfully pretty she was very graceful innocent amusing since gordon had determined to marry a little goose he had chosen the animal with extreme discernment it had quite the plumage of a swan and it sailed along the stream of life with an extraordinary lightness of motion he asked himself indeed at times whether blanche were really so silly as she seemed he doubted whether any woman could be so silly as blanche seemed he had a suspicion at times that for ends of her own she was playing a partthe suspicion arising from the fact that as usually happens in such cases she overplayed it her empty chatter her futility her childish coquetry and frivolitysuch light wares could hardly be the whole substance of any womans being there was something beneath them which blanche was keeping out of sight she had a scrap of a mind somewhere and even a little particle of a heart if one looked long enough one might catch a glimpse of these possessions but why should she keep them out of sight and what were the ends that she proposed to serve by this uncomfortable perversity bernard wondered whether she were fond of her husband and he heard it intimated by several good people in new york who had had some observation of the courtship that she had married him for his money he was very sorry to find that this was taken for granted and he determined on the whole not to believe it he was disgusted with the idea of such a want of gratitude for if gordon wright had loved miss evers for herself the young lady might certainly have discovered the intrinsic value of so disinterested a suitor her mother had the credit of having made the match gordon was known to be looking for a wife mrs evers had put her little featherhead of a daughter very much forward and gordon was as easily captivated as a child by the sound of a rattle blanche had an affection for him now however bernard saw no reason to doubt that and certainly she would have been a very flimsy creature indeed if she had not been touched by his inexhaustible kindness she had every conceivable indulgence and if she married him for his money at least she had got what she wanted she led the most agreeable life conceivable and she ought to be in high goodhumor it was impossible to have a prettier house a prettier carriage more jewels and laces for the adornment of a plump little person it was impossible to go to more parties to give better dinners to have fewer privations or annoyances bernard was so much struck with all this that advancing rapidly in the intimacy of his gracious hostess he ventured to call her attention to her blessings she answered that she was perfectly aware of them and there was no pretty speech she was not prepared to make about gordon  i know what you want to say she went on you want to say that he spoils me and i dont see why you should hesitate you generally say everything you want and you need nt be afraid of me he does nt spoil me simply because i am so bad i cant be spoiled but that s of no consequence i was spoiled ages ago every one spoiled meevery one except mrs vivian i was always fond of having everything i want and i generally managed to get it i always had lovely clothes mamma thought that was a kind of a duty if it was a duty i dont suppose it counts as a part of the spoiling but i was very much indulged and i know i have everything now gordon is a perfect husband i believe if i were to ask him for a present of his nose he would cut it off and give it to me i think i will ask him for a small piece of it some day it will rather improve him to have an inch or two less i dont say he s handsome but he s just as good as he can be some people say that if you are very fond of a person you always think them handsome but i dont agree with that at all i am very fond of gordon and yet i am not blinded by affection as regards his personal appearance he s too light for my taste and too red and because you think people handsome it does nt follow that you are fond of them i used to have a friend who was awfully handsomethe handsomest man i ever sawand i was perfectly conscious of his defects but i m not conscious of gordons and i dont believe he has got any he s so intensely kind it s quite pathetic one would think he had done me an injury in marrying me and that he wanted to make up for it if he has done me an injury i have nt discovered it yet and i dont believe i ever shall i certainly shall not as long as he lets me order all the clothes i want i have ordered five dresses this week and i mean to order two more when i told gordon what do you think he did he simply kissed me well if that s not expressive i dont know what he could have done he kisses me about seventeen times a day i suppose it s very improper for a woman to tell any one how often her husband kisses her but as you happen to have seen him do it i dont suppose you will be scandalized i know you are not easily scandalized i am not afraid of you you are scandalized at my getting so many dresses well i told you i was spoiledi freely acknowledge it that s why i was afraid to tell gordonbecause when i was married i had such a lot of things i was supposed to have dresses enough to last for a year but gordon had nt to pay for them so there was no harm in my letting him feel that he has a wife if he thinks i am extravagant he can easily stop kissing me you dont think it would be easy to stop it s very well then for those that have never begun  bernard had a good deal of conversation with blanche of which so far as she was concerned the foregoing remarks may serve as a specimen gordon was away from home during much of the day he had a chemical laboratory in which he was greatly interested and which he took bernard to see it was fitted up with the latest contrivances for the pursuit of experimental science and was the resort of needy young students who enjoyed at gordons expense the opportunity for pushing their researches the place did great honor to gordons liberality and to his ingenuity but blanche who had also paid it a visit could never speak of it without a pretty little shudder  nothing would induce me to go there again she declared and i consider myself very fortunate to have escaped from it with my life it s filled with all sorts of horrible things that fizzle up and go off or that make you turn some dreadful color if you look at them i expect to hear a great clap some day and half an hour afterward to see gordon brought home in several hundred small pieces put up in a dozen little bottles i got a horrid little stain in the middle of my dress that one of the young menthe young savantswas so good as to drop there did you see the young savants who work under gordons orders i thought they were too forlorn there is nt one of them you would look at if you can believe it there was nt one of them that looked at me they took no more notice of me than if i had been the charwoman they might have shown me some attention at least as the wife of the proprietor what is it that gordon s calledis nt there some other name if you say proprietor it sounds as if he kept an hotel i certainly dont want to pass for the wife of an hotelkeeper what does he call himself he must have some name i hate telling people he s a chemist it sounds just as if he kept a shop that s what they call the druggists in england and i formed the habit while i was there it makes me feel as if he were some dreadful little man with big green bottles in the window and nightbell painted outside he does nt call himself anything well that s exactly like gordon i wonder he consents to have a name at all when i was telling some one about the young men who work under his ordersthe young savantshe said i must not say thati must not speak of their working under his orders i dont know what he would like me to say under his inspiration  during the hours of gordons absence bernard had frequent colloquies with his friends wife whose irresponsible prattle amused him and in whom he tried to discover some faculty some quality which might be a positive guarantee of gordons future felicity but often of course gordon was an auditor as well i say an auditor because it seemed to bernard that he had grown to be less of a talker than of yore doubtless when a man finds himself united to a garrulous wife he naturally learns to hold his tongue but sometimes at the close of one of blanches discursive monologues on glancing at her husband just to see how he took it and seeing him sit perfectly silent with a fixed inexpressive smile bernard said to himself that gordon found the lesson of listening attended with some embarrassments gordon as the years went by was growing a little inscrutable but this too in certain circumstances was a usual tendency the operations of the mind with deepening experience became more complex and people were less apt to emit immature reflections at forty than they had been in their earlier days bernard felt a great kindness in these days for his old friend he never yet had seemed to him such a good fellow nor appealed so strongly to the benevolence of his disposition sometimes of old gordon used to irritate him but this danger appeared completely to have passed away bernard prolonged his visit it gave him pleasure to be able to testify in this manner to his good will gordon was the kindest of hosts and if in conversation when his wife was present he gave precedence to her superior powers he had at other times a good deal of pleasant bachelortalk with his guest he seemed very happy he had plenty of occupation and plenty of practical intentions the season went on and bernard enjoyed his life he enjoyed the keen and brilliant american winter and he found it very pleasant to be treated as a distinguished stranger in his own landa situation to which his long and repeated absences had relegated him the hospitality of new york was profuse the charm of its daughters extreme the radiance of its skies superb bernard was the restless and professionless mortal that we know wandering in life from one vague experiment to another constantly gratified and never satisfied to whom no imperious finality had as yet presented itself and nevertheless for a time he contrived to limit his horizon to the passing hour and to make a good many hours pass in the drawingroom of a demonstrative flirt  for mrs gordon was a flirt that had become tolerably obvious bernard had known of old that blanche evers was one and two or three months observation of his friends wife assured him that she did not judge a certain ethereal coquetry to be inconsistent with the conjugal character blanche flirted in fact more or less with all men but her opportunity for playing her harmless batteries upon bernard were of course exceptionally large the poor fellow was perpetually under fire and it was inevitable that he should reply with some precision of aim it seemed to him all childs play and it is certain that when his back was turned to his pretty hostess he never found himself thinking of her he had not the least reason to suppose that she thought of himexcessive concentration of mind was the last vice of which he accused her but before the winter was over he discovered that mrs gordon wright was being talked about and that his own name was as the newspapers say mentioned in connection with that of his friends wife the discovery greatly disgusted him bernard longuevilles chronicler must do him the justice to say that it failed to yield him an even transient thrill of pleasure he thought it very improbable that this vulgar rumor had reached gordons ears but he neverthelessvery naturallyinstantly made up his mind to leave the house he lost no time in saying to gordon that he had suddenly determined to go to california and that he was sure he must be glad to get rid of him gordon expressed no surprise and no regret he simply laid his hand on his shoulder and said very quietly looking at him in the eyes  very well the pleasantest things must come to an end  it was not till an hour afterwards that bernard said to himself that his friends manner of receiving the announcement of his departure had been rather odd he had neither said a word about his staying longer nor urged him to come back again and there had been it now seemed to bernard an audible undertone of relief in the single sentence with which he assented to his visitors withdrawal could it be possible that poor gordon was jealous of him that he had heard this loathsome gossip or that his own observation had given him an alarm he had certainly never betrayed the smallest sense of injury but it was to be remembered that even if he were uneasy gordon was quite capable with his characteristic habit of weighing everything his own honor included in scrupulously adjusted scales of denying himself the luxury of active suspicion he would never have let a half suspicion make a difference in his conduct and he would not have dissimulated he would simply have resisted belief his hospitality had been without a flaw and if he had really been wishing bernard out of his house he had behaved with admirable selfcontrol bernard however followed this train of thought a very short distance it was odious to him to believe that he could have appeared to gordon however guiltlessly to have invaded even in imagination the mystic line of the marital monopoly not to say that moreover if one came to that he really cared about as much for poor little blanche as for the weathercock on the nearest steeple he simply hurried his preparations for departure and he told blanche that he should have to bid her farewell on the following day he had found her in the drawingroom waiting for dinner she was expecting company to dine and gordon had not yet come down  she was sitting in the vague glow of the firelight in a wonderful blue dress with two little blue feet crossed on the rug and pointed at the hearth she received bernards announcement with small satisfaction and expended a great deal of familiar ridicule on his project of a journey to california then suddenly getting up and looking at him a moment  i know why you are going she said  i am glad to hear my explanations have not been lost  your explanations are all nonsense you are going for another reason  well said bernard if you insist upon it it s because you are too sharp with me  it s because of me so much as that is true bernard wondered what she was going to sayif she were going to be silly enough to allude to the most impudent of fictions then as she stood opening and closing her blue fan and smiling at him in the firelight he felt that she was silly enough for anything it s because of all the talkit s because of gordon you need nt be afraid of gordon  afraid of him i dont know what you mean said bernard gravely  blanche gave a little laugh  you have discovered that people are talking about usabout you and me i must say i wonder you care i dont care and if it s because of gordon you might as well know that he does nt care if he does nt care i dont see why i should and if i dont i dont see why you should  you pay too much attention to such insipid drivel in even mentioning it  well if i have the credit of saying what i should ntto you or to any one elsei dont see why i should nt have the advantage too gordon does nt carehe does nt care what i do or say he does nt care a pin for me  she spoke in her usual rattling rambling voice and brought out this declaration with a curious absence of resentment  you talk about advantage said bernard i dont see what advantage it is to you to say that  i want toi musti will that s the advantage this came out with a sudden sharpness of tone she spoke more excitedly he does nt care a button for me and he never did i dont know what he married me for he cares for something elsehe thinks of something else i dont know what it isi suppose it s chemistry  these words gave bernard a certain shock but he had his intelligence sufficiently in hand to contradict them with energy  you labor under a monstrous delusion he exclaimed your husband thinks you fascinating  this epithet pronounced with a fine distinctness was ringing in the air when the door opened and gordon came in he looked for a moment from bernard to his wife and then approaching the latter he said softly  do you know that he leaves us tomorrow       chapter xviii  bernard left then and went to california but when he arrived there he asked himself why he had come and was unable to mention any other reason than that he had announced it he began to feel restless again and to drift back to that chronic chagrin which had accompanied him through his long journey in the east he succeeded however in keeping these unreasonable feelings at bay for some time and he strove to occupy himself to take an interest in californian problems bernard however was neither an economist nor a cattlefancier and he found that as the phrase is there was not a great deal to take hold of he wandered about admired the climate and the big peaches thought a while of going to japan and ended by going to mexico in this way he passed several months and justified in the eyes of other people at least his long journey across the continent at last he made it again in the opposite sense he went back to new york where the summer had already begun and here he invented a solution for the difficulty presented by life to a culpably unoccupied and illregulated man the solution was not in the least original and i am almost ashamed to mention so stale and conventional a device bernard simply hit upon the plan of returning to europe such as it was however he carried it out with an audacity worthy of a better cause and was sensibly happier since he had made up his mind to it gordon wright and his wife were out of town but bernard went into the country as boldly as you please to inform them of his little project and take a long leave of them he had made his arrangements to sail immediately and as at such short notice it was impossible to find good quarters on one of the english vessels he had engaged a berth on a french steamer which would convey him to havre on going down to gordons house in the country he was conscious of a good deal of eagerness to know what had become of that latent irritation of which blanche had given him a specimen apparently it had quite subsided blanche was wreathed in smiles she was living in a bower of roses bernard indeed had no opportunity for investigating her state of mind for he found several people in the house and blanche who had an exalted standard of the duties of a hostess was occupied in making life agreeable to her guests most of whom were gentlemen she had in this way that great remedy for dissatisfaction which bernard lackedsomething interesting to do bernard felt a good deal of genuine sadness in taking leave of gordon to whom he contrived to feel even more kindly than in earlier days he had quite forgotten that gordon was jealous of himwhich he was not as bernard said certainly gordon showed nothing of it now and nothing could have been more friendly than their parting gordon also for a man who was never boisterous seemed very contented he was fond of exercising hospitality and he confessed to bernard that he was just now in the humor for having his house full of people fortune continued to gratify this generous taste for just as bernard was coming away another guest made his appearance the newcomer was none other than the honourable augustus lovelock who had just arrived in new york and who as he added had long desired to visit the united states bernard merely witnessed his arrival and was struck with the fact that as he presented himselfit seemed quite a surpriseblanche really stopped chattering       chapter xix  i have called it a stale expedient on bernard longuevilles part to go to europe again like the most commonplace american and it is certain that as our young man stood and looked out of the window of his inn at havre an hour after his arrival at that seaport his adventure did not strike him as having any great freshness he had no plans nor intentions he had not even any very definite desires he had felt the impulse to come back to europe and he had obeyed it but now that he had arrived his impulse seemed to have little more to say to him he perceived it indeedmentallyin the attitude of a small streetboy playing upon his nose with that vulgar gesture which is supposed to represent the elation of successful fraud there was a large blank wall before his window painted a dirty yellow and much discolored by the weather a broad patch of summer sunlight rested upon it and brought out the full vulgarity of its complexion bernard stared a while at this blank wall which struck him in some degree as a symbol of his own present moral prospect then suddenly he turned away with the declaration that whatever truth there might be in symbolism he at any rate had not come to europe to spend the precious remnant of his youth in a malodorous norman seaport the weather was very hot and neither the hotel nor the town at large appeared to form an attractive sejour for persons of an irritable nostril to go to paris however was hardly more attractive than to remain at havre for bernard had a lively vision of the heated bitumen and the glaring frontages of the french capital but if a norman town was close and dull the norman country was notoriously fresh and entertaining and the next morning bernard got into a caleche with his luggage and bade its proprietor drive him along the coast once he had begun to rumble through this charming landscape he was in much better humor with his situation the air was freshened by a breeze from the sea the blooming country without walls or fences lay open to the travellers eye the grainfields and copses were shimmering in the summer wind the pinkfaced cottages peeped through the ripening orchardboughs and the gray towers of the old churches were silvered by the morninglight of france  at the end of some three hours bernard arrived at a little wateringplace which lay close upon the shore in the embrace of a pair of whitearmed cliffs it had a quaint and primitive aspect and a natural picturesqueness which commended it to bernards taste there was evidently a great deal of nature about it and at this moment nature embodied in the clear gay sunshine in the blue and quiet sea in the daisied grass of the highshouldered downs had an air of inviting the intelligent observer to postpone his difficulties blanquaislesgalets as bernard learned the name of this unfashionable resort to be was twenty miles from a railway and the place wore an expression of unaffected rusticity bernard stopped at an inn for his noonday breakfast and then with his appreciation quickened by the homely felicity of this repast determined to go no further he engaged a room at the inn dismissed his vehicle and gave himself up to the contemplation of french seaside manners these were chiefly to be observed upon a pebbly strand which lay along the front of the village and served as the gatheringpoint of its idler inhabitants bathing in the sea was the chief occupation of these good people including as it did prolonged spectatorship of the process and infinite conversation upon its mysteries the little world of blanquais appeared to form a large family party of highly developed amphibious habits which sat gossiping all day upon the warm pebbles occasionally dipping into the sea and drying itself in the sun without any relaxation of personal intimacy all this was very amusing to bernard who in the course of the day took a bath with the rest the ocean was after all very large and when one took ones plunge one seemed to have it quite to ones self when he had dressed himself again bernard stretched himself on the beach feeling happier than he had done in a long time and pulled his hat over his eyes the feeling of happiness was an odd one it had come over him suddenly without visible cause but such as it was our hero made the most of it as he lay there it seemed to deepen his immersion and his exercise in the salt water had given him an agreeable languor this presently became a drowsiness which was not less agreeable and bernard felt himself going to sleep there were sounds in the air above his headsounds of the crunching and rattling of the loose smooth stones as his neighbors moved about on them of highpitched french voices exchanging colloquial cries of the plash of the bathers in the distant water and the short soft breaking of the waves but these things came to his ears more vaguely and remotely and at last they faded away bernard enjoyed half an hour of that light and easy slumber which is apt to overtake idle people in recumbent attitudes in the open air on august afternoons it brought with it an exquisite sense of rest and the rest was not spoiled by the fact that it was animated by a charming dream dreams are vague things and this one had the defects of its species but it was somehow concerned with the image of a young lady whom bernard had formerly known and who had beautiful eyes into whichin the dreamhe found himself looking he waked up to find himself looking into the crown of his hat which had been resting on the bridge of his nose he removed it and half raised himself resting on his elbow and preparing to taste in another position of a little more of that exquisite rest of which mention has just been made the world about him was still amusing and charming the chatter of his companions losing itself in the large seapresence the plash of the divers and swimmers the deep blue of the ocean and the silvery white of the cliff had that striking air of indifference to the fact that his mind had been absent from them which we are apt to find in mundane things on emerging from a nap the same people were sitting near him on the beachthe same and yet not quite the same he found himself noticing a person whom he had not noticed beforea young lady who was seated in a low portable chair some dozen yards off with her eyes bent upon a book her head was in shade her large parasol made indeed an awning for her whole person which in this way in the quiet attitude of perusal seemed to abstract itself from the glare and murmur of the beach the clear shadow of her umbrellait was lined with bluewas deep upon her face but it was not deep enough to prevent bernard from recognizing a profile that he knew he suddenly sat upright with an intensely quickened vision was he dreaming still or had he waked in a moment he felt that he was acutely awake he heard her across the interval turn the page of her book for a single instant as she did so she looked with level brows at the glittering ocean then lowering her eyes she went on with her reading in this barely perceptible movement he saw angela vivian it was wonderful how well he remembered her she was evidently reading very seriously she was much interested in her book she was alone bernard looked about for her mother but mrs vivian was not in sight by this time bernard had become aware that he was agitated the exquisite rest of a few moments before had passed away his agitation struck him as unreasonable in a few minutes he made up his mind that it was absurd he had done her an injuryyes but as she sat there losing herself in a french novelbernard could see it was a french novelhe could not make out that she was the worse for it it had not affected her appearance miss vivian was still a handsome girl bernard hoped she would not look toward him or recognize him he wished to look at her at his ease to think it over to make up his mind the idea of meeting angela vivian again had often come into his thoughts i may indeed say that it was a tolerably familiar presence there but the fact nevertheless now presented itself with all the violence of an accident for which he was totally unprepared he had often asked himself what he should say to her how he should carry himself and how he should probably find the young lady but with whatever ingenuity he might at the moment have answered these questions his intelligence at present felt decidedly overtaxed she was a very pretty girl to whom he had done a wrong this was the final attitude into which with a good deal of preliminary shifting and wavering she had settled in his recollection the wrong was a right doubtless from certain points of view but from the girls own it could only seem an injury to which its having been inflicted by a clever young man with whom she had been on agreeable terms necessarily added a touch of baseness  in every disadvantage that a woman suffers at the hands of a man there is inevitably in what concerns the man an element of cowardice when i say inevitably i mean that this is what the woman sees in it this is what bernard believed that angela vivian saw in the fact that by giving his friend a bad account of her he had prevented her making an opulent marriage at first he had said to himself that whether he had held his tongue or spoken she had already lost her chance but with time somehow this reflection had lost its weight in the scale it conveyed little reassurance to his irritated conscienceit had become imponderable and impertinent at the moment of which i speak it entirely failed to present itself even for forms sake and as he sat looking at this superior creature who came back to him out of an episode of his past he thought of her simply as an unprotected woman toward whom he had been indelicate it is not an agreeable thing for a delicate man like bernard longueville to have to accommodate himself to such an accident but this is nevertheless what it seemed needful that he should do if she bore him a grudge he must think it natural if she had vowed him a hatred he must allow her the comfort of it he had done the only thing possible but that made it no better for her he had wronged her the circumstances mattered nothing and as he could not make it up to her the only reasonable thing was to keep out of her way he had stepped into her path now and the proper thing was to step out of it if it could give her no pleasure to see him again it could certainly do him no good to see her he had seen her by this time pretty wellas far as mere seeing went and as yet apparently he was none the worse for that but his hope that he should himself escape unperceived had now become acute it is singular that this hope should not have led him instantly to turn his back and move away but the explanation of his imprudent delay is simply that he wished to see a little more of miss vivian he was unable to bring himself to the point those clever things that he might have said to her quite faded away the only good taste was to take himself off and spare her the trouble of inventing civilities that she could not feel and yet he continued to sit there from moment to moment arrested detained fascinated by the accident of her not looking roundof her having let him watch her so long she turned another page and another and her reading absorbed her still he was so near her that he could have touched her dress with the point of his umbrella at last she raised her eyes and rested them a while on the blue horizon straight in front of her but as yet without turning them aside this however augmented the danger of her doing so and bernard with a good deal of an effort rose to his feet the effort doubtless kept the movement from being either as light or as swift as it might have been and it vaguely attracted his neighbors attention she turned her head and glanced at him with a glance that evidently expected but to touch him and pass it touched him and it was on the point of passing then it suddenly checked itself she had recognized him she looked at him straight and openeyed out of the shadow of her parasol and bernard stood theremotionless nowreceiving her gaze how long it lasted need not be narrated it was probably a matter of a few seconds but to bernard it seemed a little eternity he met her eyes he looked straight into her face now that she had seen him he could do nothing else bernards little eternity however came to an end miss vivian dropped her eyes upon her book again she let them rest upon it only a moment then she closed it and slowly rose from her chair turning away from bernard he still stood looking at herstupidly foolishly helplessly enough as it seemed to him no sign of recognition had been exchanged angela vivian hesitated a minute she now had her back turned to him and he fancied her light flexible figure was agitated by her indecision she looked along the sunny beach which stretched its shallow curve to where the little bay ended and the white wall of the cliffs began she looked down toward the sea and up toward the little casino which was perched on a low embankment communicating with the beach at two or three points by a short flight of steps bernard sawor supposed he sawthat she was asking herself whither she had best turn to avoid him he had not blushed when she looked at himhe had rather turned a little pale but he blushed now for it really seemed odious to have literally driven the poor girl to bay miss vivian decided to take refuge in the casino and she passed along one of the little pathways of planks that were laid here and there across the beach and directed herself to the nearest flight of steps before she had gone two paces a complete change came over bernards feeling his only wish now was to speak to herto explainto tell her he would go away there was another row of steps at a short distance behind him he rapidly ascended them and reached the little terrace of the casino miss vivian stood there she was apparently hesitating again which way to turn bernard came straight up to her with a gallant smile and a greeting the comparison is a coarse one but he felt that he was taking the bull by the horns angela vivian stood watching him arrive  you did nt recognize me he said and your not recognizing me made memade me hesitate  for a moment she said nothing and then  you are more timid than you used to be she answered  he could hardly have said what expression he had expected to find in her face his apprehension had perhaps not painted her obtrusively pale and haughty aggressively cold and stern but it had figured something different from the look he encountered miss vivian was simply blushingthat was what bernard mainly perceived he saw that her surprise had been extremecomplete her blush was reassuring it contradicted the idea of impatient resentment and bernard took some satisfaction in noting that it was prolonged  yes i am more timid than i used to be he said  in spite of her blush she continued to look at him very directly but she had always done thatshe always met ones eye and bernard now instantly found all the beauty that he had ever found before in her pure unevasive glance  i dont know whether i am more brave she said but i must tell the truthi instantly recognized you  you gave no sign  i supposed i gave a striking onein getting up and going away  ah said bernard as i say i am more timid than i was and i did nt venture to interpret that as a sign of recognition  it was a sign of surprise  not of pleasure said bernard he felt this to be a venturesome and from the point of view of taste perhaps a reprehensible remark but he made it because he was now feeling his ground and it seemed better to make it gravely than with assumed jocosity  great surprises are to me never pleasures angela answered i am not fond of shocks of any kind the pleasure is another matter i have not yet got over my surprise  if i had known you were here i would have written to you beforehand said bernard laughing  miss vivian beneath her expanded parasol gave a little shrug of her shoulders  even that would have been a surprise  you mean a shock eh did you suppose i was dead  now at last she lowered her eyes and her blush slowly died away  i knew nothing about it  of course you could nt know and we are all mortal it was natural that you should nt expectsimply on turning your headto find me lying on the pebbles at blanquaislesgalets you were a great surprise to me as well but i differ from youi like surprises  it is rather refreshing to hear that one is a surprise said the girl  especially when in that capacity one is liked bernard exclaimed  i dont say thatbecause such sensations pass away i am now beginning to get over mine  the light mockery of her tone struck him as the echo of an unforgotten air he looked at her a moment and then he said  you are not changed i find you quite the same  i am sorry for that and she turned away  what are you doing he asked where are you going  she looked about her without answering up and down the little terrace the casino at blanquais was a much more modest place of reunion than the conversationhouse at badenbaden it was a small low structure of brightly painted wood containing but three or four rooms and furnished all along its front with a narrow covered gallery which offered a delusive shelter from the rougher moods of the fine fresh weather it was somewhat rude and shabbythe subscription for the season was lowbut it had a simple picturesqueness its little terrace was a very convenient place for a stroll and the great view of the ocean and of the marblewhite crags that formed the broad gateway of the shallow bay was a sufficient compensation for the absence of luxuries there were a few people sitting in the gallery and a few others scattered upon the terrace but the pleasureseekers of blanquais were for the most part immersed in the salt water or disseminated on the grassy downs  i am looking for my mother said angela vivian  i hope your mother is well  very well thank you  may i help you to look for her bernard asked  her eyes paused in their quest and rested a moment upon her companion  she is not here she said presently she has gone home  what do you call home bernard demanded  the sort of place that we always call home a bad little house that we have taken for a month  will you let me come and see it  it s nothing to see  bernard hesitated a moment  is that a refusal  i should never think of giving it so fine a name  there would be nothing fine in forbidding me your door dont think that said bernard with rather a forced laugh  it was difficult to know what the girl thought but she said in a moment  we shall be very happy to see you i am going home  may i walk with you so far asked bernard  it is not far it s only three minutes and angela moved slowly to the gate of the casino       chapter xx  bernard walked beside her and for some moments nothing was said between them as the silence continued he became aware of it and it vexed him that she should leave certain things unsaid she had asked him no questionneither whence he had come nor how long he would stay nor what had happened to him since they parted he wished to see whether this was intention or accident he was already complaining to himself that she expressed no interest in him and he was perfectly aware that this was a ridiculous feeling he had come to speak to her in order to tell her that he was going away and yet at the end of five minutes he had asked leave to come and see her this sudden gyration of mind was grotesque and bernard knew it but nevertheless he had an immense expectation that if he should give her time she would manifest some curiosity as to his own situation he tried to give her time he held his tongue but she continued to say nothing they passed along a sort of winding lane where two or three fishermens cottages with old brown nets suspended on the walls and drying in the sun stood open to the road on the other side of which was a patch of saltlooking grass browsed by a donkey that was not fastidious  it s so long since we parted and we have so much to say to each other bernard exclaimed at last and he accompanied this declaration with a laugh much more spontaneous than the one he had given a few moments before  it might have gratified him however to observe that his companion appeared to see no ground for joking in the idea that they should have a good deal to say to each other  yes it s a long time since we spent those pleasant weeks at baden she rejoined have you been there again  this was a question and though it was a very simple one bernard was charmed with it  i would nt go back for the world he said and you  would i go back oh yes i thought it so agreeable  with this he was less pleased he had expected the traces of resentment and he was actually disappointed at not finding them but here was the little house of which his companion had spoken and it seemed indeed a rather bad one that is it was one of those diminutive structures which are known at french wateringplaces as chalets and with an exiguity of furniture are let for the season to families that pride themselves upon their powers of contraction this one was a very humble specimen of its class though it was doubtless a not inadequate abode for two quiet and frugal women it had a few inches of garden and there were flowers in pots in the open windows where some extremely fresh white curtains were gently fluttering in the breath of the neighboring ocean the little door stood wide open  this is where we live said angela and she stopped and laid her hand upon the little gardengate  it s very fair said bernard i think it s better than the pastrycooks at baden  they stood there and she looked over the gate at the geraniums she did not ask him to come in but on the other hand keeping the gate closed she made no movement to leave him the casino was now quite out of sight and the whole place was perfectly still suddenly turning her eyes upon bernard with a certain strange inconsequence  i have not seen you here before she observed  he gave a little laugh  i suppose it s because i only arrived this morning i think that if i had been here you would have noticed me  you arrived this morning  three or four hours ago so if the remark were not in questionable taste i should say we had not lost time  you may say what you please said angela simply where did you come from  interrogation now it had come was most satisfactory and bernard was glad to believe that there was an element of the unexpected in his answer  from california  you came straight from california to this place  i arrived at havre only yesterday  and why did you come here  it would be graceful of me to be able to answerbecause i knew you were here but unfortunately i did not know it it was a mere chance or rather i feel like saying it was an inspiration  angela looked at the geraniums again  it was very singular she said we might have been in so many places besides this one and you might have come to so many places besides this one  it is all the more singular that one of the last persons i saw in america was your charming friend blanche who married gordon wright she did nt tell me you were here  she had no reason to know it said the girl she is not my friendas you are her husbands friend  ah no i dont suppose that but she might have heard from you  she does nt hear from us my mother used to write to her for a while after she left europe but she has given it up she paused a moment and then she addedblanche is too silly  bernard noted this wondering how it bore upon his theory of a spiteful element in his companion of course blanche was silly but equally of course this young ladys perception of it was quickened by blanches having married a rich man whom she herself might have married  gordon does nt think so bernard said  angela looked at him a moment  i am very glad to hear it she rejoined gently  yes it is very fortunate  is he well the girl asked is he happy  he has all the air of it  i am very glad to hear it she repeated and then she moved the latch of the gate and passed in at the same moment her mother appeared in the open doorway mrs vivian had apparently been summoned by the sound of her daughters colloquy with an unrecognized voice and when she saw bernard she gave a sharp little cry of surprise then she stood gazing at him  since the dispersion of the little party at badenbaden he had not devoted much meditation to this conscientious gentlewoman who had been so tenderly anxious to establish her daughter properly in life but there had been in his mind a tacit assumption that if angela deemed that he had played her a trick mrs vivians view of his conduct was not more charitable he felt that he must have seemed to her very unkind and that in so far as a wellregulated conscience permitted the exercise of unpractical passions she honored him with a superior detestation the instant he beheld her on her threshold this conviction rose to the surface of his consciousness and made him feel that now at least his hour had come  it is mr longueville whom we met at baden said angela to her mother gravely  mrs vivian began to smile and stepped down quickly toward the gate  ah mr longueville she murmured it s so longit s so pleasantit s so strange  and suddenly she stopped still smiling her smile had an odd intensity she was trembling a little and bernard who was prepared for hissing scorn perceived with a deep an almost violent surprise a touching agitation an eager friendliness  yes it s very long he said it s very pleasant i have only just arrived i met miss vivian  and you are not coming in asked angelas mother very graciously  your daughter has not asked me said bernard  ah my dearest murmured mrs vivian looking at the girl  her daughter returned her glance and then the elder lady paused again and simply began to smile at bernard who recognized in her glance that queer little intimationshy and cautious yet perfectly discernibleof a desire to have a private understanding with what he felt that she mentally termed his better nature which he had more than once perceived at badenbaden  ah no she has not asked me bernard repeated laughing gently  then angela turned her eyes upon him and the expression of those fine organs was strikingly agreeable it had moreover the merit of being easily interpreted it said very plainly please dont insist but leave me alone and it said it not at all sharplyvery gently and pleadingly bernard found himself understanding it so well that he literally blushed with intelligence  dont you come to the casino in the evening as you used to come to the kursaal he asked  mrs vivian looked again at her daughter who had passed into the doorway of the cottage then she said  we will go this evening  i shall look for you eagerly bernard rejoined auf wiedersehen as we used to say at baden  mrs vivian waved him a response over the gate her daughter gave him a glance from the threshold and he took his way back to his inn  he awaited the evening with great impatience he fancied he had made a discovery and he wished to confirm it the discovery was that his idea that she bore him a grudge that she was conscious of an injury that he was associated in her mind with a wrong had all been a morbid illusion she had forgiven she had forgotten she did nt care she had possibly never cared this at least was his theory now and he longed for a little more light upon it his old sense of her being a complex and intricate girl had in that quarter of an hour of talk with her again become lively so that he was not absolutely sure his apprehensions had been vain but with his quick vision of things he had got the impression at any rate that she had no vulgar resentment of any slight he might have put upon her or any disadvantage he might have caused her her feeling about such a matter would be large and original bernard desired to see more of that and in the evening in fact it seemed to him that he did so  the terrace of the casino was far from offering the brilliant spectacle of the promenade in front of the gamingrooms at baden it had neither the liberal illumination the distinguished frequenters nor the superior music which formed the attraction of that celebrated spot but it had a modest animation of its own in which the starlight on the open sea took the place of clustered lamps and the mighty resonance of the waves performed the function of an orchestra mrs vivian made her appearance with her daughter and bernard as he used to do at baden chose a corner to place some chairs for them the crowd was small for most of the visitors had compressed themselves into one of the rooms where a shrill operetta was being performed by a strolling troupe mrs vivians visit was a short one she remained at the casino less than half an hour but bernard had some talk with angela he sat beside herher mother was on the other side talking with an old french lady whose acquaintance she had made on the beach between bernard and angela several things were said when his friends went away bernard walked home with them he bade them goodnight at the door of their chalet and then slowly strolled back to the casino the terrace was nearly empty every one had gone to listen to the operetta the sound of whose contemporary gayety came through the open hotlooking windows in little thin quavers and catches the ocean was rumbling just beneath it made a ruder but richer music bernard stood looking at it a moment then he went down the steps to the beach the tide was rather low he walked slowly down to the line of the breaking waves the sea looked huge and black and simple everything was vague in the unassisted darkness bernard stood there some time there was nothing but the sound and the sharp fresh smell suddenly he put his hand to his heart it was beating very fast an immense conviction had come over himabruptly then and thereand for a moment he held his breath it was like a word spoken in the darknesshe held his breath to listen he was in love with angela vivian and his love was a throbbing passion he sat down on the stones where he stoodit filled him with a kind of awe       chapter xxi  it filled him with a kind of awe and the feeling was by no means agreeable it was not a feeling to which even a man of bernard longuevilles easy power of extracting the savour from a sensation could rapidly habituate himself and for the rest of that night it was far from making of our hero the happy man that a lover just coming to selfconsciousness is supposed to be it was wrongit was dishonorableit was impossibleand yet it was it was as nothing in his own personal experience had ever been he seemed hitherto to have been living by proxy in a vision in reflectionto have been an echo a shadow a futile attempt but this at last was life itself this was a fact this was reality for these things one lived these were the things that people had died for love had been a fable before thisdoubtless a very pretty one and passion had been a literary phraseemployed obviously with considerable effect but now he stood in a personal relation to these familiar ideas which gave them a very much keener import they had laid their hand upon him in the darkness he felt it upon his shoulder and he knew by its pressure that it was the hand of destiny what made this sensation a shock was the element that was mixed with it the fact that it came not simply and singly but with an attendant shadow in which it immediately merged and lost itself it was forbidden fruithe knew it the instant he had touched it he felt that he had pledged himself not to do just this thing which was gleaming before him so divinelynot to widen the crevice not to open the door that would flood him with light friendship and honor were at stake they stood at his left hand as his newborn passion stood already at his right they claimed him as well and their grasp had a pressure which might become acutely painful the soul is a still more tender organism than the body and it shrinks from the prospect of being subjected to violence violencespiritual violencewas what our luxurious hero feared and it is not too much to say that as he lingered there by the sea late into the night while the gurgitation of the waves grew deeper to his ear the prospect came to have an element of positive terror the two faces of his situation stood confronting each other it was a rigid brutal opposition and bernard held his breath for a while with the wonder of what would come of it he sat a long time upon the beach the night grew very cold but he had no sense of it then he went away and passed before the casino again and wandered through the village the casino was shrouded in darkness and silence and there was nothing in the streets of the little town but the salt smell of the sea a vague aroma of fish and the distant sound of the breakers little by little bernard lost the feeling of having been startled and began to perceive that he could reason about his trouble trouble it was though this seems an odd name for the consciousness of a bright enchantment and the first thing that reason definitely consulted told him about the matter was that he had been in love with angela vivian any time these three years this sapient faculty supplied him with further information only two or three of the items of which however it is necessary to reproduce he had been a great foolan incredible foolnot to have discovered before this what was the matter with him bernards sense of his own shrewdnessalways tolerably acutehad never received such a bruise as this present perception that a great many things had been taking place in his clever mind without his clever mind suspecting them but it little mattered his reason went on to declare what he had suspected or what he might now feel about it his present business was to leave blanquaislesgalets at sunrise the next morning and never rest his eyes upon angela vivian again this was his duty it had the merit of being perfectly plain and definite easily apprehended and unattended as far as he could discover with the smallest material difficulties not only this reason continued to remark but the moral difficulties were equally inconsiderable he had never breathed a word of his passion to miss vivianquite the contrary he had never committed himself nor given her the smallest reason to suspect his hidden flame and he was therefore perfectly free to turn his back upon herhe could never incur the reproach of trifling with her affections bernard was in that state of mind when it is the greatest of blessings to be saved the distress of choiceto see a straight path before you and to feel that you have only to follow it upon the straight path i have indicated he fixed his eyes very hard of course he would take his departure at the earliest possible hour on the morrow there was a streak of morning in the eastern sky by the time he knocked for readmittance at the door of the inn which was opened to him by a mysterious old woman in a nightcap and meagre accessories whose identity he failed to ascertain and he laid himself down to resthe was very tiredwith his attention fastened as i say on the ideaon the very imageof departure  on waking up the next morning rather late he found however that it had attached itself to a very different object his vision was filled with the brightness of the delightful fact itself which seemed to impregnate the sweet morning air and to flutter in the light fresh breeze that came through his open window from the sea he saw a great patch of the sea between a couple of redtiled roofs it was bluer than any sea had ever been before he had not slept longonly three or four hours but he had quite slept off his dread the shadow had dropped away and nothing was left but the beauty of his love which seemed to shine in the freshness of the early day he felt absurdly happyas if he had discovered el dorado quite apart from consequenceshe was not thinking of consequences which of course were another affairthe feeling was intrinsically the finest one he had ever had andas a mere feelinghe had not done with it yet the consideration of consequences could easily be deferred and there would meanwhile be no injury to any one in his extracting very quietly a little subjective joy from the state of his heart he would let the flower bloom for a day before plucking it up by the roots upon this latter course he was perfectly resolved and in view of such an heroic resolution the subjective interlude appeared no more than his just privilege the project of leaving blanquaislesgalets at nine oclock in the morning dropped lightly from his mind making no noise as it fell but another took its place which had an air of being still more excellent and which consisted of starting off on a long walk and absenting himself for the day bernard grasped his stick and wandered away he climbed the great shoulder of the further cliff and found himself on the level downs here there was apparently no obstacle whatever to his walking as far as his fancy should carry him the summer was still in a splendid mood and the hot and quiet dayit was a sundayseemed to constitute a deep silent smile on the face of nature the sea glistened on one side and the crops ripened on the other the larks losing themselves in the dense sunshine made it ring here and there in undiscoverable spots this was the only sound save when bernard pausing now and then in his walk found himself hearing far below him at the base of the cliff the drawling murmur of a wave he walked a great many miles and passed through half a dozen of those rude fishinghamlets lodged in some sloping hollow of the cliffs so many of which of late years all along the norman coast have adorned themselves with a couple of hotels and a row of bathingmachines he walked so far that the shadows had begun to lengthen before he bethought himself of stopping the afternoon had come on and had already begun to wane the grassy downs still stretched before him shaded here and there with shallow but windless dells he looked for the softest place and then flung himself down on the grass he lay there for a long time thinking of many things he had determined to give himself up to a days happiness it was happiness of a very harmless kindthe satisfaction of thought the bliss of mere consciousness but such as it was it did not elude him nor turn bitter in his heart and the long summer day closed upon him before his spirit hovering in perpetual circles round the idea of what might be had begun to rest its wing when he rose to his feet again it was too late to return to blanquais in the same way that he had come the evening was at hand the light was already fading and the walk he had taken was one which even if he had not felt very tired he would have thought it imprudent to attempt to repeat in the darkness he made his way to the nearest village where he was able to hire a rustic carriole in which primitive conveyance gaining the highroad he jogged and jostled through the hours of the evening slowly back to his startingpoint it wanted an hour of midnight by the time he reached his inn and there was nothing left for him but to go to bed  he went in the unshaken faith that he should leave blanquais early on the morrow but early on the morrow it occurred to him that it would be simply grotesque to go off without taking leave of mrs vivian and her daughter and offering them some explanation of his intention he had given them to understand that so delighted was he to find them there he would remain at blanquais at least as long as they he must have seemed to them wanting in civility to spend a whole bright sunday without apparently troubling his head about them and if the unlucky fact of his being in love with the girl were a reason for doing his duty it was at least not a reason for being rude he had not yet come to thatto accepting rudeness as an incident of virtue it had always been his theory that virtue had the best manners in the world and he flattered himself at any rate that he could guard his integrity without making himself ridiculous so at what he thought a proper hour in the course of the morning he retraced his steps along the little lane through which two days ago angela vivian had shown him the way to her mothers door at this humble portal he knocked the windows of the little chalet were open and the white curtains behind the flowerpots were fluttering as he had seen them before the door was opened by a neat young woman who informed him very promptly that madame and mademoiselle had left blanquais a couple of hours earlier they had gone to parisyes very suddenly taking with them but little luggage and they had left hershe had the honor of being the femme de chambre of ces damesto put up their remaining possessions and follow as soon as possible on bernards expressing surprise and saying that he had supposed them to be fixed at the seaside for the rest of the season the femme de chambre who seemed a very intelligent person begged to remind him that the season was drawing to a close that madame had taken the chalet but for five weeks only ten days of which period were yet to expire that ces dames as monsieur perhaps knew were great travellers who had been half over the world and thought nothing of breaking camp at an hours notice and that in fine madame might very well have received a telegram summoning her to another part of the country  and where have the ladies gone asked bernard  for the moment to paris  and in paris where have they gone  dame chez ellesto their house said the femme de chambre who appeared to think that bernard asked too many questions  but bernard persisted  where is their house  the waitingmaid looked at him from head to foot  if monsieur wishes to write many of madames letters come to her banker she said inscrutably  and who is her banker  he lives in the rue de provence  very goodi will find him out said our hero turning away  the discriminating reader who has been so good as to interest himself in this little narrative will perhaps at this point exclaim with a pardonable consciousness of shrewdness of course he went the next day to the rue de provence of course yes only as it happens bernard did nothing of the kind he did one of the most singular things he ever did in his lifea thing that puzzled him even at the time and with regard to which he often afterward wondered whence he had drawn the ability for so remarkable a feathe simply spent a fortnight at blanquaislesgalets it was a very quiet fortnight he spoke to no one he formed no relations he was company to himself it may be added that he had never found his own company half so good he struck himself as a reasonable delicate fellow who looked at things in such a way as to make him refrainrefrain successfully that was the pointfrom concerning himself practically about angela vivian his saying that he would find out the banker in the rue de provence had been for the benefit of the femme de chambre whom he thought rather impertinent he had really no intention whatever of entering that classic thoroughfare he took long walks rambled on the beach along the base of the cliffs and among the brown seacaves and he thought a good deal of certain incidents which have figured at an earlier stage of this narrative he had forbidden himself the future as an object of contemplation and it was therefore a matter of necessity that his imagination should take refuge among the warm and familiar episodes of the past he wondered why mrs vivian should have left the place so suddenly and was of course struck with the analogy between this incident and her abrupt departure from baden it annoyed him it troubled him but it by no means rekindled the alarm he had felt on first perceiving the injured angela on the beach that alarm had been quenched by angelas manner during the hour that followed and during their short talk in the evening this evening was to be forever memorable for it had brought with it the revelation which still at moments suddenly made bernard tremble but it had also brought him the assurance that angela cared as little as possible for anything that a chance acquaintance might have said about her it is all the more singular therefore that one evening after he had been at blanquais a fortnight a train of thought should suddenly have been set in motion in his mind it was kindled by no outward occurrence but by some wandering spark of fancy or of memory and the immediate effect of it was to startle our hero very much as he had been startled on the evening i have described the circumstances were the same he had wandered down to the beach alone very late and he stood looking at the duskilytumbling sea suddenly the same voice that had spoken before murmured another phrase in the darkness and it rang upon his ear for the rest of the night it startled him as i have said at first then the next morning it led him to take his departure for paris during the journey it lingered in his ear he sat in the corner of the railwaycarriage with his eyes closed abstracted on purpose to prolong the reverberation if it were not true it was at least as the italians have it ben trovato and it was wonderful how well it bore thinking of it bears telling less well but i can at least give a hint of it the theory that angela hated him had evaporated in her presence and another of a very different sort had sprung into being it fitted a great many of the facts it explained a great many contradictions anomalies mysteries and it accounted for miss vivians insisting upon her mothers leaving blanquais at a few hours notice even better than the theory of her resentment could have done at any rate it obliterated bernards scruples very effectually and led him on his arrival in paris to repair instantly to the rue de provence this street contains more than one banker but there is one with whom bernard deemed mrs vivian most likely to have dealings he found he had reckoned rightly and he had no difficulty in procuring her address having done so however he by no means went immediately to see her he waited a couple of daysperhaps to give those obliterated scruples i have spoken of a chance to revive they kept very quiet and it must be confessed that bernard took no great pains to recall them to life after he had been in paris three days he knocked at mrs vivians door       chapter xxii  it was opened by the little waitingmaid whom he had seen at blanquais and who looked at him very hard before she answered his inquiry  you see i have found mrs vivians dwelling though you would nt give me the address bernard said to her smiling  monsieur has put some time to it the young woman answered dryly and she informed him that madame was at home though mademoiselle for whom he had not asked was not  mrs vivian occupied a diminutive apartment at the summit of one of the tall white houses which ornament the neighborhood of the arc de triomphe the early days of september had arrived but paris was still a city of absentees the weather was warm and charming and a certain savour of early autumn in the air was in accord with the somewhat melancholy aspect of the empty streets and closed shutters of this honorable quarter where the end of the monumental vistas seemed to be curtained with a hazy emanation from the seine it was late in the afternoon when bernard was ushered into mrs vivians little highnestling drawingroom and a patch of sunset tints faintly red rested softly upon the gilded wall bernard had seen these ladies only in borrowed and provisional abodes but here was a place where they were really living and which was stamped with their tastes their habits their charm the little salon was very elegant it contained a multitude of pretty things and it appeared to bernard to be arranged in perfection the long windowsthe ceiling being low they were really very shortopened upon one of those solid balconies occupying the width of the apartment which are often in paris a compensation for living up five flights of stairs and this balcony was filled with flowers and cushions bernard stepped out upon it to await the coming of mrs vivian and as she was not quick to appear he had time to see that his friends enjoyed a magnificent view they looked up at the triumphal arch which presented itself at a picturesque angle and near the green treetops of the champs elysees beyond which they caught a broad gleam of the seine and a glimpse blue in the distance of the great towers of notre dame the whole vast city lay before them and beneath them with its ordered brilliancy and its mingled aspect of compression and expansion and yet the huge parisian murmur died away before it reached mrs vivians skyparlor which seemed to bernard the brightest and quietest little habitation he had ever known  his hostess came rustling in at last she seemed agitated she knocked over with the skirt of her dress a little gilded chair which was reflected in the polished parquet as in a sheet of lookingglass mrs vivian had a fixed smileshe hardly knew what to say  i found your address at the bankers said bernard your maid at blanquais refused to give it to me  mrs vivian gave him a little lookthere was always more or less of it in her facewhich seemed equivalent to an entreaty that her interlocutor should spare her  maids are so strange she murmured especially the french  it pleased bernard for the moment not to spare her though he felt a sort of delight of kindness for her  your going off from blanquais so suddenly without leaving me any explanation any clue any message of any sortmade me feel at first as if you did nt wish that i should look you up it reminded me of the way you left badendo you rememberthree years ago  baden was so charmingbut one could nt stay forever said mrs vivian  i had a sort of theory one could our life was so pleasant that it seemed a shame to break the spell and if no one had moved i am sure we might be sitting there now  mrs vivian stared still with her little fixed smile  i think we should have had bad weather  very likely said bernard laughing nature would have grown jealous of our goodhumorof our tranquil happiness and after all here we are together againthat is some of us but i have only my own audacity to thank for it i was quite free to believe that you were not at all pleased to see me reappearand it is only because i am not easy to discourageam indeed probably a rather impudent fellowthat i have ventured to come here today  i am very glad to see you reappear mr longueville mrs vivian declared with the accent of veracity  it was your daughters idea then running away from blanquais  mrs vivian lowered her eyes  we were obliged to go to fontainebleau we have but just come back i thought of writing to you she softly added  ah what pleasure that would have given me  i mean to tell you where we were and that we should have been so happy to see you  i thank you for the intention i suppose your daughter would nt let you carry it out  angela is so peculiar mrs vivian said simply  you told me that the first time i saw you  yes at siena said mrs vivian  i am glad to hear you speak frankly of that place  perhaps it s better mrs vivian murmured she got up and went to the window then stepping upon the balcony she looked down a moment into the street she will come back in a moment she said coming into the room again she has gone to see a friend who lives just beside us we dont mind about siena now she added softly  bernard understood herunderstood this to be a retraction of the request she had made of him at baden  dear little woman he said to himself she wants to marry her daughter stillonly now she wants to marry her to me  he wished to show her that he understood her and he was on the point of seizing her hand to do he did nt know whatto hold it to press it to kiss itwhen he heard the sharp twang of the bell at the door of the little apartment  mrs vivian fluttered away  it s angela she cried and she stood there waiting and listening smiling at bernard with her handkerchief pressed to her lips  in a moment the girl came into the drawingroom but on seeing bernard she stopped with her hand on the doorknob her mother went to her and kissed her  it s mr longueville dearesthe has found us out  found us out repeated angela with a little laugh what a singular expression  she was blushing as she had blushed when she first saw him at blanquais she seemed to bernard now to have a great and peculiar brightnesssomething she had never had before  i certainly have been looking for you he said i was greatly disappointed when i found you had taken flight from blanquais  taken flight she repeated his words as she had repeated her mothers that is also a strange way of speaking  i dont care what i say said bernard so long as i make you understand that i have wanted very much to see you again and that i have wondered every day whether i might venture  i dont know why you should nt venture she interrupted giving her little laugh again we are not so terrible are we mammathat is when once you have climbed our five flights of stairs  i came up very fast said bernard and i find your apartment magnificent  mr longueville must come again must he not dear asked mamma  i shall come very often with your leave bernard declared  it will be immensely kind said angela looking away  i am not sure that you will think it that  i dont know what you are trying to prove said angela first that we ran away from you and then that we are not nice to our visitors  oh no not that bernard exclaimed for i assure you i shall not care how cold you are with me  she walked away toward another door which was masked with a curtain that she lifted  i am glad to hear that for it gives me courage to say that i am very tired and that i beg you will excuse me  she glanced at him a moment over her shoulder then she passed out dropping the curtain  bernard stood there face to face with mrs vivian whose eyes seemed to plead with him more than ever in his own there was an excited smile  please dont mind that she murmured i know it s true that she is tired  mind it dear lady cried the young man i delight in it it s just what i like  ah she s very peculiar sighed mrs vivian  she is strangeyes but i think i understand her a little  you must come back tomorrow then  i hope to have many tomorrows cried bernard as he took his departure       chapter xxiii  and he had them in fact he called the next day at the same hour and he found the mother and the daughter together in their pretty salon angela was very gentle and gracious he suspected mrs vivian had given her a tender little lecture upon the manner in which she had received him the day before after he had been there five minutes mrs vivian took a decanter of water that was standing upon a table and went out on the balcony to irrigate her flowers bernard watched her a while from his place in the room then she moved along the balcony and out of sight some ten minutes elapsed without her reappearing and then bernard stepped to the threshold of the window and looked for her she was not there and as he came and took his seat near angela again he announced rather formally that mrs vivian had passed back into one of the other windows  angela was silent a momentthen she said  should you like me to call her  she was very peculiarthat was very true yet bernard held to his declaration of the day before that he now understood her a little  no i dont desire it he said i wish to see you alone i have something particular to say to you  she turned her face toward him and there was something in its expression that showed him that he looked to her more serious than he had ever looked he sat down again for some moments he hesitated to go on  you frighten me she said laughing and in spite of her laugh this was obviously true  i assure you my state of mind is anything but formidable i am afraid of you on the contrary i am humble and apologetic  i am sorry for that said angela i particularly dislike receiving apologies even when i know what they are for what yours are for i cant imagine  you dont dislike meyou dont hate me bernard suddenly broke out  you dont ask me that humbly excuse me therefore if i say i have other and more practical things to do  you despise me said bernard  that is not humble either for you seem to insist upon it  it would be after all a way of thinking of me and i have a reason for wishing you to do that  i remember very well that you used to have a reason for everything it was not always a good one  this one is excellent said bernard gravely i have been in love with you for three years  she got up slowly turning away  is that what you wished to say to me  she went toward the open window and he followed her  i hope it does nt offend you i dont say it lightlyit s not a piece of gallantry it s the very truth of my being i did nt know it till latelystrange as that may seem i loved you long before i knew itbefore i ventured or presumed to know it i was thinking of you when i seemed to myself to be thinking of other things it is very strangethere are things in it i dont understand i travelled over the world i tried to interest to divert myself but at bottom it was a perfect failure to see you againthat was what i wanted when i saw you last month at blanquais i knew it then everything became clear it was the answer to the riddle i wished to read it very clearlyi wished to be sure therefore i did nt follow you immediately i questioned my hearti crossquestioned it it has borne the examination and now i am sure i am very sure i love you as my lifei beg you to listen to me  she had listenedshe had listened intently looking straight out of the window and without moving  you have seen very little of me she said presently turning her illuminated eye on him  i have seen enough bernard added smiling you must remember that at baden i saw a good deal of you  yes but that did nt make you like me i dont understand  bernard stood there a moment frowning with his eyes lowered  i can imagine that but i think i can explain  dont explain now said angela you have said enough explain some other time and she went out on the balcony  bernard of course in a moment was beside her and disregarding her injunction he began to explain  i thought i disliked youbut i have come to the conclusion it was just the contrary in reality i was in love with you i had been so from the first time i saw youwhen i made that sketch of you at siena  that in itself needs an explanation i was not at all nice theni was very rude very perverse i was horrid  ah you admit it cried bernard with a sort of quick elation  she had been pale but she suddenly blushed  your own conduct was singular as i remember it it was not exactly agreeable  perhaps not but at least it was meant to be i did nt know how to please you then and i am far from supposing that i have learned now but i entreat you to give me a chance  she was silent a while her eyes wandered over the great prospect of paris  do you know how you can please me now she said at last by leaving me alone  bernard looked at her a moment then came straight back into the drawingroom and took his hat  you see i avail myself of the first chance but i shall come back tomorrow  i am greatly obliged to you for what you have said such a speech as that deserves to be listened to with consideration you may come back tomorrow angela added  on the morrow when he came back she received him alone  how did you know at baden that i did nt like you he asked as soon as she would allow him  she smiled very gently  you assured me yesterday that you did like me  i mean that i supposed i did nt how did you know that  i can only say that i observed  you must have observed very closely for superficially i rather had the air of admiring you said bernard  it was very superficial  you dont mean that for after all that is just what my admiration my interest in you were not they were deep they were latent they were not superficialthey were subterranean  you are contradicting yourself and i am perfectly consistent said angela your sentiments were so well hidden that i supposed i displeased you  i remember that at baden you used to contradict yourself bernard answered  you have a terrible memory  dont call it terrible for it sees everything now in a charming lightin the light of this understanding that we have at last arrived at which seems to shine backwardto shine full on those baden days  have we at last arrived at an understanding she asked with a grave directness which bernard thought the most beautiful thing he had ever seen  it only depends upon you he declared and then he broke out again into a protestation of passionate tenderness dont put me off this time he cried you have had time to think about it you have had time to get over the surprise the shock i love you and i offer you everything that belongs to me in this world as she looked at him with her dark clear eyes weighing this precious vow and yet not committing herselfah you dont forgive me he murmured  she gazed at him with the same solemn brightness  what have i to forgive you  this question seemed to him enchanting he reached forward and took her hands and if mrs vivian had come in she would have seen him kneeling at her daughters feet  but mrs vivian remained in seclusion and bernard saw her only the next time he came  i am very happy because i think my daughter is happy she said  and what do you think of me  i think you are very clever you must promise me to be very good to her  i am clever enough to promise that  i think you are good enough to keep it said mrs vivian she looked as happy as she said and her happiness gave her a communicative confidential tendency it is very strange how things come abouthow the wheel turns round she went on i suppose there is no harm in my telling you that i believe she always cared for you  why did nt you tell me before said bernard with almost filial reproachfulness  how could i i dont go about the world offering my daughter to peopleespecially to indifferent people  at baden you did nt think i was indifferent you were afraid of my not being indifferent enough  mrs vivian colored  ah at baden i was a little too anxious  too anxious i should nt speak to your daughter said bernard laughing  at baden mrs vivian went on i had views but i have nt any nowi have given them up  that makes your acceptance of me very flattering bernard exclaimed laughing still more gaily  i have something better said mrs vivian laying her fingertips on his arm i have confidence  bernard did his best to encourage this gracious sentiment and it seemed to him that there was something yet to be done to implant it more firmly in angelas breast  i have a confession to make to you he said to her one day i wish you would listen to it  is it something very horrible angela asked  something very horrible indeed i once did you an injury  an injury she repeated in a tone which seemed to reduce the offence to contemptible proportions by simple vagueness of mind about it  i dont know what to call it said bernard a poor servicean illturn  angela gave a shrug or rather an imitation of a shrug for she was not a shrugging person  i never knew it  i misrepresented you to gordon wright bernard went on  why do you speak to me of him she asked rather sadly  does it displease you  she hesitated a little  yes it displeases me if your confession has anything to do with him i would rather not hear it  bernard returned to the subject another timehe had plenty of opportunities he spent a portion of every day in the company of these dear women and these days were the happiest of his life the autumn weather was warm and soothing the quartier was still deserted and the uproar of the great city which seemed a hundred miles away reached them through the dense october air with a softened and muffled sound the evenings however were growing cool and before long they lighted the first fire of the season in mrs vivians heavily draped little chimneypiece on this occasion bernard sat there with angela watching the bright crackle of the wood and feeling that the charm of winter nights had begun these two young persons were alone together in the gathering dusk it was the hour before dinner before the lamp had been lighted  i insist upon making you my confession said bernard i shall be very unhappy until you let me do it  unhappy you are the happiest of men  i lie upon roses if you will but this memory this remorse is a folded roseleaf i was completely mistaken about you at baden i thought all manner of evil of youor at least i said it  men are dull creatures said angela  i think they are so much so that as i look back upon that time there are some things i dont understand even now  i dont see why you should look back people in our position are supposed to look forward  you dont like those baden days yourself said bernard you dont like to think of them  what a wonderful discovery  bernard looked at her a moment in the brightening firelight  what part was it you tried to play there  angela shook her head  men are dull creatures  i have already granted that and i am eating humble pie in asking for an explanation  what did you say of me angela asked after a silence  i said you were a coquette remember that i am simply historical  she got up and stood in front of the fire having her hand on the chimneypiece and looking down at the blaze for some moments she remained there bernard could not see her face  i said you were a dangerous woman to marry he went on deliberately i said it because i thought it i gave gordon an opinion about youit was a very unfavorable one i could nt make you outi thought you were playing a double part i believed that you were ready to marry him and yet i sawi thought i saw and bernard paused again  what did you see and angela turned toward him  that you were encouraging meplaying with me  and you did nt like that  i liked it immenselyfor myself but did nt like it for gordon and i must do myself the justice to say that i thought more of him than of myself  you were an excellent friend said angela simply  i believe i was and i am so still bernard added  she shook her head sadly  poor mr wright  he is a dear good fellow said bernard  thoroughly good and dear doubtless to his wife the affectionate blanche  you dont like himyou dont like her said bernard  those are two very different matters i am very sorry for mr wright  you need nt be that he is doing very well  so you have already informed me but i am sorry for him all the same  that does nt answer my question bernard exclaimed with a certain irritation what part were you playing  what part do you think  have nt i told you i gave it up long ago  angela stood with her back to the fire looking at him her hands were locked behind her  did it ever strike you that my position at baden was a charming oneknowing that i had been handed over to you to be put under the microscopelike an insect with a pin stuck through it  how in the world did you know it i thought we were particularly careful  how can a woman help knowing such a thing she guesses itshe discovers it by instinct especially if she be a proud woman  ah said bernard if pride is a source of information you must be a prodigy of knowledge  i dont know that you are particularly humble the girl retorted the meekest and most submissive of her sex would not have consented to have such a bargain as that made about hersuch a trick played upon her  my dearest angela it was no bargainno trick bernard interposed  it was a clumsy trickit was a bad bargain she declared at any rate i hated iti hated the idea of your pretending to pass judgment upon me of your having come to baden for the purpose it was as if mr wright had been buying a horse and you had undertaken to put me through my paces  i undertook nothingi declined to undertake  you certainly made a study of meand i was determined you should get your lesson wrong i determined to embarrass to mislead to defeat you or rather i did nt determine i simply obeyed a natural impulse of selfdefencethe impulse to evade the fierce light of criticism i wished to put you in the wrong  you did it all very well you put me admirably in the wrong  the only justification for my doing it at all was my doing it well said angela  you were justified then you must have hated me fiercely  she turned her back to him and stood looking at the fire again  yes there are some things that i did that can be accounted for only by an intense aversion  she said this so naturally that in spite of a certain theory that was touched upon a few pages back bernard was a good deal bewildered he rose from the sofa where he had been lounging and went and stood beside her a moment then he passed his arm round her waist and murmured an almost timorous  really  i dont know what you are trying to make me say she answered  he looked down at her for a moment as he held her close to him  i dont see after all why i should wish to make you say it it would only make my remorse more acute  she was musing with her eyes on the fire and for a moment she made no answer then as if her attention were returning  are you still talking about your remorse she asked  you see i put it very strongly  that i was a horrid creature  that you were not a woman to marry  ah my poor bernard said angela i cant attempt to prove to you that you are not inconsistent  the month of september drew to a close and she consented to fix a day for their wedding the last of october was the moment selected and the selection was almost all that was wanting to bernards happiness i say almost for there was a solitary spot in his consciousness which felt numb and deadunpervaded by the joy with which the rest of his spirit seemed to thrill and tingle the removal of this hard grain in the sweet savour of life was needed to complete his felicity bernard felt that he had made the necessary excision when at the end of the month he wrote to gordon wright of his engagement he had been putting off the performance of this duty from day to dayit seemed so hard to accomplish it gracefully he did it at the end very briefly it struck him that this was the best way three days after he had sent his letter there arrived one from gordon himself informing bernard that he had suddenly determined to bring blanche to europe she was not well and they would lose no time they were to sail within a week after his writing the letter contained a postscriptcaptain lovelock comes with us       chapter xxiv  bernard prepared for gordons arrival in paris which according to his letter would take place in a few days he was not intending to stop in england blanche desired to proceed immediately to the french capital to confer with her manmilliner after which it was probable that they would go to italy or to the east for the winter i have given her a choice of rome or the nile said gordon but she tells me she does nt care a fig where we go  i say that bernard prepared to receive his friends and i mean that he prepared morallyor even intellectually materially speaking he could simply hold himself in readiness to engage an apartment at a hotel and to go to meet them at the station he expected to hear from gordon as soon as this interesting trio should reach england but the first notification he received came from a parisian hotel it came to him in the shape of a very short note in the morning shortly before lunch and was to the effect that his friends had alighted in the rue de la paix the night before  we were tired and i have slept late said gordon otherwise you should have heard from me earlier come to lunch if possible i want extremely to see you  bernard of course made a point of going to lunch in as short a time as possible he found himself in gordons sittingroom at the hotel middlesex the table was laid for the midday repast and a gentleman stood with his back to the door looking out of the window as bernard came in this gentleman turned and exhibited the ambrosial beard the symmetrical shape the monocular appendage of captain lovelock  the captain screwed his glass into his eye and greeted bernard in his usual fashionthat is as if he had parted with him overnight  oh good morning beastly morning is nt it i suppose you are come to luncheoni have come to luncheon it ought to be on table you knowit s nearly two oclock but i dare say you have noticed foreigners are never punctualit s only english servants that are punctual and they dont understand luncheon you knowthey cant make out our eating at this sort of hour you know they always dine so beastly early do you remember the sort of time they used to dine at badenhalfpast five halfpast six some unearthly hour of that kind that s the sort of time you dine in america i found they d invite a man at halfpast six that s what i call being in a hurry for your food you know they always accuse the americans of making a rush for their victuals i am bound to say that in new york and that sort of place the victuals were very good when you got them i hope you dont mind my saying anything about america you know the americans are so deucedly thinskinnedthey always bristle up if you say anything against their institutions the english dont care a rap what you saythey ve got a different sort of temper you know with the americans i m deuced carefuli never breathe a word about anything while i was over there i went in for being complimentary i laid it on thick and i found they would take all i could give them i did nt see much of their institutions after all i went in for seeing the people some of the people were charmingupon my soul i was surprised at some of the people i dare say you know some of the people i saw they were as nice people as you would see anywhere there were always a lot of people about mrs wright you know they told me they were all the best people you know she is always late for everything she always comes in after every one is therelooking so devilish pretty pulling on her gloves she wears the longest gloves i ever saw in my life upon my word if they dont come i think i will ring the bell and ask the waiter what s the matter would nt you ring the bell it s a great mistake their trying to carry out their ideas of lunching that s wrights character you know he s always trying to carry out some idea when i am abroad i go in for the foreign breakfast myself you may depend upon it they had better give up trying to do this sort of thing at this hour  captain lovelock was more disposed to conversation than bernard had known him before his discourse of old had been languid and fragmentary and our hero had never heard him pursue a train of ideas through so many involutions to bernards observant eye indeed the captain was an altered man his manner betrayed a certain restless desire to be agreeable to anticipate judgmenta disposition to smile and be civil and entertain his auditor a tendency to move about and look out of the window and at the clock he struck bernard as a trifle nervousas less solidly planted on his feet than when he lounged along the baden gravelwalks by the side of his usual companiona lady for whom apparently his admiration was still considerable bernard was curious to see whether he would ring the bell to inquire into the delay attending the service of lunch but before this sentiment rather idle under the circumstances was gratified blanche passed into the room from a neighboring apartment to bernards perception blanche at least was always blanche she was a person in whom it would not have occurred to him to expect any puzzling variation and the tone of her little soft thin voice instantly rang in his ear like an echo of yesterdays talk he had already remarked to himself that after however long an interval one might see blanche she reappeared with an air of familiarity this was in some sense indeed a proof of the agreeable impression she made and she looked exceedingly pretty as she now suddenly stopped on seeing our two gentlemen and gave a little cry of surprise  ah i did nt know you were here they never told me have you been waiting a long time how d ye do you must think we are polite she held out her hand to bernard smiling very graciously at captain lovelock she barely glanced i hope you are very well she went on to longueville but i need nt ask that you re as blooming as a rose what in the world has happened to you you look so brilliantso fresh can you say that to a manthat he looks fresh or can you only say that about butter and eggs  it depends upon the man said captain lovelock you cant say that a man s fresh who spends his time in running about after you  ah are you here cried blanche with another little cry of surprise i did nt notice youi thought you were the waiter this is what he calls running about after me she added to bernard coming to breakfast without being asked how queerly they have arranged the table she went on gazing with her little elevated eyebrows at this piece of furniture i always thought that in paris if they could nt do anything else they could arrange a table i dont like that at allthose horrid little dishes on each side dont you think those things ought to be off the table mr longueville i dont like to see a lot of things i m not eating and i told them to have some flowerspray where are the flowers do they call those things flowers they look as if they had come out of the landladys bonnet mr longueville do look at those objects  they are not like methey are not very fresh laughed bernard  it s no great matterwe have not got to eat them growled captain lovelock  i should think you would expect towith the luncheon you usually make rejoined blanche since you are here though i did nt ask you you might as well make yourself useful will you be so good as to ring the bell if gordon expects that we are going to wait another quarter of an hour for him he exaggerates the patience of a longsuffering wife if you are very curious to know what he is about he is writing letters by way of a change he writes about eighty a day his correspondents must be strong people it s a lucky thing for me that i am married to gordon if i were not he might write to meto me to whom it s a misery to have to answer even an invitation to dinner to begin with i dont know how to spell if captain lovelock ever boasts that he has had letters from me you may know it s an invention he has never had anything but telegramsthree telegramsthat i sent him in america about a pair of slippers that he had left at our house and that i did nt know what to do with captain lovelocks slippers are no trifle to have on ones handson ones feet i suppose i ought to say for telegrams the spelling does nt matter the people at the office correct itor if they dont you can put it off on them i never see anything nowadays but gordons back she went on as they took their places at tablehis noble broad back as he sits writing his letters that s my principal view of my husband i think that now we are in paris i ought to have a portrait of it by one of the great artists it would be such a characteristic pose i have quite forgotten his face and i dont think i should know it  gordons face however presented itself just at this moment he came in quickly with his countenance flushed with the pleasure of meeting his old friend again he had the sunscorched look of a traveller who has just crossed the atlantic and he smiled at bernard with his honest eyes  dont think me a great brute for not being here to receive you he said as he clasped his hand i was writing an important letter and i put it to myself in this way if i interrupt my letter i shall have to come back and finish it whereas if i finish it now i can have all the rest of the day to spend with him so i stuck to it to the end and now we can be inseparable  you may be sure gordon reasoned it out said blanche while her husband offered his hand in silence to captain lovelock  gordons reasoning is as fine as other peoples feeling declared bernard who was conscious of a desire to say something very pleasant to gordon and who did not at all approve of blanches little ironical tone about her husband  and bernards compliments are better than either said gordon laughing and taking his seat at table  i have been paying him compliments blanche went on i have been telling him he looks so brilliant so bloomingas if something had happened to him as if he had inherited a fortune he must have been doing something very wicked and he ought to tell us all about it to amuse us i am sure you are a dreadful parisian mr longueville remember that we are three dull virtuous people exceedingly bored with each others society and wanting to hear something strange and exciting if it s a little improper that wont spoil it  you certainly are looking uncommonly well said gordon still smiling across the table at his friend i see what blanche means  my dear gordon that s a great event his wife interposed  it s a good deal to pretend certainly he went on smiling always with his red face and his blue eyes but this is no great credit to me because bernards superb condition would strike any one you look as if you were going to marry the lord mayors daughter  if bernard was blooming his bloom at this juncture must have deepened and in so doing indeed have contributed an even brighter tint to his expression of salubrious happiness it was one of the rare occasions of his life when he was at a loss for a verbal expedient  it s a great match he nevertheless murmured jestingly you must excuse my inflated appearance  it has absorbed you so much that you have had no time to write to me said gordon i expected to hear from you after you arrived  i wrote to you a fortnight agojust before receiving your own letter you left new york before my letter reached it  ah it will have crossed us said gordon but now that we have your society i dont care your letters of course are delightful but that is still better  in spite of this sympathetic statement bernard cannot be said to have enjoyed his lunch he was thinking of something else that lay before him and that was not agreeable he was like a man who has an acrobatic feat to performa wide ditch to leap a high pole to climband who has a presentiment of fractures and bruises fortunately he was not obliged to talk much as mrs gordon displayed even more than her usual vivacity rendering her companions the graceful service of lifting the burden of conversation from their shoulders  i suppose you were surprised to see us rushing out here so suddenly she observed in the course of the repast we had said nothing about it when you last saw us and i believe we are supposed to tell you everything aint we i certainly have told you a great many things and there are some of them i hope you have nt repeated i have no doubt you have told them all over paris but i dont care what you tell in parisparis is nt so easily shocked captain lovelock does nt repeat what i tell him i set him up as a model of discretion i have told him some pretty bad things and he has liked them so much he has kept them all to himself i say my bad things to captain lovelock and my good things to other people he does nt know the difference and he is perfectly content  other people as well often dont know the difference said gordon gravely you ought always to tell us which are which  blanche gave her husband a little impertinent stare  when i am not appreciated she said with an attempt at superior dryness i am too proud to point it out i dont know whether you know that i m proud she went on turning to gordon and glancing at captain lovelock it s a good thing to know i suppose gordon will say that i ought to be too proud to point that out but what are you to do when no one has any imagination you have a grain or two mr longueville but captain lovelock has nt a speck as for gordon je nen parle pas but even you mr longueville would never imagine that i am an interesting invalidthat we are travelling for my delicate health the doctors have nt given me up but i have given them up i know i dont look as if i were out of health but that s because i always try to look my best my appearance proves nothingabsolutely nothing do you think my appearance proves anything captain lovelock  captain lovelock scrutinized blanches appearance with a fixed and solemn eye and then he replied  it proves you are very lovely  blanche kissed her fingertips to him in return for this compliment  you only need to give captain lovelock a chance she rattled on and he is as clever as any one that s what i like to do to my friendsi like to make chances for them captain lovelock is like my dear little blue terrier that i left at home if i hold out a stick he will jump over it he wont jump without the stick but as soon as i produce it he knows what he has to do he looks at it a moment and then he gives his little hop he knows he will have a lump of sugar and captain lovelock expects one as well dear captain lovelock shall i ring for a lump would nt it be touching garcon un morceau de sucre pour monsieur le capitaine but what i give monsieur le capitaine is moral sugar i usually administer it in private and he shall have a good big morsel when you go away  gordon got up turning to bernard and looking at his watch  let us go away in that case he said smiling and leave captain lovelock to receive his reward we will go and take a walk we will go up the champs elysees good morning monsieur le capitaine  neither blanche nor the captain offered any opposition to this proposal and bernard took leave of his hostess and joined gordon who had already passed into the antechamber       chapter xxv  gordon took his arm and they gained the street they strolled in the direction of the champs elysees  for a little exercise and a good deal of talk it s the pleasantest place said gordon i have a good deal to say i have a good deal to ask you  bernard felt the familiar pressure of his friends hand as it rested on his arm and it seemed to him never to have lain there with so heavy a weight it held him fastit held him to account it seemed a physical symbol of responsibility bernard was not reassured by hearing that gordon had a great deal to say and he expected a sudden explosion of bitterness on the subject of blanches irremediable triviality the afternoon was a lovely onethe day was a perfect example of the mellowest mood of autumn the air was warm and filled with a golden haze which seemed to hang about the bare parisian trees as if with a tender impulse to drape their nakedness a fine day in paris brings out a wonderfully bright and appreciative multitude of strollers and loungers and the liberal spaces of the champs elysees were on this occasion filled with those placid votaries of inexpensive entertainment who abound in the french capital the benches and chairs on the edge of the great avenue exhibited a dense fraternity of gazers and up and down the broad walk passed the slowmoving and easily pleased pedestrians gordon in spite of his announcement that he had a good deal to say confined himself at first to superficial allusions and bernard after a while had the satisfaction of perceiving that he was not likely for the moment to strike the note of conjugal discord he appeared indeed to feel no desire to speak of blanche in any manner whatever he fell into the humor of the hour and the scene looked at the crowd talked about trifles he remarked that paris was a wonderful place after all and that a little glimpse of the parisian picture was a capital thing as a change said he was very glad they had come and that for his part he was willing to stay three months  and what have you been doing with yourself he asked how have you been occupied and what are you meaning to do  bernard said nothing for a moment and gordon presently glanced at his face to see why he was silent bernard looking askance met his companions eyes and then resting his own upon them he stopped short his heart was beating it was a question of saying to gordon outright i have been occupied in becoming engaged to angela vivian but he could nt say it and yet he must say something he tried to invent something but he could think of nothing and still gordon was looking at him  i am so glad to see you he exclaimed for want of something better and he blushedhe felt foolish he felt falseas he said it  my dear bernard gordon murmured gratefully as they walked on it s very good of you to say that i am very glad we are together again i want to say something he added in a moment i hope you wont mind it bernard gave a little laugh at his companions scruples and gordon continued to tell the truth it has sometimes seemed to me that we were not so good friends as we used to bethat something had come between usi dont know what i dont know why i dont know what to call it but a sort of lowering of the temperature i dont know whether you have felt it or whether it has been simply a fancy of mine whatever it may have been it s all over is nt it we are too old friendstoo good friendsnot to stick together of course the rubs of life may occasionally loosen the cohesion but it is very good to feel that with a little direct contact it may easily be reestablished is nt that so but we should nt reason about these things one feels them and that s enough  gordon spoke in his clear cheerful voice and bernard listened intently it seemed to him there was an undertone of pain and effort in his companions speech it was that of an unhappy man trying to be wise and make the best of things  ah the rubs of lifethe rubs of life bernard repeated vaguely  we must nt mind them said gordon with a conscientious laugh we must toughen our hides or at the worst we must plaster up our bruises but why should we choose this particular place and hour for talking of the pains of life he went on are we not in the midst of its pleasures i mean henceforth to cultivate its pleasures what are yours just now bernard is nt it supposed that in paris one must amuse ones self how have you been amusing yourself  i have been leading a very quiet life said bernard  i notice that s what people always say when they have been particularly dissipated what have you done whom have you seen that one knows  bernard was silent a moment  i have seen some old friends of yours he said at last i have seen mrs vivian and her daughter  ah gordon made this exclamation and then stopped short bernard looked at him but gordon was looking away his eyes had caught some one in the crowd bernard followed the direction they had taken and then gordon went on talk of the devilexcuse the adage are not those the ladies in question  mrs vivian and her daughter were in fact seated among a great many other quiet people in a couple of hired chairs at the edge of the great avenue they were turned toward our two friends and when bernard distinguished them in the welldressed multitude they were looking straight at gordon wright  they see you said bernard  you say that as if i wished to run away gordon answered i dont want to run away on the contrary i want to speak to them  that s easily done said bernard and they advanced to the two ladies  mrs vivian and her daughter rose from their chairs as they came they had evidently rapidly exchanged observations and had decided that it would facilitate their interview with gordon wright to receive him standing he made his way to them through the crowd blushing deeply as he always did when excited then he stood there bareheaded shaking hands with each of them with a fixed smile and with nothing apparently to say bernard watched angelas face she was giving his companion a beautiful smile mrs vivian was delicately cordial  i was sure it was you said gordon at last we were just talking of you  did mr longueville deny it was we asked mrs vivian archly after we had supposed that we had made an impression on him  i knew you were in pariswe were in the act of talking of you gordon went on i am very glad to see you  bernard had shaken hands with angela looking at her intently and in her eyes as his own met them it seemed to him that there was a gleam of mockery at whom was she mockingat gordon or at himself bernard was uncomfortable enough not to care to be mocked but he felt even more sorry that gordon should be  we also knew you were comingmr longueville had told us said mrs vivian and we have been expecting the pleasure of seeing blanche dear little blanche  dear little blanche will immediately come and see you gordon replied  immediately we hope said mrs vivian we shall be so very glad bernard perceived that she wished to say something soothing and sympathetic to poor gordon having it as he supposed on her conscience that after having once encouraged him to regard himself as indispensable in the capacity of soninlaw to her happiness she should now present to him the spectacle of a felicity which had established itself without his aid we were so very much interested in your marriage she went on we thought it soso delightful  gordon fixed his eyes on the ground for a moment  i owe it partly to you he answered you had done so much for blanche you had so cultivated her mind and polished her manners that her attractions were doubled and i fell an easy victim to them  he uttered these words with an exaggerated solemnity the result of which was to produce for a moment an almost embarrassing silence bernard was rapidly becoming more and more impatient of his own embarrassment and now he exclaimed in a loud and jovial voice  blanche makes victims by the dozen i was a victim last winter we are all victims  dear little blanche mrs vivian murmured again  angela had said nothing she had simply stood there making no attempt to address herself to gordon and yet with no affectation of reserve or of indifference now she seemed to feel the impulse to speak to him  when blanche comes to see us you must be sure to come with her she said with a friendly smile  gordon looked at her but he said nothing  we were so sorry to hear she is out of health angela went on  still gordon was silent with his eyes fixed on her expressive and charming face  it is not serious he murmured at last  she used to be so wellso bright said angela who also appeared to have the desire to say something kind and comfortable  gordon made no response to this he only looked at her  i hope you are well miss vivian he broke out at last  very well thank you  do you live in paris  we have pitched our tent here for the present  do you like it  i find it no worse than other places  gordon appeared to desire to talk with her but he could think of nothing to say talking with her was a pretext for looking at her and bernard who thought she had never been so handsome as at that particular moment smiling at her troubled exlover could easily conceive that his friend should desire to prolong this privilege  have you been sitting here long gordon asked thinking of something at last  half an hour we came out to walk and my mother felt tired it is time we should turn homeward angela added  yes i am tired my daughter we must take a voiture if mr longueville will be so good as to find us one said mrs vivian  bernard professing great alacrity looked about him but he still lingered near his companions gordon had thought of something else have you been to baden again bernard heard him ask but at this moment bernard espied at a distance an empty hackneycarriage crawling up the avenue and he was obliged to go and signal to it when he came back followed by the vehicle the two ladies accompanied by gordon had come to the edge of the pavement they shook hands with gordon before getting into the cab and mrs vivian exclaimed  be sure you give our love to your dear wife  then the two ladies settled themselves and smiled their adieux and the little victoria rumbled away at an easy pace while bernard stood with gordon looking after it they watched it a moment and then gordon turned to his companion he looked at bernard for some moments intently with a singular expression  it is strange for me to see her he said presently  i hope it is not altogether disagreeable bernard answered smiling  she is delightfully handsome gordon went on  she is a beautiful woman  and the strange thing is that she strikes me now so differently gordon continued i used to think her so mysteriousso ambiguous she seems to be now so simple  ah said bernard laughing thats an improvement  so simple and so good gordon exclaimed  bernard laid his hand on his companions shoulder shaking his head slowly  you must not think too much about that he said  so simpleso goodso charming gordon repeated  ah my dear gordon bernard murmured  but still gordon continued  so intelligent so reasonable so sensible  have you discovered all that in two minutes talk  yes in two minutes talk i should nt hesitate about her now  it s better you should nt say that said bernard  why should nt i say it it seems to me it s my duty to say it  noyour duty lies elsewhere said bernard there are two reasons one is that you have married another woman  what difference does that make cried gordon  bernard made no attempt to answer this inquiry he simply went on  the other isthe other is  but here he paused  what is the other gordon asked  that i am engaged to marry miss vivian  and with this bernard took his hand off gordons shoulder  gordon stood staring  to marry miss vivian  now that bernard had heard himself say it audibly distinctly loudly the spell of his apprehension seemed broken and he went on bravely  we are to be married very shortly it has all come about within a few weeks it will seem to you very strangeperhaps you wont like it that s why i have hesitated to tell you  gordon turned pale it was the first time bernard had ever seen him do so evidently he did not like it he stood staring and frowning  why i thoughti thought he began at lasti thought that you disliked her  i supposed so too said bernard but i have got over that  gordon turned away looking up the great avenue into the crowd then turning back he said  i am very much surprised  and you are not pleased  gordon fixed his eyes on the ground a moment  i congratulate you on your engagement he said at last looking up with a face that seemed to bernard hard and unnatural  it is very good of you to say that but of course you cant like it i was sure you would nt like it but what could i do i fell in love with her and i could nt run away simply to spare you a surprise my dear gordon bernard added you will get used to it  very likely said gordon dryly but you must give me time  as long as you like  gordon stood for a moment again staring down at the ground  very well then i will take my time he said goodbye  and he turned away as if to walk off alone  where are you going asked bernard stopping him  i dont knowto the hotel anywhere to try to get used to what you have told me  dont try too hard it will come of itself said bernard  we shall see  and gordon turned away again  do you prefer to go alone  very muchif you will excuse me  i have asked you to excuse a greater want of ceremony said bernard smiling  i have not done so yet gordon rejoined and marching off he mingled with the crowd  bernard watched him till he lost sight of him and then dropping into the first empty chair that he saw he sat and reflected that his friend liked it quite as little as he had feared       chapter xxvi  bernard sat thinking for a long time at first with a good deal of mortificationat last with a good deal of bitterness he felt angry at last but he was not angry with himself he was displeased with poor gordon and with gordons displeasure he was uncomfortable and he was vexed at his discomfort it formed it seemed to him no natural part of his situation he had had no glimpse of it in the book of fate where he registered on a fair blank page his betrothal to a charming girl that gordon should be surprised and even a little shocked and annoyedthis was his right and his privilege bernard had been prepared for that and had determined to make the best of it but it must not go too far there were limits to the morsel of humble pie that he was disposed to swallow something in gordons air and figure as he went off in a huff looking vicious and dangerousyes that was positively his lookleft a sinister impression on bernards mind and after a while made him glad to take refuge in being angry one would like to know what gordon expected par exemple did he expect bernard to give up angela simply to save him a shock or to back out of his engagement by way of an ideal reparation no it was too absurd and if gordon had a wife of his own why in the name of justice should not bernard have one  being angry was a relief but it was not exactly a solution and bernard at last leaving his place where for an hour or two he had been absolutely unconscious of everything that went on around him wandered about for some time in deep restlessness and irritation at one moment he thought of going back to gordons hotel to see him to explain but then he became aware that he was too angry for thatto say nothing of gordons being too angry also and moreover that there was nothing to explain he was to marry angela vivian that was a very simple factit needed no explanation was it so wonderful so inconceivable an incident so unlikely to happen he went as he always did on sunday to dine with mrs vivian and it seemed to him that he perceived in the two ladies some symptoms of a discomposure which had the same origin as his own bernard on this occasion at dinner failed to make himself particularly agreeable he ate fastas if he had no idea what he was eating and talked little every now and then his eyes rested for some time upon angela with a strange eagerly excited expression as if he were looking her over and trying to make up his mind about her afresh this young lady bore his inscrutable scrutiny with a deal of superficial composure but she was also silent and she returned his gaze from time to time with an air of unusual anxiety she was thinking of course of gordon bernard said to himself and a womans first meeting in after years with an exlover must always make a certain impression upon her gordon however had never been a lover and if bernard noted angelas gravity it was not because he felt jealous she is simply sorry for him he said to himself and by the time he had finished his dinner it began to come back to him that he was sorry too mrs vivian was probably sorry as well for she had a slightly confused and preoccupied looka look from which even in the midst of his chagrin bernard extracted some entertainment it was mrs vivians intermittent conscience that had been reminded of one of its lapses her meeting with gordon wright had recalled the least exemplary episode of her lifethe time when she whispered mercenary counsel in the ear of a daughter who sat grave and pale looking at her with eyes that wondered mrs vivian blushed a little now when she met bernards eyes and to remind herself that she was after all a virtuous woman talked as much as possible about superior and harmless thingsthe beauty of the autumn weather the pleasure of seeing french papas walking about on sunday with their progeny in their hands the peculiarities of the pulpitoratory of the country as exemplified in the discourse of a protestant pasteur whom she had been to hear in the morning  when they rose from table and went back into her little drawingroom she left her daughter alone for awhile with bernard the two were standing together before the fire bernard watched mrs vivian close the door softly behind her then looking for a moment at his companion  he is furious he announced at last  furious said angela do you mean mr wright  the amiable reasonable gordon he takes it very hard  do you mean about me asked angela  it s not with you he s furious of course it is with me he wont let me off easily  angela looked for a moment at the fire  i am very sorry for him she said at last  it seems to me i am the one to be pitied said bernard and i dont see what compassion you of all people in the world owe him  angela again rested her eyes on the fire then presently looking up  he liked me very much she remarked  all the more shame to him cried bernard  what do you mean asked the girl with her beautiful stare  if he liked you why did he give you up  he did nt give me up  what do you mean please asked bernard staring back at her  i sent him awayi refused him said angela  yes but you thought better of it and your mother had persuaded you that if he should ask you again you had better accept him then it was that he backed outin consequence of what i said to him on his return from england  she shook her head slowly with a strange smile  my poor bernard you are talking very wildly he did ask me again  that night cried bernard  the night he came back from englandthe last time i saw him until today  after i had denounced you our puzzled hero exclaimed frowning portentously  i am sorry to let you know the small effect of your words  bernard folded his hands togetheralmost devoutlyand stood gazing at her with a long inarticulate murmur of satisfaction  ah then i did nt injure youi did nt deprive you of a chance  oh sir the intention on your part was the same angela exclaimed  then all my uneasiness all my remorse were wasted he went on  but she kept the same tone and its tender archness only gave a greater sweetness to his sense of relief  it was a very small penance for you to pay  you dismissed him definitely and that was why he vanished asked bernard wondering still  he gave me another chance as you elegantly express it and i declined to take advantage of it  ah well now cried bernard i am sorry for him  i was very kindvery respectful said angela i thanked him from the bottom of my heart i begged his pardon very humbly for the wrongif wrong it wasthat i was doing him i did nt in the least require of him that he should leave baden at seven oclock the next morning i had no idea that he would do so and that was the reason that i insisted to my mother that we ourselves should go away when we went i knew nothing about his having gone and i supposed he was still there i did nt wish to meet him again  angela gave this information slowly softly with pauses between the sentences as if she were recalling the circumstances with a certain effort and meanwhile bernard with his transfigured face and his eyes fixed upon her lips was moving excitedly about the room  well he cant accuse me then he broke out again if what i said had no more effect upon him than that i certainly did him no wrong  i think you are rather vexed he did nt believe you said angela  i confess i dont understand it he had all the air of it he certainly had not the air of a man who was going to rush off and give you the last proof of his confidence  it was not a proof of confidence said angela it had nothing to do with me it was as between himself and you it was a proof of independence he did believe you more or less and what you said fell in with his own impressionsstrange impressions that they were poor man at the same time as i say he liked me too it was out of his liking me that all his trouble came he caught himself in the act of listening to you too credulouslyand that seemed to him unmanly and dishonorable the sensation brought with it a reaction and to prove to himself that in such a matter he could be influenced by nobody he marched away an hour after he had talked with you and in the teeth of his perfect mistrust confirmed by your account of my irregularitiesheaven forgive you bothagain asked me to be his wife but he hoped i would refuse  ah cried bernard the recreant he deservedhe deserved  that i should accept him angela asked smiling still  bernard was so much affected by this revelation it seemed to him to make such a difference in his own responsibility and to lift such a weight off his conscience that he broke out again into the liveliest ejaculations of relief  oh i dont care for anything now and i can do what i please gordon may hate me and i shall be sorry for him but it s not my fault and i owe him no reparation no no i am free  it s only i who am not i suppose said angela and the reparation must come from me if he is unhappy i must take the responsibility  ah yes of course said bernard kissing her  but why should he be unhappy asked angela if i refused him it was what he wanted  he is hard to please bernard rejoined he has got a wife of his own  if blanche does nt please him he is certainly difficult and angela mused a little but you told me the other day that they were getting on so well  yes i believe i told you bernard answered musing a little too  you are not attending to what i say  no i am thinking of something elsei am thinking of what it was that made you refuse him that way at the last after you had let your mother hope and bernard stood there smiling at her  dont think any more you will not find out the girl declared turning away  ah it was cruel of you to let me think i was wrong all these years he went on and at the time since you meant to refuse him you might have been more frank with me  i thought my fault had been that i was too frank  i was densely stupid and you might have made me understand better  ah said angela you ask a great deal of a girl  why have you let me go on so long thinking that my deluded words had had an effect upon gordonfeeling that i had done you a brutal wrong it was real to me the wrongand i have told you of the pangs and the shame which for so many months it has cost me why have you never undeceived me until today and then only by accident  at this question angela blushed a little then she answered smiling  it was my vengeance  bernard shook his head  that wont doyou dont mean it you never caredyou were too proud to care and when i spoke to you about my fault you did nt even know what i meant you might have told me therefore that my remorse was idle that what i said to gordon had not been of the smallest consequence and that the rupture had come from yourself  for some time angela said nothing then at last she gave him one of the deeply serious looks with which her face was occasionally ornamented  if you want really to know thencant you see that your remorse seemed to me connected in a certain way with your affection a sort of guarantee of it you thought you had injured some one or other and that seemed to be mixed up with your loving me and therefore i let it alone  ah said bernard my remorse is all gone and yet i think i love you about as much as ever so you see how wrong you were not to tell me  the wrong to you i dont care about it is very true i might have told you for mr wrights sake it would perhaps have made him look better but as you never attacked him for deserting me it seemed needless for me to defend him    i confess said bernard i am quite at sea about gordons look in the matter is he looking better nowor is he looking worse you put it very well just now i was attending to you though you said i was not if he hoped you would refuse him with whom is his quarrel at present and why was he so cool to me for months after we parted at baden if that was his state of mind why should he accuse me of inconsistency  there is something in it after all that a woman can understand i dont know whether a man can he hoped i would refuse him and yet when i had done so he was vexed after a while his vexation subsided and he married poor blanche but on learning today that i had accepted you it flickered up again i suppose that was natural enough but it wont be serious  what will not be serious my dear asked mrs vivian who had come back to the drawingroom and who apparently could not hear that the attribute in question was wanting in any direction without some alarm  shall i tell mamma bernard said angela  ah my dear child i hope it s nothing that threatens your mutual happiness mamma murmured with gentle earnestness  does it threaten our mutual happiness bernard the girl went on smiling  let mrs vivian decide whether we ought to let it make us miserable said bernard dear mrs vivian you are a casuist and this is a nice case  is it anything about poor mr wright the elder lady inquired  why do you say poor mr wright asked bernard  because i am sadly afraid he is not happy with blanche  how did you discover thatwithout seeing them together  well perhaps you will think me very fanciful said mrs vivian but it was by the way he looked at angela he has such an expressive face  he looked at me very kindly mamma angela observed  he regularly stared my daughter in any one else i should have said it was rude but his situation is so peculiar and one could see that he admired you still and mrs vivian gave a little soft sigh  ah she is thinking of the thirty thousand a year bernard said to himself  i am sure i hope he admires me still the girl cried laughing there is no great harm in that  he was comparing you with blancheand he was struck with the contrast  it could nt have been in my favor if it s a question of being looked at blanche bears it better than i  poor little blanche murmured mrs vivian sweetly  why did you tell me he was so happy with her angela asked turning to bernard abruptly  bernard gazed at her a moment with his eyebrows raised  i never saw any one ask such sudden questions he exclaimed  you can answer me at your leisure she rejoined turning away  it was because i adored you  you would nt say that at your leisure said the girl  mrs vivian stood watching them  you who are so happy together you ought to think kindly of others who are less fortunate  that is very true mrs vivian and i have never thought of any one so kindly as i have of gordon for the last year  angela turned round again  is blanche so very bad then  you will see for yourself  ah no said mrs vivian she is not bad she is only very light i am so glad she is to be near us again i think a great deal can be done by association we must help her angela i think we helped her before  it is also very true that she is light mrs vivian bernard observed and if you could make her a little heavier i should be tremendously grateful  bernards prospective motherinlaw looked at him a little  i dont know whether you are laughing at mei always think you are but i shall not give up blanche for that i never give up any one that i have once tried to help blanche will come back to me  mrs vivian had hardly spoken when the sharp little vibration of her doorbell was heard in the hall bernard stood for a moment looking at the door of the drawingroom  it is poor gordon come to make a scene he announced  is that what you meanthat he opposed your marriage asked mrs vivian with a frightened air  i dont know what he proposes to do with blanche said bernard laughing  there were voices in the hall angela had been listening  you say she will come back to you mamma she exclaimed here she is arrived       chapter xxvii  at the same moment the door was thrown open and mrs gordon appeared on the threshold with a gentleman behind her blanche stood an instant looking into the lighted room and hesitatingflushed a little smiling extremely pretty  may i come in she said and may i bring in captain lovelock  the two ladies of course fluttering toward her with every demonstration of hospitality drew her into the room while bernard proceeded to greet the captain who advanced with a certain awkward and bashful majesty almost sweeping with his great stature mrs vivians humble ceiling there was a tender exchange of embraces between blanche and her friends and the charming visitor losing no time began to chatter with her usual volubility mrs vivian and angela made her companion graciously welcome but blanche begged they would nt mind himshe had only brought him as a watchdog  his place is on the rug she said captain lovelock go and lie down on the rug  upon my soul there is nothing else but rugs in these french places the captain rejoined looking round mrs vivians salon which rug do you mean  mrs vivian had remarked to blanche that it was very kind of her to come first and blanche declared that she could not have laid her head on her pillow before she had seen her dear mrs vivian  do you suppose i would wait because i am married she inquired with a keen little smile in her charming eyes i am not so much married as that i can tell you do you think i look much as if i were married with no one to bring me here tonight but captain lovelock  i am sure captain lovelock is a very gallant escort said mrs vivian  oh he was not afraidthat is he was not afraid of the journey though it lay all through those dreadful wild champs elysees but when we arrived he was afraid to come into come up here captain lovelock is so modest you knowin spite of all the success he had in america he will tell you about the success he had in america it quite makes up for the defeat of the british army in the revolution they were defeated in the revolution the british were nt they i always told him so but he insists they were not how do we come to be free then i always ask him i suppose you admit that we are free then he becomes personal and says that i am free enough certainly but it s the general fact i mean i wish you would tell him about the general fact i think he would believe you because he knows you know a great deal about history and all that i dont mean this evening but some time when it is convenient he did nt want to come inhe wanted to stay in the carriage and smoke a cigar he thought you would nt like it his coming with me the first time but i told him he need nt mind that for i would certainly explain i would be very careful to let you know that i brought him only as a substitute a substitute for whom a substitute for my husband of course my dear mrs vivian of course i ought to bring you some pretty message from gordonthat he is dying to come and see you only that he had nineteen letters to write and that he could nt possibly stir from his fireside i suppose a good wife ought to invent excuses for her husbandought to throw herself into the breach is nt that what they call it but i am afraid i am not a good wife do you think i am a good wife mr longueville you once stayed three months with us and you had a chance to see i dont ask you that seriously because you never tell the truth i always do so i will say i am not a good wife and then the breach is too big and i am too little oh i am too little mrs vivian i know i am too little i am the smallest woman living gordon can scarcely see me with a microscope and i believe he has the most powerful one in america he is going to get another here that is one of the things he came abroad for perhaps it will do better i do tell the truth dont i mrs vivian i have that merit if i have nt any other you once told me so at baden you said you could say one thing for me at any ratethat i did nt tell fibs you were very nice to me at baden blanche went on with her little intent smile laying her hand in that of her hostess you see i have never forgotten it so to keep up my reputation i must tell the truth about gordon he simply said he would nt comevoila he gave no reason and he did nt send you any pretty message he simply declined and he went out somewhere else so you see he is nt writing letters i dont know where he can have gone perhaps he has gone to the theatre i know it is nt proper to go to the theatre on sunday evening but they say charity begins at home and as gordons does nt begin at home perhaps it does nt begin anywhere i told him that if he would nt come with me i would come alone and he said i might do as i chosethat he was not in a humor for making visits i wanted to come to you very much i had been thinking about it all day and i am so fond of a visit like this in the evening without being invited then i thought perhaps you had a salondoes nt every one in paris have a salon i tried to have a salon in new york only gordon said it would nt do he said it was nt in our manners is this a salon tonight mrs vivian oh do say it is i should like so much to see captain lovelock in a salon by good fortune he happened to have been dining with us so i told him he must bring me here i told you i would explain captain lovelock she added and i hope you think i have made it clear  the captain had turned very red during this wandering discourse he sat pulling his beard and shifting the position which with his stalwart person he had taken up on a little gilded chaira piece of furniture which every now and then gave a delicate creak  i always understand you well enough till you begin to explain he rejoined with a candid even if embarrassed laugh then by jove i m quite in the woods you see such a lot more in things than most people does nt she miss vivian  blanche has a fine imagination said angela smiling frankly at the charming visitor  when blanche was fairly adrift upon the current of her articulate reflections it was the habit of her companionsindeed it was a sort of tacit agreement among themsimply to make a circle and admire they sat about and looked at heryawning perhaps a little at times but on the whole very well entertained and often exchanging a smiling commentary with each other she looked at them smiled at them each in succession every one had his turn and this always helped to give blanche an audience incoherent and aimless as much of her talk was she never looked prettier than in the attitude of improvisationor rather i should say than in the hundred attitudes which she assumed at such a time perpetually moving she was yet constantly graceful and while she twisted her body and turned her head with charming hands that never ceased to gesticulate and little conscious brilliant eyes that looked everywhere at onceeyes that seemed to chatter even faster than her lipsshe made you forget the nonsense she poured forth or think of it only as a part of her personal picturesqueness the thing was a regular performance the practice of unlimited chatter had made her perfect she rested upon her audience and held it together and the sight of half a dozen pairs of amused and fascinated faces led her from one piece of folly to another on this occasion her audience was far from failing her for they were all greatly interested captain lovelocks interest as we know was chronic and our three other friends were much occupied with a matter with which blanche was intimately connected bernard as he listened to her smiling mechanically was not encouraged he remembered what mrs vivian had said shortly before she came in and it was not pleasant to him to think that gordon had been occupied half the day in contrasting the finest girl in the world with this magnified butterfly the contrast was sufficiently striking as angela sat there near her very still bending her handsome head a little with her hands crossed in her lap and on her lips a kind but inscrutable smile mrs vivian was on the sofa next to blanche one of whose hands when it was not otherwise occupied she occasionally took into her own  dear little blanche she softly murmured at intervals  these few remarks represent a longer pause than mrs gordon often suffered to occur she continued to deliver herself upon a hundred topics and it hardly matters where we take her up  i have nt the least idea what we are going to do i have nothing to say about it whatever gordon tells me every day i must decide and then i ask captain lovelock what he thinks because you see he always thinks a great deal captain lovelock says he does nt care a figthat he will go wherever i go so you see that does nt carry us very far i want to settle on some place where captain lovelock wont go but he wont help me at all i think it will look better for him not to follow us dont you think it will look better mrs vivian not that i care in the least where we goor whether captain lovelock follows us either i dont take any interest in anything mrs vivian dont you think that is very sad gordon may go anywhere he likesto st petersburg or to bombay  you might go to a worse place than bombay said captain lovelock speaking with the authority of an angloindian rich in reminiscences  blanche gave him a little stare  ah well that s knocked on the head from the way you speak of it i think you would come after us and the more i think of that the more i see it would nt do but we have got to go to some southern place because i am very unwell i have nt the least idea what s the matter with me and neither has any one else but that does nt make any difference it s settled that i am out of health one might as well be out of it as in it for all the advantage it is if you are out of health at any rate you can come abroad it was gordons discoveryhe s always making discoveries you see it s because i m so silly he can always put it down to my being an invalid what i should like to do mrs vivian would be to spend the winter with youjust sitting on the sofa beside you and holding your hand it would be rather tiresome for you but i really think it would be better for me than anything else i have never forgotten how kind you were to me before my marriagethat summer at baden you were everything to meyou and captain lovelock i am sure i should be happy if i never went out of this lovely room you have got it so beautifully arrangedi mean to do my own room just like it when i go home and you have got such lovely clothes you never used to say anything about it but you and angela always had better clothes than i are you always so quiet and seriousnever talking about chiffonsalways reading some wonderful book i wish you would let me come and stay with you if you only ask me gordon would be too delighted he would nt have to trouble about me any more he could go and live over in the latin quarterthat s the desire of his heartand think of nothing but old bottles i know it is nt very good manners to beg for an invitation blanche went on smiling with a gentler radiance but when it s a question of ones health one wants to keep ones self alivedoes nt one one wants to keep ones self going it would be so good for me mrs vivian it would really be very good for me  she had turned round more and more to her hostess as she talked and at last she had given both her hands to mrs vivian and sat looking at her with a singular mixture of earnestness and jocosity it was hard to know whether blanche were expressing a real desire or a momentary caprice and whether this abrupt little petition were to be taken seriously or treated merely as a dramatic pose in a series of more or less effective attitudes her smile had become almost a grimace she was flushed she showed her pretty teeth but there was a little passionate quiver in her voice  my dear child said mrs vivian we should be delighted to have you pay us a visit and we should be so happy if we could do you any good but i am afraid you would very soon get tired of us and i ought to tell you frankly that our little home is to bea broken up you know there is to be aa change the good lady continued with a hesitation which apparently came from a sense of walking on uncertain ground while she glanced with a smile at bernard and angela  blanche sat there with her little excited yet innocenttoo innocentstare her eyes followed mrs vivians they met bernards for an instant and for some reason at this moment bernard flushed  he rose quickly and walked away to the window where he stood looking out into the darkness the devilthe devil he murmured to himself she does nt even know we are to be marriedgordon has nt been able to trust himself to tell her and this fact seemed pregnant with evidence as to gordons state of mind it did not appear to simplify the situation after a moment while bernard stood there with his back turnedhe felt rather awkward and foolishhe heard blanche begin with her little surprised voice  ah you are going away you are going to travel but that s charming we can travel together you are not going to travel what then are you going to do you are going back to america ah but you must nt do that as soon as i come abroad that s not nice or friendly mrs vivian to your poor little old blanche you are not going back to america ah then i give it up what s the great mystery is it something about angela there was always a mystery about angela i hope you wont mind my saying it my dear but i was always afraid of you my husbandhe admires you so much you knowhas often tried to explain you to me but i have never understood what are you going to do now are you going into a convent are you going to beaah  and suddenly quickly interrupting herself mrs gordon gave a long wondering cry bernard heard her spring to her feet and the two other ladies rise from their seats captain lovelock got up as well bernard heard him knock over his little gilded chair there was a pause during which blanche went through a little mute exhibition of amazement and pleasure bernard turned round to receive half a dozen quick questions  what are you hiding away for what are you blushing for i never saw you do anything like that before why do you look so strange and what are you making me say angela is it trueis there something like that without waiting for the answer to this last question blanche threw herself upon mrs vivian my own mrs vivian she cried is she married  my dear blanche said bernard coming forward has not gordon told you angela and i are not married but we hope to be before long gordon only knew it this morning we ourselves have only known it a short time there is no mystery about it and we only want your congratulations  well i must say you have been very quiet about it cried blanche when i was engaged i wrote you all a letter  by jove she wrote to me observed captain lovelock  angela went to her and kissed her  your husband does nt seem to have explained me very successfully  mrs gordon held bernards intended for a moment at arms length with both her hands looking at her with eyes of real excitement and wonder then she folded her in a prolonged an exaggerated embrace  why did nt he tell mewhy did nt he tell me she presently began he has had all day to tell me and it was very cruel of him to let me come here without knowing it could anything be more absurdmore awkward you dont think it s awkwardyou dont mind it ah well you are very good but i like it angelai like it extremely immensely i think it s delightful and i wonder it never occurred to me has it been going on long ah of course it has been going on did nt it begin at baden and did nt i see it there do you mind my alluding to that at baden we were all so mixed up that one could nt tell who was attentive to whom but bernard has been very faithful my dear i can assure you of that when he was in america he would nt look at another woman i know something about that he stayed three months in my house and he never spoke to me now i know why mr bernard but you might have told me at the time the reason was certainly good enough i always want to know why you know why gordon never told me for instance that s what i want to know  blanche refused to sit down again she declared that she was so agitated by this charming news that she could not be quiet and that she must presently take her departure meanwhile she congratulated each of her friends half a dozen times she kissed mrs vivian again she almost kissed bernard she inquired about details she longed to hear all about angelas things of course they would stop for the wedding but meantime she must be very discreet she must not intrude too much captain lovelock addressed to angela a few fragmentary but wellintentioned sentences pulling his beard and fixing his eyes on the doorknoban implement which presently turned in his manly fist as he opened the door for his companion to withdraw blanche went away in a flutter of ejaculations and protestations which left our three friends in mrs vivians little drawingroom standing looking at each other as the door closed behind her  it certainly would have been better taste in him to tell her said bernard frowning and not let other people see how little communication there is between them it has mortified her  poor mr wright had his reasons mrs vivian suggested and then she ventured to explain he still cares for angela and it was painful to him to talk about her marrying some one else  this had been bernards own reflection and it was no more agreeable as mrs vivian presented it though angela herself seemed indifferent to itseemed indeed not to hear it as if she were thinking of something else  we must simply marry as soon as possible tomorrow if necessary said bernard with some causticity that s the best thing we can do for every one when once angela is married gordon will stop thinking of her he will never permit his imagination to hover about a married woman i am very sure of that he does nt approve of that sort of thing and he has the same law for himself as for other people  it does nt matter said angela simply  how do you mean my daughter it does nt matter  i dont feel obliged to feel so sorry for him now  now pray what has happened i am more sorry than ever since i have heard poor blanches dreadful tone about him  the girl was silent a moment then she shook her head lightly  her toneher tone dearest mother dont you see she is intensely in love with him       chapter xxviii  this observation struck bernard as extremely ingenious and worthy of his mistresss fine intelligence he greeted it with enthusiasm and thought of it for the next twelve hours the more he thought of it the more felicitous it seemed to him and he went to mrs vivians the next day almost for the express purpose of saying to angela that decidedly she was right he was admitted by his old friend the little femme de chambre who had long since bestowed upon him definitively her confidence and as in the antechamber he heard the voice of a gentleman raised and talking with some emphasis come to him from the salon he paused a moment looking at her with an interrogative eye  yes said mrs vivians attendant i must tell monsieur frankly that another gentleman is there moreover what does it matter monsieur would perceive it for himself  has he been here long asked bernard  a quarter of an hour it probably does nt seem long to the gentleman  is he alone with mademoiselle  he asked for mademoiselle only i introduced him into the salon and mademoiselle after conversing a little while with madame consented to receive him they have been alone together as i have told monsieur since about three oclock madame is in her own apartment the position of monsieur added this discriminating woman certainly justifies him in entering the salon  bernard was quite of this opinion and in a moment more he had crossed the threshold of the little drawingroom and closed the door behind him  angela sat there on a sofa leaning back with her hands clasped in her lap and her eyes fixed upon gordon wright who stood squarely before her as if he had been making her a resolute speech her face wore a look of distress almost of alarm she kept her place but her eyes gave bernard a mute welcome gordon turned and looked at him slowly from head to foot bernard remembered with a good deal of vividness the last look his friend had given him in the champs elysees the day before and he saw with some satisfaction that this was not exactly a repetition of that expression of cold horror it was a question however whether the horror were changed for the better poor gordon looked intensely sad and grievously wronged the keen resentment had faded from his face but an immense reproach was therea heavy helpless appealing reproach bernard saw that he had not a scene of violence to dreadand yet when he perceived what was coming he would almost have preferred violence gordon did not offer him his hand and before bernard had had time to say anything began to speak again as if he were going on with what he had been saying to angela  you have done me a great wrongyou have done me a cruel wrong i have been telling it to miss vivian i came on purpose to tell her i cant really tell her i cant tell her the details it s too painful but you know what i mean i could nt stand it any longer i thought of going awaybut i could nt do that i must come and say what i feel i cant bear it now  this outbreak of a passionate sense of injury in a man habitually so undemonstrative so little disposed to call attention to himself had in it something at once of the touching and the terrible bernard for an instant felt almost bewildered he asked himself whether he had not after all been a monster of duplicity he was guilty of the weakness of taking refuge in what is called i believe in legal phrase a sideissue  dont say all this before angela he exclaimed with a kind of artificial energy you know she is not in the least at fault and that it can only give her pain the thing is between ourselves  angela was sitting there looking up at both the men i like to hear it she said  you have a singular taste bernard declared  i know it s between ourselves cried gordon and that miss vivian is not at fault she is only too lovely too wise too good it is you and i that are at faulthorribly at fault you see i admit it and you dont i never dreamed that i should live to say such things as this to you but i never dreamed you would do what you have done it s horrible most horrible that such a difference as this should come between two men who believed themselvesor whom i believed at leastthe best friends in the world for it is a differenceit s a great gulf and nothing will ever fill it up i must say so i cant help it you know i dont express myself easily so if i break out this way you may know what i feel i know it is a pain to miss vivian and i beg her to forgive me she has so much to forgive that she can forgive that too i cant pretend to accept it i cant sit down and let it pass and then it is nt only my feelings it s the right it s the justice i must say to her that you have no right to marry her and beg of her to listen to me and let you go  my dear gordon are you crazy bernard demanded with an energy which this time at least was sufficiently real  very likely i am crazy i am crazy with disappointment and the bitterness of what i have lost add to that the wretchedness of what i have found  ah dont say that mr wright angela begged  he stood for an instant looking at her but not heeding her words will you listen to me again will you forget the wrong i did youmy stupidity and folly and unworthiness will you blot out the past and let me begin again i see you as clearly now as the light of that window will you give me another chance  angela turned away her eyes and covered her face with her hands you do pain me she murmured  you go too far said bernard to what position does your extraordinary proposal relegate your wife  gordon turned his pleading eyes on his old friend without a ray of concession but for a moment he hesitated dont speak to me of my wife i have no wife  ah poor girl said angela springing up from the sofa  i am perfectly serious gordon went on addressing himself again to her no after all i am not crazy i see only too clearlyi see what should be when people see that you call them crazy bernard has no righthe must give you up if you really care for him you should help him he is in a very false position you should nt wish to see him in such a position i cant explain to youif it were even for my own sake but bernard must have told you it is not possible that he has not told you  i have told angela everything gordon said bernard  i dont know what you mean by your having done me a wrong the girl exclaimed  if he has told you theni may say it in listening to him in believing him  but you did nt believe me bernard exclaimed since you immediately went and offered yourself to miss vivian  i believed you all the same when did i ever not believe you  the last words i ever heard from mr wright were words of the deepest kindness said angela  she spoke with such a serious tender grace that gordon seemed stirred to his depths again  ah give me another chance he moaned  the poor girl could not help her tone and it was in the same tone that she continued  if you think so well of me try and be reasonable  gordon looked at her slowly shaking his head  reasonablereasonable yes you have a right to say that for you are full of reason but so am i what i ask is within reasonable limits  granting your happiness were lost said bernardi say that only for the argumentis that a ground for your wishing to deprive me of mine  it is not yoursit is mine that you have taken you put me off my guard and then you took it yours is elsewhere and you are welcome to it  ah murmured bernard giving him a long look and turning away it is well for you that i am willing still to regard you as my best friend  gordon went on more passionately to angela  he put me off my guardi cant call it anything else i know i gave him a great chancei encouraged him urged him tempted him but when once he had spoken he should have stood to it he should nt have had two opinionsone for me and one for himself he put me off my guard it was because i still resisted him that i went to you again that last time but i was still afraid of you and in my heart i believed him as i say i always believed him it was his great influence upon me he is the cleverest the most intelligent the most brilliant of men i dont think that a grain less than i ever thought it he continued turning again to bernard i think it only the more and i dont wonder that you find a woman to believe it but what have you done but deceive me it was just my belief in your intelligence that reassured me when miss vivian refused me a second time and i left baden it was at first with a sort of relief but there came back a better feelinga feeling faint compared to this feeling of today but strong enough to make me uneasy and to fill me with regret to quench my regret i kept thinking of what you had said and it kept me quiet your word had such weight with me  how many times more would you have wished to be refused and how many refusals would have been required to give me my liberty asked bernard  that question means nothing because you never knew that i had again offered myself to miss vivian  no you told me very little considering all that you made me tell you  i told you beforehand that i should do exactly as i chose  you should have allowed me the same liberty  liberty cried gordon had nt you liberty to range the whole world over could nt he have found a thousand other women  it is not for me to think so said angela smiling a little  gordon looked at her a moment  ah you cared for him from the first he cried  i had seen him before i ever saw you said the girl  bernard suppressed an exclamation there seemed to flash through these words a sort of retrospective confession which told him something that she had never directly told him she blushed as soon as she had spoken and bernard found a beauty in this of which the brightness blinded him to the awkward aspect of the fact she had just presented to gordon at this fact gordon stood staring then at last he apprehended itlargely  ah then it had been a plot between you he cried out  bernard and angela exchanged a glance of pity  we had met for five minutes and had exchanged a few words before i came to baden it was in italyat siena it was a simple accident that i never told you bernard explained  i wished that nothing should be said about it said angela  ah you loved him gordon exclaimed  angela turned awayshe went to the window bernard followed her for three seconds with his eyes then he went on  if it were so i had no reason to suppose it you have accused me of deceiving you but i deceived only myself you say i put you off your guard but you should rather say you put me on mine it was thanks to that that i fell into the most senseless the most brutal of delusions the delusion passed awayit had contained the germ of better things i saw my error and i bitterly repented of it and on the day you were married i felt free  ah yes i have no doubt you waited for that cried gordon it may interest you to know that my marriage is a miserable failure  i am sorry to hear itbut i cant help it  you have seen it with your own eyes you know all about it and i need nt tell you  my dear mr wright said angela pleadingly turning round in heavens name dont say that  why should nt i say it i came here on purpose to say it i came here with an intentionwith a plan you know what blanche isyou need nt pretend for kindness to me that you dont you know what a precious what an inestimable wife she must make mehow devoted how sympathetic she must be and what a household blessing at every hour of the day bernard can tell you all about ushe has seen us in the sanctity of our home gordon gave a bitter laugh and went on with the same strange serious air of explaining his plan she despises me she hates me she cares no more for me than for the button on her gloveby which i mean that she does nt care a hundredth part as much you may say that it serves me right and that i have got what i deserve i married her because she was silly i wanted a silly wife i had an idea you were too wise oh yes that s what i thought of you blanche knew why i picked her out and undertook to supply the article required heaven forgive her she has certainly kept her engagement but you can imagine how it must have made her like meknowing why i picked her out she has disappointed me all the same i thought she had a heart but that was a mistake it does nt matter though because everything is over between us  what do you mean everything is over bernard demanded  everything will be over in a few weeks then i can speak to miss vivian seriously  ah i am glad to hear this is not serious said bernard  miss vivian wait a few weeks gordon went on give me another chance then then it will be perfectly right i shall be free  you speak as if you were going to put an end to your wife  she is rapidly putting an end to herself she means to leave me  poor unhappy man do you know what you are saying angela murmured  perfectly i came here to say it she means to leave me and i mean to offer her every facility she is dying to take a lover and she has got an excellent one waiting for her bernard knows whom i mean i dont know whether you do she was ready to take one three months after our marriage it is really very good of her to have waited all this time but i dont think she can go more than a week or two longer she is recommended a southern climate and i am pretty sure that in the course of another ten days i may count upon their starting together for the shores of the mediterranean the shores of the mediterranean you know are lovely and i hope they will do her a world of good as soon as they have left paris i will let you know and then you will of course admit that virtually i am free  i dont understand you  i suppose you are aware said gordon that we have the advantage of being natives of a country in which marriages may be legally dissolved  angela stared then softly  are you speaking of a divorce  i believe that is what they call it gordon answered gazing back at her with his densely clouded blue eyes the lawyers do it for you and if she goes away with lovelock nothing will be more simple than for me to have it arranged  angela stared i say and bernard was staring too then the latter turning away broke out into a tremendous irrepressible laugh  gordon looked at him a moment then he said to angela with a deeper tremor in his voice  he was my dearest friend  i never felt more devoted to you than at this moment bernard declared smiling still  gordon had fixed his sombre eyes upon the girl again  do you understand me now  angela looked back at him for some instants  yes she murmured at last  and will you wait and give me another chance  yes she said in the same tone  bernard uttered a quick exclamation but angela checked him with a glance and gordon looked from one of them to the other  can i trust you gordon asked  i will make you happy said angela  bernard wondered what under the sun she meant but he thought he might safely add  i will abide by her choice  gordon actually began to smile  it wont be long i think two or three weeks  angela made no answer to this she fixed her eyes on the floor  i shall see blanche as often as possible she presently said  by all means the more you see her the better you will understand me  i understand you very well now but you have shaken me very much and you must leave me i shall see you alsooften  gordon took up his hat and stick he saw that bernard did not do the same  and bernard he exclaimed  i shall ask him to leave paris said angela  will you go  i will do what angela requests said bernard  you have heard what she requests it s for you to come now  ah you must at least allow me to take leave cried bernard  gordon went to the door and when he had opened it he stood for a while holding it and looking at his companions then  i assure you she wont be long he said to angela and rapidly passed out  the others stood silent till they heard the outer door of the apartment close behind him  and now please to elucidate said bernard folding his arms  angela gave no answer for some moments then she turned upon him a smile which appeared incongruous but which her words presently helped to explain  he is intensely in love with his wife       chapter xxix  this statement was very effective but it might well have seemed at first to do more credit to her satiric powers than to her faculty of observation this was the light in which it presented itself to bernard but little by little as she amplified the text he grew to think well of it and at last he was quite ready to place it as a triumph of sagacity on a level with that other discovery which she had made the evening before and with regard to which his especial errand today had been to congratulate her afresh it brought him however less satisfaction than it appeared to bring to his clever companion for as he observed plausibly enough gordon was quite out of his head and this being the case of what importance was the secret of his heart  the secret of his heart and the condition of his head are one and the same thing said angela he is turned upside down by the wretchedly false position that he has got into with his wife she has treated him badly but he has treated her wrongly they are in love with each other and yet they both do nothing but hide it he is not in the least in love with poor menot today any more than he was three years ago he thinks he is because he is full of sorrow and bitterness and because the news of our engagement has given him a shock but that s only a pretexta chance to pour out the grief and pain which have been accumulating in his heart under a sense of his estrangement from blanche he is too proud to attribute his feelings to that cause even to himself but he wanted to cry out and say he was hurt to demand justice for a wrong and the revelation of the state of things between you and mewhich of course strikes him as incongruous we must allow largely for thatcame to him as a sudden opportunity no no the girl went on with a generous ardor in her face following further the train of her argument which she appeared to find extremely attractive i know what you are going to say and i deny it i am not fanciful or sophistical or irrational and i know perfectly what i am about men are so stupid it s only women that have real discernment leave me alone and i shall do something blanche is silly yes very silly but she is not so bad as her husband accused her of being in those dreadful words which he will live to repent of she is wise enough to care for him greatly at bottom and to feel her little heart filled with rage and shame that he does nt appear to care for her if he would take her a little more seriouslyit s an immense pity he married her because she was sillyshe would be flattered by it and she would try and deserve it no no no she does nt in reality care a straw for captain lovelock i assure you i promise you she does nt a woman can tell she is in danger possibly and if her present situation as regards her husband lasts she might do something as horrid as he said but she would do it out of spitenot out of affection for the captain who must be got immediately out of the way she only keeps him to torment her husband and make gordon come back to her she would drop him forever tomorrow angela paused a moment reflecting with a kindled eye and she shall  bernard looked incredulous  how will that be miss solomon  you shall see when you come back  when i come back pray where am i going  you will leave paris for a fortnightas i promised our poor friend  bernard gave an irate laugh  my dear girl you are ridiculous your promising it was almost as childish as his asking it  to play with a child you must be childish just see the effect of this abominable passion of love which you have been crying up to me so by its operation gordon wright the most sensible man of our acquaintance is reduced to the level of infancy if you will only go away i will manage him  you certainly manage me pray where shall i go  wherever you choose i will write to you every day  that will be an inducement said bernard you know i have never received a letter from you  i write the most delightful ones angela exclaimed and she succeeded in making him promise to start that night for london  she had just done so when mrs vivian presented herself and the good lady was not a little astonished at being informed of his intention  you surely are not going to give up my daughter to oblige mr wright she observed  upon my word i feel as if i were said bernard  i will explain it dear mamma said angela it is very interesting mr wright has made a most fearful scene the state of things between him and blanche is dreadful  mrs vivian opened her clear eyes  you really speak as if you liked it  she does like itshe told gordon so said bernard i dont know what she is up to gordon has taken leave of his wits he wishes to put away his wife  to put her away  to repudiate her as the historians say  to repudiate little blanche murmured mrs vivian as if she were struck with the incongruity of the operation  i mean to keep them together said angela with a firm decision  her mother looked at her with admiration  my dear daughter i will assist you  the two ladies had such an air of mysterious competence to the task they had undertaken that it seemed to bernard that nothing was left to him but to retire into temporary exile he accordingly betook himself to london where he had social resources which would perhaps make exile endurable he found himself however little disposed to avail himself of these resources and he treated himself to no pleasures but those of memory and expectation he ached with a sense of his absence from mrs vivians deeply familiar skyparlor which seemed to him for the time the most sacred spot on earthif on earth it could be calledand he consigned to those generous postal receptacles which ornament with their brilliant hue the london streetcorners an inordinate number of the most voluminous epistles that had ever been dropped into them he took long walks alone and thought all the way of angela to whom it seemed to him that the character of ministering angel was extremely becoming she was faithful to her promise of writing to him every day and she was an angel who wieldedso at least bernard thought and he was particular about lettersa very ingenious pen of course she had only one topicthe success of her operations with regard to gordon mamma has undertaken blanche she wrote and i am devoting myself to mr w it is really very interesting she told bernard all about it in detail and he also found it interesting doubly so indeed for it must be confessed that the charming figure of the mistress of his affections attempting to heal a great social breach with her light and delicate hands divided his attention pretty equally with the distracted the distorted the almost ludicrous image of his old friend  angela wrote that gordon had come back to see her the day after his first visit and had seemed greatly troubled on learning that bernard had taken himself off it was because you insisted on it of course he said it was not from feeling the justice of it himself i told him said angela in her letter that i had made a point of it but that we certainly ought to give you a little credit for it but i could nt insist upon this for fear of sounding a wrong note and exciting afresh what i suppose he would be pleased to term his jealousy he asked me where you had gone and when i told himah how he must hate me he exclaimed there you are quite wrong i answered he feels as kindly to you asas i do he looked as if he by no means believed this but indeed he looks as if he believed nothing at all he is quite upset and demoralized he stayed half an hour and paid me his visittrying hard to please me again poor man he is in a charming state to please the fair sex but if he does nt please me he interests me more and more i make bold to say that to you you would have said it would be very awkward but strangely enough i found it very easy i suppose it is because i am so interested very likely it was awkward for him poor fellow for i can certify that he was not a whit happier at the end of his halfhour in spite of the privilege he had enjoyed he said nothing more about you and we talked of paris and new york of baden and rome imagine the situation i shall make no resistance whatever to it i shall simply let him perceive that conversing with me on these topics does not make him feel a bit more comfortable and that he must look elsewhere for a remedy i said not a word about blanche  she spoke of blanche however the next time he came again this afternoon she said in her second letter and he wore exactly the same face as yesterdaynamely a very unhappy one if i were not entirely too wise to believe his account of himself i might suppose that he was unhappy because blanche shows symptoms of not taking flight she has been with us a great dealshe has no idea what is going onand i cant honestly say that she chatters any less than usual but she is greatly interested in certain shops that she is buying out and especially in her visits to her tailor mamma has proposed to herin view of your absenceto come and stay with us and she does nt seem afraid of the idea i told her husband today that we had asked her and that we hoped he had no objection none whatever but she wont come on the contrary she says she will she will pretend to up to the last minute and then she will find a pretext for backing out decidedly you think very ill of her i said she hates me he answered looking at me strangely you say that of every one i said yesterday you said it of bernard ah for him there would be more reason he exclaimed i wont attempt to answer for bernard i went on but i will answer for blanche your idea of her hating you is a miserable delusion she cares for you more than for any one in the world you only misunderstand each other and with a little good will on both sides you can easily get out of your tangle but he would nt listen to me he stopped me short i saw i should excite him if i insisted so i dropped the subject but it is not for long he shall listen to me  later she wrote that blanche had in fact backed out and would not come to stay with them having given as an excuse that she was perpetually trying on dresses and that at mrs vivians she should be at an inconvenient distance from the temple of these sacred rites and the high priest who conducted the worship but we see her every day said angela and mamma is constantly with her she likes mamma better than me mamma listens to her a great deal and talks to her a littlei cant do either when we are alone i dont know what she saysi mean what mamma says what blanche says i know as well as if i heard it we see nothing of captain lovelock and mamma tells me she has not spoken of him for two days she thinks this is a better symptom but i am not so sure poor mr wright treats it as a great triumph that blanche should behave as he foretold he is welcome to the comfort he can get out of this for he certainly gets none from anything else the society of your correspondent is not that balm to his spirit which he appeared to expect and this in spite of the fact that i have been as gentle and kind with him as i know how to be he is very silenthe sometimes sits for ten minutes without speaking i assure you it is nt amusing sometimes he looks at me as if he were going to break out with that crazy idea to which he treated me the other day but he says nothing and then i see that he is not thinking of mehe is simply thinking of blanche the more he thinks of her the better  my dear bernard she began on another occasion i hope you are not dying of ennui etc over here things are going soso he asked me yesterday to go with him to the louvre and we walked about among the pictures for half an hour mamma thinks it a very strange sort of thing for me to be doing and though she delights of all things in a good cause she is not sure that this cause is good enough to justify the means i admit that the means are very singular and as far as the louvre is concerned they were not successful we sat and looked for a quarter of an hour at the great venus who has lost her arms and he said never a word i think he does nt know what to say before we separated he asked me if i heard from you oh yes i said every day and does he speak of me never i answered and i think he looked disappointed bernard had in fact in writing to angela scarcely mentioned his name he had not been here for two days she continued at the end of a week but last evening very latetoo late for a visitorhe came in mamma had left the drawingroom and i was sitting alone i immediately saw that we had reached a crisis i thought at first he was going to tell me that blanche had carried out his prediction but i presently saw that this was not where the shoe pinched and besides i knew that mamma was watching her too closely how can i have ever been such a dullsouled idiot he broke out as soon as he had got into the room i like to hear you say that i said because it does nt seem to me that you have been at all wise you are cleverness kindness tact in the most perfect form he went on as a veracious historian i am bound to tell you that he paid me a bushel of compliments and thanked me in the most flattering terms for my having let him bore me so for a week you have not bored me i said you have interested me yes he cried as a curious case of monomania it s a part of your kindness to say that but i know i have bored you to death and the end of it all is that you despise me you cant help despising me i despise myself i used to think that i was a man but i have given that up i am a poor creature i used to think i could take things quietly and bear them bravely but i cant if it were not for very shame i could sit here and cry to you dont mind me i said you know it is a part of our agreement that i was not to be critical our agreement he repeated vaguely i see you have forgotten it i answered but it does nt in the least matter it is not of that i wish to talk to you all the more that it has nt done you a particle of good i have been extremely nice with you for a week but you are just as unhappy now as you were at the beginning indeed i think you are rather worse heaven forgive me miss vivian i believe i am he cried heaven will easily forgive you you are on the wrong road to catch up with your happiness which has been running away from you you must take another you must travel in the same direction as blanche you must not separate yourself from your wife at the sound of blanches name he jumped up and took his usual tone he knew all about his wife and needed no information but i made him sit down again and i made him listen to me i made him listen for half an hour and at the end of the time he was interested he had all the appearance of it he sat gazing at me and at last the tears came into his eyes i believe i had a moment of eloquence i dont know what i said nor how i said it to what point it would bear examination nor how if you had been there it would seem to you as a disinterested critic to hang together but i know that after a while there were tears in my own eyes i begged him not to give up blanche i assured him that she is not so foolish as she seems that she is a very delicate little creature to handle and that in reality whatever she does she is thinking only of him he had been all goodness and kindness to her i knew that but he had not from the first been able to conceal from her that he regarded her chiefly as a pretty kitten she wished to be more than that and she took refuge in flirting simply to excite his jealousy and make him feel strongly about her he has felt strongly and he was feeling strongly now he was feeling passionatelythat was my whole contention but he had perhaps never made it plain to those rather nearsighted little mental eyes of hers and he had let her suppose something that could nt fail to rankle in her mind and torment it you have let her suppose i said that you were thinking of me and the poor girl has been jealous of me i know it but from nothing she herself has said she has said nothing she has been too proud and too considerate if you dont think that s to her honor i do she has had a chance every day for a week but she has treated me without a grain of spite i have appreciated it i have understood it and it has touched me very much it ought to touch you mr wright when she heard i was engaged to mr longueville it gave her an immense relief and yet at the same moment you were protesting and denouncing and saying those horrible things about her i know how she appearsshe likes admiration but the admiration in the world which she would most delight in just now would be yours she plays with captain lovelock as a child does with a wooden harlequin she pulls a string and he throws up his arms and legs she has about as much intention of eloping with him as a little girl might have of eloping with a pasteboard jim crow if you were to have a frank explanation with her blanche would very soon throw jim crow out of the window i very humbly entreat you to cease thinking of me i dont know what wrong you have ever done me or what kindness i have ever done you that you should feel obliged to trouble your head about me you see all i ami tell you now i am nothing in the least remarkable as for your thinking ill of me at baden i never knew it nor cared about it if it had been so you see how i should have got over it dear mr wright we might be such good friends if you would only believe me she s so pretty so charming so universally admired you said just now you had bored me but it s nothingin spite of all the compliments you have paid meto the way i have bored you if she could only know itthat i have bored you let her see for half an hour that i am out of your mindthe rest will take care of itself she might so easily have made a quarrel with me the way she has behaved to me is one of the prettiest things i have ever seen and you shall see the way i shall always behave to her dont think it necessary to say out of politeness that i have not bored you it is not in the least necessary you know perfectly well that you are disappointed in the charm of my society and i have done my best too i can honestly affirm that for some time he said nothing and then he remarked that i was very clever but he did nt see a word of sense in what i said it only proves i said that the merit of my conversation is smaller than you had taken it into your head to fancy but i have done you good all the same dont contradict me you dont know yet and it s too late for us to argue about it you will tell me tomorrow       chapter xxx  some three evenings after he received this last report of the progress of affairs in paris bernard upon whom the burden of exile sat none the more lightly as the days went on turned out of the strand into one of the theatres he had been gloomily pushing his way through the various london densitiesthe november fog the nocturnal darkness the jostling crowd he was too restless to do anything but walk and he had been saying to himself for the thousandth time that if he had been guilty of a misdemeanor in succumbing to the attractions of the admirable girl who showed to such advantage in letters of twelve pages his fault was richly expiated by these days of impatience and bereavement he gave little heed to the play his thoughts were elsewhere and while they rambled his eyes wandered round the house suddenly on the other side of it he beheld captain lovelock seated squarely in his orchestrastall but if bernard was not mistaken paying as little attention to the stage as he himself had done the captains eyes it is true were fixed upon the scene his head was bent a little his magnificent beard rippled over the expanse of his shirtfront but bernard was not slow to see that his gaze was heavy and opaque and that though he was staring at the actresses their charms were lost upon him he saw that like himself poor lovelock had matter for reflection in his manly breast and he concluded that blanches ponderous swain was also suffering from a sense of disjunction lovelock sat in the same posture all the evening and that his imagination had not projected itself into the play was proved by the fact that during the entractes he gazed with the same dull fixedness at the curtain bernard forebore to interrupt him we know that he was not at this moment socially inclined and he judged that the captain was as little so inasmuch as causes even more imperious than those which had operated in his own case must have been at the bottom of his sudden appearance in london on leaving the theatre however bernard found himself detained with the crowd in the vestibule near the door which wide open to the street was a scene of agitation and confusion it had come on to rain and the raw dampness mingled itself with the dusky uproar of the strand at last among the press of people as he was passing out our hero became aware that he had been brought into contact with lovelock who was walking just beside him at the same moment lovelock noticed himlooked at him for an instant and then looked away but he looked back again the next instant and the two men then uttered that inarticulate and inexpressive exclamation which passes for a sign of greeting among gentlemen of the anglosaxon race in their moments of more acute selfconsciousness  oh are you here said bernard i thought you were in paris  no i aint in paris lovelock answered with some dryness tired of the beastly hole  oh i see said bernard excuse me while i put up my umbrella  he put up his umbrella and from under it the next moment he saw the captain waving two fingers at him out of the front of a hansom when he returned to his hotel he found on his table a letter superscribed in gordon wrights hand this communication ran as follows  i believe you are making a fool of me in heavens name come back to paris g w  bernard hardly knew whether to regard these few words as a further declaration of war or as an overture to peace but he lost no time in complying with the summons they conveyed he started for paris the next morning and in the evening after he had removed the dust of his journey and swallowed a hasty dinner he rang at mrs vivians door this lady and her daughter gave him a welcome whichi will not say satisfied him but which at least did something toward soothing the still unhealed wounds of separation  and what is the news of gordon he presently asked  we have not seen him in three days said angela  he is cured dear bernard he must be angela has been wonderful mrs vivian declared  you should have seen mamma with blanche her daughter said smiling it was most remarkable  mrs vivian smiled too very gently  dear little blanche captain lovelock has gone to london  yes he thinks it a beastly hole ah no bernard added i have got it wrong  but it little mattered late that night on his return to his own rooms bernard sat gazing at his fire he had not begun to undress he was thinking of a good many things he was in the midst of his reflections when there came a rap at his door which the next moment was flung open gordon wright stood there looking at himwith a gaze which bernard returned for a moment before bidding him to come in gordon came in and came up to him then he held out his hand bernard took it with great satisfaction his last feeling had been that he was very weary of this ridiculous quarrel and it was an extreme relief to find it was over  it was very good of you to go to london said gordon looking at him with all the old serious honesty of his eyes  i have always tried to do what i could to oblige you bernard answered smiling  you must have cursed me over there gordon went on  i did a little as you were cursing me here it was permissible  that s over now said gordon i came to welcome you back it seemed to me i could nt lay my head on my pillow without speaking to you  i am glad to get back bernard admitted smiling still i cant deny that and i find you as i believed i should then he added seriouslyi knew angela would keep us good friends  for a moment gordon said nothing then at last  yes for that purpose it did nt matter which of us should marry her if it had been i he added she would have made you accept it  ah i dont know bernard exclaimed  i am sure of it said gordon earnestlyalmost argumentatively she s an extraordinary woman  keeping you good friends with methat s a great thing but it s nothing to her keeping you good friends with your wife  gordon looked at bernard for an instant then he fixed his eyes for some time on the fire  yes that is the greatest of all things a man should value his wife he should believe in her he has taken her and he should keep herespecially when there is a great deal of good in her i was a great fool the other day he went on i dont remember what i said it was very weak  it seemed to me feeble said bernard but it is quite within a mans rights to be a fool once in a while and you had never abused of the license  well i have done it for a lifetimefor a lifetime and gordon took up his hat he looked into the crown of it for a moment and then he fixed his eyes on bernards again but there is one thing i hope you wont mind my saying i have come back to my old impression of miss vivian  your old impression  and miss vivians accepted lover frowned a little  i mean that she s not simple she s very strange  bernards frown cleared away in a sudden almost eager smile  say at once that you dislike her that will do capitally  gordon shook his head and he too almost smiled a little  it s not true she s very wonderful and if i did dislike her i should struggle with it it would never do for me to dislike your wife  after he had gone when the night was half over bernard lying awake a while gave a laugh in the still darkness as this last sentence came back to him  on the morrow he saw blanche for he went to see gordon the latter at first was not at home but he had a quarter of an hours talk with his wife whose powers of conversation were apparently not in the smallest degree affected by anything that had occurred  i hope you enjoyed your visit to london she said did you go to buy angela a set of diamonds in bond street you did nt buy anythingyou did nt go into a shop then pray what did you go for excuse my curiosityit seems to me it s rather flattering i never know anything unless i am told i have nt any powers of observation i noticed you wentoh yes i observed that very much and i thought it very strange under the circumstances your most intimate friend arrived in paris and you choose the next day to make a little tour i dont like to see you treat my husband so he would never have done it to you and if you did nt stay for gordon you might have staid for angela i never heard of anything so monstrous as a gentleman rushing away from the object of his affection for no particular purpose that any one could discover the day after she has accepted him it was not the day after well it was too soon at any rate angela could nt in the least tell me what you had gone for she said it was for a change that was a charming reason but she was very much ashamed of youand so was i and at last we all sent captain lovelock after you to bring you back you came back without him ah so much the better i suppose he is still looking for you and as he is nt very clever that will occupy him for some time we want to occupy him we dont approve of his being so idle however for my own part i am very glad you were away i was a great deal at mrs vivians and i should nt have felt nearly so much at liberty to go if i had known i should always find you there making love to mademoiselle it would nt have seemed to me discreeti know what you are going to saythat it s the first time you ever heard of my wishing to avoid an indiscretion it s a taste i have taken up latelyfor the same reason you went to london for a change here blanche paused for an appreciable moment and then she addedwell i must say i have never seen anything so lovely as mrs vivians influence i hope mamma wont be disappointed in it this time  when bernard next saw the other two ladies he said to them that he was surprised at the way in which clever women incurred moral responsibilities  we like them said mrs vivian we delight in them  well said bernard i would nt for the world have it on my conscience to have reconciled poor gordon to mrs blanche  you are not to say a word against blanche angela declared she s a little miracle  it will be all right dear bernard mrs vivian added with soft authority  i have taken a great fancy to her the younger lady went on  bernard gave a little laugh  gordon is right in his ultimate opinion you are very strange  you may abuse me as much as you please but i will never hear a word against mrs gordon  and she never would in future though it is not recorded that bernard availed himself in any special degree of the license offered him in conjunction with this warning  blanches health within a few days had according to her own account taken a marvellous turn for the better but her husband appeared still to think it proper that they should spend the winter beneath a brilliant sun and he presently informed his friends that they had at last settled it between them that a voyage up the nile must be for a thoroughly united couple a very agreeable pastime to perform this expedition advantageously they must repair to cairo without delay and for this reason he was sure that bernard and angela would easily understand their not making a point of waiting for the wedding these happy people quite understood it their nuptials were to be celebrated with extreme simplicity if however gordon was not able to be present he in conjunction with his wife bought for angela as a bridal gift a necklace of the most beautiful pearls the rue de la paix could furnish and on his arrival at cairo while he waited for his dragoman to give the signal for starting he found time in spite of the exactions of that large correspondence which has been more than once mentioned in the course of our narrative to write bernard the longest letter he had ever addressed to him the letter reached bernard in the middle of his honeymoon
