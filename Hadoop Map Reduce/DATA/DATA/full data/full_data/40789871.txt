originally published in usa as the rolypoly pudding    illustration     illustration  once upon a time there was an old cat called mrs tabitha twitchit who was an anxious parent she used to lose her kittens continually and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief  on baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard  she caught moppet and mittens but she could not find tom  mrs tabitha went up and down all over the house mewing for tom kitten she looked in the pantry under the staircase and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets she went right upstairs and looked into the attics but she could not find him anywhere  it was an old old house full of cupboards and passages some of the walls were four feet thick and there used to be queer noises inside them as if there might be a little secret staircase certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot and things disappeared at nightespecially cheese and bacon  mrs tabitha became more and more distracted and mewed dreadfully  illustration  illustration  while their mother was searching the house moppet and mittens had got into mischief  the cupboard door was not locked so they pushed it open and came out  illustration  they went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire  they patted it with their little soft pawsshall we make dear little muffins said mittens to moppet  illustration  but just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door and moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright  illustration  mittens ran away to the dairy and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand  the visitor was a neighbour mrs ribby she had called to borrow some yeast  mrs tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfullycome in cousin ribby come in and sit ye down im in sad trouble cousin ribby said tabitha shedding tears ive lost my dear son thomas im afraid the rats have got him she wiped her eyes with her apron  hes a bad kitten cousin tabitha he made a cats cradle of my best bonnet last time i came to tea where have you looked for him  all over the house the rats are too many for me what a thing it is to have an unruly family said mrs tabitha twitchit  illustration  illustration  im not afraid of rats i will help you to find him and whip him too what is all that soot in the fender  illustration  the chimney wants sweepingoh dear me cousin ribbynow moppet and mittens are gone  they have both got out of the cupboard  illustration  ribby and tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again they poked under the beds with ribbys umbrella and they rummaged in cupboards they even fetched a candle and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics they could not find anything but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs  yes it is infested with rats said tabitha tearfully i caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen and we had them for dinner last saturday and once i saw the old father ratan enormous old rat cousin ribby i was just going to jump upon him when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole  the rats get upon my nerves cousin ribby said tabitha  illustration  ribby and tabitha searched and searched they both heard a curious rolypoly noise under the attic floor but there was nothing to be seen  illustration  they returned to the kitchen heres one of your kittens at least said ribby dragging moppet out of the flour barrel  they shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor she seemed to be in a terrible fright  oh mother mother said moppet theres been an old woman rat in the kitchen and shes stolen some of the dough  the two cats ran to look at the dough pan sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers and a lump of dough was gone  which way did she go moppet  but moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again  ribby and tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight while they went on with their search  illustration  illustration  they went into the dairy the first thing they found was mittens hiding in an empty jar  illustration  they tipped up the jar and she scrambled out  oh mother mother said mittens  illustration  oh mother mother there has been an old man rat in the dairya dreadful normous big rat mother and hes stolen a pat of butter and the rollingpin  ribby and tabitha looked at one another  a rollingpin and butter oh my poor son thomas exclaimed tabitha wringing her paws  a rollingpin said ribby did we not hear a rolypoly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest  ribby and tabitha rushed upstairs again sure enough the rolypoly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor  illustration  this is serious cousin tabitha said ribby we must send for john joiner at once with a saw                                       illustration  now this is what had been happening to tom kitten and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house where a person does not know his way and where there are enormous rats  tom kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard when he saw that his mother was going to bake he determined to hide  he looked about for a nice convenient place and he fixed upon the chimney  the fire had only just been lighted and it was not hot but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks tom kitten got upon the fender and looked up it was a big oldfashioned fireplace  the chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about so there was plenty of room for a little tom cat  illustration  illustration  he jumped right up into the fireplace balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs  illustration  tom kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney knocking down some soot into the fender  illustration  tom kitten coughed and choked with the smoke and he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below he made up his mind to climb right to the top and get out on the slates and try to catch sparrows  i cannot go back if i slipped i might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket  the chimney was a very big oldfashioned one it was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth  the chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower and the daylight shone down from the top under the slanting slates that kept out the rain  illustration  tom kitten was getting very frightened he climbed up and up and up  illustration  then he waded sideways through inches of soot he was like a little sweep himself  it was most confusing in the dark one flue seemed to lead into another  there was less smoke but tom kitten felt quite lost  he scrambled up and up but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall there were some mutton bones lying about  this seems funny said tom kitten who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney i wish i had never come and what a funny smell it is something like mouse only dreadfully strong it makes me sneeze said tom kitten  illustration  illustration  he squeezed through the hole in the wall and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light  illustration  he groped his way carefully for several yards he was at the back of the skirtingboard in the attic where there is a little mark  in the picture  illustration  all at once he fell head over heels in the dark down a hole and landed on a heap of very dirty rags  when tom kitten picked himself up and looked about himhe found himself in a place that he had never seen before although he had lived all his life in the house  it was a very small stuffy fusty room with boards and rafters and cobwebs and lath and plaster  opposite to himas far away as he could sitwas an enormous rat  what do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts said the rat chattering his teeth  illustration  please sir the chimney wants sweeping said poor tom kitten  illustration  anna maria anna maria squeaked the rat there was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter  all in a minute she rushed upon tom kitten and before he knew what was happening  his coat was pulled off and he was rolled up in a bundle and tied with string in very hard knots  anna maria did the tying the old rat watched her and took snuff when she had finished they both sat staring at him with their mouths open  anna maria said the old man rat whose name was samuel whiskersanna maria make me a kitten dumpling rolypoly pudding for my dinner  it requires dough and a pat of butter and a rollingpin said anna maria considering tom kitten with her head on one side  illustration  illustration  no said samuel whiskers make it properly anna maria with breadcrumbs  illustration  nonsense butter and dough replied anna maria  illustration  the two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away  samuel whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter he did not meet anybody  he made a second journey for the rollingpin he pushed it in front of him with his paws like a brewers man trundling a barrel  he could hear ribby and tabitha talking but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest  they did not see him  illustration  anna maria went down by way of the skirtingboard and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough  illustration  she borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws  she did not observe moppet  while tom kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic he wriggled about and tried to mew for help  but his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs and he was tied up in such very tight knots he could not make anybody hear him  except a spider which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically from a safe distance  it was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate bluebottles it did not offer to assist him  tom kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted  illustration  illustration  presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling first they smeared him with butter and then they rolled him in the dough  will not the string be very indigestible anna maria inquired samuel whiskers  illustration  anna maria said she thought that it was of no consequence but she wished that tom kitten would hold his head still as it disarranged the pastry she laid hold of his ears  illustration  tom kitten bit and spat and mewed and wriggled and the rollingpin went rolypoly roly roly poly roly the rats each held an end  his tail is sticking out you did not fetch enough dough anna maria  i fetched as much as i could carry replied anna maria  i do not thinksaid samuel whiskers pausing to take a look at tom kitteni do not think it will be a good pudding it smells sooty  anna maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up abovethe rasping noise of a saw and the noise of a little dog scratching and yelping  illustration  the rats dropped the rollingpin and listened attentively  we are discovered and interrupted anna maria let us collect our propertyand other peoplesand depart at once  i fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding  illustration  but i am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible whatever you may urge to the contrary  come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane said anna maria i have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney  illustration  so it happened that by the time john joiner had got the plank upthere was nobody under the floor except the rollingpin and tom kitten in a very dirty dumpling  illustration  but there was a strong smell of rats and john joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining and wagging his tail and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet  illustration  then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag and came downstairs  the cat family had quite recovered they invited him to stay to dinner  the dumpling had been peeled off tom kitten and made separately into a bag pudding with currants in it to hide the smuts  they had been obliged to put tom kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off  john joiner smelt the pudding but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner because he had just finished making a wheelbarrow for miss potter and she had ordered two hencoops  and when i was going to the post late in the afternooni looked up the lane from the corner and i saw mr samuel whiskers and his wife on the run with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow which looked very like mine  they were just turning in at the gate to the barn of farmer potatoes  samuel whiskers was puffing and out of breath anna maria was still arguing in shrill tones  she seemed to know her way and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage  i am sure i never gave her leave to borrow my wheelbarrow  illustration  illustration  they went into the barn and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the hay mow  illustration  after that there were no more rats for a long time at tabitha twitchits  illustration  as for farmer potatoes he has been driven nearly distracted there are rats and rats and rats in his barn they eat up the chicken food and steal the oats and bran and make holes in the meal bags  and they are all descended from mr and mrs samuel whiskerschildren and grandchildren and great great grandchildren  there is no end to them  moppet and mittens have grown up into very good ratcatchers  they go out ratcatching in the village and they find plenty of employment they charge so much a dozen and earn their living very comfortably  illustration  illustration  they hang up the rats tails in a row on the barn door to show how many they have caughtdozens and dozens of them  illustration  but tom kitten has always been afraid of a rat he never durst face anything that is bigger than  illustration  a mouse
