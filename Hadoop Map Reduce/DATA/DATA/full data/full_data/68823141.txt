68823141	glaucus or the wonders of the shore     dedication   my dear miss grenfell  i cannot forego the pleasure of dedicating this little book to you  excepting of course the opening exhortation needless enough in  your case to those who have not yet discovered the value of  natural history  accept it as a memorial of pleasant hours spent  by us already and as an earnest i trust of pleasant hours to be  spent hereafter perhaps too beyond this life in the nobler world  to come in examining together the works of our father in heaven  your grateful and faithful brotherinlaw  c kingsley  bideford  april 24 1855    glaucus or the wonders of the shore    you are going down perhaps by railway to pass your usual six  weeks at some wateringplace along the coast and as you roll along  think more than once and that not overcheerfully of what you  shall do when you get there  you are halftired halfashamed of  making one more in the ignoble army of idlers who saunter about  the cliffs and sands and quays to whom every wharf is but a  wharf of lethe by which they rot dull as the oozy weed  you  foreknow your doom by sad experience  a great deal of dressing a  lounge in the clubroom a stare out of the window with the  telescope an attempt to take a bad sketch a walk up one parade  and down another interminable reading of the silliest of novels  over which you fall asleep on a bench in the sun and probably have  your umbrella stolen a purposeless fineweather sail in a yacht  accompanied by many ineffectual attempts to catch a mackerel and  the consumption of many cigars while your boys deafen your ears  and endanger your personal safety by blazing away at innocent  gulls and willocks who go off to die slowly a sport which you  feel to be wanton and cowardly and cruel and yet cannot find in  your heart to stop because the lads have nothing else to do and  at all events it keeps them out of the billiardroom and after  all and worst of all at night a soulless rechauffe of thirdrate  london frivolity  this is the lifeindeath in which thousands  spend the golden weeks of summer and in which you confess with a  sigh that you are going to spend them  now i will not be so rude as to apply to you the old hymndistich  about one who     finds some mischief still for idle hands to do   but does it not seem to you that there must surely be many a thing  worth looking at earnestly and thinking over earnestly in a world  like this about the making of the least part whereof god has  employed ages and ages further back than wisdom can guess or  imagination picture and upholds that least part every moment by  laws and forces so complex and so wonderful that science when it  tries to fathom them can only learn how little it can learn  and  does it not seem to you that six weeks rest free from the cares  of town business and the whirlwind of town pleasure could not be  better spent than in examining those wonders a little instead of  wandering up and down like the many still wrapt up each in his  little world of vanity and selfinterest unconscious of what and  where they really are as they gaze lazily around at earth and sea  and sky and have   no speculation in those eyes which they do glare withal   why not then try to discover a few of the wonders of the shore   for wonders there are there around you at every step stranger than  ever opiumeater dreamed and yet to be seen at no greater expense  than a very little time and trouble  perhaps you smile in answer at the notion of becoming a  naturalist and yet you cannot deny that there must be a  fascination in the study of natural history though what it is is  as yet unknown to you  your daughters perhaps have been seized  with the prevailing pteridomania and are collecting and buying  ferns with wards cases wherein to keep them for which you have  to pay and wrangling over unpronounceable names of species which  seem to he different in each new fernbook that they buy till the  pteridomania seems to you somewhat of a bore  and yet you cannot  deny that they find an enjoyment in it and are more active more  cheerful more selfforgetful over it than they would have been  over novels and gossip crochet and berlinwool  at least you will  confess that the abomination of fancywork  that standing cloak  for dreamy idleness not to mention the injury which it does to  poor starving needlewomen  has all but vanished from your  drawingroom since the ladyferns and venuss hair appeared  and that you could not help yourself looking now and then at the  said venuss hair and agreeing that natures real beauties were  somewhat superior to the ghastly woollen caricatures which they had  superseded  you cannot deny i say that there is a fascination in this same  natural history  for do not you the london merchant recollect  how but last summer your douce and portly headclerk was seized by  two keepers in the act of wandering in epping forest at dead of  night with a dark lantern a jar of strange sweet compound and  innumerable pocketfuls of pillboxes and found it very difficult  to make either his captors or you believe that he was neither going  to burn wheatricks nor poison pheasants but was simply sugaring  the trees for moths as a blameless entomologist  and when in  selfjustification he took you to his house in islington and  showed you the glazed and corked drawers full of delicate insects  which had evidently cost him in the collecting the spare hours of  many busy years and many a pound too out of his small salary  were you not a little puzzled to make out what spell there could be  in those useless moths to draw out of his warm bed twenty miles  down the eastern counties railway and into the damp forest like a  deerstealer a sober whiteheaded tim linkinwater like him your  very best man of business given to the reading of scotch political  economy and gifted with peculiarly clear notions on the currency  question  it is puzzling truly  i shall be very glad if these pages help  you somewhat toward solving the puzzle  we shall agree at least that the study of natural history has  become nowadays an honourable one  a cromarty stonemason was  till lately  god rest his noble soul  the most important man in  the city of edinburgh by dint of a work on fossil fishes and the  successful investigator of the minutest animals takes place  unquestioned among men of genius and like the philosopher of old  greece is considered by virtue of his science fit company for  dukes and princes  nay the study is now more than honourable it  is what to many readers will be a far higher recommendation even  fashionable  every welleducated person is eager to know something  at least of the wonderful organic forms which surround him in every  sunbeam and every pebble and books of natural history are finding  their way more and more into drawingrooms and schoolrooms and  exciting greater thirst for a knowledge which even twenty years  ago was considered superfluous for all but the professional  student  what a change from the temper of two generations since when the  naturalist was looked on as a harmless enthusiast who went bug hunting simply because he had not spirit to follow a fox  there  are those alive who can recollect an amiable man being literally  bullied out of the new forest because he dared to make a  collection at this moment we believe in some unknown abyss of  that great avernus the british museum of fossil shells from those  very hordwell cliffs for exploring which there is now established  a society of subscribers and correspondents  they can remember  too when on the first appearance of bewicks british birds the  excellent sportsman who brought it down to the forest was asked  why on earth he had bought a book about cock sparrows and had to  justify himself again and again simply by lending the book to his  brother sportsmen to convince them that there were rather more  than a dozen sorts of birds as they then held indigenous to  hampshire  but the book perhaps which turned the tide in favour  of natural history among the higher classes at least in the south  of england was whites history of selborne  a hampshire  gentleman and sportsman whom everybody knew had taken the trouble  to write a book about the birds and the weeds in his own parish  and the everyday things which went on under his eyes and everyone  elses  and all gentlemen from the weald of kent to the vale of  blackmore shrugged their shoulders mysteriously and said poor  fellow till they opened the book itself and discovered to their  surprise that it read like any novel  and then came a burst of  confused but honest admiration from the young squires bless me  who would have thought that there were so many wonderful things to  be seen in ones own park to the old squires more morally  valuable bless me why i have seen that and that a hundred times  and never thought till now how wonderful they were  there were great excuses though of old for the contempt in which  the naturalist was held great excuses for the pitying tone of  banter with which the spectator talks of the ingenious don  saltero as no doubt the neapolitan gentleman talked of ferrante  imperato the apothecary and his museum great excuses for  voltaire when he classes the collection of butterflies among the  other bizarreries de lesprit humain  for in the last  generation the needs of the world were different  it had no time  for butterflies and fossils  while buonaparte was hovering on the  boulogne coast the pursuits and the education which were needed  were such as would raise up men to fight him so the coarse  fierce hardhanded training of our grandfathers came when it was  wanted and did the work which was required of it else we had not  been here now  let us be thankful that we have had leisure for  science and show now in war that our science has at least not  unmanned us  moreover natural history if not fifty years ago certainly a  hundred years ago was hardly worthy of men of practical common  sense  after indeed linne by his invention of generic and  specific names had made classification possible and by his own  enormous labours had shown how much could be done when once a  method was established the science has grown rapidly enough  but  before him little or nothing had been put into form definite enough  to allure those who as the many always will prefer to profit by  others discoveries than to discover for themselves and natural  history was attractive only to a few earnest seekers who found too  much trouble in disencumbering their own minds of the dreams of  bygone generations whether facts like cockatrices basilisks and  krakens the breeding of bees out of a dead ox and of geese from  barnacles or theories like those of elements the vis plastrix in  nature animal spirits and the other musty heirlooms of  aristotleism and neoplatonism to try to make a science popular  which as yet was not even a science at all  honour to them  nevertheless  honour to ray and his illustrious contemporaries in  holland and france  honour to seba and aldrovandus to pomet with  his historie of drugges even to the ingenious don saltero and  his tavernmuseum in cheyne walk  where all was chaos every man  was useful who could contribute a single spot of organized standing  ground in the shape of a fact or a specimen  but it is a question  whether natural history would have ever attained its present  honours had not geology arisen to connect every other branch of  natural history with problems as vast and awful as they are  captivating to the imagination  nay the very opposition with  which geology met was of as great benefit to the sister sciences as  to itself  for when questions belonging to the most sacred  hereditary beliefs of christendom were supposed to be affected by  the verification of a fossil shell or the proving that the  maestricht homo diluvii testis was after all a monstrous eft  it became necessary to work upon conchology botany and  comparative anatomy with a care and a reverence a caution and a  severe induction which had been never before applied to them and  thus gradually in the last halfcentury the whole choir of  cosmical sciences have acquired a soundness severity and fulness  which render them as mere intellectual exercises as valuable to a  manly mind as mathematics and metaphysics  but how very lately have they attained that firm and honourable  standing ground  it is a question whether even twenty years ago  geology as it then stood was worth troubling ones head about so  little had been really proved  and heavy and uphill was the work  even within the last fifteen years of those who stedfastly set  themselves to the task of proving and of asserting at all risks  that the maker of the coal seam and the diluvial cave could not be  a deus quidam deceptor and that the facts which the rock and the  silt revealed were sacred not to be warped or trifled with for the  sake of any cowardly and hasty notion that they contradicted his  other messages  when a few more years are past buckland and  sedgwick murchison and lyell delabêche and phillips forbes and  jamieson and the group of brave men who accompanied and followed  them will be looked back to as moral benefactors of their race  and almost as martyrs also when it is remembered how much  misunderstanding obloquy and plausible folly they had to endure  from wellmeaning fanatics like fairholme or granville penn and  the respectable mob at their heels who tried as is the fashion in  such cases to make a hollow compromise between fact and the bible  by twisting facts just enough to make them fit the fancied meaning  of the bible and the bible just enough to make it fit the fancied  meaning of the facts  but there were a few who would have no  compromise who laboured on with a noble recklessness determined  to speak the thing which they had seen and neither more nor less  sure that god could take better care than they of his own  everlasting truth  and now they have conquered  the facts which  were twenty years ago denounced as contrary to revelation are at  last accepted not merely as consonant with but as corroborative  thereof and sound practical geologists  like hugh miller in his  footprints of the creator and professor sedgwick in the  invaluable notes to his discourse on the studies of cambridge   have wielded in defence of christianity the very science which was  faithlessly and cowardly expected to subvert it  but if you seek reader rather for pleasure than for wisdom you  can find it in such studies pure and undefiled  happy truly is the naturalist  he has no time for melancholy  dreams  the earth becomes to him transparent everywhere he sees  significancies harmonies laws chains of cause and effect  endlessly interlinked which draw him out of the narrow sphere of  selfinterest and selfpleasing into a pure and wholesome region  of solemn joy and wonder  he goes up some snowdon valley to him  it is a solemn spot though unnoticed by his companions where the  stagshorn clubmoss ceases to straggle across the turf and the  tufted alpine clubmoss takes its place  for he is now in a new  world a region whose climate is eternally influenced by some fresh  law after which he vainly guesses with a sigh at his own  ignorance which renders life impossible to one species possible  to another  and it is a still more solemn thought to him that it  was not always so that aeons and ages back that rock which he  passed a thousand feet below was fringed not as now with fern and  blue bugle and white brambleflowers but perhaps with the alp rose and the gemsenkraut of mont blanc at least with alpine  saxifrages which have now retreated a thousand feet up the mountain  side and with the blue snowgentian and the canadian sedum which  have all but vanished out of the british isles  and what is it  which tells him that strange story  yon smooth and rounded surface  of rock polished remark across the strata and against the grain  and furrowed here and there as if by iron talons with long  parallel scratches  it was the crawling of a glacier which  polished that rockface the stones fallen from snowdon peak into  the halfliquid lake of ice above which ploughed those furrows   aeons and aeons ago before the time when adam first   embraced his eve in happy hour and every bird in eden burst in carol every bud in flower   those marks were there the records of the age of ice slight  truly to be effaced by the next farmer who needs to build a wall  but unmistakeable boundless in significance like crusoes one  savage footprint on the seashore and the naturalist acknowledges  the fingermark of god and wonders and worships  happy especially is the sportsman who is also a naturalist  for  as he roves in pursuit of his game over hills or up the beds of  streams where no one but a sportsman ever thinks of going he will  be certain to see things noteworthy which the mere naturalist  would never find simply because he could never guess that they  were there to be found  i do not speak merely of the rare birds  which may be shot the curious facts as to the habits of fish which  may be observed great as these pleasures are  i speak of the  scenery the weather the geological formation of the country its  vegetation and the living habits of its denizens  a sportsman  out in all weathers and often dependent for success on his  knowledge of what the sky is going to do has opportunities for  becoming a meteorologist which no one beside but a sailor  possesses and one has often longed for a scientific gamekeeper or  huntsman who by discovering a law for the mysterious and  seemingly capricious phenomena of scent might perhaps throw  light on a hundred dark passages of hygrometry  the fisherman  too  what an inexhaustible treasury of wonder lies at his feet  in the subaqueous world of the commonest mountain burn  all the  laws which mould a world are there busy if he but knew it  fattening his trout for him and making them rise to the fly by  strange electric influences at one hour rather than at another   many a good geognostic lesson too both as to the nature of a  countrys rocks and as to the laws by which strata are deposited  may an observing man learn as he wades up the bed of a trout stream not to mention the strange forms and habits of the tribes  of waterinsects  moreover no good fisherman but knows to his  sorrow that there are plenty of minutes ay hours in each days  fishing in which he would be right glad of any employment better  than trying to   call spirits from the vasty deep   who will not   come when you do call for them   what to do then  you are sitting perhaps in your coracle upon  some mountain tarn waiting for a wind and waiting in vain   keine luft an keine seite todesstille fürchterlich   as göthe has it    und der schiffer sieht bekümmert glatte fläche rings umher   you paddle to the shore on the side whence the wind ought to come  if it had any spirit in it tie the coracle to a stone light your  cigar lie down on your back upon the grass grumble and finally  fall asleep  in the meanwhile probably the breeze has come on  and there has been halfanhours lively fishing curl and you wake  just in time to see the last ripple of it sneaking off at the other  side of the lake leaving all as deadcalm as before  now how much better instead of falling asleep to have walked  quietly round the lake side and asked of your own brains and of  nature the question how did this lake come here  what does it  mean  it is a hole in the earth  true but how was the hole made  there  must have been huge forces at work to form such a chasm  probably  the mountain was actually opened from within by an earthquake and  when the strata fell together again the portion at either end of  the chasm being perhaps crushed together with greater force  remained higher than the centre and so the water lodged between  them  perhaps it was formed thus  you will at least agree that  its formation must have been a grand sight enough and one during  which a spectator would have had some difficulty in keeping his  footing  and when you learn that this convulsion probably took plus at the  bottom of an ocean hundreds of thousands of years ago you have at  least a few thoughts over which to ruminate which will make you at  once too busy to grumble and ashamed to grumble  yet after all i hardly think the lake was formed in this way and  suspect that it may have been dry for ages after it emerged from  the primeval waves and snowdonia was a palmfringed island in a  tropic sea  let us look the place over more fully  you see the lake is nearly circular on the side where we stand the  pebbly beach is not six feet above the water and slopes away  steeply into the valley behind us while before us it shelves  gradually into the lake forty yards out as you know there is not  ten feet water and then a steep bank the edge whereof we and the  big trout know well sinks suddenly to unknown depths  on the  opposite side that flattopped wall of rock towers up shoreless  into the sky seven hundred feet perpendicular the deepest water  of all we know is at its very foot  right and left two shoulders  of down slope into the lake  now turn round and look down the  gorge  remark that this pebble bank on which we stand reaches some  fifty yards downward  you see the loose stones peeping out  everywhere  we may fairly suppose that we stand on a dam of loose  stones a hundred feet deep  but why loose stones  and if so what matter and what wonder   there are rocks cropping out everywhere down the hillside  because if you will take up one of these stones and crack it  across you will see that it is not of the same stuff as those said  rocks  step into the next field and see  that rock is the common  snowdon slate which we see everywhere  the two shoulders of down  right and left are slate too you can see that at a glance  but  the stones of the pebble bank are a closegrained yellowspotted  rock  they are syenite and you may believe me or not as you  will they were once upon a time in the condition of a hasty  pudding heated to some 800 degrees of fahrenheit and in that  condition shoved their way up somewhere or other through these  slates  but where whence on earth did these syenite pebbles come   let us walk round to the cliff on the opposite side and see  it is  worth while for even if my guess be wrong there is good spinning  with a brass minnow round the angles of the rocks  now see  between the clifffoot and the sloping down is a crack  ending in a gully the nearer side is of slate and the further  side the cliff itself is  why the whole cliff is composed of  the very same stone as the pebble ridge  now my good friend how did these pebbles get three hundred yards  across the lake  hundreds of tons some of them three feet long   who carried them across  the old cymry were not likely to amuse  themselves by making such a breakwater up here in nomansland  two thousand feet above the sea  but somebody or something must  have carried them for stones do not fly nor swim either  shot out of a volcano  as you seem determined to have a prodigy  it may as well be a sufficiently huge one  well  these stones lie altogether and a volcano would have hardly  made so compact a shot not being in the habit of using eleys wire  cartridges  our next hope of a solution lies in john jones who  carried up the coracle  hail him and ask him what is on the top  of that cliff    so plainshe and pogshe and another llyn   very good  now does it not strike you that this whole cliff has a  remarkably smooth and plastered look like a hares run up an  earthbank  and do you not see that it is polished thus only over  the lake that as soon as the cliff abuts on the downs right and  left it forms pinnacles caves broken angular boulders  syenite  usually does so in our damp climate from the weathering effect  of frost and rain  why has it not done so over the lake  on that  part something giants perhaps has been scrambling up or down on a  very large scale and so rubbed off every corner which was inclined  to come away till the solid core of the rock was bared  and may  not those mysterious giants have had a hand in carrying the stones  across the lake    really i am not altogether jesting  think  a while what agent could possibly have produced either one or both  of these effects  there is but one and that if you have been an alpine traveller   much more if you have been a chamois hunter  you have seen many a  time whether you knew it or not at the very same work  ice  yes ice hrymir the frostgiant and no one else  and if  you will look at the facts you will see how ice may have done it   our friend john joness report of plains and bogs and a lake above  makes it quite possible that in the ice age glacial epoch as  the bigwordmongers call it there was above that cliff a great  neve or snowfield such as you have seen often in the alps at the  head of each glacier  over the face of this cliff a glacier has  crawled down from that neve polishing the face of the rock in its  descent  but the snow having no large and deep outlet has not  slid down in a sufficient stream to reach the vale below and form  a glacier of the first order and has therefore stopped short on  the other side of the lake as a glacier of the second order which  ends in an icecliff hanging high up on the mountain side and kept  from further progress by daily melting  if you have ever gone up  the mer de glace to the tacul you saw a magnificent specimen of  this sort on your right hand just opposite the tacul in the  glacier de trelaporte which comes down from the aiguille de  charmoz  this explains our pebbleridge  the stones which the glacier  rubbed off the cliff beneath it it carried forward slowly but  surely till they saw the light again in the face of the icecliff  and dropped out of it under the melting of the summer sun to form  a huge dam across the ravine till the ice age past a more  genial climate succeeded and neve and glacier melted away  but  the moraine of stones did not and remains to this day as the  dam which keeps up the waters of the lake  there is my explanation  if you can find a better do  but  remember always that it must include an answer to  how did the  stones get across the lake   now reader we have had no abstruse science here no long words  not even a microscope or a book  and yet we as two plain  sportsmen have gone back or been led back by fact and common  sense into the most awful and sublime depths into an epos of the  destruction and recreation of a former world  this is but a single instance i might give hundreds  this one  nevertheless may have some effect in awakening you to the  boundless world of wonders which is all around you and make you  ask yourself seriously what branch of natural history shall i  begin to investigate if it be but for a few weeks this summer  to which i answer try the wonders of the shore  there are along  every seabeach more strange things to be seen and those to be  seen easily than in any other field of observation which you will  find in these islands  and on the shore only will you have the  enjoyment of finding new species of adding your mite to the  treasures of science  for not only the english ferns but the natural history of all our  land species are now wellnigh exhausted  our home botanists and  ornithologists are spending their time now perforce in verifying  a few obscure species and bemoaning themselves like alexander  that there are no more worlds left to conquer  for the geologist  indeed and the entomologist especially in the remoter districts  much remains to be done but only at a heavy outlay of time  labour and study and the dilettante and it is for dilettanti  like myself that i principally write must be content to tread in  the tracks of greater men who have preceded him and accept at  second or third hand their foregone conclusions  but this is most unsatisfactory for in giving up discovery one  gives up one of the highest enjoyments of natural history  there  is a mysterious delight in the discovery of a new species akin to  that of seeing for the first time in their native haunts plants  or animals of which one has till then only read  some surely who  read these pages have experienced that latter delight and though  they might find it hard to define whence the pleasure arose know  well that it was a solid pleasure the memory of which they would  not give up for hard cash  some surely can recollect at their  first sight of the alpine soldanella the rhododendron or the  black orchis growing upon the edge of the eternal snow a thrill  of emotion not unmixed with awe a sense that they were as it  were brought face to face with the creatures of another world  that nature was independent of them not merely they of her that  trees were not merely made to build their houses or herbs to feed  their cattle as they looked on those wild gardens amid the wreaths  of the untrodden snow which had lifted their gay flowers to the  sun year after year since the foundation of the world taking no  heed of man and all the coil which he keeps in the valleys far  below  and even to take a simpler instance there are those who will  excuse or even approve of a writer for saying that among the  memories of a months eventful tour those which stand out as  beaconpoints those round which all the others group themselves  are the first wolftrack by the roadside in the kyllwald the  first sight of the blue and green rollerbirds walking behind the  plough like rooks in the tobaccofields of wittlich the first ball  of olivine scraped out of the volcanic slagheaps of the dreisser weiher the first pair of the lesser bustard flushed upon the downs  of the moselkopf the first sight of the cloud of white ephemerae  fluttering in the dusk like a summer snowstorm between us and the  black cliffs of the rheinstein while the broad rhine beneath  flashed bloodred in the blaze of the lightning and the fires of  the mausenthurm  a lurid acheron above which seemed to hover ten  thousand unburied ghosts and last but not least on the lip of  the vast moselkopf crater  just above the point where the weight  of the fiery lake has burst the side of the great slagcup and  rushed forth between two cliffs of clinkstone across the downs in  a clanging stream of fire damming up rivulets and blasting its  path through forests far away toward the valley of the moselle   the sight of an object for which was forgotten for the moment that  battlefield of the titans at our feet and the glorious panorama  hundsruck and taunus siebengebirge and ardennes and all the  crater peaks around and which was  smile not reader  our first  yellow foxglove  but what is even this to the delight of finding a new species  of  rescuing as it seems to you one more thought of the divine mind  from hela and the realms of the unknown unclassified  uncomprehended  as it seems to you  though in reality it only  seems so in a world wherein not a sparrow falls to the ground  unnoticed by our father who is in heaven  the truth is the pleasure of finding new species is too great it  is morally dangerous for it brings with it the temptation to look  on the thing found as your own possession all but your own  creation to pride yourself on it as if god had not known it for  ages since even to squabble jealously for the right of having it  named after you and of being recorded in the transactions of i knownotwhat society as its first discoverer as if all the  angels in heaven had not been admiring it long before you were  born or thought of  but to be forewarned is to be forearmed and i seriously counsel  you to try if you cannot find something new this summer along the  coast to which you are going  there is no reason why you should  not be so successful as a friend of mine who with a very slight  smattering of science and very desultory research obtained in one  winter from the torbay shores three entirely new species beside  several rare animals which had escaped all naturalists since the  lynxeye of colonel montagu discerned them forty years ago  and do not despise the creatures because they are minute  no doubt  we should most of us prefer discovering monstrous apes in the  tropical forests of borneo or stumbling upon herds of gigantic  ammon sheep amid the rhododendron thickets of the himalaya  but it  cannot be and he is a fool says old hesiod who knows not how  much better half is than the whole  let us be content with what  is within our reach  and doubt not that in these tiny creatures  are mysteries more than we shall ever fathom  the zoophytes and microscopic animalcules which people every shore  and every drop of water have been now raised to a rank in the  human mind more important perhaps than even those gigantic  monsters whose models fill the lake at the crystal palace  the  research which has been bestowed for the last century upon these  once unnoticed atomies has well repaid itself for from no branch  of physical science has more been learnt of the scientia  scientiarum the priceless art of learning no branch of science  has more utterly confounded a wisdom of the wise shattered to  pieces systems and theories and the idolatry of arbitrary names  and taught man to be silent while his maker speaks than this  apparent pedantry of zoophytology in which our old distinctions of  animal vegetable and mineral are trembling in the balance  seemingly ready to vanish like their fellows  the four elements  of fire earth air and water  no branch of science has helped so  much to sweep away that sensuous idolatry of mere size which  tempts man to admire and respect objects in proportion to the  number of feet or inches which they occupy in space  no branch of  science moreover has been more humbling to the boasted rapidity  and omnipotence of the human reason or has more taught those who  have eyes to see and hearts to understand how weak and wayward  staggering and slow are the steps of our fallen race rapid and  triumphant enough in that broad road of theories which leads to  intellectual destruction whensoever they tread the narrow path of  true science which leads if i may be allowed to transfer our  lords great parable from moral to intellectual matters to life  to the living and permanent knowledge of living things and of the  laws of their existence  humbling truly to one who looks back to  the summer of 1754 when good mr ellis the wise and benevolent  west indian merchant read before the royal society his paper  proving the animal nature of corals and followed it up the year  after by that essay toward a natural history of the corallines  and other like marine productions of the british coasts which  forms the groundwork of all our knowledge on the subject to this  day  the chapter in dr g johnstons british zoophytes p 407  or the excellent little resume thereof in dr landsboroughs book  on the same subject is really a saddening one as one sees how  loth were not merely dreamers like marsigli or bonnet but sound headed men like pallas and linne to give up the old sensebound  fancy that these corals were vegetables and their polypes some  sort of living flowers  yet after all there are excuses for  them  without our improved microscopes and while the sciences of  comparative anatomy and chemistry were yet infantile it was  difficult to believe what was the truth and for this simple  reason  that as usual the truth when discovered turned out far  more startling and prodigious than the dreams which men had hastily  substituted for it more strange than ovids old story that the  coral was soft under the sea and hardened by exposure to air than  marsiglis notion that the coralpolypes were its flowers than  dr parsons contemptuous denial that these complicated forms  could be the operations of little poor helpless jellylike  animals and not the work of more sure vegetation than baker the  microscopists detailed theory of their being produced by the  crystallization of the mineral salts in the seawater just as he  had seen the particles of mercury and copper in aquafortis assume  treelike forms or curious delineations of mosses and minute  shrubs on slates and stones owing to the shooting of salts  intermixed with mineral particles  one smiles at it now  yet  these men were no less sensible than we and if we know better it  is only because other men and those few and far between have  laboured amid disbelief ridicule and error needing again and  again to retrace their steps and to unlearn more than they learnt  seeming to go backwards when they were really progressing most   and now we have entered into their labours and find them as i  have just said more wondrous than all the poetic dreams of a  bonnet or a darwin  for who after all to take a few broad  instances not to enlarge on the great rootwonder of a number of  distinct individuals connected by a common life and forming a  seeming plant invariable in each species would have dreamed of  the bizarreries which these very zoophytes present in their  classification  you go down to any shore after a gale of wind and pick up a few  delicate little seaferns  you have two in your hand which  probably look to you even under a good pocket magnifier identical  or nearly so 1  but you are told to your surprise that however  like the dead horny polypidoms which you hold may be the two  species of animal which have formed them are at least as far apart  in the scale of creation as a quadruped is from a fish  you see in  some musselburgh dredgers boat the phosphorescent seapen unknown  in england a living feather of the look and consistency of a  cocks comb or the still stranger searush virgularia mirabilis  a spine a foot long with hundreds of rosy flowerets arranged in  halfrings round it from end to end and you are told that these  are the congeners of the great stony venuss fan which hangs in  seamens cottages brought home from the west indies  and ere you  have done wondering you hear that all three are congeners of the  ugly shapeless white dead mans hand which you may pick up  after a storm on any shore  you have a beautiful madrepore or  brainstone on your mantelpiece brought home from some pacific  coralreef  you are to believe that its first cousins are the  soft slimy seaanemones which you see expanding their living  flowers in every rockpool  bags of seawater without a trace of  bone or stone  you must believe it for in science as in higher  matters he who will walk surely must walk by faith and not by  sight  these are but a few of the wonders which the classification of  marine animals affords and only drawn from one class of them  though almost as common among every other family of that submarine  world whereof spenser sang    oh what an endless work have i in hand to count the seas abundant progeny whose fruitful seed far passeth those in land and also those which won in th azure sky for much more earth to tell the stars on high albe they endless seem in estimation than to recount the seas posterity so fertile be the flouds in generation so huge their numbers and so numberless their nation   but these few examples will be sufficient to account both for the  slow pace at which the knowledge of seaanimals has progressed and  for the allurement which men of the highest attainments have found  and still find in it  and when to this we add the marvels which  meet us at every step in the anatomy and the reproduction of these  creatures and in the chemical and mechanical functions which they  fulfil in the great economy of our planet we cannot wonder at  finding that books which treat of them carry with them a certain  charm of romance and feed the play of fancy and that love of the  marvellous which is inherent in man at the same time that they  lead the reader to more solemn and lofty trains of thought which  can find their full satisfaction only in selfforgetful worship  and that hymn of praise which goes up ever from land and sea as  well as from saints and martyrs and the heavenly host o all ye  works of the lord and ye too spirits and souls of the righteous  praise him and magnify him for ever  i have said that there were excuses for the old contempt of the  study of natural history  i have said too it may be hoped  enough to show that contempt to be now illfounded  but still  there are those who regard it as a mere amusement and that as a  somewhat effeminate one and think that it can at best help to  while away a leisure hour harmlessly and perhaps usefully as a  substitute for coarser sports or for the reading of novels   those however who have followed it out especially on the sea shore know better  they can tell from experience that over and  above its accessory charms of pure seabreezes and wild rambles by  cliff and loch the study itself has had a weighty moral effect  upon their hearts and spirits  there are those who can well  understand how the good and wise john ellis amid all his  philanthropic labours for the good of the west indies while he was  spending his intellect and fortune in introducing into our tropic  settlements the breadfruit the mangosteen and every plant and  seed which he hoped might be useful for medicine agriculture and  commerce could yet feel himself justified in devoting large  portions of his ever wellspent time to the fighting the battle of  the corallines against parsons and the rest and even in measuring  pens with linne the prince of naturalists  there are those who can sympathise with the gallant old scotch  officer mentioned by some writer on seaweeds who desperately  wounded in the breach at badajos and a sharer in all the toils and  triumphs of the peninsular war could in his old age show a rare  seaweed with as much triumph as his wellearned medals and talk  over a tiny sporecapsule with as much zest as the records of  sieges and battles  why not  that temper which made him a good  soldier may very well have made him a good naturalist also  the  late illustrious geologist sir roderick murchison was also an old  peninsular officer  i doubt not that with him too the  experiences of war may have helped to fit him for the studies of  peace  certainly the best naturalist as far as logical acumen  as well as earnest research is concerned whom england has ever  seen was the devonshire squire colonel george montagu of whom  the late e forbes well says that had he been educated a  physiologist and not as he was a soldier and a sportsman and  made the study of nature his aim and not his amusement his would  have been one of the greatest names in the whole range of british  science  i question nevertheless whether he would not have lost  more than he would have gained by a different training  it might  have made him a more learned systematizer but would it have  quickened in him that seeing eye of the true soldier and  sportsman which makes montagus descriptions indelible word pictures instinct with life and truth  there is no question  says e forbes after bewailing the vagueness of most naturalists  about the identity of any animal montagu described    he was a  forwardlooking philosopher he spoke of every creature as if one  exceeding like it yet different from it would be washed up by the  waves next tide  consequently his descriptions are permanent   scientific men will recognize in this the highest praise which can  be bestowed because it attributes to him the highest faculty  the  art of seeing but the study and the book would not have given  that  it is gods gift wheresoever educated  but its true school room is the camp and the ocean the prairie and the forest active  selfhelping life which can grapple with nature herself  not  merely with printedbooks about her  let no one think that this  same natural history is a pursuit fitted only for effeminate or  pedantic men  i should say rather that the qualifications  required for a perfect naturalist are as many and as lofty as were  required by old chivalrous writers for the perfect knighterrant  of the middle ages  for to sketch an ideal of which i am happy  to say our race now affords many a fair realization our perfect  naturalist should be strong in body able to haul a dredge climb a  rock turn a boulder walk all day uncertain where he shall eat or  rest ready to face sun and rain wind and frost and to eat or  drink thankfully anything however coarse or meagre he should know  how to swim for his life to pull an oar sail a boat and ride the  first horse which comes to hand and finally he should be a  thoroughly good shot and a skilful fisherman and if he go far  abroad be able on occasion to fight for his life  for his moral character he must like a knight of old be first of  all gentle and courteous ready and able to ingratiate himself with  the poor the ignorant and the savage not only because foreign  travel will be often otherwise impossible but because he knows how  much invaluable local information can be only obtained from  fishermen miners hunters and tillers of the soil  next he  should be brave and enterprising and withal patient and undaunted  not merely in travel but in investigation knowing as lord bacon  might have put it that the kingdom of nature like the kingdom of  heaven must be taken by violence and that only to those who knock  long and earnestly does the great mother open the doors of her  sanctuary  he must be of a reverent turn of mind also not rashly  discrediting any reports however vague and fragmentary giving man  credit always for some germ of truth and giving nature credit for  an inexhaustible fertility and variety which will keep him his  life long always reverent yet never superstitious wondering at  the commonest but not surprised by the most strange free from the  idols of size and sensuous loveliness able to see grandeur in the  minutest objects beauty in the most ungainly estimating each  thing not carnally as the vulgar do by its size or its  pleasantness to the senses but spiritually by the amount of  divine thought revealed to man therein holding every phenomenon  worth the noting down believing that every pebble holds a  treasure every bud a revelation making it a point of conscience  to pass over nothing through laziness or hastiness lest the vision  once offered and despised should be withdrawn and looking at every  object as if he were never to behold it again  moreover he must keep himself free from all those perturbations of  mind which not only weaken energy but darken and confuse the  inductive faculty from haste and laziness from melancholy  testiness pride and all the passions which make men see only what  they wish to see  of solemn and scrupulous reverence for truth of  the habit of mind which regards each fact and discovery not as our  own possession but as the possession of its creator independent  of us our tastes our needs or our vainglory i hardly need to  speak for it is the very essence of a natures faculty  the very  tenure of his existence  and without truthfulness science would be  as impossible now as chivalry would have been of old  and last but not least the perfect naturalist should have in him  the very essence of true chivalry namely selfdevotion the  desire to advance not himself and his own fame or wealth but  knowledge and mankind  he should have this great virtue and in  spite of many shortcomings for what man is there who liveth and  sinneth not naturalists as a class have it to a degree which  makes them stand out most honourably in the midst of a selfseeking  and mammonite generation inclined to value everything by its money  price its private utility  the spirit which gives freely because  it knows that it has received freely which communicates knowledge  without hope of reward without jealousy and rivalry to fellow students and to the world which is content to delve and toil  comparatively unknown that from its obscure and seemingly  worthless results others may derive pleasure and even build up  great fortunes and change the very face of cities and lands by  the practical use of some stray talisman which the poor student has  invented in his laboratory  this is the spirit which is abroad  among our scientific men to a greater degree than it ever has been  among any body of men for many a century past and might well be  copied by those who profess deeper purposes and a more exalted  calling than the discovery of a new zoophyte or the  classification of a moorland crag  and it is these qualities however imperfectly they may be realized  in any individual instance which make our scientific men as a  class the wholesomest and pleasantest of companions abroad and at  home the most blameless simple and cheerful in all domestic  relations men for the most part of manful heads and yet of  childlike hearts who have turned to quiet study in these late  piping times of peace an intellectual health and courage which  might have made them in more fierce and troublous times capable  of doing good service with very different instruments than the  scalpel and the microscope  i have been sketching an ideal  but one which i seriously  recommend to the consideration of all parents for though it be  impossible and absurd to wish that every young man should grow up a  naturalist by profession yet this age offers no more wholesome  training both moral and intellectual than that which is given by  instilling into the young an early taste for outdoor physical  science  the education of our children is now more than ever a  puzzling problem if by education we mean the development of the  whole humanity not merely of some arbitrarily chosen part of it   how to feed the imagination with wholesome food and teach it to  despise french novels and that sugared slough of sentimental  poetry in comparison with which the old fairytales and ballads  were manful and rational how to counteract the tendency to  shallowed and conceited sciolism engendered by hearing popular  lectures on all manner of subjects which can only be really learnt  by stern methodic study how to give habits of enterprise  patience accurate observation which the countinghouse or the  library will never bestow above all how to develop the physical  powers without engendering brutality and coarseness  are  questions becoming daily more and more puzzling while they need  daily more and more to be solved in an age of enterprise travel  and emigration like the present  for the truth must be told that  the great majority of men who are now distinguished by commercial  success have had a training the directly opposite to that which  they are giving to their sons  they are for the most part men who  have migrated from the country to the town and had in their youth  all the advantages of a sturdy and manful hillside or seaside  training men whose bodies were developed and their lungs fed on  pure breezes long before they brought to work in the city the  bodily and mental strength which they had gained by loch and moor   but it is not so with their sons  their business habits are learnt  in the countinghouse a good school doubtless as far as it goes   but one which will expand none but the lowest intellectual  faculties which will make them accurate accountants shrewd  computers and competitors but never the originators of daring  schemes men able and willing to go forth to replenish the earth  and subdue it  and in the hours of relaxation how much of their  time is thrown away for want of anything better on frivolity not  to say on secret profligacy parents know too well and often shut  their eyes in very despair to evils which they know not how to  cure  a frightful majority of our middleclass young men are  growing up effeminate empty of all knowledge but what tends  directly to the making of a fortune or rather to speak correctly  to the keeping up the fortunes which their fathers have made for  them while of the minority who are indeed thinkers and readers  how many women as well as men have we seen wearying their souls  with study undirected often misdirected craving to learn yet not  knowing how or what to learn cultivating with unwholesome energy  the head at the expense of the body and the heart catching up with  the most capricious selfwill one mania after another and tossing  it away again for some new phantom gorging the memory with facts  which no one has taught them to arrange and the reason with  problems which they have no method for solving till they fret  themselves in a chronic fever of the brain which too often urge  them on to plunge as it were to cool the inward fire into the  everrestless seas of doubt or of superstition  it is a sad  picture  there are many who may read these pages whose hearts will  tell them that it is a true one  what is wanted in these cases is  a methodic and scientific habit of mind and a class of objects on  which to exercise that habit which will fever neither the  speculative intellect nor the moral sense and those physical  science will give as nothing else can give it  moreover to revert to another point which we touched just now man  has a body as well as a mind and with the vast majority there will  be no mens sana unless there be a corpus sanum for it to inhabit   and what outdoor training to give our youths is as we have already  said more than ever puzzling  this difficulty is felt perhaps  less in scotland than in england  the scotch climate compels  hardiness the scotch bodily strength makes it easy and scotland  with her mountaintours in summer and her frozen lochs in winter  her labyrinth of seashore and above all that priceless boon  which providence has bestowed on her in the contiguity of her  great cities to the loveliest scenery and the hills where every  breeze is health affords facilities for healthy physical life  unknown to the englishman who has no arthurs seat towering above  his london no western islands sporting the ocean firths beside his  manchester  field sports with the invaluable training which they  give if not   the reason firm   yet still   the temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill   have become impossible for the greater number  and athletic  exercises are now in england at least becoming more and more  artificialized and expensive and are confined more and more  with  the honourable exception of the football games in battersea park   to our public schools and the two elder universities  all honour  meanwhile to the volunteer movement and its moral as well as its  physical effects  but it is only a comparatively few of the very  sturdiest who are likely to become effective volunteers and so  really gain the benefits of learning to be soldiers  and yet the  young man who has had no substitute for such occupations will cut  but a sorry figure in australia canada or india and if he stays  at home will spend many a pound in doctors bills which could  have been better employed elsewhere  taking a walk  as one  would take a pill or a draught  seems likely soon to become the  only form of outdoor existence possible for too many inhabitants of  the british isles  but a walk without an object unless in the  most lovely and novel of scenery is a poor exercise and as a  recreation utterly nil  i never knew two young lads go out for a  constitutional who did not if they were commonplace youths  gossip the whole way about things better left unspoken or if they  were clever ones fall on arguing and brainsbeating on politics or  metaphysics from the moment they left the door and return with  their wits even more heated and tired than they were when they set  out  i cannot help fancying that milton made a mistake in a  certain celebrated passage and that it was not sitting on a hill  apart but tramping four miles out and four miles in along a  turnpikeroad that his hapless spirits discoursed   of fate freewill foreknowledge absolute and found no end in wandering mazes lost   seriously if we wish rural walks to do our children any good we  must give them a love for rural sights an object in every walk we  must teach them  and we can teach them  to find wonder in every  insect sublimity in every hedgerow the records of past worlds in  every pebble and boundless fertility upon the barren shore and  so by teaching them to make full use of that limited sphere in  which they now are make them faithful in a few things that they  may be fit hereafter to be rulers over much  i may seem to exaggerate the advantages of such studies but the  question after all is one of experience  and i have had experience  enough and to spare that what i say is true  i have seen the young  man of fierce passions and uncontrollable daring expend healthily  that energy which threatened daily to plunge him into recklessness  if not into sin upon hunting out and collecting through rock and  bog snow and tempest every bird and egg of the neighbouring  forest  i have seen the cultivated man craving for travel and for  success in life pent up in the drudgery of london work and yet  keeping his spirit calm and perhaps his morals all the more  righteous by spending over his microscope evenings which would too  probably have gradually been wasted at the theatre  i have seen  the young london beauty amid all the excitement and temptation of  luxury and flattery with her heart pure and her mind occupied in a  boudoir full of shells and fossils flowers and seaweeds keeping  herself unspotted from the world by considering the lilies of the  field how they grow  and therefore it is that i hail with  thankfulness every fresh book of natural history as a fresh boon  to the young a fresh help to those who have to educate them  the greatest difficulty in the way of beginners is as in most  things how to learn the art of learning  they go out search  find less than they expected and give the subject up in  disappointment  it is good to begin therefore if possible by  playing the part of jackal to some practised naturalist who will  show the tyro where to look what to look for and moreover what  it is that he has found often no easy matter to discover  forty  years ago during an autumns work of deadleafsearching in the  devon woods for poor old dr turton while he was writing his book  on british landshells the present writer learnt more of the art  of observing than he would have learnt in three years desultory  hunting on his own account and he has often regretted that no  naturalist has established shorelectures at some wateringplace  like those up hill and down dale fieldlectures which in pleasant  bygone cambridge days professor sedgwick used to give to young  geologists and professor henslow to young botanists  in the meanwhile to show you something of what may be seen by  those who care to see let me take you in imagination to a shore  where i was once at home and for whose richness i can vouch and  choose our season and our day to start forth on some glorious  september or october morning to see what last nights equinoctial  gale has swept from the populous shallows of torbay and cast up  high and dry on paignton sands  torbay is a place which should be as much endeared to the  naturalist as to the patriot and to the artist  we cannot gaze on  its blue ring of water and the great limestone bluffs which bound  it to the north and south without a glow passing through our  hearts as we remember the terrible and glorious pageant which  passed by in the glorious july days of 1588 when the spanish  armada ventured slowly past berry head with elizabeths gallant  pack of devon captains for the london fleet had not yet joined  following fast in its wake and dashing into the midst of the vast  line undismayed by size and numbers while their kin and friends  stood watching and praying on the cliffs spectators of britains  salamis  the white line of houses too on the other side of the  bay is brixham famed as the landingplace of william of orange  the stone on the pierhead which marks his first footsteps on  british ground is sacred in the eyes of all true english whigs  and close by stands the castle of the settler of newfoundland sir  humphrey gilbert raleighs halfbrother most learned of all  elizabeths admirals in life most pious and heroic in death  and  as for scenery though it can boast of neither mountain peak nor  dark fiord and would seem tame enough in the eyes of a western  scot or irishman yet torbay surely has a soft beauty of its own   the rounded hills slope gently to the sea spotted with squares of  emerald grass and rich red fallow fields and parks full of  stately timber trees  long lines of tall elms run down to the very  waters edge their boughs unwarped by any blast here and there  apple orchards are bending under their loads of fruit and narrow  strips of watermeadow line the glens where the red cattle are  already lounging in richest pastures within ten yards of the rocky  pebble beach  the shore is silent now the tide far out  but six  hours hence it will be hurling columns of rosy foam high into the  sunlight and sprinkling passengers and cattle and trim gardens  which hardly know what frost and snow may be but see the flowers  of autumn meet the flowers of spring and the old year linger  smilingly to twine a garland for the new  no wonder that such a spot as torquay with its delicious italian  climate and endless variety of rich woodland flowery lawn  fantastic rockcavern and broad bright tidesand sheltered from  every wind of heaven except the soft southeast should have become  a favourite haunt not only for invalids but for naturalists   indeed it may well claim the honour of being the original home of  marine zoology and botany in england as the firth of forth under  the auspices of sir j g dalyell has been for scotland  for here  worked montagu turton and mrs griffith to whose extraordinary  powers of research english marine botany almost owes its existence  and who survived to an age long beyond the natural term of man to  see in her cheerful and honoured old age that knowledge become  popular and general which she pursued for many a year unassisted  and alone  here too the scientific succession is still  maintained by mr pengelly and mr gosse the latter of whom by his  delightful and happily wellknown books has done more for the  study of marine zoology than any other living man  torbay  moreover from the variety of its rocks aspects and seafloors  where limestones alternate with traps and traps with slates while  at the valleymouth the soft sandstones and hard conglomerates of  the new red series slope down into the tepid and shallow waves  affords an abundance and variety of animal and vegetable life  unequalled perhaps in any other part of great britain  it cannot  boast certainly of those strange deepsea forms which messrs   alder goodsir and laskey dredge among the lochs of the western  highlands and the submarine mountain glens of the zetland sea  but it has its own varieties its own everfresh novelties  and in  spite of all the research which has been lavished on its shores a  naturalist cannot i suspect work there for a winter without  discovering forms new to science or meeting with curiosities which  have escaped all observers since the lynx eye of montagu espied  them full fifty years ago  follow us then reader in imagination out of the gay watering place with its london shops and london equipages along the broad  road beneath the sunny limestone cliff tufted with golden furze  past the huge oaks and green slopes of tor abbey and past the  fantastic rocks of livermead scooped by the waves into a labyrinth  of double and triple caves like hindoo temples upborne on pillars  banded with yellow and white and red a weeks study in form and  colour and chiarooscuro for any artist and a mile or so further  along a pleasant road with landlocked glimpses of the bay to the  broad sheet of sand which lies between the village of paignton and  the sea  sands trodden a hundred times by montagu and turton  perhaps by dillwyn and gaertner and many another pioneer of  science  and once there before we look at anything else come  down straight to the sea marge for yonder lies just left by the  retiring tide a mass of life such as you will seldom see again   it is somewhat ugly perhaps at first sight for ankledeep are  spread for some ten yards long by five broad huge dirty bivalve  shells as large as the hand each with its loathly grey and black  siphons hanging out a confused mass of slimy death  let us walk  on to some cleaner heap and leave these the great lutraria  elliptica which have been lying buried by thousands in the sandy  mud each with the point of its long siphon above the surface  sucking in and driving out again the salt water on which it feeds  till last nights groundswell shifted the seabottom and drove  them up hither to perish helpless but not useless on the beach  see close by is another shell bed quite as large but comely  enough to please any eye  what a variety of forms and colours are  there amid the purple and olive wreaths of wrack and bladder weed and tangle oreweed as they call it in the south and the  delicate green ribbons of the zostera the only english flowering  plant which grows beneath the sea  what are they all  what are  the long white razors  what are the delicate greengrey scimitars   what are the tapering brown spires  what the tufts of delicate  yellow plants like squirrels tails and lobsters horns and  tamarisks and firtrees and all other finely cut animal and  vegetable forms  what are the groups of grey bladders with  something like a little bud at the tip  what are the hundreds of  little pinkstriped pears  what those tiny babies heads covered  with grey prickles instead of hair  the great red starfish which  ulster children call the bad mans hands and the great whelks  which the youth of musselburgh know as roaring buckies these we  have seen before but what oh what are the red capsicums   yes what are the red capsicums and why are they poking snapping  starting crawling tumbling wildly over each other rattling about  the huge mahogany cockles as big as a childs two fists out of  which they are protruded  mark them well for you will perhaps  never see them again  they are a mediterranean species or rather  three species left behind upon these extreme southwestern coasts  probably at the vanishing of that warmer ancient epoch which  clothed the lizard point with the cornish heath and the killarney  mountains with spanish saxifrages and other relics of a flora  whose home is now the iberian peninsula and the sunny cliffs of the  riviera  rare on every other shore even in the west it abounds  in torbay at certain or rather uncertain times to so prodigious  an amount that the dredge after five minutes scrape will  sometimes come up choked full of this great cockle only  you will  see hundreds of them in every cove for miles this day a seeming  waste of life which would be awful in our eyes were not the  divine ruler as his custom is making this destruction the means  of fresh creation by burying them in the sands as soon as washed  on shore to fertilize the strata of some future world  it is but  a shellfish truly but the great cuvier thought it remarkable  enough to devote to its anatomy elaborate descriptions and  drawings which have done more perhaps than any others to  illustrate the curious economy of the whole class of bivalve or  doubleshelled mollusca  plate ii fig 3  that red capsicum is the foot of the animal contained in the  cockleshell  by its aid it crawls leaps and burrows in the sand  where it lies drinking in the salt water through one of its  siphons and discharging it again through the other  put the shell  into a rock pool or a basin of water and you will see the siphons  clearly  the valves gape apart some threequarters of an inch   the semipellucid orange mantle fills the intermediate space   through that mantle at the end from which the foot curves the  siphons protrude two thick short tubes joined side by side their  lips fringed with pearly cirri or fringes and very beautiful they  are  the larger is always open taking in the water which is at  once the animals food and air and which flowing over the  delicate inner surface of the mantle at once oxygenates its blood  and fills its stomach with minute particles of decayed organized  matter  the smaller is shut  wait a minute and it will open  suddenly and discharge a jet of clear water which has been robbed  i suppose of its oxygen and its organic matter  but i suppose  your eyes will be rather attracted by that same scarlet and orange  foot which is being drawn in and thrust out to a length of nearly  four inches striking with its point against any opposing object  and sending the whole shell backwards with a jerk  the point you  see is sharp and tonguelike only flattened not horizontally  like a tongue but perpendicularly so as to form as it was  intended a perfect sandplough by which the animal can move at  will either above or below the surface of the sand 2  but for colour and shape to what shall we compare it  to polished  cornelian says mr gosse  i say to one of the great red  capsicums which hang drying in every coventgarden seedsmans  window  yet is either simile better than the guess of a certain  lady who entering a room wherein a couple of cardium tuberculatum  were waltzing about a plate exclaimed oh dear  i always heard  that my pretty red coral came out of a fish and here it is all  alive  c tuberculatum says mr gosse who described it from specimens  which i sent him in 1854 is far the finest species  the valves  are more globose and of a warmer colour those that i have seen are  even more spinous  such may have been the case in those i sent   but it has occurred to me now and then to dredge specimens of c  aculeatum which had escaped that rolling on the sand fatal in old  age to its delicate spines and which equalled in colour size and  perfectness the noble one figured in poor dear old dr turtons  british bivalves  besides aculeatum is a far thinner and more  delicate shell  and a third species c echinatum with curves  more graceful and continuous is to be found now and then with the  two former  in it each point instead of degenerating into a  knot as in tuberculatum or developing from delicate flat briar prickles into long straight thorns as in aculeatum is closeset  to its fellow and curved at the point transversely to the shell  the whole being thus horrid with hundreds of strong tenterhooks  making his castle impregnable to the raveners of the deep  for we  can hardly doubt that these prickles are meant as weapons of  defence without which so savoury a morsel as the mollusc within  cooked and eaten largely on some parts of our south coast would  be a staple article of food for seabeasts of prey  and it is  noteworthy first that the defensive thorns which are permanent on  the two thinner species aculeatum and echinatum disappear  altogether on the thicker one tuberculatum as old age gives him a  solid and heavy globose shell and next that he too while young  and tender and liable therefore to be bored through by whelks and  such murderous univalves does actually possess the same briar prickles which his thinner cousins keep throughout life   nevertheless prickles in all three species are as far as we can  see useless in torbay where no wolffish anarrhichas lupus or  other owner of shellcrushing jaws wanders terrible to lobster and  to cockle  originally intended as we suppose to face the strong toothed monsters of the mediterranean these foreigners have  wandered northward to shores where their armour is not now needed  and yet centuries of idleness and security have not been able to  persuade them to lay it by  this  if my explanation is the right  one  is but one more case among hundreds in which peculiarities  useful doubtless to their original possessors remain though now  useless in their descendants  just so does the tame ram inherit  the now superfluous horns of his primeval wild ancestors though he  fights now  if he fights at all  not with his horns but with his  forehead  enough of cardium tuberculatum  now for the other animals of the  heap and first for those long white razors  they as well as the  grey scimitars are solens razorfish solen siliqua and s  ensis burrowers in the sand by that foot which protrudes from one  end nimble in escaping from the torquay boys whom you will see  boring for them with a long iron screw on the sands at low tide   they are very good to eat these razorfish at least for those  who so think them and abound in millions upon all our sandy  shores 3  now for the tapering brown spires  they are turritellae snail like animals though the form of the shell is different who crawl  and browse by thousands on the beds of zostera or grass wrack  which you see thrown about on the beach and which grows naturally  in two or three fathoms water  stay  here is one which is more  than itself  on its back is mounted a cluster of barnacles  balanus porcatus of the same family as those which stud the  tiderocks in millions scratching the legs of hapless bathers  of  them i will speak presently for i may have a still more curious  member of the family to show you  but meanwhile look at the mouth  of the shell a long grey worm protrudes from it which is not the  rightful inhabitant  he is dead long since and his place has been  occupied by one sipunculus bernhardi a wight of low degree who  connects radiate with annulate forms  in plain english sea cucumbers of which we shall see some soon with seaworms  but  however low in the scale of comparative anatomy he has wit enough  to take care of himself mean ugly little worm as he seems  for  finding the mouth of the turritella too big for him he has  plastered it up with sand and mud heaven alone knows how just as  a wryneck plasters up a hole in an appletree when she intends to  build therein and has left only a round hole out of which he can  poke his proboscis  a curious thing is this proboscis when seen  through the magnifier  you perceive a ring of tentacles round the  mouth for picking up i know not what and you will perceive too  if you watch it that when he draws it in he turns mouth  tentacles and all inwards and so down into his stomach just as  if you were to turn the finger of a glove inward from the tip till  it passed into the hand and so performs every time he eats the  clowns as yet ideal feat of jumping down his own throat 4  so much have we seen on one little shell  but there is more to see  close to it  those yellow plants which i likened to squirrels  tails and lobsters horns and what not are zoophytes of different  kinds  here is sertularia argentea true squirrels tail here  s filicula as delicate as tangled threads of glass here  abietina here rosacea  the lobsters horns are antennaria  antennina and mingled with them are plumulariae always to be  distinguished from sertulariae by polypes growing on one side of  the branch and not on both  here is falcata with its roots  twisted round a seaweed  here is cristata on the same weed and  here is a piece of the beautiful myriophyllum which has been  battered in its long journey out of the deep water about the ore  rock  for all these you must consult johnsons zoophytes and  for a dozen smaller species which you would probably find tangled  among them or parasitic on the seaweed  here are flustrae or  seamats  this which smells very like verbena is flustra  coriacea pl i fig 2  that scurf on the frond of oreweed is  f lineata pl fig 1  the glass bells twined about this  sertularia are campanularia syringa pl i fig 9 and here is a  tiny plant of cellularia ciliata pl i fig 8  look at it  through the fieldglass for it is truly wonderful  each polype  cell is edged with whiplike spines and on the back of some of  them is  what is it but a live vultures head snapping and  snapping  what for  nay reader i am here to show you what can be seen  but as for  telling you what can be known much more what cannot i decline  and refer you to johnsons zoophytes wherein you will find that  several species of polypes carry these same birds heads  but  whether they be parts of the polype and of what use they are no  man living knoweth  next what are the striped pears  they are seaanemones and of a  species only lately well known sagartia viduata the snakelocked  anemone pl v fig 35  they have been washed off the loose  stones to which they usually adhere by the pitiless roll of the  groundswell however they are not so far gone but that if you  take one of them home and put it in a jar of water it will expand  into a delicate compound flower which can neither be described nor  painted of long pellucid tentacles hanging like a thin bluish  cloud over a disk of mottled brown and grey  here adhering to this large whelk is another but far larger and  coarser  it is sagartia parasitica one of our largest british  species and most singular in this that it is almost always in  torbay at least found adhering to a whelk  but never to a live  one and for this reason  the live whelk as you may see for  yourself when the tide is out burrows in the sand in chase of  hapless bivalve shells whom he bores through with his sharp tongue  always cunning fellow close to the hinge where the fish is  and then sucks out their life  now if the anemone stuck to him  it would be carried under the sand daily to its own disgust  it  prefers therefore the dead whelk inhabited by a soldier crab  pagurus bernhardi pl ii  fig 2 of which you may find a dozen  anywhere as the tide goes out and travels about at the crabs  expense sharing with him the offal which is his food  note  moreover that the soldier crab is the most hasty and blundering of  marine animals as active as a monkey and as subject to panics as  a horse wherefore the poor anemone on his back must have a hard  life of it being knocked about against rocks and shells without  warning from morn to night and night to morn  against which  danger kind nature ever maxima in minimis has provided by  fitting him with a stout leather coat which she has given i  believe to no other of his family  next for the babies heads covered with prickles instead of  hair  they are seaurchins amphidotus cordatus which burrow by  thousands in the sand  these are of that spatangoid form which  you will often find fossil in the chalk and which shepherd boys  call snakes heads  we shall soon find another sort an echinus  and have time to talk over these most strange in my eyes of all  living animals  there are a hundred more things to be talked of here  but we must  defer the examination of them till our return for it wants an hour  yet of the dead low springtide and ere we go home we will spend  a few minutes at least on the rocks at livermead where awaits us a  strongbacked quarryman with a strongbacked crowbar as is to be  hoped for he snapped one right across there yesterday falling  miserably on his back into a pool thereby and we will verify mr  gosses observation that   when once we have begun to look with curiosity on the strange  things that ordinary people pass over without notice our wonder is  continually excited by the variety of phase and often by the  uncouthness of form under which some of the meaner creatures are  presented to us  and this is very specially the case with the  inhabitants of the sea  we can scarcely poke or pry for an hour  among the rocks at lowwater mark or walk with an observant  downcast eye along the beach after a gale without finding some  oddlyfashioned suspiciouslooking being unlike any form of life  that we have seen before  the dark concealed interior of the sea  becomes thus invested with a fresh mystery its vast recesses  appear to be stored with all imaginable forms and we are tempted  to think there must be multitudes of living creatures whose very  figure and structure have never yet been suspected   o sea old sea who yet knows half of thy wonders or thy pride gosses aquarium pp 226 227   these words have more than fulfilled themselves since they were  written  those deepsea dredgings of which a detailed account  will be found in dr wyville thomsons new and most beautiful book  the depths of the sea have disclosed of late years wonders of  the deep even more strange and more multitudinous than the wonders  of the shore  the time is past when we thought ourselves bound to  believe with professor edward forbes that only some hundred  fathoms down the inhabitants of the seabottom become more and  more modified and fewer and fewer indicating our approach towards  an abyss where life is either extinguished or exhibits but a few  sparks to mark its lingering presence  neither now need we indulge in another theory which had a certain  grandeur in it and was not so absurd as it looks at first sight   namely that as dr wyville thomson puts it picturesquely enough  in going down the sea water became under the pressure gradually  heavier and heavier and that all the loose things floated at  different levels according to their specific weight  skeletons  of men anchors and shot and cannon and last of all the broad gold  pieces lost in the wreck of many a galleon off the spanish main  the whole forming a kind of false bottom to the ocean beneath  which there lay all the depth of clear still water which was  heavier than molten gold  the facts are first that water being all but incompressible is  hardly any heavier and just as liquid at the greatest depth than  at the surface and that therefore animals can move as freely in it  in deep as in shallow water and next that as the fluids inside  the body of a sea animal must be at the same pressure as that of  the water outside it the two pressures must balance each other  and the body instead of being crushed in may be unconscious that  it is living under a weight of two or three miles of water  but so  it is as we gather our curiosities at lowtide mark or haul the  dredge a mile or two out at sea we may allow our fancy to range  freely out to the westward and down over the subaqueous cliffs of  the hundredfathom line which mark the old shore of the british  isles or rather of a time when britain and ireland were part of  the continent through water a mile and two and three miles deep  into total darkness and icy cold and a pressure which in the  open air would crush any known living creature to a jelly and be  certain that we shall find the oceanfloor teeming everywhere with  multitudinous life some of it strangely like some strangely  unlike the creatures which we see along the shore  some strangely like  you may find for instance among the sea weed here and there a little black seaspider a nymphon who has  this peculiarity that possessing no body at all to speak of he  carries his needful stomach in long branches packed inside his  legs  the specimens which you will find will probably be half an  inch across the legs  an almost exactly similar nymphon has been  dredged from the depths of the arctic and antarctic oceans nearly  two feet across  you may find also a quaint little shrimp caprella clinging by its  hind claws to seaweed and waving its gaunt grotesque body to and  fro while it makes mesmeric passes with its large fore claws   one of the most ridiculous of natures many ridiculous forms   those which you will find will be some quarter of an inch in  length but in the cold area of the north atlantic their cousins  it is now found are nearly three inches long and perch in like  manner not on seaweeds for there are none so deep but on  branching sponges  these are but two instances out of many of forms which were  supposed to be peculiar to shallow shores repeating themselves at  vast depths  thus forcing on us strange questions about changes in  the distribution and depth of the ancient seas and forcing us  also to reconsider the old rules by which rocks were distinguished  as deepsea or shallowsea deposits according to the fossils found  in them  as for the new forms and even more important than them the  ancient forms supposed to have been long extinct and only known  as fossils till they were lately rediscovered alive in the nether  darkness  for them you must consult dr wyville thomsons book  and the notices of the challengers dredgings which appear from  time to time in the columns of nature for want of space forbids  my speaking of them here  but if you have no time to read the depths of the sea go at  least to the british museum or if you be a northern man to the  admirable public museum at liverpool ask to be shown the deepsea  forms and there feast your curiosity and your sense of beauty for  an hour  look at the crinoids or stalked starfishes the lilies  of living stone which swarmed in the ancient seas in vast  variety and in such numbers that whole beds of limestone are  composed of their disjointed fragments but which have vanished out  of our modern seas we know not why till a few years since  almost the only known living species was the exquisite and rare  pentacrinus asteria from deep water off the windward isles of the  west indies  of this you will see a specimen or two both at liverpool and in the  british museum and near them probably specimens of the newold  crinoids discovered of late years by professor sars mr gwyn  jeffreys dr carpenter dr wyville thomson and the other deep sea disciples of the mythic glaucus the fisherman who enamoured  of the wonders of the sea plunged into the blue abyss once and for  all and became himself the blue old man of the sea  next look at the corals and gorgonias and all the seafern tribe  of branching polypidoms and last but not least at the glass  sponges first at the euplectella or venuss flowerbasket which  lives embedded in the mud of the seas of the philippines supported  by a glass frill standing up round it like an elizabethan ruff   twenty years ago there was but one specimen in europe  now you may  buy one for a pound in any curiosity shop  i advise you to do so  and to keep  as i have seen done  under a glass case as a  delight to your eyes one of the most exquisite both for form and  texture of natural objects  then look at the hyalonemas or glassrope ocean floor by a twisted  wisp of strong flexible flint needles somewhat on the principle of  a screwpile  so strange and complicated is their structure that  naturalists for a long while could literally make neither head nor  tail of them as long as they had only japanese specimens to study  some of which the japanese dealers had of malice prepense stuck  upside down into pholasborings in stones  which was top and which  bottom which the thing itself and which special parasites growing  on it whether it was a sponge or a zoophyte or something else  at one time even whether it was natural or artificial and a make up  could not be settled even till a year or two since  but the  discovery of the same or a similar species in abundance from the  butt of the lows down to setubal on the portuguese coast where the  deepwater shark fishers call it seawhip has given our savants  specimens enough to make up their minds  that they really know  little or nothing about it and probably will never know  and do not forget lastly to ask whether at liverpool or at the  british museum for the holtenias and their congeners  hollow  sponges built up of glassy spicules and rooted in the mud by glass  hairs in some cases between two and three feet long as flexible  and graceful as tresses of snowwhite silk  look at these and a hundred kindred forms and then see how nature  is not only maxima in minimis  greatest in her least but often  pulcherrima in abditis  fairest in her most hidden works and  how the creative spirit has lavished as it were unspeakable  artistic skill on lowlyorganized creature never till now beheld  by man and buried not only in foul mud but in their own  unsightly heap of living jelly  but so it was from the beginning  and this planet was not made  for man alone  countless ages before we appeared on earth the  depths of the old chalkocean teemed with forms as beautiful and  perfect as those their lineal descendants which the dredge now  brings up from the atlantic seafloor and if there were  as my  reason tells me that there must have been  final moral causes for  their existence the only ones which we have a right to imagine are  these  that all down to the lowest rhizopod might delight  themselves however dimly in existing and that the lord might  delight himself in them  thus much  alas how little  about the wonders of the deep  we  who are no deepsea dredgers must return humbly to the wonders of  the shore  and first as after descending the gap in the seawall  we walk along the ribbed floor of hard yellow sand let me ask you  to give a sharp lookout for a round grey disc about as big as a  pennypiece peeping out on the surface  no that is not it that  little lump  open it and you will find within one of the common  little venus gallina  the closet collectors have given it some  new name now and no thanks to them  they are always changing the  names instead of studying the live animals where nature has put  them in which case they would have no time for wordinventing   nay i verify suspect that the names grow like other things at  least they get longer and longer and more jawbreaking every year   the little bivalve however finding itself left by the tide has  wisely shut up its siphons and by means of its foot and its  edges buried itself in a comfortable bath of cool wet sand till  the sea shall come back and make it safe to crawl and lounge about  on the surface smoking the seawater instead of tobacco  neither  is that depression what we seek  touch it and out poke a pair of  astonished and inquiring horns  it is a longarmed crab who saw  us coming and wisely shovelled himself into the sand by means of  his netherend  corystes cassivelaunus is his name which he is  said to have acquired from the marks on his back which are  somewhat like a human face  those long antennae says my friend  mr lloyd 6  i have not verified the fact but believe it as he  knows a great deal about crabs and i know next to nothing  form  a tube through which a current of water passes into the crabs  gills free from the surrounding sand  moreover it is only the  male who has those strangely long forearms and claws the female  contenting herself with limbs of a more moderate length  neither  is that though it might be the hole down which what we seek has  vanished  but that burrow contains one of the long white razors  which you saw cast on shore at paignton  the boys close by are  boring for them with iron rods armed with a screw and taking them  in to sell in torquay market as excellent food  but there is one  at last  a grey disc pouting up through the sand  touch it and  it is gone down quick as light  we must dig it out and  carefully for it is a delicate monster  at last after ten  minutes careful work we have brought up from a foot depth or  more  what  a thick dirty slimy worm without head or tail  form or colour  a slug has more artistic beauty about him  be it  so  at home in the aquarium where alas he will live but for a  day or two under the new irritation of light he will make a very  different figure  that is one of the rarest of british sea animals peachia hastata pl xii fig 1 which differs from most  other british actiniae in this that instead of having like them a  walking disc it has a free open lower end with which i know not  how it buries itself upright in the sand with its mouth just  above the surface  the figure on the left of the plate represents  a curious cluster of papillae which project from one side of the  mouth and are the opening of the oviduct  but his value consists  not merely in his beauty though that really is not small but  in his belonging to what the long wordmakers call an  interosculant group  a party of genera and species which  connect families scientifically far apart filling up a fresh link  in the great chain or rather the great network of zoological  classification  for here we have a simple and as it were crude  form of which if we dared to indulge in reveries we might say  that the creative mind realized it before either actiniae or  holothurians and then went on to perfect the idea contained in it  in two different directions dividing it into two different  families and making on its model by adding new organs and taking  away old ones in one direction the whole family of actiniae sea anemones and in a quite opposite one the holothuriae those  strange seacucumbers with their mouthfringe of feathery gills  of which you shall see some anon  thus there has been in the  creative mind as it gave life to new species a development of the  idea on which older species were created in order  we may fancy   that every mesh of the great net might gradually be supplied and  there should be no gaps in the perfect variety of natures forms   this development is one which we must believe to be at least  possible if we allow that a mind presides over the universe and  not a mere brute necessity a law absurd misnomer without a  lawgiver and to it strangely enough coinciding here and there  with the platonic doctrine of eternal ideas existing in the divine  mind all fresh inductive discovery seems to point more and more  let me speak freely a few words on this important matter  geology  has disproved the old popular belief that the universe was brought  into being as it now exists by a single fiat  we know that the  work has been gradual that the earth   in tracts of fluent heat began the seeming prey of cyclic storms the home of seeming random forms till at the last arose the man   and we know also that these forms seeming random as they are  have appeared according to a law which as far as we can judge has  been on the whole one of progress  lower animals though we  cannot yet say the lowest appearing first and man the highest  mammal the roof and crown of things one of the latest in the  series  we have no more right let it be observed to say that  man the highest appeared last than that the lowest appeared  first  it was probably so in both cases but there is as yet no  positive proof of either and as we know that species of animals  lower than those which already existed appeared again and again  during the various eras so it is quite possible that they may be  appearing now and may appear hereafter  and that for every  extinct dodo or moa a new species may be created to keep up the  equilibrium of the whole  this is but a surmise  but it may be  wise perhaps just now to confess boldly even to insist on its  possibility lest any should fancy from our unwillingness to allow  it that there would be ought in it if proved contrary to sound  religion  i am i must honestly confess more and more unable to perceive  anything which an orthodox christian may not hold in those  physical theories of evolution which are gaining more and more  the assent of our best zoologists and botanists  all that they ask  us to believe is that species and families and indeed the  whole of organic nature have gone through and may still be going  through some such development from a lowest germ as we know that  every living individual from the lowest zoophyte to man himself  does actually go through  they apply to the whole of the living  world past present and future the law which is undeniably at  work on each individual of it  they may be wrong or they may be  right  but what is there in such a conception contrary to any  doctrine  at least of the church of england  to say that this  cannot be true that species cannot vary because god at the  beginning created each thing according to its kind is really to  beg the question which is  does the idea of kind include  variability or not and if so how much variability  now kind  or species as we call it is defined nowhere in the bible  what  right have we to read our own definition into the word  and that  against the certain fact that some kinds do vary and that  widely  mankind for instance and the animals and plants which  he domesticates  surely that latter fact should be significant to  those who believe as i do that man was created in the likeness of  god  for if man has the power not only of making plants and  animals vary but of developing them into forms of higher beauty  and usefulness than their wild ancestors possessed why should not  the god in whose image he is made possess the same power  if the  old theological rule be true  there is nothing in man which was  not first in god sin of course excluded  then why should not  this imperfect creative faculty in man be the very guarantee that  god possesses it in perfection  such at least is the conclusion of one who studying certain  families of plants which indulge in the most fantastic varieties  of shape and size and yet through all their vagaries retain  as  do the palms the orchids the euphorbiaceae  one organ or form  of organs peculiar and highly specialized yet constant throughout  the whole of each family has been driven to the belief that each  of these three families at least has sported off from one  common ancestor  one archetypal palm one archetypal orchid one  archetypal euphorbia simple it may be in itself but endowed  with infinite possibilities of new and complex beauty to be  developed not in it but in its descendants  he has asked  himself sitting alone amid the boundless wealth of tropic forests  whether even then and there the great god might not be creating  round him slowly but surely new forms of beauty  if he chose to  do it could he not do it  that man found himself none the worse  christian for the thought  he has said  and must be allowed to  say again for he sees no reason to alter his words  in speaking  of the wonderful variety of forms in the euphorbiaceae from the  weedy english euphorbias the dogs mercuries and the box to the  pricklystemmed scarlet euphorbia of madagascar the succulent  cactuslike euphorbias of the canaries and elsewhere the galelike  phyllanthus the manyformed crotons the hemplike maniocs  physicnuts castoroils the scarlet poinsettia the little pink  and yellow dalechampia the poisonous manchineel and the gigantic  hura or sandbox tree of the west indies  all so different in  shape and size yet all alike in their most peculiar and complex  fructification and in their acrid milky juice what if all these  forms are the descendants of one original form  would that be one  whit the more wonderful than the theory that they were each and  all with the minute and often imaginary shades of difference  between certain cognate species among them created separately and  at once  but if it be so  which i cannot allow  what would the  theologian have to say save that gods works are even more  wonderful than he always believed them to be  as for the theory  being impossible  that is to be decided by men of science on  strict experimental grounds  as for us theologians who are we  that we should limit à priori the power of god  is anything too  hard for the lord asked the prophet of old and we have a right  to ask it as long as the world shall last  if it be said that  natural selection or as mr herbert spencer better defines it  the survival of the fittest is too simple a cause to produce  such fantastic variety  that again is a question to be settled  exclusively by men of science on their own grounds  we  meanwhile always knew that god works by very simple or seemingly  simple means that the universe as far as we could discern it  was one organization of the most simple means  it was wonderful   or should have been  in our eyes that a shower of rain should  make the grass grow and that the grass should become flesh and  the flesh food for the thinking brain of man  it was  or ought to  have been  more wonderful yet to us that a child should resemble  its parents or even a butterfly resemble if not always still  usually its parents likewise  ought god to appear less or more  august in our eyes if we discover that the means are even simpler  than we supposed  we held him to be almighty and allwise  are we  to reverence him less or more if we find him to be so much  mightier so much wiser than we dreamed that he can not only make  all things but  the very perfection of creative power  make all  things make themselves  we believed that his care was over all his  works that his providence worked perpetually over the universe   we were taught  some of us at least  by holy scripture that  without him not a sparrow fell to the ground and that the very  hairs of our head were all numbered that the whole history of the  universe was made up in fact of an infinite network of special  providences  if then that should be true which a great  naturalist writes it may be metaphorically said that natural  selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing throughout the world  every variation even the slightest rejecting that which is bad  preserving and adding up all that is good silently and insensibly  working whenever and wherever opportunity offers at the  improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and  inorganic conditions of life  if this i say were proved to be  true ought gods care and gods providence to seem less or more  magnificent in our eyes  of old it was said by him without whom  nothing is made  my father worketh hitherto and i work  shall  we quarrel with physical science if she gives us evidence that  those words are true  and  understand it well  the grand passage i have just quoted  need not be accused of substituting natural selection for god   in any case natural selection would be only the means or law by  which god works as he does by other natural laws  we do not  substitute gravitation for god when we say that the planets are  sustained in their orbits by the law of gravitation  the theory  about natural selection may be untrue or imperfect as may the  modern theories of the evolution and progress of organic forms   let the man of science decide that  but if true the theories seem  to me perfectly to agree with and may be perfectly explained by  the simple old belief which the bible sets before us of a living  god  not a mere past will such as the koran sets forth creating  once and for all and then leaving the universe to use goethes  simile to spin round his finger nor again an allpervading  spirit words which are mere contradictory jargon concealing  from those who utter them blank materialism  but one who works in  all things which have obeyed him to will and to do of his good  pleasure keeping his abysmal and selfperfect purpose yet  altering the methods by which that purpose is attained from aeon  to aeon ay from moment to moment for ever various yet for ever  the same  this great and yet most blessed paradox of the  changeless god who yet can say it repenteth me and behold i  work a new thing on the earth is revealed no less by nature than  by scripture the changeableness not of caprice or imperfection  but of an infinite maker and poietes drawing ever fresh forms  out of the inexhaustible treasury of his primaeval mind and yet  never throwing away a conception to which he has once given actual  birth in time and space but to compare reverently small things  and great lovingly repeating it reapplying it producing the  same effects by endlessly different methods or so delicately  modifying the method that as by the turn of a hair it shall  produce endlessly diverse effects looking back as it were ever  and anon over the great work of all the ages to retouch it and  fill up each chasm in the scheme which for some good purpose had  been left open in earlier worlds or leaving some open the forms  for instance necessary to connect the bimana and the quadrumana  to be filled up perhaps hereafter when the world needs them the  handiwork in short of a living and loving mind perfect in his  own eternity but stooping to work in time and space and there  rejoicing himself in the work of his own hands and in his eternal  sabbaths ceasing in rest ineffable that he may look on that which  he hath made and behold it is very good  i speak of course under correction for this conclusion is  emphatically matter of induction and must be verified or modified  by everfresh facts  but i meet with many a christian passage in  scientific books which seems to me to go not too far but rather  not far enough in asserting the god of the bible as saint paul  says not to have left himself without witness in nature itself  that he is the god of grace  why speak of the god of nature and  the god of grace as two antithetical terms the bible never in a  single instance makes the distinction and surely if god be as  he is the eternal and unchangeable one and if as we all confess  the universe bears the impress of his signet we have no right in  the present infantile state of science to put arbitrary limits of  our own to the revelation which he may have thought good to make of  himself in nature  nay rather let us believe that if our eyes  were opened we should fulfil the requirement of genius to see  the universal in the particular by seeing gods whole likeness  his whole glory reflected as in a mirror even in the meanest  flower and that nothing but the dulness of our own souls prevents  them from seeing day and night in all things however small or  trivial to human eclecticism the lord jesus christ himself  fulfilling his own saying my father worketh hitherto and i  work  to me it seems to sum up in a few words what i have tried to  say that such development and progress as have as yet been  actually discovered in nature bear every trace of having been  produced by successive acts of thought and will in some personal  mind which however boundlessly rich and powerful is still the  archetype of the human mind and therefore for to this i confess i  have been all along tending probably capable without violence to  its properties of becoming like the human mind incarnate  but to descend from these perhaps too daring speculations there is  another and more human source of interest about the animal who is  writhing feebly in the glass jar of salt water for he is one of  the many curiosities which have been added to our fauna by that  humble hero mr charles peach the selftaught naturalist of whom  as we walk on toward the rocks something should be said or rather  read for mr chambers in an oftenquoted passage from his  edinburgh journal which i must have the pleasure of quoting once  again has told the story better than we can tell it  but who is that little intelligentlooking man in a faded naval  uniform who is so invariably to be seen in a particular central  seat in this section  that gentle reader is perhaps one of the  most interesting men who attend the british association  he is  only a private in the mounted guard preventive service at an  obscure part of the cornwall coast with four shillings a day and  a wife and nine children most of whose education he has himself to  conduct  he never tastes the luxuries which are so common in the  middle ranks of life and even amongst a large portion of the  working classes  he has to mend with his own hands every sort of  thing that can break or wear in his house  yet mr peach is a  votary of natural history not a student of the science in books  for he cannot afford books but an investigator by sea and shore a  collector of zoophytes and echinodermata  strange creatures many  of which are as yet hardly known to man  these he collects  preserves and describes and every year does he come up to the  british association with a few novelties of this kind accompanied  by illustrative papers and drawings  thus under circumstances the  very opposite of those of such men as lord enniskillen adding in  like manner to the general stock of knowledge  on the present  occasion he is unusually elated for he has made the discovery of a  holothuria with twenty tentacula a species of the echinodermata  which professor forbes in his book on starfishes has said was  never yet observed in the british seas  it may be of small moment  to you who mayhap know nothing of holothurias  but it is a  considerable thing to the fauna of britain and a vast matter to a  poor private of the cornwall mounted guard  and accordingly he  will go home in a few days full of the glory of his exhibition  and strong anew by the kind notice taken of him by the masters of  the science to similar inquiries difficult as it may be to  prosecute them under such a complication of duties professional  and domestic  honest peach humble as is thy home and simple thy  bearing thou art an honour even to this assemblage of nobles and  doctors  nay more when we consider everything thou art an  honour to human nature itself for where is the heroism like that  of virtuous intelligent independent poverty  and such heroism is  thine  chambers edin journ nov 23 1844  mr peach has been since rewarded in part for his long labours in  the cause of science by having been removed to a more lucrative  post on the north coast of scotland the earnest it is to be  hoped of still further promotion  i mentioned just now synapta or as montagu called it chirodota   a much better name and i think very uselessly changed for  chirodota expresses the peculiarity of the beast which consists in   start not reader  twelve hands like human hands while synapta  expresses merely its power of clinging to the fingers which it  possesses in common with many other animals  it is at least a  beast worth talking about as for finding one i fear that we have  no chance of such good fortune  colonel montagu found them here some forty years ago and after  him mr alder in 1845  i found hundreds of them but only once  in 1854 after a heavy southeastern gale washed up among the great  lutrariae in a cove near goodrington but all my dredging outside  failed to procure a specimen  mr alder however and mr cocks  who find everything and will at last certainly catch midgard the  great seaserpent as thor did by baiting for him with a bulls  head have dredged them in great numbers the former at helford  in cornwall the latter on the west coast of scotland  it seems  however to be a southern monster probably a remnant like the  great cockle of the mediterranean fauna for mr macandrew finds  them plentifully in vigo bay and j müller in the adriatic off  trieste  but what is it like  conceive a very fat short earthworm not  ringed though like the earthworm but smooth and glossy dappled  with darker spots especially on one side which may be the upper  one  put round its mouth twelve little arms on each a hand with  four ragged fingers and on the back of the hand a stump of a  thumb and you have synapta digitata plates iv and v from my  drawings of the live animal  these hands it puts down to its  mouth generally in alternate pairs but how it obtains its food by  them is yet a mystery for its intestines are filled like an  earthworms with the mud in which it lives and from which it  probably extracts as does the earthworm all organic matters  you will find it stick to your fingers by the whole skin causing  if your hand be delicate a tingling sensation and if you examine  the skin under the microscope you will find the cause  the whole  skin is studded with minute glass anchors some hanging freely from  the surface but most imbedded in the skin  each of these anchors  is jointed at its root into one end of a curious cribriform plate   in plain english one pierced like a sieve which lies under the  skin and reminds one of the similar plates in the skin of the  white cucumaria which i will show you presently and both of these  we must regard as the first rudiments of an echinoderms outside  skeleton such as in the seaurchins covers the whole body of the  animal  see on echinus millaris p 89 7  somewhat similar  anchorplates from a red sea species synapta vittata may be seen  in any collection of microscopic objects  the animal when caught has a strange habit of selfdestruction  contracting its skin at two or three different points and writhing  till it snaps itself into junks as the sailors would say and  then dies  my specimens on breaking up threw out from the  wounded part long ovarian filaments whatsoever those may be  similar to those thrown out by many of the sagartian anemones  especially s parasitica  beyond this i can tell you nothing  about synapta and only ask you to consider its hands as an  instance of that fantastic play of nature which repeats in  families widely different organs of similar form though perhaps  of by no means similar use nay sometimes as in those beautiful  clearwing hawkmoths which you as they hover round the  rhododendrons mistake for bumblebees repeats the outward form of  a whole animal for no conceivable reason save her  shall we not  say honestly his  own good pleasure  but here we are at the old bank of boulders the ruins of an  antique pier which the monks of tor abbey built for their  convenience while torquay was but a knot of fishing huts within a  lonely limestone cove  to get to it though we have passed many a  hidden treasure for every ledge of these flat newredsandstone  rocks if torn up with the crowbar discloses in its cracks and  crannies nests of strange forms which shun the light of day  beautiful actiniae fill the tiny caverns with living flowers great  pholades plate x figs 3 4 bore by hundreds in the softer  strata and wherever a thin layer of muddy sand intervenes between  two slabs long annelid worms of quaintest forms and colours have  their horizontal burrows among those of that curious and rare  radiate animal the spoonworm 8 an eyeless bag about an inch  long half bluish grey half pink with a strange scalloped and  wrinkled proboscis of saffron colour which serves in some  mysterious way soft as it is to collect food and clear its dark  passage through the rock  see at the extreme lowwater mark where the broad olive fronds of  the laminariae like fanpalms droop and wave gracefully in the  retiring ripples a great boulder which will serve our purpose   its upper side is a whole forest of seaweeds large and small and  that forest if you examined it closely as full of inhabitants as  those of the amazon or the gambia  to beat that dense cover  would be an endless task  but on the under side where no sea weeds grow we shall find full in view enough to occupy us till the  tide returns  for the slab see is such a one as seabeasts love  to haunt  its weedcovered surface shows that the surge has not  shifted it for years past  it lies on other boulders clear of sand  and mud so that there is no fear of dead seaweed having lodged  and decayed under it destructive to animal life  we can see dark  crannies and caves beneath yet too narrow to allow the surge to  wash in and keep the surface clean  it will be a fine menagerie  of nereus if we can but turn it  now the crowbar is well under it heave and with a will and so  after five minutes tugging propping slipping and splashing the  boulder gradually tips over and we rush greedily upon the spoil  a muddy dripping surface it is truly full of cracks and hollows  uninviting enough at first sight  let us look it round leisurely  to see if there are not materials enough there for an hours  lecture  the first object which strikes the eye is probably a group of milk white slugs from two to six inches long cuddling snugly together  plate ix fig 1  you try to pull them off and find that they  give you some trouble such a firm hold have the delicate white  sucking arms which fringe each of their five edges  you see at  the head nothing but a yellow dimple for eating and breathing are  suspended till the return of tide but once settled in a jar of  saltwater each will protrude a large chocolatecoloured head  tipped with a ring of ten feathery gills looking very much like a  head of curled kale but of the loveliest white and primrose in  the centre whereof lies perdu a mouth with sturdy teeth  if indeed  they as well as the whole inside of the beast have not been  lately got rid of and what you see be not a mere bag without  intestine or other organ  but only for the time being  for hear  it wornout epicures and old indians who bemoan your livers this  little holothuria knows a secret which if he could tell it you  would be glad to buy of him for thousands sterling  to him blue  pill and muriatic acid are superfluous and travels to german  brunnen a waste of time  happy holothuria who possesses really  the secret of everlasting youth which ancient fable bestowed on  the serpent and the eagle  for when his teeth ache or his  digestive organs trouble him all he has to do is just to cast up  forthwith his entire inside and faisant maigre for a month or so  grow a fresh set and then eat away as merrily as ever  his name  if you wish to consult so triumphant a hygeist is cucumaria  pentactes  but he has many a stout cousin round the scotch coast  who knows the antibilious panacea as well as he and submits among  the northern fishermen to the rather rude and undeserved name of  seapuddings one of which grows in shetland to the enormous length  of three feet rivalling there his huge congeners who display  their exquisite plumes on every tropic coral reef  9  next what are those bright little buds like salmoncoloured  banksia roses half expanded sitting closely on the stone  touch  them the soft part is retracted and the orange flower of flesh is  transformed into a pale pink flower of stone  that is the  madrepore caryophyllia smithii plate v fig 2 one of our south  coast rarities  and see on the lip of the last one which we have  carefully scooped off with the chisel two little pink towers of  stone delicately striated drop them into this small bottle of  seawater and from the top of each tower issues every halfsecond   what shall we call it  a hand or a net of finest hairs  clutching at something invisible to our grosser sense  that is the  pyrgoma parasitic only as far as we know on the lip of this same  rare madrepore a little cirrhipod the cousin of those tiny  barnacles which roughen every rock a larger sort whereof i showed  you on the turritella and of those larger ones also who burrow in  the thick hide of the whale and borne about upon his mighty  sides throw out their tiny casting nets as this pyrgoma does to  catch every passing animalcule and sweep them into the jaws  concealed within its shell  and this creature rooted to one spot  through life and death was in its infancy a free swimming animal  hovering from place to place upon delicate ciliae till having  sown its wild oats it settled down in life built itself a good  stone house and became a landowner or rather a glebae adscriptus  for ever and a day  mysterious destiny  yet not so mysterious as  that of the free medusoid young of every polype and coral which  ends as a rooted tree of horn or stone and seems to the eye of  sensuous fancy to have literally degenerated into a vegetable  of  them you must read for yourself in mr gosses book in the  meanwhile he shall tell you something of the beautiful madrepores  themselves  his description 10 by far the best yet published  should be read in full we must content ourselves with extracts  doubtless you are familiar with the stony skeleton of our  madrepore as it appears in museums  it consists of a number of  thin calcareous plates standing up edgewise and arranged in a  radiating manner round a low centre  a little below the margin  their individuality is lost in the deposition of rough calcareous  matter    the general form is more or less cylindrical  commonly wider at top than just above the bottom    this is but  the skeleton and though it is a very pretty object those who are  acquainted with it alone can form but a very poor idea of the  beauty of the living animal    let it after being torn from  the rock recover its equanimity then you will see a pellucid  gelatinous flesh emerging from between the plates and little  exquisitely formed and coloured tentacula with white clubbed tips  fringing the sides of the cupshaped cavity in the centre across  which stretches the oval disc marked with a star of some rich and  brilliant colour surrounding the central mouth a slit with white  crenated lips like the orifice of one of those elegant cowry  shells which we put upon our mantelpieces  the mouth is always  more or less prominent and can be protruded and expanded to an  astonishing extent  the space surrounding the lips is commonly  fawn colour or rich chestnutbrown the star or vandyked circle  rich red pale vermilion and sometimes the most brilliant emerald  green as brilliant as the gorget of a hummingbird  and what does this exquisitely delicate creature do with its pretty  mouth  alas for fact  it sips no honeydew or fruits from  paradise  i put a minute spider as large as a pins head into  the water pushing it down to the coral  the instant it touched  the tip of a tentacle it adhered and was drawn in with the  surrounding tentacles between the plates  with a lens i saw the  small mouth slowly open and move over to that side the lips  gaping unsymmetrically while with a movement as imperceptible as  that of the hour hand of a watch the tiny prey was carried along  between the plates to the corner of the mouth  the mouth however  moved most and at length reached the edges of the plates  gradually closed upon the insect and then returned to its usual  place in the centre  mr gosse next tried the fairy of the walking mouth with a house fly who escaped only by hard fighting and at last the gentle  creature after swallowing and disgorging various large pieces of  shellfish found viands to its taste in the lean of cooked meat  and portions of earthworms filling up the intervals by a  perpetual dessert of microscopic animalcules whirled into that  lovely avernus its mouth by the currents of the delicate ciliae  which clothe every tentacle  the fact is that the madrepore like  those glorious seaanemones whose living flowers stud every pool  is by profession a scavenger and a feeder on carrion and being as  useful as he is beautiful really comes under the rule which he  seems at first to break that handsome is who handsome does  another species of madrepore 11 was discovered on our devon coast  by mr gosse more gaudy though not so delicate in hue as our  caryophyllia  mr gosses locality for this and numberless other  curiosities is ilfracombe on the north coast of devon  my  specimens came from lundy island in the mouth of the bristol  channel or more properly from that curious rat island to the  south of it where still lingers the black longtailed english rat  exterminated everywhere else by his sturdier brown cousin of the  hanoverian dynasty  look now at these tiny saucers of the thinnest ivory the largest  not bigger than a silver threepence which contain in their centres  a milkwhite crust of stone pierced as you see under the  magnifier into a thousand cells each with its living architect  within  here are two kinds  in one the tubular cells radiate from  the centre giving it the appearance of a tiny compound flower  daisy or groundsel in the other they are crossed with waving  grooves giving the whole a peculiar fretted look even more  beautiful than that of the former species  they are tubulipora  patina and tubulipora hispida  and stay  break off that tiny  rough red wart and look at its cells also under the magnifier  it  is cellepora pumicosa and now with the madrepore you hold in  your hand the principal at least the commonest british types of  those famed coral insects which in the tropics are the architects  of continents and the conquerors of the ocean surge  all the  world since the publication of darwins delightful voyage of the  beagle and of williams missionary enterprises knows or  ought to know enough about them  for those who do not there are  a few pages in the beginning of dr landsboroughs british  zoophytes well worth perusal  there are a few other true cellepore corals round the coast  the  largest of all cervicornis may be dredged a few miles outside on  the exmouth bank with a few more tubulipores  but all tiny  things the lingering and as it were expiring remnants of that  great coralworld which through the abysmal depths of past ages  formed here in britain our limestone hills storing up for  generations yet unborn the materials of agriculture and  architecture  inexpressibly interesting even solemn to those who  will think is the sight of those puny parasites which as it were  connect the ages and the aeons  yet not so solemn and full of  meaning as that tiny relic of an older world the little pear shaped turbinolia cousin of the madrepores and seaanemones  found fossil in the suffolk crag and yet still lingering here and  there alive in the deep water of scilly and the west coast of  ireland possessor of a pedigree which dates perhaps from ages  before the day in which it was said let us make man in our image  after our likeness  to think that the whole human race its joys  and its sorrows its virtues and its sins its aspirations and its  failures has been rushing out of eternity and into eternity again  as arjoon in the bhagavad gita beheld the race of men issuing from  kreeshnas flaming mouth and swallowed up in it again as the  crowds of insects swarm into the flame as the homeless streams  leap down into the ocean bed in an everlasting heartpulse whose  blood is living souls  and all that while and ages before that  mystery began that humble coral unnoticed on the dark seafloor  has been continuing as it was at the beginning and fulfilling  the law which cannot be broken while races and dynasties and  generations have been   playing such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep   yes it is this vision of the awful permanence and perfection of  the natural world beside the wild flux and confusion the mad  struggles the despairing cries of the world of spirits which man  has defiled by sin which would at moments crush the naturalists  heart and make his brain swim with terror were it not that he can  see by faith through all the abysses and the ages not merely    hands from out the darkness shaping man   but above them a living loving countenance human and yet divine  and can hear a voice which said at first let us make man in our  image and hath said since then and says for ever and for ever  lo i am with you alway even to the end of the world  but now friend who listenest perhaps instructed and at least  amused  if as professor harvey well says the simpler animals  represent as in a glass the scattered organs of the higher races  which of your organs is represented by that scad mans head  which the devon children more gracefully yet with less adherence  to plain likeness call mermaids head 12 which we picked up  just now on paignton sands  or which again by its more beautiful  little congener 13 five or six of which are adhering tightly to  the slab before us a ball covered with delicate spines of lilac  and green and stuck over cunning fellows with stripes of dead  seaweed to serve as improvised parasols  one cannot say that in  him we have the first type of the human skull  for the  resemblance quaint as it is is only sensuous and accidental in  the logical use of that term and not homological ie a lower  manifestation of the same idea  yet how is one tempted to say  that this was natures first and lowest attempt at that use of  hollow globes of mineral for protecting soft fleshy parts which  she afterwards developed to such perfection in the skulls of  vertebrate animals  but even that conceit pretty as it sounds  will not hold good for though radiates similar to these were among  the earliest tenants of the abyss yet as early as their time  perhaps even before them had been conceived and actualized in the  sharks and in mr hugh millers pets the old red sandstone fishes  that very true vertebrate skull and brain of which this is a mere  mockery 14  here the whole animal with his extraordinary  feeding mill for neither teeth nor jaws is a fit word for it is  enclosed within an evergrowing limestone castle to the  architecture of which the eddystone and the crystal palace are  bungling heaps without arms or legs eyes or ears and yet  capable in spite of his perpetual imprisonment of walking  feeding and breeding doubt it not merrily enough  but this  result has been attained at the expense of a complication of  structure which has baffled all human analysis and research into  final causes  as much concerning this most miraculous of families  as is needful to be known and ten times more than you are likely  to understand may be read in harveys seaside book pp 142 148  pages from which you will probably arise with a sense of the  infinity and complexity of nature even in what we are pleased to  call her lower forms and the simplest and as it were easiest  forms of life  conceive a crystal palace for mere difference in  size as both the naturalist and the metaphysician know has  nothing to do with the wonder whereof each separate joist  girder and pane grows continually without altering the shape of  the whole and you have conceived only one of the miracles embodied  in that little seaegg which the creator has as it were to  justify to man his own immutability furnished with a shell capable  of enduring fossil for countless ages that we may confess him to  have been as great when first his spirit brooded on the deep as he  is now and will be through all worlds to come  but we must make haste for the tide is rising fast and our stone  will be restored to its eleven hours bath long before we have  talked over half the wonders which it holds  look though ere you  retreat at one or two more  what is that little brown thing whom you have just taken off the  rock to which it adhered so stoutly by his suckingfoot  a limpet   not at all  he is of quite a different family and structure but  on the whole a limpetlike shell would suit him well enough so he  had one given him  nevertheless owing to certain anatomical  peculiarities he needed one aperture more than a limpet so one  if you will examine has been given him at the top of his shell  15  this is one instance among a thousand of the way in which a  scientific knowledge of objects must not obey but run counter to  the impressions of sense and of a custom in nature which makes  this caution so necessary namely the repetition of the same form  slightly modified in totally different animals sometimes as if to  avoid waste for why should not the same conception be used in two  different cases if it will suit in both and sometimes more  marvellous by far when an organ fully developed and useful in one  species appears in a cognate species but feeble useless and as  it were abortive and gradually in species still farther removed  dies out altogether placed there it would seem at first sight  merely to keep up the family likeness  i am half jesting that  cannot be the only reason perhaps not the reason at all but the  fact is one of the most curious and notorious also in comparative  anatomy  look again at those seaslugs  one some three inches long of a  bright lemonyellow clouded with purple another of a dingy grey  16 another exquisite little creature of a pearly french white  17 furred all over the back with what seem arms but are really  gills of ringed white and grey and black  put that yellow one  into water and from his head above the eyes arise two serrated  horns while from the afterpart of his back springs a circular  princeofwalessfeather of gills  they are almost exactly like  those which we saw just now in the white cucumaria  yes here is  another instance of the same custom of repetition  the cucumaria  is a low radiate animal  the seaslug a far higher mollusc and  every organ within him is formed on a different type as indeed are  those seemingly identical gills if you come to examine them under  the microscope having to oxygenate fluids of a very different and  more complicated kind and moreover the cucumarias gills were  put round his mouth the doriss feathers round the other  extremity that grey eoliss again are simple clubs scattered  over his whole back and in each of his nudibranch congeners these  same gills take some new and fantastic form in melibaea those  clubs are covered with warts in scyllaea with tufted bouquets in  the beautiful antiopa they are transparent bags and in many other  english species they take every conceivable form of leaf tree  flower and branch bedecked with every colour of the rainbow as  you may see them depicted in messrs alder and hancocks unrivalled  monograph on the nudibranch mollusca  and now worshipper of final causes and the mere useful in nature  answer but one question  why this prodigal variety  all these  nudibranchs live in much the same way  why would not the same  mould have done for them all  and why again for we must push  the argument a little further why have not all the butterflies  at least all who feed on the same plant the same markings  of all  unfathomable triumphs of design we can only express ourselves  thus for honest induction as paley so well teaches allows us to  ascribe such results only to the design of some personal will and  mind what surpasses that by which the scales on a butterflys  wing are arranged to produce a certain pattern of artistic beauty  beyond all painters skill  what a waste of power on any  utilitarian theory of nature  and once more why are those strange  microscopic atomies the diatomaceae and infusoria which fill  every stagnant pool which fringe every branch of seaweed which  form banks hundreds of miles long on the arctic seafloor and the  strata of whole moorlands which pervade in millions the mass of  every iceberg and float aloft in countless swarms amid the clouds  of the volcanic dust  why are their tiny shells of flint as  fantastically various in their quaint mathematical symmetry as  they are countless beyond the wildest dreams of the poet  mystery  inexplicable on the conceited notion which making man forsooth the  centre of the universe dares to believe that this variety of forms  has existed for countless ages in abysmal seadepths and untrodden  forests only that some few individuals of the western races might  in these latter days at last discover and admire a corner here and  there of the boundless realms of beauty  inexplicable truly if  man be the centre and the object of their existence explicable  enough to him who believes that god has created all things for  himself and rejoices in his own handiwork and that the material  universe is as the wise man says a platform whereon his eternal  spirit sports and makes melody  of all the blessings which the  study of nature brings to the patient observer let none perhaps  be classed higher than this  that the further he enters into those  fairy gardens of life and birth which spenser saw and described in  his great poem the more he learns the awful and yet most  comfortable truth that they do not belong to him but to one  greater wiser lovelier than he and as he stands silent with  awe amid the pomp of natures everbusy rest hears as of old  the word of the lord god walking among the trees of the garden in  the cool of the day  one sight more and we have done  i had something to say had time  permitted on the ludicrous element which appears here and there in  nature  there are animals like monkeys and crabs which seem made  to be laughed at by those at least who possess that most  indefinable of faculties the sense of the ridiculous  as long as  man possesses muscles especially formed to enable him to laugh we  have no right to suppose with some that laughter is an accident  of our fallen nature or to find with others the primary cause of  the ridiculous in the perception of unfitness or disharmony  and  yet we shrink whether rightly or wrongly we can hardly tell from  attributing a sense of the ludicrous to the creator of these forms   it may be a weakness on my part at least i will hope it is a  reverent one  but till we can find something corresponding to what  we conceive of the divine mind in any class of phenomena it is  perhaps better not to talk about them at all but observe a stoic  epoche waiting for more light and yet confessing that our own  laughter is uncontrollable and therefore we hope not unworthy of  us at many a strange creature and strange doing which we meet  from the highest ape to the lowest polype  but in the meanwhile there are animals in which results so  strange fantastic even seemingly horrible are produced that  fallen man may be pardoned if he shrinks from them in disgust   that at least must be a consequence of our own wrong state for  everything is beautiful and perfect in its place  it may be  answered yes in its place but its place is not yours  you had  no business to look at it and must pay the penalty for  intermeddling  i doubt that answer for surely if man have  liberty to do anything he has liberty to search out freely his  heavenly fathers works and yet every one seems to have his  antipathic animal and i know one bred from his childhood to  zoology by land and sea and bold in asserting and honest in  feeling that all without exception is beautiful who yet cannot  after handling and petting and admiring all day long every uncouth  and venomous beast avoid a paroxysm of horror at the sight of the  common housespider  at all events whether we were intruding or  not in turning this stone we must pay a fine for having done so  for there lies an animal as foul and monstrous to the eye as  hydra gorgon or chimaera dire and yet so wondrously fitted to  its work that we must needs endure for our own instruction to  handle and to look at it  its name if you wish for it is  nemertes probably n borlasii 18 a worm of very low  organization though well fitted enough for its own work  you see  it  that black shiny knotted lump among the gravel small enough  to be taken up in a dessert spoon  look now as it is raised and  its coils drawn out  three feet  six  nine at least  with a  capability of seemingly endless expansion a slimy tape of living  caoutchouc some eighth of an inch in diameter a dark chocolate black with paler longitudinal lines  is it alive  it hangs  helpless and motionless a mere velvet string across the hand  ask  the neighbouring annelids and the fry of the rock fishes or put it  into a vase at home and see  it lies motionless trailing itself  among the gravel you cannot tell where it begins or ends it may  be a dead strip of seaweed himanthalia lorea perhaps or chorda  filum or even a tarred string  so thinks the little fish who  plays over and over it till he touches at last what is too surely  a head  in an instant a bellshaped sucker mouth has fastened to  his side  in another instant from one lip a concave double  proboscis just like a tapirs another instance of the repetition  of forms has clasped him like a finger and now begins the  struggle  but in vain  he is being played with such a fishing line as the skill of a wilson or a stoddart never could invent a  living line with elasticity beyond that of the most delicate fly rod which follows every lunge shortening and lengthening  slipping and twining round every piece of gravel and stem of sea weed with a tiring drag such as no highland wrist or step could  ever bring to bear on salmon or on trout  the victim is tired now  and slowly and yet dexterously his blind assailant is feeling and  shifting along his side till he reaches one end of him and then  the black lips expand and slowly and surely the curved finger  begins packing him endforemost down into the gullet where he  sinks inch by inch till the swelling which marks his place is  lost among the coils and he is probably macerated to a pulp long  before he has reached the opposite extremity of his cave of doom   once safe down the black murderer slowly contracts again into a  knotted heap and lies like a boa with a stag inside him  motionless and blest 19  there we must come away now for the tide is over our ankles but  touch before you go one of those little red mouths which peep out  of the stone  a tiny jet of water shoots up almost into your face  the bivalve 20 who has burrowed into the limestone knot the  softest part of the stone to his jaws though the hardest to your  chisel is scandalized at having the soft mouths of his siphons so  rudely touched and taking your finger for some bothering annelid  who wants to nibble him is defending himself shooting you as  naturalists do hummingbirds with water  let him rest in peace  it will cost you ten minutes hard work and much dirt to extract  him but if you are fond of shells secure one or two of those  beautiful pink and strawcoloured scallops hinnites pusio plate  x fig 1 who have gradually incorporated the layers of their  lower valve with the roughnesses of the stone destroying thereby  the beautiful form which belongs to their race but not their  delicate colour  there are a few more bivalves too adhering to  the stone and those rare ones and two or three delicate mangeliae  and nassae 21 are trailing their graceful spires up and down in  search of food  that little bright red and yellow pea too touch  it  the brilliant coloured cloak is withdrawn and instead you  have a beautiful ribbed pink cowry 22 our only european  representative of that grand tropical family  cast one wondering  glance too at the forest of zoophytes and corals lepraliae and  flustrae and those quaint blue stars set in brown jelly which  are no zoophytes but respectable molluscs each with his well formed mouth and intestines 23 but combined in a peculiar form  of communism of which all one can say is that one hopes they like  it and that at all events they agree better than the heroes and  heroines of mr hawthornes blithedale romance  now away and as a specimen of the fertility of the waterworld  look at this rough list of species 24 the greater part of which  are on this very stone and all of which you might obtain in an  hour would the rude tide wait for zoologists  and remember that  the number of individuals of each species of polype must be counted  by tens of thousands and also that by searching the forest of  seaweeds which covers the upper surface we should probably obtain  some twenty minute species more  a goodly catalogue this surely of the inhabitants of three or  four large stones and yet how small a specimen of the  multitudinous nations of the sea  from the bare rocks above highwater mark down to abysses deeper  than ever plummet sounded is life everywhere life fauna after  fauna and flora after flora arranged in zones according to the  amount of light and warmth which each species requires and to the  amount of pressure which they are able to endure  the crevices of  the highest rocks only sprinkled with salt spray in springtides  and high gales have their peculiar little univalves their crisp  lichenlike seaweed in myriads lower down the region of the  fuci bladderweeds has its own tribes of periwinkles and limpets  below again about the neaptide mark the region of the corallines  and algae furnishes food for yet other species who graze on its  watery meadows and beneath all only uncovered at low springtide  the zone of the laminariae the great tangles and oreweeds is  most full of all of every imaginable form of life  so that as we  descend the rocks we may compare ourselves likening small things  to great to those who descending the andes pass in a single day  from the vegetation of the arctic zone to that of the tropics  and  here and there even at halftide level deep rockbasins shaded  from the sun and always full of water keep up in a higher zone the  vegetation of a lower one and afford in nature an analogy to those  deep barrancos which split the high tableland of mexico down  whose awful cliffs swept by cool seabreezes the traveller looks  from among the plants and animals of the temperate zone and sees  far below dim through their everlasting vapourbath of rank hot  steam the mighty forms and gorgeous colours of a tropic forest  i do not wonder says mr gosse in his charming naturalists  rambles on the devonshire coast p 187 that when southey had  an opportunity of seeing some of those beautiful quiet basins  hollowed in the living rock and stocked with elegant plants and  animals having all the charm of novelty to his eye they should  have moved his poetic fancy and found more than one place in the  gorgeous imagery of his oriental romances  just listen to him   it was a garden still beyond all price even yet it was a place of paradise and here were coral bowers and grots of madrepores and banks of sponge as soft and fair to eye as eer was mossy bed whereon the woodnymphs lie with languid limbs in summers sultry hours here too were living flowers which like a bud compacted their purple cups contracted and now in open blossom spread stretchd like green anthers many a seeking head and arborets of jointed stone were there and plants of fibres fine as silkworms thread yea beautiful as mermaids golden hair upon the waves dispread others that like the broad banana growing

line and image by  image the details of the picture and acknowledging as you  proceed the minute truthfulness with which it has been drawn  for  such is the loveliness of nature in these secluded reservoirs that  the accomplished poet when depicting the gorgeous scenes of  eastern mythology  scenes the wildest and most extravagant that  imagination could paint  drew not upon the resources of his  prolific fancy for imagery here but was well content to jot down  the simple lineaments of nature as he saw her in plain homely  england  it is a beautiful and fascinating sight for those who have never  seen it before to see the little shrubberies of pink coralline   the arborets of jointed stone  that fringe those pretty pools   it is a charming sight to see the crimson bananalike leaves of the  delesseria waving in their darkest corners and the purple fibrous  tufts of polysiphonia and ceramia fine as silkworms thread   but there are many others which give variety and impart beauty to  these tidepools  the broad leaves of the ulva finer than the  finest cambric and of the brightest emeraldgreen adorn the  hollows at the highest level while at the lowest wave tiny  forests of the feathery ptilota and dasya and large leaves cut  into fringes and furbelows of rosy rhodymeniae  all these are  lovely to behold but i think i admire as much as any of them one  of the commonest of our marine plants chondrus crispus  it occurs  in the greatest profusion on this coast in every pool between  tidemarks and everywhere  except in those of the highest level  where constant exposure to light dwarfs the plant and turns it of  a dull umberbrown tint  it is elegant in form and brilliant in  colour  the expanding fanshaped fronds cut into segments cut  and cut again make fine bushy tufts in a deep pool and every  segment of every frond reflects a flush of the most lustrous azure  like that of a tempered swordblade  gosses devonshire coast  pp 187189  and the seabottom also has its zones at different depths and  its peculiar forms in peculiar spots affected by the currents and  the nature of the ground the riches of which have to be seen  alas rather by the imagination than the eye for such spoonfuls of  the treasure as the dredge brings up to us come too often rolled  and battered torn from their sites and contracted by fear mere  hints to us of what the populous reality below is like  often  standing on the shore at low tide has one longed to walk on and in  under the waves as the waterousel does in the pools of the  mountain burn and see it all but for a moment and a solemn beauty  and meaning has invested the old greek fable of glaucus the  fisherman  how eating of the herb which gave his fish strength to  leap back into their native element he was seized on the spot with  a strange longing to follow them under the waves and became for  ever a companion of the fair semihuman forms with which the  hellenic poets peopled their sunny bays and firths feeding silent  flocks far below on the green zostera beds or basking with them  on the sunny ledges in the summer noon or wandering in the still  bays on sultry nights amid the choir of amphitrite and her sea nymphs   joining the bliss of the gods as they waken the coves with their  laughter   in nightly revels whereof one has sung    so they came up in their joy and before them the roll of the  surges sank as the breezes sank dead into smooth green foamflecked  marble awed and the crags of the cliffs and the pines of the mountains  were silent so they came up in their joy and around them the lamps of the sea nymphs myriad fiery globes swam heaving and panting and rainbows crimson and azure and emerald were broken in starshowers  lighting far in the winedark depths of the crystal the gardens of nereus coral and seafan and tangle the blooms and the palms of the  ocean so they went on in their joy more white than the foam which they  scattered laughing and singing and tossing and twining while eager the  tritons blinded with kisses their eyes unreproved and above them in  worship fluttered the terns and the seagulls swept past them on silvery  pinions echoing softly their laughter around them the wantoning dolphins sighed as they plunged full of love and the great seahorses  which bore them curved up their crests in their pride to the delicate arms of their  riders pawing the spray into gems till a fiery rainfall unharming sparkled and gleamed on the limbs of the maids and the coils of  the mermen so they went on in their joy bathed round with the fiery coolness needing nor sun nor moon selflighted immortal  but others pitiful floated in silence apart on their knees lay the seaboys whelmed by the roll of the surge swept down by the anger of  nereus hapless whom never again upon quay or strand shall their mothers welcome with garlands and vows to the temples but wearily pining gaze over island and main for the sails which return not they  heedless sleep in soft bosoms for ever and dream of the surge and the sea maids so they passed by in their joy like a dream on the murmuring  ripple   such a rhapsody may be somewhat out of order even in a popular  scientific book and yet one cannot help at moments envying the old  greek imagination which could inform the soulless seaworld with a  human life and beauty  for after all starfishes and sea anemones are dull substitutes for sirens and tritons the lamps of  the seanymphs those glorious phosphorescent medusae whose beauty  mr gosse sets forth so well with pen and pencil are not as  attractive as the seanymphs themselves would be and who would  not like menelaus take the grey old man of the sea himself asleep  upon the rocks rather than one of his sealherd probably too with  the same result as the worldfamous combat in the antiquary  between hector and phoca  and yet  is there no human interest in  these pursuits more humanity and more divine than there would be  even in those triton and nereid dreams if realized to sight and  sense  heaven forbid that those should say so whose wanderings  among rock and pool have been mixed up with holiest passages of  friendship and of love and the intercommunion of equal minds and  sympathetic hearts and the laugh of children drinking in health  from every breeze and instruction at every step running ever and  anon with proud delight to add their little treasure to their  parents stock and of happy friendly evenings spent over the  microscope and the vase in examining arranging preserving  noting down in the diary the wonders and the labours of the happy  busy day  no such short glimpses of the waterworld as our  present appliances afford us are full enough of pleasure and we  will not envy glaucus  we will not even be overanxious for the  success of his only modern imitator the french naturalist who is  reported to have fitted himself with a waterproof dress and  breathing apparatus in order to walk the bottom of the  mediterranean and see for himself how the world goes on at the  fiftyfathom line  we will be content with the wonders of the  shore and of the seafloor as far as the dredge will discover them  to us  we shall even thus find enough to occupy if we choose our  lifetime  for we must recollect that this hasty sketch has hardly  touched on that vegetable waterworld which is as wonderful and as  various as the animal one  a hint or two of the beauty of the sea weeds has been given but space has allowed no more  yet we might  have spent our time with almost as much interest and profit had we  neglected utterly the animals which we have found and devoted our  attention exclusively to the flora of the rocks  seaweeds are no  mere playthings for children and to buy at a shop some thirty  pretty kinds pasted on paper with long names probably misspelt  written under each is not by any means to possess a collection of  them  putting aside the number and the obscurity of their species  the questions which arise in studying their growth reproduction  and organic chemistry are of the very deepest and most important in  the whole range of science and it will need but a little study of  such a book as harveys algae to show the wise man that he who  has comprehended which no man yet does the mystery of a single  spore or tissuecell has reached depths in the great science of  life at which an owen would still confess himself blind by excess  of light  knowest thou how the bones grow in the womb asks the  jewish sage sadly half selfreprovingly as he discovers that man  is not the measure of all things and that in much learning may be  vanity and vexation of spirit and in much study a weariness of the  flesh and all our deeper physical science only brings the same  question more awfully near  vilior algâ more worthless than the  very seaweed says the old roman  and yet no torn scrap of that  very seaweed which tomorrow may manure the nearest garden but  says to us proud man talking of spores and vesicles if thou  darest for a moment to fancy that to have seen spores and vesicles  is to have seen me or to know what i am answer this  knowest  thou how the bones do grow in the womb  knowest thou even how one  of these tiny black dots which thou callest spores grow on my  fronds  and to that question what answer shall we make  we see  tissues divide cells develop processes go on  but how and why   these are but phenomena but what are phenomena save effects   causes it may be of other effects but still effects of other  causes  and why does the cause cause that effect  why should it  not cause something else  why should it cause anything at all   because it obeys a law  but why does it obey the law and how does  it obey the law  and after all what is a law  a mere custom of  nature  we see the same phenomenon happen a great many times and  we infer from thence that it has a custom of happening and  therefore we call it a law  but we have not seen the law all we  have seen is the phenomenon which we suppose to indicate the law   we have seen things fall  but we never saw a little flying thing  pulling them down with gravitation labelled on its back and the  question why things fall and how is just where it was before  newton was born and is likely to remain there  all we can say is  that nature has her customs and that other customs ensue when  those customs appear  but that as to what connects cause and  effect as to what is the reason the final cause or even the  causa causans of any phenomenon we know not more but less than  ever for those laws or customs which seem to us simplest  endosmose for instance or gravitation are just the most  inexplicable logically unexpected seemingly arbitrary certainly  supernatural  miraculous if you will for no natural and physical  cause whatsoever can be assigned for them while if anyone shall  argue against their being miraculous and supernatural on the ground  of their being so common i can only answer that of all absurd and  illogical arguments this is the most so  for what has the number  of times which the miracle occurs to do with the question save to  increase the wonder  which is more strange that an inexplicable  and unfathomable thing should occur once and for all or that it  should occur a million times every day all the world over  let those however who are too proud to wonder do as seems good  to them  their want of wonder will not help them toward the  required explanation  and to them as to us as soon as we begin  asking how and why the mighty mother will only reply with  that magnificent smile of hers most genial but most silent which  she has worn since the foundation of all worlds that silent smile  which has tempted many a man to suspect her of irony even of  deceit and hatred of the human race the silent smile which solomon  felt and answered in ecclesiastes which goethe felt and did  not answer in his faust which pascal felt and tried to answer  in his thoughts and fled from into selftorture and  superstition terrified beyond his powers of endurance as he found  out the true meaning of st johns vision and felt himself really  standing on that fragile and slippery sea of glass and close  beneath him the bottomless abyss of doubt and the nether fires of  moral retribution  he fled from natures silent smile as that  poor old king edward miscalled the confessor fled from her hymns  of praise in the old legend of haveringattebower when he cursed  the nightingales because their songs confused him in his prayers   but the wise man need copy neither and fear neither the silence  nor the laughter of the mighty mother earth if he will be but  wise and hear her tell him alike in both  why call me mother   why ask me for knowledge which i cannot teach peace which i cannot  give or take away  i am only your fostermother and your nurse   and i have not been an unkindly one  but you are gods children  and not mine  ask him  i can amuse you with my songs but they  are but a nurses lullaby to the weary flesh  i can awe you with  my silence but my silence is only my just humility and your gain   how dare i pretend to tell you secrets which he who made me knows  alone  i am but inanimate matter why ask of me things which  belong to living spirit  in god i live and move and have my  being i know not how any more than you know  who will tell you  what life is save he who is the lord of life  and if he will not  tell you be sure it is because you need not to know  at least  why seek god in nature the living among the dead  he is not here   he is risen  he is not here  he is risen  good reader you will probably agree  that to know that saying is to know the keynote of the world to  come  believe me to know it and all it means is to know the  keynote of this world also from the fall of dynasties and the fate  of nations to the seaweed which rots upon the beach  it may seem startling possibly though i hope not for my readers  sake irreverent to go back at once after such thoughts be they  true or false to the weeds upon the cliff above our heads  but he  who is not here but is risen yet is here and has appointed them  their services in a wonderful order and i wish that on some day  or on many days when a quiet sea and offshore breezes have  prevented any new objects from coming to land with the rising tide  you would investigate the flowers peculiar to our searocks and  sandhills  even if you do not find the delicate lilylike  trichonema of the channel islands and dawlish or the almost as  beautiful squill of the cornish cliffs or the sealavender of  north devon or any of those rare mediterranean species which mr  johns has so charmingly described in his week at the lizard  point yet an average cliff with its carpeting of pink thrift and  of bladder catchfly and ladys finger and elegant grasses most  of them peculiar to the sea marge is often a very lovely flower bed  not merely interesting too but brilliant in their vegetation are  sandhills and the seemingly desolate dykes and banks of salt  marshes will yield many a curious plant which you may neglect if  you will  but lay to your account the having to repent your  neglect hereafter when finding out too late what a pleasant study  botany is you search in vain for curious forms over which you trod  every day in crossing flats which seemed to you utterly ugly and  uninteresting but which the good god was watching as carefully as  he did the pleasant hills inland  perhaps even more carefully for  the uplands he has completed and handed over to man that he may  dress and keep them  but the tideflats below are still  unfinished dry land in the process of creation to which every  tide is adding the elements of fertility which shall grow food  perhaps in some future state of our planet for generations yet  unborn  but to return to the waterworld and to dredging which of all  seaside pursuits is perhaps the most pleasant combining as it  does fine weather sailing with the discovery of new objects to  which after all the waifs and strays of the beach whether  flotsom jetsom or lagand as the old admiralty laws define them  are few and poor  i say particularly fine weather sailing for a  swell which makes the dredge leap along the bottom instead of  scraping steadily is as fatal to sport as it is to some peoples  comfort  but dredging if you use a pleasure boat and the small  naturalists dredge is an amusement in which ladies if they will  may share and which will increase and not interfere with the  amusements of a waterparty  the naturalists dredge of which mr gosses aquarium gives a  detailed account should differ from the common oyster dredge in  being smaller certainly not more than four feet across the mouth  and instead of having but one iron scrapinglip like the oyster  dredge it should have two one above and one below so that it  will work equally well on whichsoever side it falls or how often  soever it may be turned over by rough ground  the bagnet should  be of strong spunyarn or still better of hide such as those  hides of the wild cattle of the pampas which the tobacconists  receive from south america cut into thongs and netted close  it  should be loosely laced together with a thong at the tail edge in  order to be opened easily when brought on board without canting  the net over and pouring the contents roughly out through the  mouth  the draggingrope should be strong and at least three  times as long as the perpendicular depth of the water in which you  are working if indeed there is much breeze or any swell at all  still more line should be veered out  the inboard end should be  made fast somewhere in the stern sheets the dredge hove to  windward the boat put before the wind and you may then amuse  yourself as you will for the next quarter of an hour provided that  you have got ready various widemouthed bottles for the more  delicate monsters and a couple of buckets to receive the large  lumps of oysters and serpulae which you will probably bring to the  surface  as for a dredging ground one may be found i suppose off every  wateringplace  the most fertile spots are in rough ground in not  less than five fathoms water  the deeper the water the rarer and  more interesting will the animals generally be  but a greater  depth than fifteen fathoms is not easily reached on this side of  plymouth and on the whole the beginner will find enough in seven  or eight fathoms to stock an aquarium rivalling any of those in the  tankhouse at the zoological gardens  in general the south coast of england to the eastward of  portland affords bad dredging ground  the friable cliffs of  comparatively recent formations keep the sea shallow and the  bottom smooth and bare by the vast deposits of sand and gravel   yet round the isle of wight especially at the back of the needles  there ought to be fertile spots and weymouth according to mr  gosse and other wellknown naturalists is a very garden of nereus   torbay as may well be supposed is an admirable dredging spot  perhaps its two best points are round the isolated thatcher and  oarerock and from the mouth of brixham harbour to berry head  along which last line for perhaps three hundred years the decks  of all brixham trawlers have been washed down ere running into  harbour and the seabottom thus stored with treasures scraped up  from deeper water in every direction for miles and miles  hastings is i fear but a poor spot for dredging  its friable  cliffs and strong tides produce a changeable and barren seafloor   yet the immense quantities of flustra thrown up after a storm  indicate dredging ground at no great distance outside its rocks  uninteresting as they are compared with our devonians have yielded  to the industry and science of m tumanowicz a vast number of sea weeds and sponges  those three curious polypes valkeria cuscuta  plate i fig 3 notamia bursaria and serialaria lendigera  abound within tidemarks and as the place is so much visited by  londoners it may be worth while to give a few hints as to what  might be done by anyone whose curiosity has been excited by the  saltwater tanks of the zoological gardens and the crystal palace  an hour or twos dredging round the rocks to the eastward would  probably yield many delicate and brilliant little fishes gobies  brilliant labri blue yellow and orange with tiny rabbit mouths  and powerful protruding teeth pipe fishes syngnathi 25 with  strange snipebills which they cannot open and snakelike bodies  small cuttlefish sepiolae of a white jelly mottled with brilliant  metallic hues with a ring of suckered arms round their tiny  parrots beaks who put into a jar will hover and dart in the  water as the skylark does in air by rapid winnowings of their  glassy sidefins while they watch you with bright lizardeyes the  whole animal being a combination of the vertebrate and the mollusc  so utterly fantastic and abnormal that had not the family been  amongst the commonest from the earliest geological epochs it  would have seemed to mans deductive intellect a form almost as  impossible as the mermaid far more impossible than the sea serpent  these and perhaps a few handsome seaslugs and bivalve  shells you will be pretty sure to find  perhaps a great deal  more  meanwhile without dredging you may find a good deal on the shore   in the spring doris bilineata comes to the rocks in thousands to  lay its strange white furbelows of spawn upon their overhanging  edges  eolides of extraordinary beauty haunt the same spots  the  great eolis papillosa of a delicate french grey eolis pellucida   plate x fig 4 in which each papilla on the back is  beautifully coloured with a streak of pink and tipped with iron  blue and a most fantastical yellow little creature so covered  with plumes and tentacles that the body is invisible which i  believe to be the idalia aspersa of alder and hancock  at the bottom of the rock pools behind st leonards baths may be  found hundreds of the snipes feather anemone sagartia  troglodytes of every line from the common brown and grey snipes  feather kind to the whitehorned hesperus the orangehorned  aurora and a rich lilac and crimson variety which does not seem  to agree with either the lilacinia or rubicunda of gosse  a more  beautiful living bouquet could hardly be seen than might be made  of the varieties of this single species from this one place  on the outside sands between the end of the marina and the martello  tower you may find at very low tides great numbers of a sand tube about three inches long standing up out of the sand  i do  not mean the tubes of the terebella so common in all sands which  are somewhat flexible and have their upper end fringed with a  ragged ring of sandy arms  those i speak of are straight and  stiff and ending in a point upward  draw them out of the sand   they will offer some resistance  and put them into a vase of  water you will see the worm inside expand two delicate golden  combs just like oldfashioned backhair combs of a metallic  lustre which will astonish you  with these combs the worm seems  to burrow head downward into the sand but whether he always  remains in that attitude i cannot say  his name is pectinaria  belgica  he is an annelid or true worm connected with the  serpulea and sabellae of which i have spoken already and holds  himself in his case like them by hooks and bristles set on each  ring of his body  in confinement he will probably come out of his  case and die when you may dissect him at your leisure and learn a  great deal more about him thereby than i am sorry to say i know  but if you have courage to run out fifteen or twenty miles to the  diamond you may find really rare and valuable animals  there is a  risk of course of being blown over to the coast of france by a  change of wind there is a risk also of not being able to land at  night on the inhospitable hastings beach and of sleeping as best  you can on board  but in the long days and settled fine weather  of summer the trip in a stout boat ought to be a safe and a  pleasant one  on the diamond you will find many or most of those gay creatures  which attract your eye in the central row of tanks at the  zoological gardens  great twisted masses of serpulae 26 those  white tubes of stone from the mouth of which protrude pairs of  rosecoloured or orange fans flashing in quick as light the  moment that your finger approaches them or your shadow crosses the  water  you will dredge too the twelverayed sunstar solaster papposa  with his rich scarlet armour and more strange and quite as  beautiful the birds foot star palmipes membranaceus which you  may see crawling by its thousand suckingfeet in the crystal palace  tanks a pentagonal webbed birds foot of scarlet and orange  shagreen  with him most probably will be a specimen of the great  purple hearturchin spatangus purpureus clothed in pale lilac  horny spines and other echinoderms for which you must consult  forbess british starfishes but perhaps the species among them  which will interest you most will be the common brittlestar  ophiocoma rosula of which a hundred or so i can promise shall  come up at a single haul of the dredge entwining their long spine clad arms in a seemingly inextricable confusion of kaleidoscope  patterns thanks to mr gosse for the one right epithet purple  and azure fawn brown green grey white and crimson as if a  whole bed of chinaasters should have first come to life and then  gone mad and fallen to fighting  but pick out one by one  specimens from the tangled mass and you will agree that no china aster is so fair as this living stoneflower of the deep with its  daisylike disc and fine long prickly arms which never cease  their graceful serpentine motion and its colours hardly alike in  any two specimens  handle them not meanwhile too roughly lest  whether modesty or in anger they begin a desperate course of  gradual suicide and breaking off arm after arm piecemeal fling  them indignantly at their tormentor  along with these you will  certainly obtain a few of that fine bivalve the great scallop  which you have seen lying on every fishmongers counter in  hastings  of these you must pick out those which seem dirtiest and  most overgrown with parasites and place them carefully in a jar of  salt water where they may not be rubbed for they are worth your  examination not merely for the sake of that ring of gemlike eyes  which borders their cloak lying along the extreme out edge of  the shell as the valves are half open but for the sake of the  parasites outside  corallines of exquisite delicacy plumulariae  and sertulariae dead mens hands alcyonia lumps of white or  orange jelly which will protrude a thousand starlike polypes and  the tubularia indivisa twisted tubes of fine straw which ought  already to have puzzled you for you may pick them up in  considerable masses on the hastings beach after a southwest gale  and think long over them before you determine whether the oatlike  stems and spongy roots belong to an animal or a vegetable   animals they are nevertheless though even now you will hardly  guess the fact when you see at the mouth of each tube a little  scarlet flower connected with the pink pulp which fills the tube   for a further description of this largest and handsomest of our  hydroid polypes i must refer you to johnston or failing him to  landsborough and go on to beg you not to despise those pink or  grey or white lumps of jelly which will expand in salt water into  exquisite seaanemones of quite different forms from any which we  have found along the rocks  one of them will certainly be the  dianthus 27 which will open into a furbelowed flower furred  with innumerable delicate tentacula and in the centre a mouth of  the most delicate orange the size of the whole animal being  perhaps eight inches high and five across  perhaps it will be of a  satiny grey perhaps pale rose perhaps pure white whatever its  colour it is the very maiden queen of all the beautiful tribe and  one of the loveliest gems with which it has pleased god to bedeck  this lower world  these and much more you will find on the scallops or even more  plentifully on any lump of ancient oysters and if you do not  dredge it would be well worth your while to make interest with the  fishmonger for a few oyster lumps put into water the moment they  are taken out of the trawl  divide them carefully clear out the  oysters with a knife and put the shells into your aquarium and  you will find that an oyster at home is a very different thing from  an oyster on a stall  you ought besides to dredge many handsome species of shells  which you would never pick up along the beach and if you are  conchologizing in earnest you must not forget to bring home a tin  box of shell sand to be washed and picked over in a dish at your  leisure or forget either to wash through a fine sieve over the  boats side any sludge and ooze which the dredge brings up  many   i may say hundreds  rare and new shells are found in this way  and in no other  but if you cannot afford the expense of your own dredge and boat  and the time and trouble necessary to follow the occupation  scientifically yet every trawler and oysterboat will afford you a  tolerable satisfaction  go on board one of these and while the  trawl is down spend a pleasant hour or two in talking with the  simple honest sturdy fellows who work it from whom if you are  as fortunate as i have been for many a year past you may get many  a moving story of danger and sorrow as well as many a shrewd  practical maxim and often too a living recognition of god and  the providence of god which will send you home perhaps a wiser  and more genial man  and when the trawl is hauled wait till the  fish are counted out and packed away and then kneel down and  inspect in a pair of mackintosh leggings and your oldest coat  the crawling heap of shells and zoophytes which remains behind  about the decks and you will find if a landsman enough to occupy  you for a week to come  nay even if it be too calm for trawling  condescend to go out in a dingy and help to haul some honest  fellows deepsea lines and lobsterpots and you will find more  and stranger things about them than even fish or lobsters  though  they to him who has eyes to see are strange enough  i speak from experience for it was not so very long ago that in  the north of devon i found sermons not indeed in stones but in a  creature reputed among the most worthless of seavermin  i had  been lounging about all the morning on the little pier waiting  with the rest of the village for a trawling breeze which would not  come  two oclock was past and still the red mainsails of the  skiffs hung motionless and their images quivered head downwards in  the glassy swell   as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean   it was neaptide too and therefore nothing could be done among  the rocks  so in despair finding an old coastguard friend  starting for his lobsterpots i determined to save the old mans  arms by rowing him up the shore and then paddled homeward again  under the high green northern wall five hundred feet of cliff  furred to the waters edge with rich oak woods against whose base  the smooth atlantic swell died whispering as if curling itself up  to sleep at last within that sheltered nook tired with its weary  wanderings  the sun sank lower and lower behind the deerpark  point the white stair of houses up the glen was wrapped every  moment deeper and deeper in hazy smoke and shade as the light  faded the evening fires were lighted one by one the soft murmur  of the waterfall and the pleasant laugh of children and the  splash of homeward oars came clearer and clearer to the ear at  every stroke  and as we rowed on arose the recollection of many a  brave and wise friend whose lot was cast in no such western  paradise but rather in the infernos of this sinful earth toiling  even then amid the festering alleys of bermondsey and bethnal  green to palliate death and misery which they had vainly laboured  to prevent watching the strides of that very cholera which they  had been striving for years to ward off now readmitted in spite  of all their warnings by the carelessness and laziness and greed  of sinful man  and as i thought over the whole hapless question of  sanitary reform proved long since a moral duty to god and man  possible easy even pecuniarily profitable and yet left undone  there seemed a sublime irony most humbling to man in some of  natures processes and in the silent and unobtrusive perfection  with which she has been taught to anticipate since the foundation  of the world some of the loftiest discoveries of modern science  of which we are too apt to boast as if we had created the method by  discovering its possibility  created it  alas for the pride of  human genius and the autotheism which would make man the measure  of all things and the centre of the universe  all the invaluable  laws and methods of sanitary reform at best are but clumsy  imitations of the unseen wonders which every animalcule and leaf  have been working since the worlds foundation with this slight  difference between them and us that they fulfil their appointed  task and we do not  the sickly geranium which spreads its blanched leaves against the  cellar panes and peers up as if imploringly to the narrow slip  of sunlight at the top of the narrow alley had it a voice could  tell more truly than ever a doctor in the town why little bessy  sickened of the scarlatina and little johnny of the hoopingcough  till the toddling wee things who used to pet and water it were  carried off each and all of them one by one to the churchyard  sleep while the father and mother sat at home trying to supply by  gin that very vital energy which fresh air and pure water and the  balmy breath of woods and heaths were made by god to give and how  the little geranium did its best like a heavensent angel to  right the wrong which mans ignorance had begotten and drank in  day by day the poisoned atmosphere and formed it into fair green  leaves and breathed into the childrens faces from every pore  whenever they bent over it the lifegiving oxygen for which their  dulled blood and festered lungs were craving in vain fulfilling  gods will itself though man would not too careless or too  covetous to see after thousands of years of boasted progress why  god had covered the earth with grass herb and tree a living and  lifegiving garment of perpetual health and youth  it is too sad to think long about lest we become very  heraclituses  let us take the other side of the matter with  democritus try to laugh man out of a little of his boastful  ignorance and selfsatisfied clumsiness and tell him that if the  house of commons would but summon one of the little paramecia from  any thames sewermouth to give his evidence before their next  cholera committee sanitary bluebooks invaluable as they are  would be superseded for ever and a day and sanitary reformers  would no longer have to confess that they know of no means of  stopping the smells which in past hot summers drove the members out  of the house and the judges out of westminster hall  nay in the boat at the minute of which i have been speaking  silent and neglected sat a fellowpassenger who was a greater  adept at removing nuisances than the whole board of health put  together and who had done his work too with a cheapness  unparalleled for all his good deeds had not as yet cost the state  one penny  true he lived by his business so do other inspectors  of nuisances  but nature instead of paying maia squinado  esquire some five hundred pounds sterling per annum for his  labour had contrived with a sublime simplicity of economy which  mr hume might have envied and admired afar off to make him do his  work gratis by giving him the nuisances as his perquisites and  teaching him how to eat them  certainly without going the length  of the caribs who upheld cannibalism because they said it made  war cheap and precluded entirely the need of a commissariat this  cardinal virtue of cheapness ought to make squinado an interesting  object in the eyes of the present generation especially as he was  at that moment a true sanitary martyr having like many of his  human fellowworkers got into a fearful scrape by meddling with  those existing interests and vested rights which are but vested  wrongs which have proved fatal already to more than one board of  health  for last night as he was sitting quietly under a stone in  four fathoms water he became aware whether by sight smell or  that mysterious sixth sense to us unknown which seems to reside  in his delicate feelers of a palpable nuisance somewhere in the  neighbourhood and like a trusty servant of the public turned out  of his bed instantly and went in search till he discovered  hanging among what he judged to be the stems of oreweed  laminaria three or four large pieces of stale thornback of most  evil savour and highly prejudicial to the purity of the sea and  the health of the neighbouring herrings  happy squinado  he  needed not to discover the limits of his authority to consult any  lengthy nuisances removal act with its clauses and counter clauses and explanations of interpretations and interpretations  of explanations  nature who can afford to be arbitrary because  she is perfect and to give her servants irresponsible powers  because she has trained them to their work had bestowed on him and  on his forefathers as general health inspectors those very  summary powers of entrance and removal in the watery realms for  which common sense public opinion and private philanthropy are  still entreating vainly in the terrestrial realms so finding a  hole in he went and began to remove the nuisance without  waiting twentyfour hours laying an information serving a  notice or any other vain delay  the evil was there  and there  it should not stay so having neither cart nor barrow he just  began putting it into his stomach and in the meanwhile set his  assistants to work likewise  for suppose not gentle reader that  squinado went alone in his train were more than a hundred thousand  as good as he each in his office and as cheaply paid who needed  no cumbrous baggage train of forcepumps hose chloride of lime  packets whitewash pails or brushes but were every man his own  instrument and to save expense of transit just grew on  squinados back  do you doubt the assertion  then lift him up  hither and putting him gently into that shallow jar of salt water  look at him through the handmagnifier and see how nature is  maxima in minimis  there he sits twiddling his feelers a substitute it seems with  crustacea for biting their nails when they are puzzled and by no  means lovely to look on in vulgar eyes  about the bigness of a  mans fist a roundbodied spindleshanked crusty prickly dirty  fellow with a villanous squint too in those little bony eyes  which never look for a moment both the same way  never mind  many  a man of genius is ungainly enough and nature if you will  observe as if to make up to him for his uncomeliness has arrayed  him as solomon in all his glory never was arrayed and so fulfilled  one of the proposals of old fourier  that scavengers chimney sweeps and other workers in disgusting employments should be  rewarded for their selfsacrifice in behalf of the public weal by  some peculiar badge of honour or laurel crown  not that his  crown like those of the old greek games is a mere useless badge  on the contrary his robe of state is composed of his fellow servants  his whole back is covered with a little grey forest of  branching hairs fine as a spiders web each branchlet carrying  its little pearly ringed club each club its rosecoloured polype  like to quote mr gosses comparison the unexpanded birds of the  acacia 28  on that leg grows amid another copse of the grey polypes a  delicate strawcoloured sertularia branch on branch of tiny double  combs each tooth of the comb being a tube containing a living  flower on another leg another sertularia coarser but still  beautiful and round it again has trained itself parasitic on the  parasite plant upon plant of glass ivy bearing crystal bells  29 each of which too protrudes its living flower on another  leg is a fresh species like a little heatherbush of whitest  ivory 30 and every needle leaf a polype cell  let us stop  before the imagination grows dizzy with the contemplation of those  myriads of beautiful atomies  and what is their use  each living  flower each polype mouth is feeding fast sweeping into itself by  the perpetual currents caused by the delicate fringes upon its rays  so minute these last that their motion only betrays their  presence each tiniest atom of decaying matter in the surrounding  water to convert it by some wondrous alchemy into fresh cells  and buds and either build up a fresh branch in their thousand tenanted tree or form an eggcell from whence when ripe may  issue not a fixed zoophyte but a free swimming animal  and in the meanwhile among this animal forest grows a vegetable  one of delicatest seaweeds green and brown and crimson whose  office is by their everlasting breath to reoxygenate the impure  water and render it fit once more to be breathed by the higher  animals who swim or creep around  mystery of mysteries  let us jest no more  heaven forgive us if  we have jested too much on so simple a matter as that poor spider crab taken out of the lobsterpots and left to die at the bottom  of the boat because his more aristocratic cousins of the blue and  purple armour will not enter the trap while he is within  i am not aware whether the surmise that these tiny zoophytes help  to purify the water by exhaling oxygen gas has yet been verified   the infusorial animalcules do so reversing the functions of animal  life and instead of evolving carbonic acid gas as other animals  do evolve pure oxygen  so at least says liebig who states that  he found a small piece of matchwood just extinguished burst out  again into a flame on being immersed in the bubbles given out by  these living atomies  i myself should be inclined to doubt that this is the case with  zoophytes having found water in which they were growing unless  of course seaweeds were present to be peculiarly ready to become  foul but it is difficult to say whether this is owing to their  deoxygenating the water while alive like other animals or to the  fact that it is very rare to get a specimen of zoophyte in which a  large number of the polypes have not been killed in the transit  home or at least so far knocked about that in the anthozoa  which are far the most abundant the polype  or rather living  mouth for it is little more  is thrown off to decay pending the  growth of a fresh one in the same cell  but all the seaweeds in common with other vegetables perform  this function continually and thus maintain the water in which  they grow in a state fit to support animal life  this fact  first advanced by priestley and ingenhousz and though  doubted by the great ellis satisfactorily ascertained by professor  daubeny mr ward dr johnston and mr warrington  gives an  answer to the question which i hope has ere now arisen in the  minds of some of my readers   how is it possible to see these wonders at home  beautiful and  instructive as they may be can they be meant for any but dwellers  by the seaside  nay more even to them must not the glories of  the waterworld be always more momentary than those of the rainbow  a mere fata morgana which breaks up and vanishes before the eyes   if there were but some method of making a miniature seaworld for a  few days much more of keeping one with us when far inland   this desideratum has at last been filled up and science has shown  as usual that by simply obeying nature we may conquer her even  so far as to have our miniature sea of artificial saltwater  filled with living plants and seaweeds maintaining each other in  perfect health and each following as far as is possible in a  confined space its natural habits  to dr johnston is due as far as is known the honour of the first  accomplishment of this as of a hundred other zoological triumphs   as early as 1842 he proved to himself the vegetable nature of the  common pink coralline which fringes every rockpool by keeping it  for eight weeks in unchanged saltwater without any putrefaction  ensuing  the ground of course on which the proof rested in this  case was that if the coralline were as had often been thought a  zoophyte the water would become corrupt and poisonous to the life  of the small animals in the same jar and that its remaining fresh  argued that the coralline had reoxygenated it from time to time  and was therefore a vegetable  in 1850 mr robert warrington communicated to the chemical society  the results of a years experiments on the adjustment of the  relations between the animal and vegetable kingdoms by which the  vital functions of both are permanently maintained  the law which  his experiments verified was the same as that on which mr ward in  1842 founded his invaluable proposal for increasing the purity of  the air in large towns by planting trees and cultivating flowers  in rooms that the animal and vegetable respirations might  counterbalance each other the animals blood being purified by the  oxygen given off by the plants the plants fed by the carbonic acid  breathed out by the animals  on the same principle mr warrington first kept for many months  in a vase of unchanged water two small gold fish and a plant of  vallisneria spiralis and two years afterwards began a similar  experiment with seawater weeds and anemones which were at  last as successful as the former ones  mr gosse had in the  meanwhile with tolerable success begun a similar method unaware  of what mr warrington had done and now the beautiful and curious  exhibition of fresh and salt water tanks in the zoological gardens  in london bids fair to be copied in every similar institution and  we hope in many private houses throughout the kingdom  to this subject mr gosses book the aquarium is principally  devoted though it contains besides sketches of coast scenery in  his usual charming style and descriptions of rare seaanimals  with wise and goodly reflections thereon  one great object of  interest in the book is the last chapter which treats fully of the  making and stocking these saltwater aquaria and the various  beautifully coloured plates which are as it were sketches from  the interior of tanks are well fitted to excite the desire of all  readers to possess such gorgeous living pictures if as nothing  else still as drawingroom ornaments flowergardens which never  wither fairy lakes of perpetual calm which no storm blackens   greek text which cannot be reproduced  those who have never seen one of them can never imagine and  neither mr gosses pencil nor my clumsy words can ever describe to  them the gorgeous colouring and the grace and delicacy of form  which these subaqueous landscapes exhibit  as for colouring  the only bit of colour which i can remember  even faintly resembling them for though correggios magdalene may  rival them in greens and blues yet even he has no such crimsons  and purples is the adoration of the shepherds by that prince of  colorists  palma vecchio which hangs on the lefthand side of  lord ellesmeres great gallery  but as for the forms  where  shall we see their like  where amid miniature forests as  fantastic as those of the tropics animals whose shapes outvie the  wildest dreams of the old german ghost painters which cover the  walls of the galleries of brussels or antwerp  and yet the  uncouthest has some quaint beauty of its own while most  the  starfishes and anemones for example  are nothing but beauty   the brilliant plates in mr gosses aquarium give after all but  a meagre picture of the reality as it may be seen in the tank house at the zoological gardens and as it may be seen also by  anyone who will follow carefully the directions given at the end of  his book stock a glass vase with such common things as he may find  in an hours search at low tide and so have an opportunity of  seeing how truly mr gosse says in his valuable preface that   the habits and he might well have added the marvellous beauty  of animals will never be thoroughly known till they are observed  in detail  nor is it sufficient to mark them with attention now  and then they must be closely watched their various actions  carefully noted their behaviour under different circumstances and  especially those movements which seem to us mere vagaries  undirected by any suggestible motive or cause well examined  a  rich fruit of result often new and curious and unexpected will i  am sure reward anyone who studies living animals in this way  the  most interesting parts by far of published natural history are  those minute but graphic particulars which have been gathered up  by an attentive watching of individual animals  mr gosses own books certainly give proof enough of this  we  need only direct the reader to his exquisitely humorous account of  the ways and works of a captive soldiercrab 31 to show them how  much there is to be seen and how full nature is also of that  ludicrous element of which we spoke above  and indeed it is in  this form of natural history  not in mere classification and the  finding out of means and quarrellings as to the first discovery of  that beetle or this buttercup  too common alas among mere  closetcollectors  endless genealogies to apply st pauls  words by no means irreverently or fancifully which do but gender  strife  not in these pedantries is that moral training to be  found for which we have been lauding the study of natural history   but in healthful walks and voyages out of doors and in careful and  patient watching of the living animals and plants at home with an  observation sharpened by practice and a temper calmed by the  continual practice of the naturalists first virtues  patience and  perseverance  practical directions for forming an aquarium may be found in mr  gosses book bearing that name at pp 101 255 et seq and those  who wish to carry out the notion thoroughly cannot do better than  buy his book and take their choice of the many different forms of  vase with rockwork fountains and other pretty devices which he  describes  but the many even if they have mr gosses book will be rather  inclined to begin with a small attempt especially as they are  probably half sceptical of the possibility of keeping seaanimals  inland without changing the water  a few simple directions  therefore will not come amiss here  they shall be such as anyone  can put into practice who goes down to stay in a lodginghouse at  the most cockney of wateringplaces  buy at any glassshop a cylindrical glass jar some six inches in  diameter and ten high which will cost you from three to four  shillings wash it clean and fill it with clean saltwater dipped  out of any pool among the rocks only looking first to see that  there is no dead fish or other evil matter in the said pool and  that no stream from the land runs into it  if you choose to take  the trouble to dip up the water over a boats side so much the  better  so much for your vase now to stock it  go down at low springtide to the nearest ledge of rocks and with  a hammer and chisel chip off a few pieces of stone covered with  growing seaweed  avoid the common and coarser kinds fuci which  cover the surface of the rocks for they give out under water a  slime which will foul your tank  but choose the more delicate  species which fringe the edges of every pool at lowwater mark the  pink coralline the dark purple ragged dulse rhodymenia the  carrageen moss chondrus and above all the commonest of all the  delicate green ulva which you will see growing everywhere in  wrinkled fanshaped sheets as thin as the finest silverpaper   the smallest bits of stone are sufficient provided the seaweeds  have hold of them for they have no real roots but adhere by a  small disc deriving no nourishment from the rock but only from  the water  take care meanwhile that there be as little as  possible on the stone beside the weed itself  especially scrape  off any small sponges and see that no worms have made their  twining tubes of sand among the weedstems if they have drag them  out for they will surely die and as surely spoil all by  sulphuretted hydrogen blackness and evil smells  put your weeds into your tank and settle them at the bottom which  last some say should be covered with a layer of pebbles  but let  the beginner leave it as bare as possible for the pebbles only  tempt crossgrained annelids to crawl under them die and spoil  all by decaying  whereas if the bottom of the vase is bare you  can see a sickly or dead inhabitant at once and take him out  which you must do instantly  let your weeds stand quietly in the  vase a day or two before you put in any live animals and even  then do not put any in if the water does not appear perfectly  clear  but lift out the weeds and renew the water ere you replace  them  this is mr gosses method  but mr lloyd in his handbook to the  crystal palace aquarium advises that no weed should be put into  the tank  it is better he says to depend only on those which  gradually and naturally appear on the rocks of the aquarium by the  action of light and which answer every chemical purpose  i  should advise anyone intending to set up an aquarium however  small to study what mr lloyd says on this matter in pp 1719  and also in page 30 of his pamphlet and also to go to the crystal  palace aquarium and there see for himself the many beautiful  species of seaweeds which have appeared spontaneously in the tanks  from unsuspected spores floating in the seawater  on the other  hand mr lloyd lays much stress on the necessity of aërating the  water by keeping it in perpetual motion a process not easy to be  carried out in small aquaria at least to that perfection which has  been attained at the crystal palace where the water is kept in  continual circulation by steampower  for a jaraquarium it will  be enough to drive fresh air through the water every day by means  of a syringe  now for the live stock  in the crannies of every rock you will  find seaanemones actiniae and a dozen of these only will be  enough to convert your little vase into the most brilliant of  living flowergardens  there they hang upon the under side of the  ledges apparently mere rounded lumps of jelly  one is of dark  purple dotted with green another of a rich chocolate another of a  delicate olive another siennayellow another all but white  take  them from their rock you can do it easily by slipping under them  your fingernail or the edge of a pewter spoon  take care to tear  the sucking base as little as possible though a small rent they  will darn for themselves in a few days easily enough and drop  them into a basket of wet seaweed when you get home turn them  into a dish full of water and leave them for the night and go to  look at them tomorrow  what a change  the dull lumps of jelly  have taken root and flowered during the night and your dish is  filled from side to side with a bouquet of chrysanthemums each has  expanded into a hundredpetalled flower crimson pink purple or  orange touch one and it shrinks together like a sensitive plant  displaying at the root of the petals a ring of brilliant turquoise  beads  that is the commonest of all the actiniae  mesembryanthemum you may have him when and where you will  but  if you will search those rocks somewhat closer you will find even  more gorgeous species than him  see in that pool some dozen large  ones in full bloom and quite six inches across some of them  if  their cousins whom we found just now were like chrysanthemums  these are like quilled dahlias  their arms are stouter and shorter  in proportion than those of the last species but their colour is  equally brilliant  one is a brilliant bloodred another a  delicate seablue striped with pink but most have the disc and the  innumerable arms striped and ringed with various shades of grey and  brown  shall we get them  by all means if we can  touch one   where is he now  gone  vanished into air or into stone  not  quite  you see that knot of sand and broken shell lying on the  rock where your dahlia was one moment ago  touch it and you will  find it leathery and elastic  that is all which remains of the  live dahlia  never mind get your finger into the crack under him  work him gently but firmly out and take him home and he will be  as happy and as gorgeous as ever tomorrow  let your actiniae stand for a day or two in the dish and then  picking out the liveliest and handsomest detach them once more  from their hold drop them into your vase right them with a bit of  stick so that the sucking base is downwards and leave them to  themselves thenceforth  these two species mesembryanthemum and crassicornis are quite  beautiful enough to give a beginner amusement  but there are two  others which are not uncommon and of such exceeding loveliness  that it is worth while to take a little trouble to get them  the  one is dianthus which i have already mentioned the other bellis  the seadaisy of which there is an excellent description and  plates in mr gosses rambles in devon pp 24 to 32  it is common at ilfracombe and at torquay and indeed everywhere  where there are cracks and small holes in limestone or slate rock   in these holes it fixes its base and expands its delicate brown grey starlike flowers on the surface  but it must be chipped out  with hammer and chisel at the expense of much dirt and patience  for the moment it is touched it contracts deep into the rock and  all that is left of the daisy flower some two or three inches  across is a blue knot of half the size of a marble  but it will  expand again after a day or two of captivity and will repay all  the trouble which it has cost  troglodytes may be found as i have  said already in hundreds at hastings in similar situations to  that of bellis its only token when the tide is down being a  round dimple in the muddy sand which firs the lower cracks of  rocks  but you will want more than these anemones both for your own  amusement and for the health of your tank  microscopic animals  will breed and will also die and you need for them some such  scavenger as our poor friend squinado to whom you were introduced  a few pages back  turn then a few stones which lie piled on each  other at extreme lowwater mark and five minutes search will give  you the very animal you want  a little crab of a dingy russet  above and on the under side like smooth porcelain  his back is  quite flat and so are his large angular fringed claws which when  he folds them up lie in the same plane with his shell and fit  neatly into its edges  compact little rogue that he is made  especially for sidling in and out of cracks and crannies he  carries with him such an apparatus of combs and brushes as isidor  or floris never dreamed of with which he sweeps out of the sea water at every moment shoals of minute animalcules and sucks them  into his tiny mouth  mr gosse will tell you more of this marvel  in his aquarium p 48  next your seaweeds if they thrive as they ought to do will sow  their minute spores in millions around them and these as they  vegetate will form a green film on the inside of the glass  spoiling your prospect  you may rub it off for yourself if you  will with a rag fastened to a stick but if you wish at once to  save yourself trouble and to see how all emergencies in nature are  provided for you will set three or four live shells to do it for  you and to keep your subaqueous lawn close mown  that last word is no figure of speech  look among the beds of sea weed for a few of the bright yellow or green seasnails nerita  or conical tops trochus especially that beautiful pink one  spotted with brown ziziphinus which you are sure to find about  shaded rockledges at dead low tide and put them into your  aquarium  for the present they will only nibble the green ulvae  but when the film of young weed begins to form you will see it  mown off every morning as fast as it grows in little semicircular  sweeps just as if a fairys scythe had been at work during the  night  and a scythe has been at work none other than the tongue of the  little shellfish a description of its extraordinary mechanism  too long to quote here but which is well worth reading may be  found in gosses aquarium 32  a prawn or two and a few minute starfish will make your aquarium  complete though you may add to it endlessly as one glance at the  saltwater tanks of the zoological gardens and the strange and  beautiful forms which they contain will prove to you sufficiently  you have two more enemies to guard against dust and heat  if the  surface of the water becomes clogged with dust the communication  between it and the lifegiving oxygen of the air is cut off and  then your animals are liable to die for the very same reason that  fish die in a pond which is long frozen over unless a hole be  broken in the ice to admit the air  you must guard against this by  occasional stirring of the surface or as i have already said by  syringing and by keeping on a cover  a piece of muslin tied over  will do but a better defence is a plate of glass raised on wire  some halfinch above the edge so as to admit the air  i am not  sure that a sheet of brown paper laid over the vase is not the best  of all because that by its shade also guards against the next  evil which is heat  against that you must guard by putting a  curtain of muslin or oiled paper between the vase and the sun if  it be very fierce or simply for simple expedients are best by  laying a handkerchief over it till the heat is past  but if you  leave your vase in a sunny window long enough to let the water get  tepid all is over with your pets  half an hours boiling may  frustrate the care of weeks  and yet on the other hand light you  must have and you can hardly have too much  some animals  certainly prefer shade and hide in the darkest crannies and for  them if your aquarium is large enough you must provide shade by  arranging the bits of stone into piles and caverns  but without  light your seaweeds will neither thrive nor keep the water sweet   with plenty of light you will see to quote mr gosse once more  33 thousands of tiny globules forming on every plant and even  all over the stones where the infant vegetation is beginning to  grow and these globules presently rise in rapid succession to the  surface all over the vessel and this process goes on  uninterruptedly as long as the rays of the sun are uninterrupted  now these globules consist of pure oxygen given out by the plants  under the stimulus of light and to this oxygen the animals in the  tank owe their life  the difference between the profusion of  oxygenbubbles produced on a sunny day and the paucity of those  seen on a dark cloudy day or in a northern aspect is very  marked  choose therefore a south or east window but draw down  the blind or throw a handkerchief over all if the heat become  fierce  the water should always feel cold to your hand let the  temperature outside be what it may  next you must make up for evaporation by fresh water a very  little will suffice as often as in summer you find the water in  your vase sink below its original level and prevent the water from  getting too salt  for the salts remember do not evaporate with  the water and if you left the vase in the sun for a few weeks it  would become a mere brinepan  but how will you move your treasures up to town  the simplest plan which i have found successful is an earthen jar   you may buy them with a cover which screws on with two iron clasps   if you do not find such a piece of oilskin tied over the mouth is  enough  but do not fill the jar full of water leave about a  quarter of the contents in empty air which the water may absorb  and so keep itself fresh  and any pieces of stone or oysters  which you send up hang by a string from the mouth that they may  not hurt tender animals by rolling about the bottom  with these  simple precautions anything which you are likely to find will well  endure fortyeight hours of travel  what if the water fails after all  then mr gosses artificial seawater will form a perfect  substitute  you may buy the requisite salts for there are more  salts than salt in seawater from any chemist to whom mr gosse  has entrusted his discovery and according to his directions make  seawater for yourself  one more hint before we part  if after all you are not going  down to the seaside this year and have no opportunities of  testing the wonders of the shore you may still study natural  history in your own drawingroom by looking a little into the  wonders of the pond  i am not jesting a freshwater aquarium though by no means as  beautiful as a saltwater one is even more easily established  a  glass jar floored with two or three inches of pondmud which  should be covered with fine gravel to prevent the mud washing up  a specimen of each of two waterplants which you may buy now at any  good shop in covent garden vallisneria spiralis which is said to  give to the canvasbacked duck of america its peculiar richness of  flavour and anacharis alsinastrum that magical weed which  lately introduced from canada among timber has multiplied self sown to so prodigious an extent that it bid fair a few years  since to choke the navigation not only of our canals and fen rivers but of the thames itself  34 or in default of these  some of the more delicate pondweeds such as callitriche  potamogeton pusillum and best of all perhaps the beautiful  watermilfoil myriophyllium whose comblike leaves are the  haunts of numberless rare and curious animalcules these in  themselves from the transparency of their circulation interesting  microscopic objects for oxygenbreeding vegetables and for  animals the pickings of any pond a minnow or two an eft a few  of the delicate pondsnails unless they devour your plants too  rapidly  waterbeetles of activity inconceivable and that  wondrous bug the notonecta who lies on his back all day rowing  about his boatshaped body with one long pair of oars in search  of animalcules and the moment the lights are out turns head over  heels rights himself and opening a pair of handsome wings starts  to fly about the dark room in company with his friend the water beetle and i suspect catch flies and then slips back demurely  into the water with the first streak of dawn  but perhaps the most  interesting of all the tribes of the naiads  in default of  course of those semihuman nymphs with which our teutonic  forefathers like the greeks peopled each sacred fountain   are the little watercrickets which may be found running under  the pebbles or burrowing in little galleries in the banks  and  those caddises which crawl on the bottom in the stiller waters  enclosed all save the head and legs in a tube of sand or pebbles  shells or sticks green or dead weeds often arranged with quaint  symmetry or of very graceful shape  their aspect in this state  may be somewhat uninviting but they compensate for their youthful  ugliness by the strangeness of their transformations and often by  the delicate beauty of the perfect insects as the caddises  rising to the surface become flying phryganeae caperers and sand flies generally of various shades of fawncolour and the water crickets though an unscientific eye may be able to discern but  little difference in them in the larva or imperfect state  change into flies of the most various shapes  one perhaps into  the great sluggish olive stonefly perla bicaudata another  into the delicate lemoncoloured yellow sally chrysoperla  viridis another into the dark chocolate alder sialis lutaria   and the majority into duns and drakes ephemerae whose grace of  form and delicacy of colour give them a right to rank among the  most exquisite of gods creations from the tiny spinners baëtis  or chloron of incandescent glass with gorgeous rainbowcoloured  eyes to the great green drake ephemera vulgata known to all  fishermen as the prince of troutflies  these animals their  habits their miraculous transformations might give many an hours  quiet amusement to an invalid laid on a sofa or imprisoned in a  sickroom and debarred from reading unless by some such means  any page of that great green book outside whose pen is the finger  of god whose covers are the fire kingdoms and the star kingdoms  and its leaves the heatherbells and the polypes of the sea and  the gnats above the summer stream  i said just now that happy was the sportsman who was also a  naturalist  and having once mentioned these curious waterflies  i cannot help going a little farther and saying that lucky is the  fisherman who is also a naturalist  a fair scientific knowledge of  the flies which he imitates and of their habits would often  ensure him sport while other men are going home with empty creels   one would have fancied this a selfevident fact yet i have never  found any sound knowledge of the natural waterflies which haunt a  given stream except among cunning old fishermen of the lower  class who get their living by the gentle art and bring to indoors  baskets of trout killed on flies which look as if they had been  tied with a pair of tongs so rough and ungainly are they but  which nevertheless kill simply because they are in colour  which is all that fish really care for exact likenesses of some  obscure local species which happen to be on the water at the time   among gentlemenfishermen on the other hand so deep is the  ignorance of the natural fly that i have known good sportsmen  still under the delusion that the great green mayfly comes out of  a caddisbait the gentlemen having never seen much less fished  with that most deadly bait the watercricket or free creeping  larva of the mayfly which may be found in may under the river banks  the consequence of this ignorance is that they depend for  good patterns of flies on mere chance and experiment and that the  shop patterns originally excellent deteriorate continually till  little or no likeness to their living prototype remains being tied  by town girls who have no more understanding of what the feathers  and mohair in their hands represent than they have of what the  national debt represents  hence follows many a failure at the  streamside because the caperer or dun or yellow sally  which is produced from the flybook though possibly like the  brood which came out three years since on some stream a hundred  miles away is quite unlike the brood which is out today on ones  own river  for not only do most of these flies vary in colour in  different soils and climates but many of them change their hue  during life the ephemerae especially have a habit of throwing  off the whole of their skins even marvellously enough to the  skin of the eyes and wings and the delicate whisks at their  tail and appearing in an utterly new garb after ten minutes  rest to the discomfiture of the astonished angler  the natural history of these flies i understand from mr stainton  one of our most distinguished entomologists has not yet been  worked out at least for england  the only attempt i believe in  that direction is one made by a charming book the flyfishers  entomology which should be in every good anglers library but  why should not a few fishermen combine to work out the subject for  themselves and study for the interests both of science and their  own sport the wonders of the bank  the work petty as it may  seem is much too great for one man so prodigal is nature of her  forms in the stream as in the ocean but what if a correspondence  were opened between a few fishermen  of whom one should live say  by the hampshire or berkshire chalk streams another on the slates  and granites of devon another on the limestones of yorkshire or  derbyshire another among the yet earlier slates of snowdonia or  some mountain part of wales and more than one among the hills of  the border and the lakes of the highlands  each would find i  suspect on comparing his insects with those of the others that  he was exploring a little peculiar world of his own and that with  the exception of a certain number of typical forms the flies of  his county were unknown a hundred miles away or at least  appeared there under great differences of size and colour and  each if he would take the trouble to collect the caddises and  watercrickets and breed them into the perfect fly in an aquarium  would see marvels in their transformations their instincts their  anatomy quite as great though not perhaps as showy and  startling as i have been trying to point out on the seashore   moreover each and every one of the party i will warrant will  find his fellowcorrespondents perhaps previously unknown to him  men worth knowing not it may be of the meditative and half saintly type of dear old izaak walton who after all was no fly fisher but a sedentary popjoy guilty of float and worm but  rather like his flyfishing disciple cotton good fellows and men  of the world and perhaps something better over and above  the suggestion has been made  will it ever be taken up and a  naiad club formed for the combination of sport and science  and now how can this desultory little treatise end more usefully  than in recommending a few books on natural history fit for the  use of young people and fit to serve as introductions to such  deeper and larger works as yarrells birds and fishes bells  quadrupeds and crustacea forbes and hanleys mollusca  owens fossil mammals and birds and a host of other admirable  works  not that this list will contain all the best but simply  the best of which the writer knows let therefore none feel  aggrieved if as it may chance opening these pages they find  their books omitted  first and foremost certainly come mr gosses books  there is a  playful and genial spirit in them a brilliant power of word painting combined with deep and earnest religious feeling which  makes them as morally valuable as they are intellectually  interesting  since whites history of selborne few or no  writers on natural history save mr gosse mr g h lewes and  poor mr e forbes have had the power of bringing out the human  side of science and giving to seemingly dry disquisitions and  animals of the lowest type by little touches of pathos and humour  that living and personal interest to bestow which is generally the  special function of the poet  not that waterton and jesse are not  excellent in this respect and authors who should be in every boys  library  but they are rather anecdotists than systematic or  scientific inquirers while mr gosse in his naturalist on the  shores of devon his tour in jamaica his tenby and his  canadian naturalist has done for those three places what white  did for selborne with all the improved appliances of a science  which has widened and deepened tenfold since whites time  mr  gosses manual of the marine zoology of the british isles is for  classification by far the completest handbook extant  he has  contrived in it to compress more sound knowledge of vast classes of  the animal kingdom than i ever saw before in so small a space 35  miss anne pratts things of the seacoast is excellent and still  better is professor harveys seaside book of which it is  impossible to speak too highly and most pleasant it is to see a  man of genius and learning thus gathering the bloom of his varied  knowledge to put it into a form equally suited to a child and a  savant  seldom perhaps has there been a little book in which so  vast a quantity of facts have been told so gracefully simply  without a taint of pedantry or cumbrousness  an excellence which  is the sure and only mark of a perfect mastery of the subject  mr  g h lewess seashore studies are also very valuable hardly  perhaps a book for beginners but from his admirable power of  description whether of animals or of scenes is interesting for  all classes of readers  two little popular histories  one of british zoophytes the  other of british seaweeds by dr landsborough since dead of  cholera at saltcoats the scene of his energetic and pious  ministry  are very excellent and are furnished too with well drawn and coloured plates for the comfort of those to whom a  scientific nomenclature as liable as any other human thing to be  faulty and obscure conveys but a vague conception of the objects   these may serve well for the beginner as introductions to  professor harveys large work on british algae and to the new  edition of professor johnstons invaluable british zoophytes  miss giffords marine botanist third edition and dr cockss  seaweed collectors guide have also been recommended by a high  authority  for general zoology the best books for beginners are perhaps as a  general introduction the rev j a l woods popular zoology  full of excellent plates and for systematic zoology mr gosses  four little books on mammals birds reptiles and fishes  published with many plates by the christian knowledge society at  a marvellously cheap rate  for miscroscopic animalcules miss  agnes catlows drops of water will teach the young more than they  will ever remember and serve as a good introduction to those  teeming abysses of the unseen world which must be afterwards  traversed under the guidance of hassall and ehrenberg  for ornithology there is no book after all like dear old bewick  passe though he may be in a scientific point of view  there is a  good little british ornithology too published in sir w jardines  naturalists library and another by mr gosse  and mr knoxs  ornithological rambles in sussex with mr st johns highland  sports and tour in sutherlandshire are the monographs of  naturalists gentlemen and sportsmen which remind one at every  page and what higher praise can one give of whites history of  selborne  these last with mr gosses canadian naturalist and  his little book the ocean not forgetting darwins delightful  voyage of the beagle and adventure ought to be in the hands of  every lad who is likely to travel to our colonies  for general geology professor ansteds introduction is excellent  while as a specimen of the way in which a single district may be  thoroughly worked out and the universal method of induction learnt  from a narrow field of objects what book can or perhaps ever  will compare with mr hugh millers old red sandstone  for this last reason i especially recommend to the young the rev  c a johnss week at the lizard as teaching a young person how  much there is to be seen and known within a few square miles of  these british isles  but indeed all mr johnss books are good  as they are bound to be considering his most accurate and varied  knowledge especially his flowers of the field the best cheap  introduction to systematic botany which has yet appeared  trained  and all but selftrained like mr hugh miller in a remote and  narrow field of observation mr johns has developed himself into  one of our most acute and persevering botanists and has added many  a new treasure to the flora of these isles and one person at  least owes him a deep debt of gratitude for first lessons in  scientific accuracy and patience  lessons taught not dully and  dryly at the book and desk but livingly and genially in  adventurous rambles over the bleak cliffs and ferny woods of the  wild atlantic shore    where the old fable of the guarded mount looks toward namancos and bayonas hold   mr henfreys rudiments of botany might accompany mr johnss  books  mr babingtons manual of british botany is also most  compact and highly finished and seems the best work which i know  of from which a student somewhat advanced in english botany can  verify species while for ferns moores handbook is probably the  best for beginners  for entomology which after all is the study most fit for boys  as botany is for girls who have no opportunity for visiting the  seashore catlows popular british entomology having coloured  plates a delight to young people and saying something of all the  orders is probably still a good work for beginners  mr staintons entomologists annual for 1855 contains valuable  hints of that gentlemans on taking and arranging moths and  butterflies as well as of mr wollastons on performing the same  kind office for that far more numerous and not less beautiful  class the beetles  there is also an admirable manual of british  butterflies and moths by mr stainton in course of publication  but perhaps the most interesting of all entomological books which  i have seen and for introducing me to which i must express my  hearty thanks to mr stainton is practical hints respecting  moths and butterflies forming a calendar of entomological  operations 36 by richard shield a simple london workingman  i would gladly devote more space than i can here spare to a review  of this little book so perfectly does it corroborate every word  which i have said already as to the moral and intellectual value of  such studies  richard shield making himself a firstrate  lepidopterist while working with his hands for a pound a week  is the antitype of mr peach the coastguardsman among his  cornish tiderocks  but more than this there is about shields  book a tone as of izaak walton himself which is very delightful  tender poetical and religious yet full of quiet quaintness and  humour showing in every page how the love for natural history is  in him only one expression of a love for all things beautiful and  pure and right  if any readers of these pages fancy that i over praise the book let them buy it and judge for themselves  they  will thus help the good man toward pursuing his studies with larger  and better appliances and will be as i expect surprised to find  how much there is to be seen and done even by a workingman  within a days walk of smoky babylon itself and how easily a man  might if he would wash his soul clean for a while from all the  turmoil and intrigue the vanity and vexation of spirit of that  toopopulous wilderness by going out to be alone a while with  god in heaven and with that earth which he has given to the  children of men not merely for the material wants of their bodies  but as a witness and a sacrament that in him they live and move  and have their being not by bread alone but by every word that  proceedeth out of the mouth of god   thus i wrote some twenty years ago when the study of natural  history was confined mainly to several scientific men or mere  collectors of shells insects and dried plants  since then i am glad to say it has become a popular and common  pursuit owing i doubt not to the impulse given to it by the many  authors whose works i then recommended  i recommend them still  though a swarm of other manuals and popular works have appeared  since excellent in their way and almost beyond counting  but all  honour to those and above all to mr gosse and mr johns who  first opened peoples eyes to the wonders around them all day long   now we have in addition to amusing books on special subjects  serials on natural history more or less profound and suited to  every kind of student and every grade of knowledge  i mention the  names of none  for first they happily need no advertisement from  me and next i fear to be unjust to any one of them by  inadvertently omitting its name  let me add that in the  advertising columns of those serials will be found notices of all  the new manuals and of all apparatus and other matters needed by  amateur naturalists and of many who are more than amateurs   microscopy meanwhile and the whole study of the wonders of the  little have made vast strides in the last twenty years and i was  equally surprised and pleased to find three years ago in each of  two towns of a few thousand inhabitants perhaps a dozen good  microscopes all but hidden away from the public worked by men who  knew how to handle them and who knew what they were looking at  but who modestly refrained from telling anybody what they were  doing so well  and it was this very discovery of unsuspected  microscopists which made me more desirous than ever to see  as i  see now in many places  scientific societies by means of which  the few who otherwise would work apart may communicate their  knowledge to each other and to the many  these microscopic  naturalist geological or other societies and the field  clubs for excursions into the country which are usually connected  with them form a most pleasant and hopeful new feature in english  society bringing together as they do almost all ranks all  shades of opinion and it has given me deep pleasure to see in the  case at least of the country clubs with which i am acquainted the  clergy of the church of england taking an active and often a  leading interest in their practical work  the town clergy are  for the most part too utterly overworked to follow the example of  their country brethren  but i have reason to know that they regard  such societies and natural history in general with no unfriendly  eyes and that there is less fear than ever that the clergy of the  church of england should have to relinquish their ancient boast   that since the formation of the royal society in the seventeenth  century they have done more for sound physical science than any  other priesthood or ministry in the world  let me advise anyone  who may do me the honour of reading these pages to discover  whether such a club or society exists in his neighbourhood and to  join it forthwith certain that  if his experience be at all like  mine  he will gain most pleasant information and most pleasant  acquaintances and pass most pleasant days and evenings among  people whom he will be glad to know and whom he never would have  known save for the new  and now i hope rapidly spreading   freemasonry of natural history  meanwhile i hope  though i dare not say i trust  to see the day  when the boys of each of our large schools shall join  like those  of marlborough and clifton  the same freemasonry and have their  own naturalists clubs nay more when our public schools and  universities shall awake to the real needs of the age and  even  to the curtailing of the time usually spent in not learning latin  and greek  teach boys the rudiments at least of botany zoology  geology and so forth and when the public opinion at least of the  refined and educated shall consider it as ludicrous  to use no  stronger word  to be ignorant of the commonest facts and laws of  this living planet as to be ignorant of the rudiments of two dead  languages  all honour to the said two languages  ignorance of  them is a serious weakness for it implies ignorance of many things  else and indeed without some knowledge of them the nomenclature  of the physical sciences cannot be mastered  but i have got to  discover that a boys time is more usefully spent and his  intellect more methodically trained by getting up ovids fasti  with an ulterior hope of being able to write a few latin verses  than in getting up professor rollestons forms of animal life or  any other of the excellent scientific manuals for beginners which  are now as i said happily so numerous  may that day soon come and an old dream of mine and of my  scientific friends be fulfilled at last  and so i end this little book hoping even praying that it may  encourage a few more labourers to go forth into a vineyard which  those who have toiled in it know to be full of everfresh health  and wonder and simple joy and the presence and the glory of him  whose name is love    appendix    plate i    zoophyta  polyzoa  the forms of animal life which are now united in an independent  class under the name polyzoa so nearly resemble the hydroid  zoophytes in general form and appearance that a casual observer may  suppose them to be nearly identical  in all but the more recent  works they are treated as distinct indeed but still included  under the general term zoophytes  the animals of both groups are  minute polypiform creatures mostly living in transparent cells  springing from the sides of a stem which unites a number of  individuals in one common life and grows in a shrublike form upon  any submarine body such as a shell a rock a weed or even  another polypidom to which it is parasitically attached  each  polype in both classes protrudes from and retreats within its  cell by an independent action and when protruded puts forth a  circle of tentacles whose motion round the mouth is the means of  securing nourishment  there are however peculiarities in the  structure of the polyzoa which seem to remove them from  zoophytology to a place in the system of nature more nearly  connected with molluscan types  some of them come so near to the  compound ascidians that they have been termed as an order  zoophyta ascidioida  the simplest form of polype is that of a fleshy bag open at one  end surmounted by a circle of contractile threads or fingers  called tentacles  the plate shows on a very minute scale at  figs 1 3 and 6 several of these little polypiform bodies  protruding from their cells  but the hydra or freshwater polype  has no cell and is quite unconnected with any root thread or with  other individuals of the same species  it is perfectly free and  so simple in its structure that when the sac which forms its body  is turned inside out it will continue to perform the functions of  life as before  the greater part however of these hydraform  polypes although equally simple as individuals are connected in a  compound life by means of their variously formed polypidom as the  branched system of cells is termed  the hydroid zoophytes are  represented in the first plate by the following examples   hydroida   sertularia rosea  pl i fig 6  a species which has the cells in pairs on opposite sides of the  central tube with the openings turned outwards  in the more  enlarged figure is seen a septum across the inner part of each cell  which forms the base upon which the polype rests  fig 6 b  indicates the natural size of the piece of branch represented but  it must be remembered that this is only a small portion of the  bushy shrub   campanularia syringa  pl i fig 8   this zoophyte twines itself parasitically upon a species of  sertularia  the cells in this species are thrown out at irregular  intervals upon flexible stems which are wrinkled in rings  they  consist of lengthened cylindrical transparent vases   campanularia volubilis  pl i fig 9   a still more beautiful species with lengthened footstalks ringed  at each end  the polype is remarkable for the protrusion and  contractile power of its lips  it has about twenty knobbed  tentacula   polyzoa   among polyzoa the animals body is coated with a membraneous  covering like that of the tunicated mollusca but which is a  continuation of the edge of the cell which doubles back upon the  body in such a manner that when the animal protrudes from its cell  it pushes out the flexible membrane just as one would turn inside  out the finger of a glove  this oneness of cell and polype is a  distinctive character of the group  another is the higher  organization of the internal parts  the mouth surrounded by  tentacles leads by gullet and gizzard through a channel into a  digesting stomach from which the rejectable matter passes upwards  through an intestinal canal till it is discharged near the mouth   the tentacles also differ much from those of true polypes  instead  of being fleshy and contractile they are rather stiff resembling  spun glass set on the sides with vibrating cilia which by their  motion up one side and down the other of each tentacle produce a  current which impels their living food into the mouth  when these  tentacles are withdrawn they are gathered up in a bundle like the  stays of an umbrella  our plate i contains the following examples  of polyzoa   valkeria cuscuta pl i fig 3   from a group in one of mr lloyds vases  fig 3 a is the natural  size of the central group of cells in a specimen coiled round a  threadlike weed  underneath this is the same portion enlarged   when magnified to this apparent size the cells could be seen in  different states some closed and others with their bodies  protruded  when magnified to 3 d we could pleasantly watch the  gradual eversion of the membrane then the points of the tentacles  slowly appearing and then when fully protruded suddenly  expanding into a bellshaped circle  this was their usual  appearance but sometimes they could be noticed bending inwards as  in fig 3 c as if to imprison some living atom of importance   fig b represents two tentacles showing the direction in which the  cilia vibrate   crisia denticulata  pl i fig 4   i have only drawn the cells from a prepared specimen  the polypes  are like those described above   gemellaria loricata  pl i fig 5   here the cells are placed in pairs back to back  5 a is a very  small portion on the natural scale   cellularia ciliata  pl i fig 7   the cells are alternate on the stem and are curiously armed with  long whiplike cilia or spines  on the back of some of the cells  is a very strange appendage the use of which is not with certainty  ascertained  it is a minute body slightly resembling a vultures  head with a movable lower beak  the whole head keeps up a nodding  motion and the movable beak occasionally opens widely and then  suddenly snaps to with a jerk  it has been seen to hold an  animalcule between its jaws till the latter has died but it has no  power to communicate the prey to the polype in its cell or to  swallow and digest it on its own account  it is certainly not an  independent parasite as has been supposed and yet its purpose in  the animal economy is a mystery  mr gosse conjectures that its  use may be by holding animalcules till they die and decay to  attract by their putrescence crowds of other animalcules which may  thus be drawn within the influence of the polypes ciliated  tentacles  fig 7 b shows the form of one of these birds heads  and fig 7 c its position on the cell   flustra lineata  pl i fig 1   in flustrae the cells are placed side by side on an expanded  membrane  fig 1 represents the general appearance of a species  which at least resembles f lineata as figured in johnstons work   it is spread upon a fucus  fig a is an enlarged view of the  cells   flustra foliacea  pl i fig 2   we figure a frond or two of the common species which has cells on  both sides  it is rarely that the polypes can be seen in a state  of expansion   serialaria lendigera  pl i fig 10  notamia bursaria  pl  i fig 11   the tobaccopipe appendages fig 11 b are of unknown use   they are probably analogous to the birds heads in the cellularae    plate v    corals and sea anemones   caryophyllaea smithii  pl v fig 2  pl vi fig 3   the connection between brainstones mushroom corals and other  madrepores abounding on polynesian reefs and the sea anemones  which have lately become so familiar to us all can be seen by  comparing our comparatively insignificant c smithii with our  commonest species of actinia and sagartia  the former is a  beautiful object when the fleshy part and tentacles are wholly or  partially expanded  like actinia it has a membranous covering a  simple saclike stomach a central mouth a disk surrounded by  contractile and adhesive tentacles  unlike actinia it is fixed to  submarine bodies to which it is glued in very early life and  cannot change its place  unlike actinia its body is supported by  a stony skeleton of calcareous plates arranged edgewise so as to  radiate from the centre  but as we find some molluscs furnished  with a shell and others even of the same character and habits  without one so we find that in spite of this seemingly important  difference the animals are very similar in their nature  since  the introduction of glass tanks we have opportunities of seeing  anemones crawling up the sides so as to exhibit their entire basal  disk and then we may observe lightly coloured lines of a less  transparent substance than the interstices radiating from the  margin to the centre some short others reaching the entire  distance and arranged in exactly the same manner as the plates of  caryophyllaea  these are doubtless flexible walls of compartments  dividing the fleshy parts of the softer animals and corresponding  with the septa of the coral  fig 2 a represents a section of the  latter to be compared with the basal disk of sagartia   sagartia anguicoma  pl v fig 3 a b   this genus has been separated from actinia on account of its habit  of throwing out threads when irritated  although my specimens  often assumed the form represented in fig 3 mr lloyd informs me  that it must have arisen from unhealthiness of condition its usual  habit being to contract into a more flattened form  when fully  expanded its transparent and lengthened tentacles present a  beautiful appearance  fig 3 a showing a basal disk is given for  the purpose already described   balanophyllaea regia  pl v fig 1   another species of british madrepore found by mr gosse at  ilfracombe and by mr kingsley at lundy island  it is smaller  than o smithii of a very bright colour and always covers the  upper part of its bony skeleton in which the plates are  differently arranged from those of the smaller species  fig 1  shows the tentacles expanded in an unusual degree 1 a animal  contracted 1 b the coral 1 c a tentacle enlarged    plate vi    corals and sea anemones  actinia mesembryanthemum  pl vi fig 1 a   this common species is more frequently met with than many others  because it prefers shallow water and often lives high up among  rocks which are only covered by the sea at very high tide so that  the creature can if it will spend but a short portion of its time  immersed  when uncovered by the tide it gathers up its leathery  tunic and presents the appearance of fig 1 a  when under water  it may often be seen expanding its flowerlike disk and moving its  feelers in search of food  these feelers have a certain power of  adhesion and any not too vigorous animals which they touch are  easily drawn towards the centre and swallowed  around the margin  of the tunic are seen peeping out between the tentacles certain  bright blue globules looking very like eyes but whose purpose is  not exactly ascertained  fig 1 represents the disk only partially  expanded   bunodes crassicornis  pl vi fig 2   this genus of actinioid zoophytes is distinguished from actinia  proper by the tubercles or warts which stud the outer covering of  the animal  in b gemmacea these warts are arranged symmetrically  so as to give a peculiarly jewelled appearance to the body  being  of a large size the tentacles of b crassicornis exhibit in great  perfection the adhesive powers produced by the nettling threads  which proceed from them   caryophyllaea smithii  pl vi fig 3   this figure is to show a whiter variety with the flesh and  tentacles fully expanded    plate viii    mollusca  nassa reticulata  pl viii fig 2 a b c d e f   a very active mollusc given here chiefly on account of the  opportunity afforded by the birth of young fry in mr lloyds  tanks  the nassa feeds on small animalcules for which in  aquaria it may be seen routing among the sand and stones  sometimes burying itself among them so as only to show its caudal  tube moving along between them  a pair of nassae in mr lloyds  collection deposited on the 5th of april about fifty capsules or  bags of eggs upon the stems of weeds fig 2 b each capsule  contained about a hundred eggs  the capsules opened on the 16th of  may permitting the escape of rotiferous fry fig 2 c d e not  in the slightest degree resembling the parent but presenting  minute nautilusshaped transparent shells  these shells rather  hang on than cover the bodies which have a pair of lobes around  which vibrate minute cilia in such a manner as to give them an  appearance of rotatory motion  under a lens they may be seen  moving about very actively in various positions but always with  the look of being moved by rapidly turning wheels  we should have  been glad to witness the next step towards assuming their ultimate  form but were disappointed as the embryos died  fig 2 f is the  tongue of a nassa from a photograph by dr kingsley    footnotes  1 sertularia operculata and gemellaria lociculata or any of the  small sertulariae compared with crisiae and cellulariae are very  good examples  for a fuller description of these see appendix  explaining plate i  2 if any inland reader wishes to see the action of this foot in  the bivalve molluscs let him look at the common pondmussel  anodon cygneus which he will find in most stagnant waters and  see how he burrows with it in the mud and how when the water is  drawn off he walks solemnly into deeper water leaving a furrow  behind him  3 these shells are so common that i have not cared to figure  them  4 plate ix fig 3 represents both parasites on the dead
