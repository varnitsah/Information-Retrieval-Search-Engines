loured over the world time seemed to stand still a universal astonishment and confusion fell as upon a flock of sheep perplexed by strange dogs but now though never before was a st lucys day so black with absence darkness death christmas is gone spring comes swiftly the almond trees flourish easter will soon be here life breaks into beauty again and we realize that man may bring hell itself into the world but that nature ever patiently waits to be his natural paradise yet still a kind of instinctive blindness blots out the prospect of the future until the long horror of the war is gone from our minds we shall be able to think of nothing that has not for its background a chaotic darkness like every obsession it gnaws at thought follows us into our dreams and returns with the morning but there have been other wars and humanity after learning as best it may their brutal lesson has survived them just as the young soldier leaves home behind him and accepts hardship and danger as to the manner born so when he returns again life will resume its old quiet wont nature is not idle even in the imagination it is mans salvation to forget no less than it is his salvation to remember and it is wise even in the midst of the conflict to look back on those that are past and to prepare for the returning problems of the future  when whitman wrote his democratic vistas the long embittered war between the northern and southern states of america was a thing only of yesterday it is a headlong amorphous productiona tangled meadow of leaves of grass in prose but it is as cogent today as it was when it was written      to the ostent of the senses and eyes he writes the influences     which stamp the worlds history are wars uprisings or downfalls     of dynasties these of course play their part yet it may     be a single new thought imagination abstract principle  put     in shape by some great literatus and projected among mankind     may duly cause changes growths removals greater than the     longest and bloodiest war or the most stupendous merely     political dynastic or commercial overturn  the literatus who realized this had his own message in mind and yet justly for those who might point to the worldly prosperity and material comforts of his country and ask are not these better indeed than any utterances even of greatest rhapsodic artist or literatus he has his irrefutable answer he surveys the new york of 1870 its fa√ßades of marble and iron of original grandeur and elegance of design etc in his familiar catalogical jargon and shutting his eyes to its glow and grandeur inquires in return are there indeed men here worthy the name are there perfect women is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners are there arts worthy freedom and a rich people is there a great moral and religious civilizationthe only justification of a great material one we ourselves in good time shall have to face and to answer these questions they search our keenest hopes of the peace that is coming and we may be fortified perhaps by the following queer proof of history repeating itself      never in the old world was thoroughly upholsterd exterior     appearance and show mental and other built entirely on the idea     of caste and on the sufficiency of mere outside     acquisitionnever were glibness verbal intellect more the     test the emulationmore loftily elevated as head and sample     than they are on the surface of our republican states this day     the writers of a time hint the mottoes of its gods the word of     the modern say these voices is the word culture  whitman had no very tender regard for the germany of his time he fancied that the germans were like the chinese only less graceful and refined and more brutish but neither had he any particular affection for any relic of europe never again will we trust the moral sense or abstract friendliness of a single government of the old world he accepted selections from its literature for the new american adam but even its greatest poets were not americas and though he might welcome even juvenal it was for use and not for worship we have to learn he insists that the best culture will always be that of the manly and courageous instincts and loving perceptions and of selfrespect in our children rests every hope and promise and therefore in their mothers disengage yourselves from parties these savage and wolfish parties alarm me hold yourself judge and master over all of them only faith can save us the faith in ourselves and in our fellowmen which is of the true faith in goodness and in god the idea of the mass of men so fresh and free so loving and so proud filled this poet with a singular awe passionately he pleads for the dignity of the common people it is the average man of a land that is important to win the people back to a proud belief and confidence in life to rapture in this wonderful world to love and admirationthis was his burning desire i demand races of orbic bards he rhapsodizes sweet democratic despots to dominate and even destroy the future vistas the throes of birth are upon us allons camarado  he could not despair must i indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled he asks himself in drumtaps but wildest shuttlecock of criticism though he is he has never yet been charged with looking only on the dark side of things once he says once before the war alas i dare not say how many times the mood has come i too was filld with doubt and gloom his part in it soothed mellowed deepened his great nature he had himself witnessed such misery cruelty and abomination as it is best just now perhaps not to read about one fact alone is enough that over fifty thousand federal soldiers perished of starvation in southern prisons malarial fever contracted in camps and hospitals had wrecked his health during 186265 he visited he says eighty to a hundred thousand sick and wounded soldiers comprehending all slighting none rebel or compatriot it made no difference i loved the young man he cries again and again pity and fatherliness were in his face for his heart was full of them mr gosse has described the old gray as he saw him in 1884 in his bare littered sundrenched room in camden shared by kitten and canary      he sat with a very curious pose of the head thrown backward as     if resting it one vertebra lower down the spinal column than     other people do and thus tilting his face a little upwards with     his head so poised and the whole man fixed in contemplation of     the interlocutor he seemed to pass into a state of absolute     passivity  the glassy eyes half closed the large knotted     hands spread out before him he resembled in fact nothing so     much as a great old grey angora tom alert in repose serenely     blinking under his combed waves of hair with eyes inscrutably     dreaming as i stood in dull deserted mickle street once     more my heart was full of affection for this beautiful old man      this old rhapsodist in his empty room glorified by patience     and philosophy  whitman was then sixtyfive in a portrait of thirty years before there is just a wraith of that feline dream perhaps but it is a face of a rare grace and beauty that looks out at us of a profound kindness and compassion and in the eyes not so much penetration as visionary absorption such was the man to whom nothing was unclean nothing too trivial except pale poetlings lisping cadenzas piano who then apparently thronged new york to take to himself intensest indomitablest of individualists he exulted in all that appertains to that forked radish man this contentious soul of mine he exclaims ecstatically viva the attack i have been born the same as the war was born i lull nobody and you will never understand me maybe i am nonliterary and undecorous i have written impromptu and shall let it all go at that let me at least be human human indeed he was a tender allwelcoming host of everyman of his idolized if somewhat overpowering american democracy man in the street in his swarms poor crazed faces in the state asylum prisoners in sing sing prostitute whose dead body reminded him not of a lost soul but only of a sad forlorn and empty houseit mattered not he opened his heart to them one and all i see beyond each mark that wonder a kindred soul o the bullet could never kill what you really are dear friend    the moon gives you light   and the bugles and drums give you music   and my heart o my soldiers my veterans   my heart gives you love  yours for you he exclaims welding in a phrase his unparalleled egotism his beautiful charity yours for you who ever you are as mine for me it is the essence of philosophy and of religion for all the wonders of heaven and earth are significant only because of the me in the centre  this was the secret of his tender unassuming ministrations he had none of that shrinking timidity that fear of intrusion that uneasiness in the presence of the tragic and the pitiful which so often numb and oppress those who would willingly give themselves and their best to the needy and suffering but whose intellect misgives them he was that formidable phenomenon a dreamer of action but he possessed a sovran good sense food and rest and clean clothes were his scrupulous preparation for his visits he always assumed as cheerful an appearance as possible armed with bright new fivecent and tencent bills the wounded he found were often broke and the sight of a little money helped their spirits with books and stationery and tobacco for one a twist of good strong green tea for another a good homemade ricepudding or a jar of sparkling but innocent blackberry and cherry syrup a small bottle of horseradish pickle or a large handsome apple he would make friends what i have i also give you he cried from the bottom of his grieved tempestuous heart he would talk or write letterspassionate loveletters tooor sit silent in mute and tender kindness long long i gazed  leaning my chin in my hands passing sweet hours immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comradenot a tear not a word vigil of silence love and death vigil for you my son and my soldier and how many a mother must have blessed the stranger who could bring such last news of a son as this and now like many other noble and good men after serving his country as a soldier he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service such things are gloomyyet there is a text god doeth all things wellthe meaning of which after due time appears to the soul it is only love that can comfort the loving  he forced nothing on these friends of a day so many of them near their last farewell a poor wasted young man asks him to read a chapter in the new testament and whitman chooses that which describes christs crucifixion he askd me to read the following chapter also how christ rose again i read very slowly for he was feeble it pleased him very much yet the tears were in his eyes he askd me if i enjoyd religion i said perhaps not my dear in the way you mean yet maybe it is the same thing this is only one of many such serene intimacies in whitmans experiences of the war through them we reach to an understanding of a poet who chose not signal and beautiful episodes out of the past nor the rare moments of existence for theme but took all life within and around him in vast bustling america for his poetic province like a benign barbaric sun he surveys the world ever at noon i am the man i sufferd i was there he cries in the song of myself i do not despise you priests all times the world over he could not despise anything not even his fellowpoets because he himself was everything his verse sometimes seems mere verbiage but it is always a higgledypiggledy santa claus bagful of things and he could penetrate to the essential reality he tells in his drumtaps how one daybreak he arose in camp and saw three still forms stretched out in the eastern radiance how with light fingers he just lifted the blanket from each cold face in turn the first elderly gaunt and grimwho are you my dear comrade the next with cheeks yet bloomingwho are you sweet boy the thirdyoung man i think i know you i think this face is the face of the christ himself dead and divine and brother of all and here again he lies  true poetry focuses experience not merely transmits it it must redeem it for ever from transitoriness and evanescence whitman incontinently pours experience out in a niagaralike cataract but in spite of his habitual publicity he was at heart of a shy brooding impassioned devotional type in spite of his selfconscious arrogant virility he was to the end of his life an entranced child he came into the world saw and babbled his deliberate method of writing could have had no other issue a subject would occur to him a kind of tag he would scribble it down on a scrap of paper and drop it into a drawer day by day this first impulse would evoke fresh poemets until at length the accumulation was exhaustive then he merely gutted his treasury and the ode was complete it was only when sense and feeling attained a sort of ecstasy that he succeeded in distilling the true essence that is poetry and in enstopping it in a crystal phial of form  the prose of his specimen days indeed is often nearer to poetry than his verse      much of the time he sleeps or half sleeps i often come and     sit by him in perfect silence he will breathe for ten minutes as     softly and evenly as a young babe asleep poor youth so     handsome athletic with profuse beautiful shining hair one time     as i sat looking at him while he lay asleep he suddenly without     the least start awakend opend his eyes gave me a long steady     look turning his face very slightly to gaze easierone long     clear silent looka slight sighthen turnd back and went into     his doze again little he knew poor deathstricken boy the     heart of the stranger that hoverd near      the western star venus in the earlier hours of evening has     never been so large so clear it seems as if it told something     as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity with us americans     the sky dark blue the transparent night the planets the     moderate west wind the elastic temperature the miracle of that     great star and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west     suffused the soul then i heard slow and clear the deliberate     notes of a bugle come up out of the silence  firm and     faithful floating along rising falling leisurely with here     and there a longdrawn note sounding tattoo  a steady rain dark and thick and warm he writes again two days after gettysburg the cavalry camp is a ceaseless field of observation to me this forenoon there stood the horses tetherd together dripping steaming chewing their hay the men emerge from their tents dripping also the fires are halfquenchd there is a poetic poise in this brief vivid statement apart from its bare economy of means it is the lump awaiting the leaven no less than is cavalry crossing a ford to this supreme spectator an apple orchard in may even the white house in moonlight no more and no less than these battlescenes rendered up their dignity life and beauty their true human significance but in drumtaps the witness is not always so satisfactory the secret has evaporated in the effort to make poetry or halfconsciously to inject a moral to play the universal bard there creeps into the words a tinge of the raw and the grotesque the poet has the look of a cowboy off the stage tanned with greasepaint but again and again the secret creeps back and some lovely emanation of poetry is added to it    look down fair moon and bathe this scene   pour softly down nights nimbus floods on faces ghastly swollen             purple   on the dead on their backs with arms tossd wide   pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon  or this called reconciliation    word over all beautiful as the sky   beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be             utterly lost   that the hands of the sisters death and night incessantly softly wash             again and ever again this soild world   for my enemy is dead a man divine as myself is dead   i look where he lies whitefaced and still in the coffini draw             near   bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the             coffin  the bonds of rhyme shackled him deprived him of more than freedom he is like a wild bird that suddenly perceives the bars of its small cage across the blue of the sky and yet the finer his poems are the nearer they approach to definite rhythmical design one has only to compare o captain my captain with hushed be the camps today to perceive this curious paradox they are both of them memories of his beloved lincoln whom he had many times seen with that peculiarly close and transatlantic curiosity of his riding at a jogtrot on a goodsized easygoing grey horse with his escort of yellowstriped cavalry behind him through the streets of washingtondressed in black somewhat rusty and dusty with a black stiff hat almost as ordinary in attire as the commonest man that heroic face too he had pierced and caught from it the deep subtle indirect expression that only the longgone masterpainters of the old world could have seized and immortalized and in yet another memory of this great american whitman attains to his best and highest when lilacs last in the doorway bloomd it is one of the most beautiful of poems of the purest intuition of a consummate if unconscious artistry whose voice is it that rings and echoes now low and tender now solemn and desolate now clear full victorious out of its cloistral solitudethat of the mourner himself of allheedfull heedless nature of the immortal soul of man or just a bird the shy and hidden sweet small hermit thrush the last division of his lifes workhis fond epic his cosmic inventoryas whitman planned it was to be devoted to the chaunting of songs of death and immortality the soldier to whom he read of christs resurrection talked of death to him and said he did not fear it he talked to a man who did not enjoy religion in the way a christian means to whom the mystery of easter is an allsufficing reliance but whitman not only did not fear death the thought of it was to him the strangest of raptures the reverie of a child dreaming of a distant mother soon to come again death and immortality were but two aspects of the same blessed hope to this man who poured out his life in a turgid fount of ecstatic joy in living     and i saw askant the armies   i saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battleflags   borne through the smoke of the battles and piercd with missiles i             saw them   and carried hither and yon through the smoke and torn and bloody   and at last but a few shreds left on the staffs and all in silence   and the staffs all splintered and broken    i saw battlecorpses myriads of them   and the white skeletons of young men i saw them   i saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war   but i saw they were not as was thought   they themselves were fully at rest they sufferd not   the living remaind and sufferd the mother sufferd   and the wives and the child and the musing comrade sufferd   and the armies that remaind sufferd    come lovely and soothing death   undulate round the world serenely arriving arriving   in the night in the day to all to each   sooner or later delicate death    praisd be the fathomless universe   for life and joy and for objects and knowledge curious   and for love sweet lovebut praise praise praise   for the sureenwinding arms of coolenfolding death    dark mother always gliding near with soft feet   have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome   then i chant it for thee i glorify thee above all   i bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come come

eyes are almost done   your faculties serve you and presently i must have them serve me   rest while i tell what the crowd around us means   on the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising   there is the camp one regiment departs tomorrow   do you hear the officers giving their orders   do you hear the clank of the muskets    why what comes over you now old man   why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively   the troops are but drilling they are yet surrounded with smiles   around them at hand the welldrest friends and the women   while splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down   green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze   oer proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between   but drill and parade are over they march back to quarters   only hear that approval of hands hear what a clapping    as wending the crowds now part and dispersebut we old man   not for nothing have i brought you hitherwe must remain   you to speak in your turn and i to listen and tell    the centenarian    when i clutchd your hand it was not with terror   but suddenly pouring about me here on every side   and below there where the boys were drilling and up the slopes they             ran   and where tents are pitchd and wherever you see south and             southeast and southwest   over hills across lowlands and in the skirts of woods   and along the shores in mire now filld over came again and             suddenly raged   as eightyfive years agone no mere parade receivd with applause of             friends   but a battle which i took part in myselfaye long ago as it is i             took part in it   walking then this hilltop this same ground    aye this is the ground   my blind eyes even as i speak behold it repeopled from graves   the years recede pavements and stately houses disappear   rude forts appear again the old hoopd guns are mounted   i see the lines of raisd earth stretching from river to bay   i mark the vista of waters i mark the uplands and slopes   here we lay encampd it was this time in summer also    as i talk i remember all i remember the declaration   it was read here the whole army paraded it was read to us here   by his staff surrounded the general stood in the middle he held up             his unsheathd sword   it glitterd in the sun in full sight of the army    twas a bold act thenthe english warships had just arrived   we could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor   and the transports swarming with soldiers    a few days more and they landed and then the battle    twenty thousand were brought against us   a veteran force furnishd with good artillery   i tell not now the whole of the battle   but one brigade early in the forenoon orderd forward to engage the             redcoats   of that brigade i tell and how steadily it marchd   and how long and well it stood confronting death    who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting             death   it was the brigade of the youngest men two thousand strong   raised in virginia and maryland and most of them known personally to             the general    jauntily forward they went with quick step toward gowanus waters   till of a sudden unlookd for by defiles through the woods gaind at             night   the british advancing rounding in from the east fiercely playing             their guns   that brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemys mercy    the general watchd them from this hill   they made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment   they drew close together very compact their flag flying in the             middle   but o from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them    it sickens me yet that slaughter   i saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the general   i saw how he wrung his hands in anguish    meanwhile the british manoeuvrd to draw us out for a pitchd battle   but we dared not trust the chances of a pitchd battle    we fought the fight in detachments   sallying forth we fought at several points but in each the luck was             against us   our foe advancing steadily getting the best of it pushd us back to             the works on this hill   till we turnd menacing here and then he left us    that was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men two             thousand strong   few returnd nearly all remain in brooklyn   that and here my generals first battle   no women looking on nor sunshine to bask in it did not conclude with             applause   nobody clappd hands here then    but in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain   wearied that night we lay foild and sullen   while scornfully laughd many an arrogant lord oft against us             encampd   quite within hearing feasting clinking wineglasses together over             their victory    so dull and damp and another day   but the night of that mist lifting rain ceasing   silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him my             general retreated    i saw him at the riverside   down by the ferry lit by torches hastening the embarcation   my general waited till the soldiers and wounded were all passd over   and then it was just ere sunrise these eyes rested on him for the             last time    every one else seemd filld with gloom   many no doubt thought of capitulation    but when my general passd me   as he stood in his boat and lookd toward the coming sun   i saw something different from capitulation    terminus    enough the centenarians story ends   the two the past and present have interchanged   i myself as connecter as chansonnier of a great future am now             speaking    and is this the ground washington trod   and these waters i listlessly daily cross are these the waters he             crossd   as resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs    i must copy the story and send it eastward and westward   i must preserve that look as it beamd on you rivers of brooklyn    seeas the annual round returns the phantoms return   it is the 27th of august and the british have landed   the battle begins and goes against us behold through the smoke             washingtons face   the brigade of virginia and maryland have marchd forth to intercept             the enemy   they are cut off murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them   rank after rank falls while over them silently droops the flag   baptized that day in many a young mans bloody wounds   in death defeat and sisters mothers tears    ah hills and slopes of brooklyn i perceive you are more valuable             than your owners supposed   in the midst of you stands an encampment very old   stands forever the camp of that dead brigade    cavalry crossing a ford     a line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands   they take a serpentine course their arms flash in the sunhark to             the musical clank   behold the silvery river in it the splashing horses loitering stop             to drink   behold the brownfaced men each group each person a picture the             negligent rest on the saddles   some emerge on the opposite bank others are just entering the             fordwhile   scarlet and blue and snowy white   the guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind    bivouac on a mountain side     i see before me now a traveling army halting   below a fertile valley spread with barns and the orchards of summer   behind the terraced sides of a mountain abrupt in places rising             high   broken with rocks with clinging cedars with tall shapes dingily             seen   the numerous campfires scatterd near and far some away up on the             mountain   the shadowy forms of men and horses looming largesized             flickering   and over all the skythe sky far far out of reach studded             breaking out the eternal stars    an army corps on the march     with its cloud of skirmishers in advance   with now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip and now an             irregular volley   the swarming ranks press on and on the dense brigades press on   glittering dimly toiling under the sunthe dustcoverd men   in columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground   with artillery interspersdthe wheels rumble the horses sweat   as the army corps advances    by the bivouacs fitful flame     by the bivouacs fitful flame   a procession winding around me solemn and sweet and slowbut first             i note   the tents of the sleeping army the fields and woods dim outline   the darkness lit by spots of kindled fire the silence   like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving   the shrubs and trees as i lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily             watching me   while wind in procession thoughts o tender and wondrous thoughts   of life and death of home and the past and loved and of those that             are far away   a solemn and slow procession there as i sit on the ground   by the bivouacs fitful flame    come up from the fields father     come up from the fields father heres a letter from our pete   and come to the front door mother heres a letter from thy dear son    lo tis autumn   lo where the trees deeper green yellower and redder   cool and sweeten ohios villages with leaves fluttering in the             moderate wind   where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellisd             vines   smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines   smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing   above all lo the sky so calm so transparent after the rain and             with wondrous clouds   below too all calm all vital and beautiful and the farm prospers             well    down in the fields all prospers well   but now from the fields come father come at the daughters call   and come to the entry mother to the front door come right away    fast as she can she hurries something ominous her steps trembling   she does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap    open the envelope quickly   o this is not our sons writing yet his name is signd   o a strange hand writes for our dear son o stricken mothers soul   all swims before her eyes flashes with black she catches the main             words only   sentences broken gunshot wound in the breast cavalry skirmish             taken to hospital   at present low but will soon be better    ah now the single figure to me   amid all teeming and wealthy ohio with all its cities and farms   sickly white in the face and dull in the head very faint   by the jamb of a door leans    grieve not so dear mother the justgrown daughter speaks through             her sobs   the little sisters huddle around speechless and dismayd   see dearest mother the letter says pete will soon be better    alas poor boy he will never be better nor maybe needs to be             better that brave and simple soul   while they stand at home at the door he is dead already   the only son is dead    but the mother needs to be better   she with thin form presently drest in black   by day her meals untouchd then at night fitfully sleeping often             waking   in the midnight waking weeping longing with one deep longing   o that she might withdraw unnoticed silent from life escape and             withdraw   to follow to seek to be with her dear dead son    vigil strange i kept on the field one night     vigil strange i kept on the field one night   when you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day   one look i but gave which your dear eyes returnd with a look i shall             never forget   one touch of your hand to mine o boy reachd up as you lay on the             ground   then onward i sped in the battle the evencontested battle   till late in the night relievd to the place at last again i made my             way   found you in death so cold dear comrade found your body son of             responding kisses never again on earth responding   bared your face in the starlight curious the scene cool blew the             moderate nightwind   long there and then in vigil i stood dimly around me the             battlefield spreading   vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night   but not a tear fell not even a longdrawn sigh long long i gazed   then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my             chin in my hands   passing sweet hours immortal and mystic hours with you dearest             comradenot a tear not a word   vigil of silence love and death vigil for you my son and my             soldier   as onward silently stars aloft eastward new ones upward stole   vigil final for you brave boy i could not save you swift was your             death   i faithfully loved you and cared for you living i think we shall             surely meet again   till at latest lingering of the night indeed just as the dawn             appeard   my comrade i wrapt in his blanket envelopd well his form   folded the blanket well tucking it carefully over head and carefully             under feet   and there and then and bathed by the rising sun my son in his grave             in his rudedug grave i deposited   ending my vigil strange with that vigil of night and battlefield             dim   vigil for boy of responding kisses never again on earth             responding   vigil for comrade swiftly slain vigil i never forget how as day             brightend   i rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his             blanket   and buried him where he fell    a march in the ranks hardprest and the road unknown     a march in the ranks hardprest and the road unknown   a route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness   our army foild with loss severe and the sullen remnant retreating   till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dimlighted             building   we come to an open space in the woods and halt by the dimlighted             building   tis a large old church at the crossing roads now an impromptu             hospital   entering but for a minute i see a sight beyond all the pictures and             poems ever made   shadows of deepest deepest black just lit by moving candles and             lamps   and by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and             clouds of smoke   by these crowds groups of forms vaguely i see on the floor some in             the pews laid down   at my feet more distinctly a soldier a mere lad in danger of             bleeding to death he is shot in the abdomen   i staunch the blood temporarily the youngsters face is white as a             lily   then before i depart i sweep my eyes oer the scene fain to absorb it             all   faces varieties postures beyond description most in obscurity             some of them dead   surgeons operating attendants holding lights the smell of ether             the odor of blood   the crowd o the crowd of the bloody forms the yard outside also             filld   some on the bare ground some on planks or stretchers some in the             deathspasm sweating   an occasional scream or cry the doctors shouted orders or calls   the glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the             torches   these i resume as i chant i see again the forms i smell the odor   then hear outside the orders given fall in my men fall in   but first i bend to the dying lad his eyes open a halfsmile gives             he me   then the eyes close calmly close and i speed forth to the darkness   resuming marching ever in darkness marching on in the ranks   the unknown road still marching    a sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim     a sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim   as from my tent i emerge so early sleepless   as slow i walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital             tent   three forms i see on stretchers lying brought out there untended             lying   over each the blanket spread ample brownish woollen blanket   gray and heavy blanket folding covering all    curious i halt and silent stand   then with light fingers i from the face of the nearest the first just             lift the blanket   who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim with wellgrayd hair and             flesh all sunken about the eyes   who are you my dear comrade    then to the second i stepand who are you my child and darling   who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming    then to the thirda face nor child nor old very calm as of             beautiful yellowwhite ivory   young man i think i know youi think this face is the face of the             christ himself   dead and divine and brother of all and here again he lies    as toilsome i wanderd virginias woods     as toilsome i wanderd virginias woods   to the music of rustling leaves kickd by my feet for twas autumn   i markd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier   mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat easily all could i             understand   the halt of a midday hour when up no time to loseyet this sign             left   on a tablet scrawld and naild on the tree by the grave   bold cautious true and my loving comrade    long long i muse then on my way go wandering   many a changeful season to follow and many a scene of life   yet at times through changeful season and scene abrupt alone or in             the crowded street   comes before me the unknown soldiers grave comes the inscription             rude in virginias woods   bold cautious true and my loving comrade    not the pilot     not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port   though beaten back and many times baffled   not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long   by deserts parchd snows chilld rivers wet perseveres till he             reaches his destination   more than i have charged myself heeded or unheeded to compose a             march for these states   for a battlecall rousing to arms if need be years centuries             hence    year that trembled and reeld beneath me     year that trembled and reeld beneath me   your summer wind was warm enough yet the air i breathed froze me   a thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darkend me   must i change my triumphant songs said i to myself   must i indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled   and sullen hymns of defeat    the wounddresser   1    an old man bending i come among new faces   years looking backward resuming in answer to children   come tell us old man as from young men and maidens that love me   arousd and angry id thought to beat the alarum and urge             relentless war   but soon my fingers faild me my face droopd and i resignd myself   to sit by the wounded and soothe them or silently watch the dead   years hence of these scenes of these furious passions these             chances   of unsurpassd heroes was one side so brave the other was equally             brave   now be witness again paint the mightiest armies of earth   of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us   what stays with you latest and deepest of curious panics   of hardfought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains  2    o maidens and young men i love and that love me   what you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking             recalls   soldier alert i arrive after a long march coverd with sweat and             dust   in the nick of time i come plunge in the fight loudly shout in the             rush of successful charge   enter the capturd worksyet lo like a swiftrunning river they             fade   pass and are gone they fadei dwell not on soldiers perils or             soldiers joys   both i remember wellmany the hardships few the joys yet i was             content    but in silence in dreams projections   while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on   so soon what is over forgotten and waves wash the imprints off the             sand   with hinged knees returning i enter the doors while for you up             there   whoever you are follow without noise and be of strong heart    bearing the bandages water and sponge   straight and swift to my wounded i go   where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in   where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground   or to the rows of the hospital tent or under the roofd hospital   to the long rows of cots up and down each side i return   to each and all one after another i drawn near not one do i miss   an attendant follows holding a tray he carries a refuse pail   soon to be filld with clotted rags and blood emptied and filld             again    i onward go i stop   with hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds   i am firm with each the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable   one turns to me his appealing eyespoor boy i never knew you   yet i think i could not refuse this moment to die for you if that             would save you  3    on on i go open doors of time open hospital doors   the crushd head i dress poor crazed hand tear not the bandage             away   the neck of the cavalryman with the bullet through and through i             examine   hard the breathing rattles quite glazed already the eye yet life             struggles hard   come sweet death be persuaded o beautiful death   in mercy come quickly    from the stump of the arm the amputated hand   i undo the clotted lint remove the slough wash off the matter and             blood   back on his pillow the soldier bends with curvd neck and             sidefalling head   his eyes are closed his face is pale he dares not look on the             bloody stump   and has not yet lookd on it    i dress a wound in the side deep deep   but a day or two more for see the frame all wasted and sinking   and the yellowblue countenance see    i dress the perforated shoulder the foot with the bulletwound   cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene so sickening so             offensive   while the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail    i am faithful i do not give out   the fracturd thigh the knee the wound in the abdomen   these and more i dress with impassive hand yet deep in my breast a             fire a burning flame  4    thus in silence in dreams projections   returning resuming i thread my way through the hospitals   the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand   i sit by the restless all the dark night some are so young   some suffer so much i recall the experience sweet and sad

so cohere    i saw old general at bay     i saw old general at bay   old as he was his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars   his small force was now completely hemmd in in his works   he calld for volunteers to run the enemys lines a desperate             emergency   i saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks but two or three             were selected   i saw them receive their orders aside they listend with care the             adjutant was very grave   i saw them depart with cheerfulness freely risking their lives    the artillerymans vision     while my wife at my side lies slumbering and the wars are over long   and my head on the pillow rests at home and the vacant midnight             passes   and through the stillness through the dark i hear just hear the             breath of my infant   there in the room as i wake from sleep this vision presses upon me   the engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal   the skirmishers begin they crawl cautiously ahead i hear the             irregular snap snap   i hear the sounds of the different missiles the short tht             tht of the rifleballs   i see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds i hear the             great shells shrieking as they pass   the grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees             tumultuous now the contest rages   all the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again   the crashing and smoking the pride of the men in their pieces   the chiefgunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of             the right time   after firing i see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the             effect   elsewhere i hear the cry of a regiment charging the young colonel             leads himself this time with brandishd sword   i see the gaps cut by the enemys volleys quickly filld up no             delay   i breathe the suffocating smoke then the flat clouds hover low             concealing all   now a strange lull for a few seconds not a shot fired on either             side   then resumed the chaos louder than ever with eager calls and orders             of officers   while from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a             shout of applause some special success   and ever the sound of the cannon far or near rousing even in dreams             a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the depths             of my soul   and ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions batteries             cavalry moving hither and thither   the falling dying i heed not the wounded dripping and red i heed             not some to the rear are hobbling   grime heat rush aidedecamps galloping by or on a full run   with the patter of small arms the warning sst of the rifles
