28081109	countess kate  by charlotte m yonge     chapter i    there ive done every bit i can do  im going to see what oclock it is  i heard it strike eleven just now  sylvia youll tip up  what a tremendous stretch  whaooh  oh dear  we shant get one moment before dinner  oh horrible oh horrible most horrible  sylvia you know i hate hearing hamlet profaned  you cant hate it more than having no one to hear our lessons  that makes you do it  what on earth can mary be about  some tiresome woman to speak to her i suppose  im sure it cant be as much her business as it is to mind her poor little sisters  oh dear if papa could only afford us a governess  i am sure i should not like it at all besides it is wrong to wish to be richer than one is  i dont wish i am only thinking how nice it would be if some one would give us a famous quantity of money  then papa should have a pretty parsonage like the one at shagton and we would make the church beautiful and get another pony or two to ride with charlie  yes and have a garden with a hothouse like mr browns  oh yes and a governess to teach us to draw  but best of allo sylvia wouldnt it be nice not to have to mind ones clothes always yes you laugh but it comes easier to you and oh dear oh dear it is so horrid to be always having to see one does not tear oneself  i dont think you do see said sylvia laughing  my frocks always will get upon the thorns  it is very odd  only do please katie dear let me finish this sum and then if mary is not come she cant scold if we are amusing ourselves  i know cried kate  ill draw such a picture and tell you all about it when your sum is over  thereon ensued silence in the little room half parlour half study nearly filled with books and piano and the furniture though carefully protected with brown holland looking the worse for wear and as if danced over by a good many young folks  the two little girls who sat on the opposite sides of a little square table in the baywindow were both between ten and eleven years old but could not have been taken for twins nor even for sisters so unlike were their features and complexion though their dress very dark grey linsey and brown holland aprons was exactly the same except that sylvias was enlivened by scarlet braid kates darkened by blackand moreover kates apron was soiled and the frock bore traces of a great darn  in fact new frocks for the pair were generally made necessary by kates tattered state when sylvias garments were still available for little lily or for some school child  sylvias brown hair was smooth as satin kates net did not succeed in confining the loose rough waves of dark chestnut on the road to blackness  sylvia was the shorter firmer and stronger with round white wellcushioned limbs kate was tall skinny and brown though perfectly healthful  the face of the one was round and rosy of the other thin and dark and one pair of eyes were of honest grey while the others were large and hazel with blue whites  kates little hand was so slight that sylvias strong fingers could almost crush it together but it was far less effective in any sort of handiwork and her slim neatlymade foot always was a reproach to her for making such boisterous steps and wearing out her shoes so much faster than the quieter movements of her companion didher sister as the children would have said for nothing but the difference of surname reminded katharine umfraville that she was not the sister of sylvia wardour  her father a young clergyman had died before she could remember anything and her mother had not survived him three months  little kate had then become the charge of her mothers sister mrs wardour and had grown up in the little parsonage belonging to the district church of st jamess oldburgh amongst her cousins calling mr and mrs wardour papa and mamma and feeling no difference between their love to their own five children and to her  mrs wardour had been dead for about four years and the little girls were taught by the eldest sister mary who had been at a boarding school to fit her for educating them  mr wardour too taught them a good deal himself and had the more time for them since charlie the youngest boy had gone every day to the grammarschool in the town  armyn the eldest of the family was with mr brown a very good old solicitor who besides his office in oldburgh had a very pretty house and grounds two miles beyond st jamess where the parsonage children were delighted to spend an afternoon now and then  little did they know that it was the taking the little niece as a daughter that had made it needful to make armyn enter on a profession at once instead of going to the university and becoming a clergyman like his father nor how cheerfully armyn had agreed to do whatever would best lighten his fathers cares and troubles  they were a very happy family above all on the saturday evenings and sundays that the goodnatured elder brother spent at home  there cried sylvia laying down her slate pencil and indulging in another tremendous yawn we cant do a thing more till mary comes what can she be about  oh but look sylvia cried kate quite forgetting everything in the interest of her drawing on a large sheet of strawpaper  do you see what it is  i dont know said sylvia unlesslet me seethats a very rich little girl isnt it pointing to an outline of a young lady whose wealth was denoted by the flounces or rather scallops on her frock the bracelets on her sausageshaped arms and the necklace on her neck  yes she is a very rich and grandlady ethelinda isnt that a pretty name  i do wish i was lady katharine  and what is she giving  i wish you would not do men and boys kate their legs always look so funny as you do them  they never will come right but never mind i must have them  that is lady ethelindas dear good cousin maximilian he is a lawyer dont you see the parchment sticking out of his pocket  just like armyn  and she is giving him a box with a beautiful new microscope in it dont you see the top of it  and there is a whole pile of books and i would draw a pony only i never can nicely but look here kate went on drawing as she spokehere is lady ethelinda with her best hat on and a little girl coming  there is the little girls house burnt down dont you see  sylvia saw with the eyes of her mind the ruins though her real eyes saw nothing but two lines meant to be upright joined together by a wild zigzag and with some peaked scrabbles and round whirls intended for smoke  then kates ready pencil portrayed the family as jagged in their drapery as the flames and presently lady ethelinda appeared before a counter such a counter sloping like a desk in the attempt at perspective but it conveniently concealed the shopmans legs buying very peculiar garments for the sufferers  another scene in which she was presenting them followed sylvia looking on and making suggestions for in fact there was no quiet pastime more relished by the two cousins than drawing stories as they called it and most of their pence went in paper for that purpose  lady ethelinda had a whole ream of paper to draw on were the words pronounced in kates shrill key of eagerness just as the long lost mary and her father opened the door  indeed said mr wardour a tall gravelooking man and who is lady ethelinda  o papa its just a story i was drawing said kate half eager half ashamed  we have done all the lessons we could indeed we have began sylvia my music and our french grammar and  yes i know said mary and she paused looking embarrassed and uncomfortable so that sylvia stood in suspense and wonder  and so my little kate likes thinking of ladylady etheldredas said mr wardour rather musingly but kate was too much pleased at his giving any sort of heed to her performances to note the manner and needed no more encouragement to set her tongue off  lady ethelinda papa  she is a very grand rich lady though she is a little girl  and see there she is giving presents to all her cousins and there she is buying new clothes for the orphans that were burnt out and there she is building a school for them  kate suddenly stopped for mr wardour sat down drew her between his knees took both her hands into one of his and looked earnestly into her face so gravely that she grew frightened and looking appealingly up cried out o mary mary have i been naughty  no my dear said mr wardour but we have heard a very strange piece of news about you and i am very anxious as to whether it may turn out for your happiness  kate stood still and looked at him wishing he would speak faster could her greatuncle in india be come home and want her to make him a visit in london  how delightful  if it had been anybody but papa she would have said go on  my dear said mr wardour at last you know that your cousin lord caergwent was killed by an accident last week  yes i know said kate that was why mary made me put this black braid on my frock and a very horrid job it was to doit made my fingers so sore  i did not know till this morning that his death would make any other difference to you continued mr wardour  i thought the title went to heirsmale and that colonel umfraville was the present earl but my little katharine i find that it is ordained that you should have this great responsibility  what you thought it was the salic law said kate going on with one part of his speech and not quite attending to the other  something like it only that it is not the english term for it said mr wardour half smiling  as your grandfather was the elder son the title and property come to you  kate did not look at him but appeared intent on the marks of the needle on the end of her forefinger holding down her head  sylvia however seemed to jump in her very skin and opening her eyes cried out the title  then kate isisoh what is a she earl called  a countess said mr wardour with a smile but rather sadly  our little kate is countess of caergwent  my dear sylvia exclaimed mary in amazement for sylvia like an indiarubber ball had bounded sheer over the little armchair by which she was standing  but there her fathers look and uplifted finger kept her still and silent  he wanted to give kate time to understand what he had said  countess of caergwent she repeated thats not so pretty as if i were lady katharine  the sound does not matter much said mary  you will always be katharine to those that love you best  and oh  mary stopped short her eyes full of tears  kate looked up at her astonished  are you sorry mary she asked a little hurt  we are all sorry to lose our little kate said mr wardour  lose me papa cried kate clinging to him as the children scarcely ever did for he seldom made many caresses oh no never doesnt caergwent castle belong to me  then you must all come and live with me there and you shall have lots of big books papa and we will have a ponycarriage for mary and ponies for sylvia and charlie and me and  kate either ran herself down or saw that the melancholy look on mr wardours face rather deepened than lessened for she stopped short  my dear he said you and i have both other duties  oh but if i built a church  i dare say there are people at caergwent as poor as they are here  couldnt we build a church and you mind them papa  my little katharine you have yet to understand that the heir so long as he is a child differeth in nothing from a servant but is under tutors and governors  you will not have any power over yourself or your property till you are twentyone  but you are my tutor and my governor and my spiritual pastor and master said kate  i always say so whenever mary asks us questions about our duty to our neighbour  i have been so hitherto said mr wardour setting her on his knee but i see i must explain a good deal to you  it is the business of a court in london that is called the court of chancery to provide that proper care is taken of young heirs and heiresses and their estates if no one have been appointed by their parents to do so and it is this court that must settle what is to become of you  and why wont it settle that i may live with my own papa and brothers and sisters  because kate you must be brought up in a way to fit your station and my children must be brought up in a way to fit theirs  and besides he added more sadly nobody that could help it would leave a girl to be brought up in a household without a mother  kates heart said directly that as she could never again have a mother her dear mary must be better than a stranger but somehow any reference to the sorrow of the household always made her anxious to get away from the subject so she looked at her finger again and asked then am i to live up in this court of chances  not exactly said mr wardour  your two aunts in london lady barbara and lady jane umfraville are kind enough to offer to take charge of you  here is a letter that they sent inclosed for you  the countess of caergwent was written on the envelope and kates and sylvias heads were together in a moment to see how it looked before opening the letter and reading my dear niecedear me how funny to say niecei deferred writing to you upon the melancholy oh what is it sylvia  the melancholy comet  no no nonsense  melancholy event suggested mary  yes to be sure  i cant think why grownup people always write on purpose for one not to read themmelancholy event that has placed you in possession of the horrors of the family  horrorskate kate  well i am sure it is horrors said the little girl rather perversely  this is not a time for nonsense kate said mr wardour and she was subdued directly  shall i read it to you said mary  oh no no  kate was too proud of her letter to give it up and applied herself to it againfamily honours until i could ascertain your present address  and likewise the shock of your poor cousins death so seriously affected my sisters health in her delicate state that for some days i could give my attention to nothing else  dear me  this is my aunt barbara i see  is aunt jane so ill  she has had very bad health for many years said mr wardour and your other aunt has taken the greatest care of her  we have now however been able to consider what will be best for all parties and we think nothing will be so proper as that you should reside with us for the present  we will endeavour to make a happy home for you and will engage a lady to superintend your education and give you all the advantages to which you are entitled we have already had an interview with a very admirable person who will come down to oldburgh with our butler next friday and escort you to us if mrs wardour will kindly prepare you for the journey i have written to thank her for her kindness to you  mrs wardour exclaimed sylvia  the ladies have known and cared little about kate or us for a good many years said mary almost to herself but in such a hurt tone that her father looked up with grave reproof in his eyes as if to remind her of all he had been saying to her during the long hours that the little girls had waited  with your aunt janes love and hoping shortly to be better acquainted i remain my dear little niece your affectionate aunt barbara umfraville  then i am to go and live with them said kate drawing a long sigh  o papa do let sylvia come too and learn of my governess with me  your aunts do not exactly contemplate that said mr wardour but perhaps there may be visits between you  sylvia began to look very grave  she had not understood that this great news was to lead to nothing but separation  everything had hitherto been in common between her and kate and that what was good for the one should not be good for the other was so new and strange that she did not understand it at once  oh yes we will visit  you shall all come and see me in london and see the zoological gardens and the british museum and i will send you such presents  we will see said mr wardour kindly but just now i think the best thing you can do is to write to your aunt and thank her for her kind letter and say that i will bring you up to london on the day she names without troubling the governess and the butler  oh thank you said kate i shant be near so much afraid if you come with me  mr wardour left the room and the first thing mary did was to throw her arms round the little girl in a long vehement embrace  my little kate my little kate  i little thought this was to be the end of it she cried kissing her while the tears dropped fast  kate did not like it at all  the sight of strong feeling distressed her and made her awkward and ungracious  dont mary she said disengaging herself never mind i shall always come and see you and when i grow up you shall come to live with me at caergwent  and you know when they write a big red book about me they will put in that you brought me up  write a big red book about you kate  why said kate suddenly become very learned there is an immense fat red and gold book at mr browns all full of lords and ladies  oh a peerage said mary but even you my lady countess cant have a whole peerage to yourself  and that little laugh seemed to do mary good for she rose and began to rule the single lines for kates letter  kate could write a very tidy little note but just now she was too much elated and excited to sit down quietly or quite to know what she was about  she went skipping restlessly about from one chair to another chattering fast about what she would do and wondering what the aunts would be like and what armyn would say and what charlie would say and the watch she would buy for charlie and the great things she was to do for everybodytill mary muttered something in haste and ran out of the room  i wonder why mary is so cross said kate  poor mary  no one could be farther from being cross but she was thoroughly upset  she was as fond of kate as of her own sisters and was not only sorry to part with her but was afraid that she would not be happy or good in the new life before her    chapter ii    the days passed very slowly with kate until the moment when she was to go to london and take her state upon her as she thought  till that should come to pass she could not feel herself really a countess  she did not find herself any taller or grander charlie teased her rather more instead of less and she did not think either mr wardour or mary or armyn thought half enough of her dignity they did not scruple to set her down when she talked too loud and looked sad instead of pleased when she chattered about the fine things she should do  mr and mrs brown to be sure came to wish her goodbye but they were so respectful and took such pains that she should walk first that she grew shy and sheepish and did not like it at all  she thought ease and dignity would come by nature when she was once in london and she made so certain of soon seeing sylvia again that she did not much concern herself about the parting with her while she was rather displeased with mary for looking grave and not making more of her and trying to tell her that all might not be as delightful as she expected  she little knew that mary was grieved at her eagerness to leave her happy home and never guessed at the kind sisters fears for her happiness  she set it all down to what she was wont to call crossness  if mary had really been a cross or selfish person all she would have thought of would have been that now there would not be so many rents to mend after kates cobbling attempts nor so many shrill shrieking laughs to disturb papa writing his sermon nor so much difficulty in keeping any room in the house tidy nor so much pinching in the housekeeping  instead of that mary only thought whether barbara and lady jane would make her little kate happy and good  she was sure they were proud hard cold people and her father had many talks with her to try to comfort her about them  mr wardour told her that kates grandfather had been such a grief and shame to the family that it was no wonder they had not liked to be friendly with those he had left behind him  there had been help given to educate the son and some notice had been taken of him but always very distant and he had been thought very foolish for marrying when he was very young and very ill off  at the time of his death his uncle colonel umfraville had been very kind and had consulted earnestly with mr wardour what was best for the little orphan but had then explained that he and his wife could not take charge of her because his regiment was going to india and she could not go there with them and that his sisters were prevented from undertaking the care of so young a child by the bad health of the elder who almost owed her life to the tender nursing of the younger and as mrs wardour was only eager to keep to herself all that was left of her only sister and had a nursery of her own it had been most natural that kate should remain at st jamess parsonage and mr wardour had full reason to believe that had there been any need or if he had asked for help the aunts would have gladly given it he knew them to be worthy and religious women and he told mary that he thought it very likely that they might deal better with kates character than he had been able to do  mary knew she herself had made mistakes but she could not be humble for her father or think any place more improving than under his roof  and kate meanwhile had her own views  and when all the goodbyes were over and she sat by the window of the railway carriage watching the fields rush by reduced to silence because papa had told her he could not hear her voice and had made a peremptory sign to her when she screamed her loudest and caused their fellow travellers to look up amazed she wove a web in her brain something like this i know what my aunts will be like  they will be just like ladies in a book  they will be dreadfully fashionable  let me seeaunt barbara will have a turban on her head and a bird of paradise like the bad old lady in armyns book that mary took away from me and they will do nothing all day long but try on flounced gowns and count their jewels and go out to balls and operasand they will want me to do the sameand play at cards all sunday lady caergwent they will say it is becoming to your position and then the young countess presented a remarkable contrast in her ingenuous simplicity continued kate not quite knowing whether she was making a story or thinking of herselffor indeed she did not feel as if she were herself but somebody in a story  her waving hair was only confined by an azure ribbon kate loved a fine word when charlie did not hear it to laugh at her and her dress was of the simplest muslin with one diamond aigrette of priceless value  kate had not the most remote notion what an aigrette might be but she thought it would sound well for a countess and she went on musing very pleasantly on the amiable simplicity of the countess and the speech that was to cure the aunts of playing at cards on a sunday wearing turbans and all other enormities and lead them to live in the country giving a continual course of school feasts and surprising meritorious families with gifts of cows  she only wished she had a pencil to draw it all to show sylvia provided sylvia would know her cows from her tables  after more vain attempts at chatter and various stops at stations mr wardour bought a storybook for her and thus brought her to a most happy state of silent content which lasted till the house roofs of london began to rise on either side of the railway  among the carriages that were waiting at the terminus was a small brougham very neat and shiny and a servant came up and touched his hat opening the door for kate who was told to sit there while the servant and mr wardour looked for the luggage  she was a little disappointed  she had once seen a carriage go by with four horses and a single one did not seem at all worthy of her but she had two chapters more of her story to read and was so eager to see the end of it that mr wardour could hardly persuade her to look out and see the thames when she passed over it nor the houses of parliament and the towers of westminster abbey  at last while passing through the brighter and more crowded streets kate having satisfied herself what had become of the personages of her story looked up and saw nothing but dull houses of blackened cream colour and presently found the carriage stopping at the door of one  is it here papa she said suddenly seized with fright  yes he said this is bruton street and he looked at her anxiously as the door was opened and the steps were let down  she took tight hold of his hand  whatever she had been in her day dreams she was only his own little frightened kate now and she tried to shrink behind him as the footman preceded them up the stairs and opening the door announcedlady caergwent and mr wardour  two ladies rose up and came forward to meet her  she felt herself kissed by both and heard greetings but did not know what to say and stood up by mr wardour hanging down her head and trying to stand upon one foot with the other as she always did when she was shy and awkward  sit down my dear said one of the ladies making a place for her on the sofa  but kate only laid hold of a chair pulled it as close to mr wardour as possible and sat down on the extreme corner of it feeling for a rail on which to set her feet and failing to find one twining her ankles round the leg of the chair  she knew very well that this was not pretty but she never could recollect what was pretty behaviour when she was shy  she was a very different little girl in a daydream and out of one  and when one of the aunts asked her if she were tired all she could do was to give a foolish sort of smile and say nno  then she had a perception that papa was looking reprovingly at her so she wriggled her legs away from that of the chair twisted them together in the middle and said something meant for no thank you but of which nothing was to be heard but q apparently proceeding out of the brim of her broad hat so low did the young countess in her amiable simplicity hold her head  she is shy said one of the ladies to the other and they let her alone a little and began to talk to mr wardour about the journey and various other things to which kate did not greatly listen  she began to let her eyes come out from under her hat brim and satisfied herself that the aunts certainly did not wear either turbans or birds of paradise but looked quite as like other people as she felt herself in spite of her title  indeed one aunt had nothing on her head at all but a little black velvet and lace not much more than mary sometimes wore and the other only a very light cap  kate thought greataunts must be as old at least as mrs brown and was much astonished to see that these ladies had no air of age about them  the one who sat on the sofa had a plump smooth pretty pink and white face very soft and pleasant to look at though an older person than kate would have perceived that the youthful delicacy of the complexion showed that she had been carefully shut up and sheltered from all exposure and exertion and that the quiet innocent look of the small features was that of a person who had never had to use her goodness more actively than a little baby  kate was sure that this was aunt jane and that she should get on well with her though that slow way of speaking was rather wearisome  the other aunt who was talking the most was quite as slim as mary and had a bright dark complexion so that if kate had not seen some shades of grey in her black hair it would have been hard to believe her old at all  she had a face that put kate in mind of a picture of a beautiful lady in a book at homethe eyes forehead nose and shape of the chin were so finely made and yet there was something in them that made the little girl afraid and feel as if the plaster cast of dianas head on the study mantelpiece had got a pair of dark eyes and was looking very hard at her and there was a sort of dry sound in her voice that was uncomfortable to hear  then kate took a survey of the room which was very prettily furnished with quantities of beautiful work of all kinds and little tables and brackets covered with little devices in china and curiosities under glass and had flowers standing in the windows and by the time she had finished trying to make out the subject of a print on the walls she heard some words that made her think that her aunts were talking of her new governess and she opened her ears to hear so we thought it would be an excellent arrangement for her poor thing and papa answering i hope kate may try to be a kind considerate pupil  then seeing by kates eyes that her attention had been astray or that she had not understood lady barbaras words he turned to her saying did you not hear what your aunt was telling me  no papa  she was telling me about the lady who will teach you  she has had great afflictions  she has lost her husband and is obliged to go out as governess that she may be able to send her sons to school so kate you must think of this and try to give her as little trouble as possible  it would have been much nicer if kate would have looked up readily and said something kind and friendly but the fit of awkwardness had come over her again and with it a thought so selfish that it can hardly be called otherwise than naughtynamely that grownup people in trouble were very tiresome and never let young ones have any fun  shall i take you to see mrs lacy my dear said lady barbara rising  and as kate took hold of mr wardours hand she added you will see mr wardour again after dinner  you had better dress and have some meat for your tea with mrs lacy and then come into the drawingroom  this was a stroke upon kate  she who had dined with the rest of the world ever since she could remembershe now that she was a countess to be made to drink tea upstairs like a baby and lose all that time of papas company  she swelled with displeasure  but aunt barbara did not look like a person whose orders could be questioned and papa said not a word in her favour  possibly the specimen of manners she had just given had not led either him or lady barbara to think her fit for a late dinner  lady barbara first took her upstairs and showed her a little long narrow bedroom with a pretty pinkcurtained bed in it  this will be your room my dear she said  i am sorry we have not a larger one to offer you but it opens into mine as you see and my sisters is just beyond  our maid will dress you for a few days when i hope to engage one for you  here was something like promotion  kate dearly loved to have herself taken off her own hands and not to be reproved by mary for untidiness or roughly set to rights by lilys nurse  she actually exclaimed oh thank you  and her aunt waited till the hat and cloak had been taken off and the chestnut hair smoothed looked at her attentively and said yes you are like the family  im very like my own papa said kate growing a little bolder but still speaking with her head on one side which was her way when she said anything sentimental  i dare say you are answered her aunt with the dry sound  are you ready now  i will show you the way  the house is very small continued lady barbara as they went down the stairs to the ground floor and this must be your schoolroom for the present  it was the room under the back drawingroom and in it was a lady in a widows cap sitting at work  here is your little pupillady caergwentmrs lacy said lady barbara  i hope you will find her a good child  she will drink tea with you and then dress and afterwards i hope we shall see you with her in the drawingroom  mrs lacy bowed without any answer in words only she took kates hand and kissed her  lady barbara left them and there was a little pause  kate looked at her governess and her heart sank for it was the very saddest face she had ever seenthe eyes looked soft and gentle but as if they had wept till they could weep no longer and when the question was asked are you tired my dear it was in a sunk tone trying to be cheerful but the sadder for that very reason poor lady it was only that morning that she had parted with her son and had gone away from the home where she had lived with her husband and children  kate was almost distressed yet she felt more at her ease than with her aunts and answered not at all thank you in her natural tone  was it a long journey  kate had been silent so long that her tongue was ready for exertion and she began to chatter forth all the events of the journey without heeding much whether she were listened to or not till having come to the end of her breath she saw that mrs lacy was leaning back in her chair her eyes fixed as if her attention had gone away  kate thereupon roamed round the room peeped from the window and saw that it looked into a dull blacklooking narrow garden and then studied the things in the room  there was a piano at which she shook her head  mary had tried to teach her music but after a daily fret for six weeks mr wardour had said it was waste of time and temper for both and kate was delighted  then she came to a bookcase and there the aunts had kindly placed the books of their own younger days some of which she had never seen before  when she had once begun on the rival crusoes she gave mrs lacy no more trouble except to rouse her from it to drink her tea and then go and be dressed  the maid managed the white muslin so as to make her look very nice but before she had gone half way downstairs there was a voice behindmy lady my lady  she did not turn not remembering that she herself must be meant and the maid running after her caught her rather sharply and showed her her own hand all black and grimed  how tiresome cried she  why i only just washed it  yes my lady but you took hold of the balusters all the way down and your forehead  bless me what would lady barbara say  for kate had been trying to peep through the balusters into the hall below and had of course painted her brow with london blacks  she made one of her little impatient gestures and thought she was very hardly useddirt stuck upon her and brambles tore her like no one else  she got safely down this time and went into the drawingroom with mrs lacy there taking a voyage of discovery among the pretty things knowing she must not touch but asking endless questions some of which mrs lacy answered in her sad indifferent way others she could not answer and kate was rather vexed at her not seeming to care to know  kate had not yet any notion of caring for other peoples spirits and feelings she never knew what to do for them and so tried to forget all about them  the aunts came in and with them mr wardour  she was glad to run up to him and drag him to look at a group in white parian under a glass that had delighted her very much  she knew it was jupiters eagle but who was feeding it  ganymede said mr wardour and kate who always liked mythological stories went on most eagerly talking about the legend of the youth who was borne away to be the cupbearer of the gods  it was a thing to make her forget about the aunts and everybody else and mr wardour helped her out as he generally did when her talk was neither foolish nor illtimed but he checked her when he thought she was running on too long and went himself to talk to mrs lacy while kate was obliged to come to her aunts and stood nearest to lady jane of whom she was least afraid  you seem quite at home with all the heathen gods my dear said lady jane how come you to know them so well  in charlies lessonbooks you know said kate and seeing that her aunt did not know she went on to say there are notes and explanations  and there is a homeran english one you know and we play at it  we seem to have quite a learned lady here said aunt barbara in the voice kate did not like  do you learn music  no i havent got any ear and i hate it  oh said lady barbara drily and kate seeing mr wardours eyes fixed on her rather anxiously recollected that hate was not a proper word and fell into confusion  and drawing said her aunt  no but i want to  oh again said lady barbara looking at kates fingers which in her awkwardness she was apparently dislocating in a method peculiar to herself  however it was soon over for it was already later than kates home bedtime she bade everyone goodnight and was soon waited on by mrs bartley the maid in her own luxurious little room  but luxurious as it was kate for the first time thoroughly missed home  the boarded floor the old crib the deal table would have been welcome if only sylvia had been there  she had never gone to bed without sylvia in her life  and now she thought with a pang that sylvia was longing for her and looking at her empty crib thinking too it might be that kate had cared more for her grandeur than for the parting  not only was it sorrowful to be lonely but also kate was one of the silly little girls to whom the first quarter of an hour in bed was a time of fright  sylvia had no fears and always accounted for the odd noises and strange sights that terrified her companion  she never believed that the house was on fire even though the moon made very bright sparkles she always said the sounds were the servants the wind or the mice and never would allow that thieves would steal little girls or anything belonging to themselves  or if she were fast asleep her very presence gave a feeling of protection  but when the preparations were very nearly over and kate began to think of the strange room and the roar of carriages in the streets sounded so unnatural her heart failed her and the fear of being alone quite overpowered her dread of the grave staid mrs bartley far more of being thought a silly little girl  please please mrs bartley she said in a trembling voice are you going away  yes my lady i am going down to supper when i have placed my lady janes and my lady barbaras things  then pleaseplease said kate in her most humble and insinuating voice do leave the door open while you are doing it  very well my lady was the answer in a tone just like that in which lady barbara said oh  and the door stayed open but kate could not sleep  there seemed to be the rattle and bump of the train going on in her bed the gas lights in the streets below came in unnaturally and the noises were much more frightful and unaccountable than any she had ever heard at home  her eyes spread with fright instead of closing in sleep then came the longing yearning for sylvia and tears grew hot in them and by the time mrs bartley had finished her preparations and gone down her distress had grown so unbearable that she absolutely began sobbing aloud and screaming papa  she knew he would be very angry and that she should hear that such folly was shameful in a girl of her age but any anger would be better than this dreadful loneliness  she screamed louder and louder and she grew half frightened half relieved when she heard his step and a buzz of voices on the stairs and then there he was standing by her and saying gravely what is the matter kate  o papa papa i wanti want sylviai am afraid  then she held her breath and cowered under the clothes ready for a scolding but it was not his angry voice  poor child he said quietly and sadly you must put away this childishness my dear  you know that you are not really alone even in a strange place  no no papa but i am afraidi cannot bear it  have you said the verse that helps you to bear it katie  i could not say it without sylvia  she heard him sigh and then he said you must try another night my katie and think of sylvia saying it at home in her own room  you will meet her prayers in that way  now let me hear you say it  kate repeated but half choked with sobs i lay me down in peace and the rest of the calm words with which she had been taught to lay herself in bed but at the end she cried o papa dont go  i must go my dear  i cannot stay away from your aunts  but i will tell you what to do tonight and other nights when i shall be away say to yourself the ninetyfirst psalm  i think you know itwhoso abideth under the defence of the most high  i think i do know it  try to say it to yourself and then the place will seem less dreary because you will feel who is with you  i will look in once more before i go away and i think you will be asleep  and though kate tried to stay awake for him asleep she was    chapter iii    in a very few days kate had been settled into the ways of the household in bruton street and found one day so like another that she sometimes asked herself whether she had not been living there years instead of days  she was always to be ready by halfpast seven  her french maid josephine used to come in at seven and wash and dress her quietly for if there were any noise aunt barbara would knock and be displeased  aunt barbara rose long before that time but she feared lest aunt jane should be disturbed in her mornings sleep and kate thought she had the ears of a dragon for the least sound of voice or laugh  at halfpast seven kate met mrs lacy in the schoolroom read the psalms and second lesson and learnt some answers to questions on the catechism to be repeated to lady barbara on a sunday  for so far from playing at cards in a birdofparadise turban all sunday the aunts were quite as particular about these things as mr wardour more inconveniently so the countess thought for he always let her answer his examinations out of her own head and never gave her answers to learn by heart answers that i know before quite well said kate only not made tiresome with fine words  that is not a right way of talking lady caergwent gravely said mrs lacy and kate gave herself an illtempered wriggle and felt cross and rebellious  it was a trial but if kate had taken it humbly she would have found that even the stiff hard words and set phrases gave accuracy to her ideas and the learning of the texts quoted would have been clear gain if she had been in a meeker spirit  this done mrs lacy gave her a musiclesson  this was grievous work for the question was not how the learning should be managed but whether the thing should be learnt at all  kate had struggled hard against it  she informed her aunts that mary had tried to teach her for six weeks in vain and that she had had a bad mark every day that papa had said it was all nonsense and that talents could not be forced and that armyn said she had no more ear than an old peahen  to which lady barbara had gravely answered that mr wardour could decide as he pleased while katharine was under his charge but that it would be highly improper that she should not learn the accomplishments of her station  only i cant learn said kate half desperate you will see that it is no use aunt barbara  i shall do my duty katharine was all the answer she obtained and she pinched her chair with suppressed passion  lady barbara was right in saying that it was her duty to see that the child under her charge learnt what is usually expected of ladies and though kate could never acquire music enough to give pleasure to others yet the training and discipline were likely not only to improve her ear and untamed voice but to be good for her whole characterthat is if she had made a good use of them  but in these times being usually already out of temper with the difficult answers of the catechism questions and obliged to keep in her pettish feelings towards what concerned sacred things she let all out in the music lesson and with her murmurs and her inattention her yawns and her blunders rendered herself infinitely more dull and unmusical than nature had made her and was a grievous torment to poor mrs lacy and her patient one two threenow my dear  kate thought it was mrs lacy who tormented her  i wonder which was the worse to the other  at any rate mrs lacys heavy eyes looked heavier and she moved as though wearied out for the whole day by the time the clock struck nine and released them whilst her pupil who never was cross long together took a hop skip and jump to the diningroom and was as fresh as ever in the eager hope that the post would bring a letter from home  lady barbara read prayers in the diningroom at nine and there breakfasted with kate and mrs lacy sending up a tray to lady jane in her bedroom  those were apt to be grave breakfasts not like the merry mornings at home when chatter used to go on in half whispers between the younger ones with laughs breaking out in sudden gusts till a little overloudness brought one of marys goodnatured hushes usually answered with o mary such fun  it was lady barbaras time for asking about all the lessons of the day before and though these were usually fairly done and mrs lacy was always a kind reporter it was rather awful and what was worse were the strictures on deportment  for it must be confessed that lady caergwent though neatly and prettily made with delicate little feet and hands and a strong upright back was a remarkably awkward child and the more she was lectured the more ungraceful she made herselfpartly from thinking about it and from fright making her abrupt partly from being provoked  she had never been so ungainly at oldburgh she never was half so awkward in the schoolroom as she would be while taking her cup of tea from lady barbara or handing the butter to her governess  and was it not wretched to be ordered to do it again and again and again each time worse than the last the fingers more crooked the elbow more stuck out the shoulder more forward than before when there was a letter in sylvias writing lying on the table unopened  and whereas it had been the fashion at st jamess parsonage to compare kates handing her plate to a chimpanzee asking for nuts it was hard that in bruton street these manners should be attributed to the barbarous country in which she had grown up  but that though kate did not know it was very much her own fault  she could never be found fault with but she answered again  she had been scarcely broken of replying and justifying herself even to mr wardour and had often argued with mary till he came in and put a sudden sharp stop to it and now she usually defended herself with papa says or mary says and though she really thought she spoke the truth she made them say such odd things that it was no wonder lady barbara thought they had very queer notions of education and that her niece had nothing to do but to unlearn their lessons  thus  katharine easychairs were not meant for little girls to lounge in  oh papa says he doesnt want one always to sit upright and stupid  so lady barbara was left to suppose that mr wardours model attitude for young ladies was sitting upon one leg in an easychair with the other foot dangling the forehead against the back and the arm of the chair used as a desk  how was she to know that this only meant that he had once had the misfortune to express his disapproval of the highbacked longlegged schoolroom chairs formerly in fashion  in fact kate could hardly be forbidden anything without her replying that papa or mary always let her do it till at last she was ordered very decidedly never again to quote mr and miss wardour and especially not to call him papa  kates eyes flashed at this and she was so angry that no words would come but a passionate stammering i canti cant leave off i wont  lady barbara looked stern and grave  you must be taught what is suitable to your position lady caergwent and until you have learnt to feel it yourself i shall request mrs lacy to give you an additional lesson every time you call mr wardour by that name  aunt barbaras low slow way of speaking when in great displeasure was a terrific thing and so was the set look of her handsome mouth and eyes  kate burst into a violent fit of crying and was sent away in dire disgrace  when she had spent her tears and sobs she began to think over her aunts cruelty and ingratitude and the wickedness of trying to make her ungrateful too and she composed a thrilling speech as she called itlady barbara umfraville when the orphan was poor and neglected my uncle wardour was a true father to me you may tear me with wild horses ere i will cease to give him the title ofno and i will call him papano fatherwith my last breath  what the countess might have done if lady barbara had torn her with wild horses must remain uncertain  it is quite certain that the mere fixing of those great dark eyes was sufficient to cut off paat its first syllable and turn it into a faltering my uncle and that though kates heart was very sore and angry she never except once or twice when the word slipped out by chance incurred the penalty though she would have respected herself more if she had been brave enough to bear something for the sake of showing her love to mr wardour  and the fact was that selfjustification and carelessness of exact correctness of truth had brought all this upon her and given her aunt this bad opinion of her friends  but this is going a long way from the description of kates days in bruton street  after breakfast she was sent out with mrs lacy for a walk  if she had a letter from home she read it while josephine dressed her as if she had been a doll or else she had a story book in hand and was usually lost in it when mrs lacy looked into her room to see if she were ready  to walk along the dull street and pace round and round the gardens in berkeley square was not so entertaining as morning games in the garden with sylvia and these were times of feeling very like a prisoner  other children in the gardens seemed to be friends and played together but this the aunts had forbidden her and she could only look on and think of sylvia and charlie and feel as if one real game of play would do her all the good in the world  to be sure she could talk to mrs lacy and tell her about sylvia and deliver opinions upon the characters in her histories and stories but it often happened that the low grave yes my dear showed by the very tone that her governess had heard not a word and at the best it was dreary work to look up and discourse to nothing but the black crape veil that mrs lacy always kept down  i cannot think why i should have a governess in affliction it is very hard upon me said kate to herself  why did she never bethink herself how hard the afflictions were upon mrs lacy and what good it would have done her if her pupil had tried to be like a gentle little daughter to her instead of merely striving for all the fun she could get  the lesson time followed  kate first repeated what she had learnt the day before and then had a french master two days in the week on two more one for arithmetic and geography and on the other two a drawing master  she liked these lessons and did well in all as soon as she left off citing mary wardours pronunciations and ways of doing sums  indeed she had more lively conversation with her french master who was a very goodnatured old man than with anyone else except josephine and she liked writing french letters for him to correct making them be from the imaginary little girls whom she was so fond of drawing and sending them to sylvia  after the master was gone kate prepared for him for the next day and did a little italian reading with mrs lacy after which followed reading of history and needlework  lady barbara was very particular that she should learn to work well and was a good deal shocked at her very poor performances  she had thought that plain needlework at least would be taught in a clergymans family  mary tried to teach me but she says all my fingers are thumbs  and so poor mrs lacy found them  mrs lacy and her pupil dined at the ladies luncheon and this was pleasanter than the breakfast from the presence of aunt jane whose kiss of greeting was a comforting cheering moment and who always was so much distressed and hurt at the sight of her sisters displeasure that aunt barbara seldom reproved before her  she always had a kind word to say mrs lacy seemed brighter and less oppressed in the sound of her voice everyone was more at ease and when speaking to her or waiting upon her lady barbara was no longer stern in manner nor dry in voice  the meal was not lively there was nothing like the talk about parish matters nor the jokes that she was used to and though she was helped first and ceremoniously waited on she might not speak unless she was spoken to and was it not very cruel first to make everything so dull that no one could help yawning and then to treat a yawn as a dire offence  the length of the luncheon was a great infliction because all the time from that to three oclock was her own  it was a poor remnant of the entire afternoons which she and sylvia had usually disposed of much as they pleased and even what there was of it was not to be spent in the way for which the young limbs longed  no one was likely to play at blind mans buff and hare and hounds in that house and even her poor attempt at throwing her gloves or a penwiper against the wall and catching them in the rebound and her scampers up stairs two steps at once and runs down with a leap down the last four steps were summarily stopped as unladylike and too noisy for aunt jane  kate did get a private run and leap whenever she could but never with a safe conscience and that spoilt the pleasure or made it guilty and alarmed  all she could do really in peace was reading or drawing or writing letters to sylvia  nobody had interfered with any of these occupations though kate knew that none of them were perfectly agreeable to aunt barbara who had been heard to speak of childrens reading far too many silly storybooks nowadays and had declared that the child would cramp her hand for writing or good drawing with that nonsense  however lady jane had several times submitted most complacently to have a whole long history in pictures explained to her smiling very kindly but not apparently much the wiser  and one at least of the old visions of wealth was fulfilled for kates pocketmoney enabled her to keep herself in storybooks and unlimited white paper as well as to set up a paintbox with real good colours  but somehow a new tale every week had not half the zest that stories had when a fresh book only came into the house by rare and much prized chances and though the paper was smooth and the blue and red lovely it was not half so nice to draw and paint as with sylvia helping and the remains of marys rubbings for making illuminations nay lily spoiling everything and armyn and charlie laughing at her were now remembered as ingredients in her pleasure and she would hardly have had the heart to go on drawing but that she could still send her pictorial stories to sylvia and receive remarks on them  there were no more lady ethelindas in flounces in kates drawings now her heroines were always clergymens daughters or those of colonists cutting down trees and making the butter  at three oclock the carriage came to the door and on mondays and thursdays took lady caergwent and her governess to a mistress who taught dancing and calisthenic exercises and to whom her aunts trusted to make her a little more like a countess than she was at present  those were poor kates black days of the week when her feet were pinched and her arms turned the wrong way as it seemed to her and she was in perpetual disgrace  and oh that polite disgrace  those wishes that her ladyship would assume a more aristocratic deportment were so infinitely worse than a good scolding  nothing could make it more dreadful except aunt barbaras coming in at the end to see how she was getting on  the aunts when lady jane was well enough used to take their drive while the dancing lesson was in progress and send the carriage afterwards to bring their niece home  on the other days of the week when it was fine the carriage set mrs lacy and kate down in hyde park for their walk while the aunts drove about and this after the first novelty was nearly as dull as the morning walk  the quiet decorous pacing along was very tiresome after skipping in the lanes at home and once when mrs lacy had let her run freely in kensington gardens lady barbara was much displeased with her and said lady caergwent was too old for such habits  there was no sightseeing  kate had told lady jane how much she wished to see the zoological gardens and british museum and had been answered that some day when she was very good aunt barbara would take her there but the day never came though whenever kate had been in no particular scrape for a little while she hoped it was coming though certainly days without scrapes were not many  the loud tones the screams of laughing that betrayed her undignified play with josephine the attitudes the skipping and jumping like the gambols of a calf the wonderful tendency of her clothes to get into mischiefall were continually bringing trouble upon her  if a splash of mud was in the street it always came on her stockings her meals left reminiscences on all her newest dresses her hat was always blowing off and her skirts curiously entangled themselves in rails and balusters caught upon nails and tore into ribbons and though all the repairs fell to josephines lot and the purchase of new garments was no such difficulty as of old aunt barbara was even more severe on such mishaps than mary who had all the trouble and expense of them  after the walk kate had lessons to learn for the next daypoetry dates grammar and the like and after them came her tea and then her evening toilette when as the aunts were out of hearing she refreshed herself with play and chatter with josephine  she was supposed to talk french to her but it was very odd sort of french and josephine did not insist on its being better  she was very good natured and thought miladi had a dull life so she allowed a good many things that a more thoughtful person would have known to be inconsistent with obedience to lady barbara  when dressed kate had to descend to the drawingroom and there await her aunts coming up from dinner  she generally had a book of her own or else she read bits of those lying on the tables till lady barbara caught her and in spite of her protest that at home she might always read any book on the table ordered her never to touch any without express permission  sometimes the aunts worked sometimes lady barbara played and sang they wanted kate to sit up as they did with fancy work and she had a bunch of flowers in berlin wool which she was supposed to be grounding but she much disliked it and seldom set three stitches when her aunts eyes were not upon her  lady jane was a great worker and tried to teach her some pretty stitches but though she began by liking to sit by the soft gentle aunt she was so clumsy a pupil that lady barbara declared that her sister must not be worried and put a stop to the lessons  so kate sometimes read or dawdled over her grounding or when aunt barbara was singing she would nestle up to her other aunt and go off into some dreamy fancy of growing up getting home to the wardours or having them to live with her at her own home or even of a great revolution in which after the pattern of the french nobility she should have to maintain aunt jane by the labour of her hands  what was to become of aunt barbara was uncertain perhaps she was to be in prison and kate to bring food to her in a little basket every day or else she was to run away  but aunt jane was to live in a nice little lodging with no one to wait on her but her dear little niece who was to paint beautiful screens for her livelihood and make her coffee with her own hands  poor lady jane  bedtime came at lasthorrible bedtime with all its terrors  at first kate persuaded josephine and her light to stay till sleep came to put an end to them but lady barbara came up one evening declared that a girl of eleven years old must not be permitted in such childish nonsense and ordered josephine to go down at once and always to put out the candle as soon as lady caergwent was in bed  lady barbara would hardly have done so if she had known how much suffering she caused but she had always been too sensible to know what the misery of fancies could be nor how the silly little brain imagined everything possible and impossible sometimes that thieves were breaking insometimes that the house was on firesometimes that she should be smothered with pillows like the princes in the tower for the sake of her titlesometimes that the gunpowder plot would be acted under the house  most often of all it was a thought that was not foolish and unreal like the rest  it was the thought that the last judgment might be about to begin  but kate did not use that thought as it was meant to be used when we are bidden to watch  if she had done so she would have striven every morning to live this day as if the last  but she never thought of it in the morning nor made it a guide to her actions or else she would have dreaded it less  and at night it did not make her particular about obedience  it only made her want to keep josephine as if josephine and a candle could protect her from that day and hour  and if the moment had come would she not have been safer trying to endure hardness for the sake of obediencewith the holy verses mr wardour had taught her on her lips alone with her god and her good angelthan trying to forget all in idle chatter with her maid and contrary to known commands detaining her by foolish excuses  it is true that kate did not feel as if obedience to lady barbara was the same duty as obedience to papa  perhaps it was not in the nature of things that she should but no one can habitually practise petty disobedience to one placed in authority over her without hurting the whole disposition    chapter iv    thursday morning  bothercalisthenic dayill go to sleep again to put it off as long as i can  if i was only a little countess in her own feudal keep i would get up in the dawn and gather flowers in the may dewprimroses and eglantinecharlie says it is affected to call sweetbriar eglantinesylvia  sylvia that thorn has got hold of me and theres aunt barbara coming down the lane in the bakers jiggeting cartoh dear was it only dreaming  i thought i was gathering dogroses with charlie and sylvia in the lane and now it is only thursday and horrid calisthenic day  i suppose i must wake up   awake my soul and with the sun thy daily stage of duty run   im sure its a very tiresome sort of stage  we used to say as happy as a queen i am sure if the queen is as much less happy than a countess as i am than a common little girl she must be miserable indeed  it is like a ruleofthree sum  let me seeif a common little girl has one hundred happinesses a day and a countess only only fivehow many has the queen  nobut how much higher is a queen than a countess  if i were queen i would put an end to aunts and to calisthenic exercises and i would send for all my orphan nobility and let them choose their own governesses and playfellows and always live with country clergymen  i am sure nobody ought to be oppressed as aunt barbara oppresses me  it is just like james v of scotland when the douglases got hold of him  i wonder what is the use of being a countess if one never is to do anything to please oneself and one is to live with a cross old aunt  most likely everyone is of lady caergwents morning opinionthat lady barbara umfraville was cross and that it was a hard lot to live in subjection to her  but there are two sides to a question and there were other hardships in that house besides those of the countess of caergwent  forty years ago two little sisters had been growing up together so fond of each other that they were like one and though the youngest barbara was always brighter stronger braver and cleverer than gentle jane she never enjoyed what her sister could not do and neither of them ever wanted any amusement beyond quiet play with their dolls and puzzles contrivances in pretty fancy works and walks with their governess in trim gravel paths  they had two elder brothers and one younger but they had never played out of doors with them and had not run about or romped since they were almost babies they would not have known how and jane was always sickly and feeble and would have been very unhappy with loud or active ways  as time passed on jane became more weakly and delicate while barbara grew up very handsome and full of life and spirit but fonder of her sister than ever and always coming home from her parties and gaieties as if telling jane about them was the best part of all  at last lady barbara was engaged to be married to a brother officer of her second brother james but just then poor jane fell so ill that the doctors said she could not live through the year  barbara loved her sister far too well to think of marrying at such a time and said she must attend to no one else  all that winter and spring she was nursing her sister day and night watching over her and quite keeping up the little spark of life the doctors said by her tender care  and though lady jane lived on day after day she never grew so much better as to be fit to hear of the engagement and that if she recovered her sister would be separated from her and so weeks went on and still nothing could be done about the marriage  as it turned out this was the best thing that could have happened to lady barbara for in the course of this time it came to her fathers knowledge that her brother and her lover had both behaved disgracefully and that if she had married she must have led a very unhappy life  he caused the engagement to be broken off  she knew it was right and made no complaint to anybody but she always believed that it was her brother james who had been the tempter who had led his friend astray and from that time though she was more devoted than ever to her sick sister she was soft and bright to nobody else  she did not complain but she thought that things had been very hard with her and when people repine their troubles do not make them kinder but the brave grow stern and the soft grow fretful  all this had been over for nearly thirty years and the brother and the friend had both been long dead  lady barbara was very anxious to do all that she thought right and she was so wise and sensible and so careful of her sister jane that all the family respected her and looked up to her  she thought she had quite forgiven all that had passed  she did not know why it was so hard to her to take any notice of her brother jamess only son  perhaps if she had she would have forced herself to try to be more warm and kind to him and not have inflamed lord caergwents displeasure when he married imprudently  her sister jane had never known all that had passed she had been too ill to hear of it at the time and it was not lady barbaras way to talk to other people of her own troubles  but jane was always led by her sister and never thought of people or judged events otherwise than as barbara told her so that kind and gentle as she was by nature she was like a double of her sister instead of by her mildness telling on the family counsels  the other brother giles had been aware of all and saw how it was but he was so much younger than the rest that he was looked on by them like a boy long after he was grown up and had not felt entitled to break through his sister barbaras reserve so as to venture on opening out the sorrows so long past and pleading for his brother jamess family though he had done all he could for them himself  he had indeed been almost constantly on foreign service and had seen very little of his sisters  since their fathers death the two sisters had lived their quiet life together  they were just rich enough to live in the way they thought the duty of persons in their rank keeping their carriage for lady janes daily drive and spending two months every year by the sea and one at caergwent castle with their eldest brother  they always had a spare room for any old friend who wanted to come up to town and they did many acts of kindness and gave a great deal to be spent on the poor of their parish  they did the same quiet things every day  one liked what the other liked and lady barbara thought morning noon and night what would be good for her sisters health while lady jane rested on barbaras care and was always pleased with whatever came in her way  and so the two sisters had gone on year after year and were very happy in their own way till the great grief came of losing their eldest brother and not long after him his son the nephew who had been their great pride and delight and for whom they had so many plans and hopes  and with his death there came what they felt to be the duty and necessity of trying to fit the poor little heiress for her station they were not fond of any children and it upset all their ways very much to have to make room for a little girl her maid and her governess but still if she had been such a little girl as they had been and always like the wellbehaved children whom they saw in drawingrooms they would have known what kind of creature had come into their hands  but was it not very hard on them that their niece should turn out a little wild harumscarum creature such as they had never dreamt of really unable to move without noises that startled lady janes nerves and threw lady barbara into despair at the harm they would doa child whose untutored movements were a constant eyesore and distress to them and though she could sometimes be bright and fairy like if unconstrained always grew abrupt and uncouth when under restrainta child very far from silly but apt to say the silliest thingslearning quickly all that was mere headwork but hopelessly or obstinately dull at what was to be done by the fingersa child whose ways could not be called vulgar but would have been completely tomboyish except for a certain timidity that deprived them of the one merit of courage and a certain frightened consciousness that was in truth modesty though it did not look like it  to have such a being to endure and more than that to break into the habits of civilized life and the dignity of a lady of rank was no small burden for them but they thought it right and made up their minds to bear it  of course it would have been better if they had taken home the little orphan when she was destitute and an additional weight to mr wardour and had she been actually in poverty or distress with no one to take care of her lady barbara would have thought it a duty to provide for her  but knowing her to be in good hands it had not then seemed needful to inflict the child on her sister or to conquer her own distaste to all connected with her unhappy brother james  no one had ever thought of the little katharine aileve umfraville becoming the head of the family for then young lord umfraville was in his full health and strength  and why did lady barbara only now feel the charge of the child a duty  perhaps it was because without knowing it she had been brought up to make an idol of the state and consequence of the earldom since she thought breeding up the girl for a countess incumbent on her when she had not felt tender compassion for the brothers orphan grandchild  so somewhat of the pomps of this world may have come in to blind her eyes but whatever she did was because she thought it right to do and when kate thought of her as cross it was a great mistake  lady barbara had great control of temper and did everything by rule keeping herself as strictly as she did everyone else except lady jane and though she could not like such a troublesome little incomprehensible wild cat as katharine she was always trying to do her strict justice and give her whatever in her view was good or useful  but kate esteemed it a great holiday when as sometimes happened aunt barbara went out to spend the evening with some friends and she under promise of being very good used to be aunt janes companion  those were the times when her tongue took a holiday and it must be confessed rather to the astonishment and confusion of lady jane  aunt jane do tell me about yourself when you were a little girl  ah my dear that does not seem so very long ago  time passes very quickly  to think of such a great girl as you being poor jamess grandchild  was my grandpapa much older than you aunt jane  only three years older my dear  then do tell me how you played with him  i never did my dear i played with your aunt barbara  dear me how stupid  one cant do things without boys  no my dear boys always spoil girls play they are so rough  oh no no aunt jane theres no fun unless one is roughi mean not rough exactly but its no use playing unless one makes a jolly good noise  my dear said lady jane greatly shocked i cant bear to hear you talk so nor to use such words  dear me aunt jane we say jolly twenty times a day at st jamess and nobody minds  ah yes you see you played with boys  but our boys are not rough aunt jane persisted kate who liked hearing herself talk much better than anyone else  mary says charlie is a great deal less riotous than i am especially since he went to school and armyn is too big to be riotous  oh dear i wish mr brown would send armyn to london he said he would be sure to come and see me and he is the jolliest most delightful fellow in the world  my dear child said lady jane in her soft distressed voice indeed that is not the way young ladies talk ofofboys  armyn is not a boy aunt jane hes a man  he is a clerk you know and will get a salary in another year  a clerk  yes in mr browns office you know  aunt jane did you ever go out to tea  yes my dear sometimes we drank tea with our little friends in the dolls teacups  oh you cant think what fun we have when mrs brown asks us to tea she has got the nicest garden in the world and a greenhouse and a great squirtsyringe i mean to water it and we always used to get it till once without meaning it i squirted right through the drawingroom window and made such a puddle and mrs brown thought it was charlie only i ran in and told of myself and mrs brown said it was very generous and gave me a venetian weight with a little hermit in a snowstorm only it is worn out now and wont snow so i gave it to little lily when we had the whoopingcough  by this time lady jane was utterly ignorant what the gabble was about except that katharine had been in very odd company and done very strange things with those boys and she gave a melancholy little sound in the pause but kate taking breath ran on again   it is because mrs brown is not used to educating children you know that she fancies one wants a reward for telling the truth i told her so but mary thought it would vex her and stopped my mouth well then we young onesthat is charlie and sylvia and armyn and idrank tea out on the lawn  mary had to sit up and be company but we had such fun  there was a great old laurel tree and armyn put sylvia and me up into the fork and that was our nest and we were birds and he fed us with strawberries and we pretended to be learning to fly and stood up flapping our frocks and squeaking and charlie came under and danced the branches about  we didnt like that and armyn said it was a shame and hunted him away racing all round the garden and we scrambled down by ourselves and came down on the slope  it is a long green slope right down to the river all smooth and turfy you know and i was standing at the top when charlie comes slyly and saying he would help the little bird to fly gave me one push and down i went roll roll tumble tumble till sylvia really thought she heard my neck crack  wasnt it fun  but the river my dear said lady jane shuddering  oh there was a good flat place before we came to the river and i stopped long before that  so then as we had been the birds of the air we thought we would be the fishes of the sea and it was nice and shallow with dear little caddises and river crayfish and great british pearlshells at the bottom  so we took off our shoes and stockings and charlie and armyn turned up their trousers and we had such a nice paddling  i really thought i should have got a british pearl then and you know there were some in the breastplate of venus  in the river  did your cousin allow that  oh yes we had on our old blue checks and mary never minds anything when armyn is there to take care of us  when they heard in the drawingroom what we had been doing they made mary sing auld lang syne because of we twa hae paidlit in the burn frae morning sun till dine and whenever in future times i meet armyn i mean to say   we twa hae paidlit in the burn    frae morning sun till dine weve wandered many a weary foot    sin auld lang syne   or perhaps i shall be able to sing it and that will be still prettier  and kate sat still thinking of the prettiness of the scene of the stranger alone in the midst of numbers in the splendid drawing rooms hearing the sweet voice of the lovely young countess at the piano singing this touching memorial of the simple days of childhood  lady jane meanwhile worked her embroidery and thought what wonderful disadvantages the poor child had had and that barbara really must not be too severe on her after she had lived with such odd people and that it was very fortunate that she had been taken away from them before she had grown any older or more used to them  soon after kate gave a specimen of her manners with boys  when she went into the diningroom at luncheon time one wet afternoon she heard steps on the stairs behind her aunts and there appeared a very pleasantlooking gentleman followed by a boy of about her own age  here is our niece said lady barbara  katharine come and speak to lord de la poer  kate liked his looks and the way in which he held out his hand to her but she knew she should be scolded for her awkward greeting  so she put out her hand as if she had no use of her arm above the elbow hung down her head and said do at least no more was audible  but there was something comfortable and encouraging in the grasp of the strong large hand over the foolish little fingers and he quite gave them to his son whose shake was a real treat the contact with anything young was like meeting a followcountryman in a foreign land though neither as yet spoke  she found out that the boys name was ernest and that his father was taking him to school but had come to arrange some business matters for her aunts upon the way  she listened with interest to lord de la poers voice for she liked it and was sure he was a greater friend there than any she had before seen  he was talking about gilesthat was her uncle the colonel in india and she first gathered from what was passing that her uncles eldest and only surviving son an officer in his own regiment had never recovered a wound he had received at the relief of lucknow and that if he did not get better at simlah where his mother had just taken him his father thought of retiring and bringing him home though all agreed that it would be a very unfortunate thing that the colonel should be obliged to resign his command before getting promoted but they fully thought he would do so for this was the last of his children another son had been killed in the mutiny and two or three little girls had been born and died in india  kate had never known this  her aunts never told her anything nor talked over family affairs before her and she was opening her ears most eagerly and turning her quick bright eyes from one speaker to the other with such earnest attention that the guest turned kindly to her and said do you remember your uncle  oh dear no  i was a little baby when he went away  kate never used dear as an adjective except at the beginning of a letter but always and very unnecessarily as an interjection and this time it was so emphatic as to bring lady barbaras eyes on her  did you see either giles or poor frank before they went out to him  oh dear no  this time the dear was from the confusion that made her always do the very thing she ought not to do  no my niece has been too much separated from her own relations said lady barbara putting this as an excuse for the oh dears  i hope mr wardour is quite well said lord de la poer turning again to kate  oh yes quite thank you and then with brightening eyes she ventured on do you know him  i saw him two or three times he answered with increased kindness of manner  will you remember me to him when you write  very well said kate promptly but he says all those sort of things are nonsense  the horror of the two aunts was only kept in check by the good manners that hindered a public scolding but lord de la poer only laughed heartily and said indeed  what sort of things may i ask lady caergwent  whylove and regards and remembrances  mary used to get letters from her schoolfellows all filled with dearest loves and we always laughed at her and armyn used to say them by heart beforehand said kate  i beg to observe was the answer in the grave tone which however kate understood as fun that i did not presume to send my love to mr wardour  may not that make the case different  yes said kate meditatively only i dont know that your remembrance would be of more use than your love  and are we never to send any messages unless they are of use  this was a puzzling question and kate did not immediately reply  none for pleasureeh  well but i dont see what would be the pleasure  what do you consider it pleasurable to be universally forgotten  nobody ever could forget pamy uncle wardour cried kate with eager vehemence flashing in her eyes  certainly not said lord de la poer in a voice as if he were much pleased with her he is not a man to be forgotten  it is a privilege to have been brought up by him  but come lady caergwent since you are so critical will you be pleased to devise some message for me that may combine use pleasure and my deep respect for him and as she sat beside him at the table he laid his hand on hers so that she felt that he really meant what he said  she sat fixed in deep thought and her aunts who had been miserable all through the conversation began to speak of other things but in the midst the shrill little voice broke in i know what and good natured lord de la poer turned at once smiling and saying well what  if you would help in the new aisle  you know the church is not big enough there are so many people come into the district with the new ironworks you know and we have not got half room enough and cant make more though we have three services and we want to build a new aisle and it will cost 250 pounds but we have only got 139 pounds 15s 6d  and if you would but be so kind as to give one sovereign for itthat would be better than remembrances and respects and all that sort of thing  i rather think it would said lord de la poer and though lady barbara eagerly exclaimed oh do not think of it the child does not know what she is talking of  pray excuse her he took out his purse and from it came a crackling smooth fivepound note which he put into the hand saying there my dear cut that in two and send the two halves on different days to mr wardour with my best wishes for his success in his good works  will that do  kate turned quite red and only perpetrated a choked sound of her favourite q  for the whole world she could not have said more  but though she knew perfectly well that anger and wrath were hanging over her she felt happier than for many a long week  presently the aunts rose and lady barbara said to her in the low ceremonious voice that was a sure sign of warning and displeasure you had better come up stairs with us katharine and amuse lord ernest in the back drawingroom while his father is engaged with us  kates heart leapt up at the sound amuse  she popped her precious note into her pocket bounded upstairs and opened the back drawing room door for her playfellow as he brought up the rear of the procession  lord de la poer and lady barbara spread the table with papers lady jane sat by the children were behind the heavy red curtains that parted off the second room  there was a great silence at first then began a little tittering then a little chattering then presently a stifled explosion  lady barbara began to betray some restlessness she really must see what that child was about  no no said lord de la poer leave them in peace  that poor girl will never thrive unless you let her use her voice and limbs  i shall make her come over and enjoy herself with my flock when we come up en masse  the explosions were less carefully stifled and there were some sounds of rushing about some small shrieks and then the door shut and there was a silence again  by this it may be perceived that kate and ernest had become tolerably intimate friends  they had informed each other of what games were their favourites kate had told him the wardour names and ages and required from him in return those of his brothers and sisters  she had been greatly delighted by learning that adelaide was no end of a hand at climbing trees and that whenever she should come and stay at their house ernest would teach her to ride  and then they began to consider what play was possible under the present circumstances beginning they hardly knew how by dodging one another round and round the table making snatches at one another gradually assuming the characters of hunter and red indian  only when the hunter had snatched up aunt janes tortoiseshell papercutter to stab with complaining direfully that it was a stupid place with nothing for a gun and the red indians crinoline had knocked down two chairs she recollected the consequences in time to strangle her own warwhoop and suggested that they should be safer on the stairs to which ernest readily responded adding that there was a great gallery at home all full of pillars and statues the jolliest place in the world for making a row  oh dear oh dear how i hope i shall go there cried kate swinging between the rails of the landingplace  i do want of all things to see a statue  a statue why dont you see lots every day  oh  i dont mean great equestrian things like the trafalgar square ones or the dukeor anything big and horrid like achilles in the park holding up a shield like a green umbrella  i want to see the work of the great sculptor julio romano  he wasnt a sculptor  yes he was didnt he sculpno what is the wordhermione  no i mean they pretended he had done her  hermione  what have you seen the winters tale  papauncle wardour that isread it to us last christmas  well ive seen it  alfred and i went to it last spring with our tutor  oh then do pray let us play at it  look theres a little stand up there where i have always so wanted to get up and be hermione and descend to the sound of slow music  theres a musicalbox in the back drawingroom that will make the music  very well but i must be the lion and bear killing the courtier  o yesvery well and ill be courtier only i must get a sofa cushion to be perdita  and wheres bohemia  oh the hall must be bohemia and the staircarpet the sea because then the aunts wont hear the lion and bear roaring  with these precautions the characteristic roaring and growling of lion and bear and the shrieks of the courtier though not absolutely unheard in the drawingroom produced no immediate results  but in the very midst of lady janes signing her name to some paper she gave a violent start and dropped the pen for they were no stage shrieksah ah  it is coming down  help me down  ernest ernest help me down  ahand then a great fall  the little mahogany bracket on the wall had been mounted by the help of a chair but it was only fixed into the plaster being intended to hold a small lamp and not for young ladies to stand on so no sooner was the chair removed by which kate had mounted than she felt not only giddy in her elevation but found her pedestal loosening  there was no room to jump and ernest perhaps enjoying what he regarded as a girls foolish fright was a good way off endeavouring to wind up the musicalbox when the bracket gave way and hermione descended precipitately with anything but the sound of soft music and as the inhabitants of the drawingroom rushed out to the rescue her legs were seen kicking in the air upon the landingplace ernest looking on not knowing whether to laugh or be dismayed  lord de la poer picked her up and sat down on the stairs with her between his knees to look her over and see whether she were hurt or what was the matter while she stood half sobbing with the fright and shock  he asked his son rather severely what he had been doing to her  he did nothing gasped kate i was only hermione  yes thats all papa repeated ernest it is all the fault of the plaster  and a sort of explanation was performed between the two children at which lord de la poer could hardly keep his gravity though he was somewhat vexed at the turn affairs had taken  he was not entirely devoid of awe of the lady barbara and would have liked his children to be on their best behaviour before her  well he said i am glad there is no worse harm done  you had better defer your statueship till we can find you a sounder pedestal lady caergwent  oh call me kate whispered she in his ear turning redder than the fright had made her  he smiled and patted her hand then added we must go and beg pardon i suppose i should not wonder if the catastrophe had damaged aunt jane the most and if so i dont know what will be done to us  he was right lady barbara had only satisfied herself that no bones had been broken and then turned back to reassure her sister but lady jane could not be frightened without suffering for it and was lying back on the sofa almost faint with palpitation when lord de la poer with kates hand in his came to the door looking much more consciously guilty than his son who on the whole was more diverted than penitent at the commotion they had made  lady barbara looked very grand and very dignified but lord de la poer was so grieved for lady janes indisposition that she was somewhat softened and then he began asking pardon blending himself with the children so comically that in all her fright and anxiety kate wondered how her aunt could help laughing  it never was lady barbaras way to reprove before a guest but this good gentleman was determined that she should not reserve her displeasure for his departure and he would not go away till he had absolutely made her promise that his little friend as he called kate should hear nothing more about anything that had that day taken place  lady barbara kept her promise  she uttered no reproof either on her nieces awkward greeting her abrupt conversation and its tendency to pertness nor on the loudness of the unlucky game and the impropriety of climbing nor even on what had greatly annoyed her the asking for the subscription to the church  there was neither blame nor punishment but she could not help a certain cold restraint of manner by which kate knew that she was greatly displeased and regarded her as the most hopeless little saucy romp that ever maiden aunt was afflicted with  and certainly it was hard on her  she had a great regard for lord de la poer and thought his a particularly well trained family and she was especially desirous that her little niece should appear to advantage before him  nothing she was sure but katharines innate naughtiness could have made that wellbehaved little ernest break out into rudeness and though his father had shown such good nature he must have been very much shocked  what was to be done to tame this terrible little savage was poor lady barbaras haunting thought morning noon and night  and what was it that kate did want  i believe nothing could have made her perfectly happy or suited to her aunt but that she would have been infinitely happier and better off had she had the spirit of obedience of humility or of unselfishness    chapter v    the one hour of play with ernest de la poer had the effect of making kate long more and more for a return of fun and of intercourse with beings of her own age and of high spirits  she wove to herself dreams of possible delights with sylvia and charlie if the summer visit could be paid to them and at other times she imagined her uncle giless two daughters still alive and sent home for education arranging in her busy brain wonderful scenes in which she with their assistance should be happy in spite of aunt barbara  these fancies however would be checked by the recollection that it was shocking to lower two happy spirits in heaven into playful little girls upon earth and she took refuge in the thought of the coming chance of playfellows when lord de la poer was to bring his family to london  she had learnt the names and ages of all the ten and even had her own theories as to what her contemporaries were to be likemary and fanny ernests elders and adelaide and grace who came next below him she had a vision for each of them and felt as if she already knew them  meanwhile the want of the amount of air and running about to which she had been used did really tell upon her she had giddy feelings in the morning tired limbs and a weary listless air and fretted over her lessons at times  so they showed her to the doctor who came to see lady jane every alternate day and when he said she wanted more exercise her morning walk was made an hour longer and a shuttlecock and battledores were bought with which it was decreed that mrs lacy should play with her for exactly half an hour every afternoon or an hour when it was too wet to go out  it must be confessed that this was a harder task to both than the music lessons  whether it were from the difference of height or from kates innate unhandiness they never could keep that unhappy shuttlecock up more than three times and mrs lacy looked as grave and melancholy all the time as if she played it for a punishment making little efforts to be cheerful that were sad to see  kate hated it and was always cross and willingly would they have given it up by mutual consent but the instant the tap of the cork against the parchment ceased if it were not halfpast five down sailed lady barbara to inquire after her prescription  she had been a famous battledoreplayer in the galleries of caergwent castle and once when she took up the battledore to give a lesson it seemed as if between her and mrs lacy the shuttlecock would not come downthey kept up five hundred and eightyone and then only stopped because it was necessary for her to go to dinner  she could not conceive anyone being unable to play at battledore and thought kates failures and dislike pure perverseness  once kate by accident knocked her shuttlecock through the window and hoped she had got rid of it but she was treated as if she had done it out of naughtiness and a new instrument of torture as she called it was bought for her  it was no wonder she did not see the real care for her welfare and thought this intensely cruel and unkind but it was a great pity that she visited her vexation on poor mrs lacy to whom the game was even a greater penance than to herself especially on a warm day with a bad headache  even in her best days at home kate had resisted learning to take thought for others  she had not been considerate of marys toil nor of mr wardours peace except when armyn or sylvia reminded her and now that she had neither of them to put it into her mind she never once thought of her governess as one who ought to be spared and pitied  yet if she had been sorry for mrs lacy and tried to spare her trouble and annoyance how much irritability and peevishness and sense of constant naughtiness would have been prevented  and it was that feeling of being always naughty that was what had become the real dreariness of kates present home and was far worse than the music the battledore or even the absence of fun  at last came a message that lady caergwent was to be dressed for going out to make a call with lady barbara as soon as luncheon was over  it could be on no one but the de la poers and kate was so delighted that she executed all manner of little happy hops skips and fidgets all the time of her toilette and caused many an expostulation of mais miladi from josephine before the pretty delicate blue and white muslin worked white jacket and white ribboned and feathered hat were adjusted  lady barbara kept her little countess very prettily and quietly dressed but it was at the cost of infinite worry of herself kate and josephine for there never was a child whom it was so hard to keep in decent trim armyns old saying that she ought to be always kept dressed in sacking as the only thing she could not spoil was a true one for the sharp hasty movements and entire disregard of where she stepped were so ruinous that it was on the records of the bruton street household that she had gone far to demolish eight frocks in ten days  however on this occasion she did get safe down to the carriage clothes gloves and all without detriment or scolding and jumped in first  she was a long way yet from knowing that though her aunts gave the first place to her rank it would have been proper in her to yield it to their years and make way for them  she was too childish to have learnt this as a matter of good breeding but she might have learnt it of a certain parable which she could say from beginning to end that she should sit not down in the highest room  her aunt sat down beside her and spent the first ten minutes of the drive in enjoining on her proper behaviour at lady de la poers  the children there were exceedingly well brought up she said and she was very desirous they should be her nieces friends but she was certain that lady de la poer would allow no one to associate with them who did not behave properly  lord de la poer was very kind to me just as i was said kate in her spirit of contradiction which was always reckless of consequences  gentlemen are no judges of what is becoming to a little girl said lady barbara severely  unless you make a very different impression upon lady de la poer she will never permit you to be the friend of her daughters  i wonder how i am to make an impression meditated kate as they drove on i suppose it would make an impression if i stood up and repeated ruin seize thee ruthless king or something of that sort as soon as i got in  but one couldnt do that and i am afraid nothing will happen  if the horses would only upset us at the door and aunt barbara be nicely insensible and the young countess show the utmost presence of mind  but nothing nice and like a book ever does happen  and after all i believe that it is all nonsense about making impressions  thinking of them is all affectation and one ought to be as simple and unconscious as one can  a conclusion which did honour to the countesss sense  in fact she had plenty of sense if only she had ever used it for herself instead of for the little ladies she drew on her quires of paper  lady barbara had started early as she really wished to find her friends at home and accordingly when the stairs were mounted and the aunt and niece were ushered into a pretty brightlooking drawing room there they found all that were not at school enjoying their afterdinner hour of liberty with their father and mother  lord de la poer himself had the youngest in his arms and looked very much as if he had only just scrambled up from the floor his wife was really sitting on the ground helping two little ones to put up a puzzle of wild beasts and there was a little herd of girls at the farther corner all very busy over something towards which kates longing eyes at once turnedeven in the midst of lord de la poers very kind greeting and his wifes no less friendly welcome  it was true that as lady barbara had said they were all exceedingly wellbred children  even the little fellow in his fathers arms though but eighteen months old made no objection to hold out his fat hand graciously and showed no shyness when lady barbara kissed him and the others all waited quietly over their several occupations neither shrinking foolishly from notice nor putting themselves forward to claim it  only the four sisters came up and took their own special visitor into the midst of them as their own property the elder of them however at a sign from her mamma taking the baby in her arms and carrying him off followed by the other two small ones only pausing at the door for him to kiss his little hand and wave it in the prettiest fashion of baby stateliness  the other sisters drew kate back with them into the room where they had been busy  generally however much she and sylvia might wish it they had found acquaintance with other children absolutely impossible in the presence of grownup people whose eyes and voices seemed to strike all parties dumb  but these children seemed in no wise constrained  one of them said at once we are so glad you are come mamma said she thought you would before we went out one of those days  isnt it horrid going out in london asked kate at once set at ease  it is not so nice as it is at home said one of the girls laughing except when it is our turn to go out with mamma  she takes us all out in turn explained another from fanny down to little cecil the babyand that is our great time for talking to her when one has her all alone  and does she never take you out in the country  oh yes but there are people staying with us then or else she goes out with papa  it is not a regular drive every day as it is here  kate would not have had a drive with aunt barbara every day for more than she could well say  however she was discreet enough not to say so and asked what they did on other days  oh we walk with miss oswald in the park and she tells us stories or we make them  we dont tell stories in the country unless we have to walk straight along the drives that as papa says we may have some solace  then it was explained that miss oswald was their governess and that they were very busy preparing for her birthday  they were making a papercase for her all themselves and this hour was their only time for doing it out of her sight in secret  but why do you make it yourselves said kate one can buy such beauties at the bazaars  yes but mamma says a present one has taken pains to make is worth a great deal more than what is only bought for trouble goes for more than money  but one can make nothing but nasty tumbletopieces things objected kate  that depends said lady mary in a very odd merry voice and the other two adelaide and grace who were far too much alike for kate to guess which was which began in a rather offended manner to assure her that their papercase was to be anything but tumbletopieces fanny was to bind it and papa had promised to paste its back and press it  and mamma drove with me to richmond on purpose to get leaves to spatter added the other sister  then they showed katewhose eyes brightened at anything approaching to a messthat they had a piece of coloured cardboard on which leaves chiefly fern were pinned tightly down and that the entire sheet was then covered with a spattering of ink from a toothbrush drawn along the tooth of a comb  when the process was completed the form of the loaf remained in the primitive colour of the card thrown out by the cloud of inkspots and only requiring a tracing of its veins by a pen  a space had been cleared for these operations on a sidetable and in spite of the newspaper on which the appliances were laid and even the comb and brush there was no look of disarrangement or untidiness  oh dodo show me how you do it cried kate who had had nothing to do for months with the dear delight of making a mess except what she could contrive with her paints  and lady grace resumed a brownholland apron and bib and opening her hands with a laugh showed their black insides then took up her implements  oh dodo let me try was kates next cry one little bit to show sylvia wardour  with one voice the three sisters protested that she had better not she was not properly equipped and would ink herself all over  if she would pin down a leaf upon the scrap she held up grace should spatter it for her and they would make it up into anything she liked  but this did not satisfy kate at all the pinning out of the leaf was stupid work compared with the glory of making the ink fly  in vain did adelaide represent that all the taste and skill was in the laying out the leaves and pinning them down and that anyone could put on the ink in vain did mary represent the dirtiness of the work  this was the beauty of it in her eyes and the sight of the black dashes sputtering through the comb filled her with emulation so that she entreated almost piteously to be allowed to do an ivy loaf which she had hastily and not very carefully pinned out with marys assistancethat is she had feebly and unsteadily stuck every pin and mary had steadied them  the new friends consented seeing how much she was set on it but fanny who had returned from the nursery insisted on precautions took off the jacket turned up the frock sleeves and tied on an apron though kate fidgeted all the time as if a great injury were being inflicted on her and really in her little frantic spirit thought lady fanny a great torment determined to delay her delight till her aunt should go away and put a stop to it  when once she had the brush she was full of fun and merriment and kept her friends much amused by her droll talk half to them half to her work  theres a portentous cloud isnt there  an inky cloud if ever there was one  take care inhabitants below growl growl theres the thunder now comes the rain hail hail all hail like the beginning of macbeth  which the frenchman said was in compliment to the climate said fanny at which the whole company fell into convulsions of laughing and neither kate nor grace exactly knew what hands or brush or comb were about but whereas the little de la poers had from their infancy laughed almost noiselessly and without making faces kate for her misfortune had never been broken of a very queer contortion of her lips and a cackle like a bantam hens  when this unlucky cackle had been several times repeated it caused lady barbara who had been sitting with her back to the inner room to turn round  poor lady barbara  it would not be easy to describe her feelings when she saw the young lady whom she had brought delicately blue and white like a speedwell flower nearly as black as a sweep  lord de la poer broke out into an uncontrollable laugh half at the aunt half at the niece  why she has grown a moustache he exclaimed  girls what have you been doing to her and walking up to them he turned kate round to a mirror where she beheld her own brown eyes looking out of a face dashed over with black specks thicker about the mouth giving her altogether much the colouring of a very dark man closely shaved  it was so exceedingly comical that she went off into fits of laughing in which she was heartily joined by all the merry party  there said lord de la poer do you want to know what your uncle giles is like youve only to look at yourself  see barbara is it not a capital likeness  i never thought her like giles said her aunt gravely with an emphasis on the name as if she meant that the child did bear a likeness that was really painful to her  my dears said the mother you should not have put her in such a condition could you not have been more careful  kate expected one of them to say she would do it in spite of us but instead of that fanny only answered it is not so bad as it looks mamma i believe her frock is quite safe and we will soon have her face and hands clean  whereupon kate turned round and said it is all my fault and nobodys elses  they told me not but it was such fun  and therewith she obeyed a pull from grace and ran upstairs with the party to be washed and as the door shut behind them lord de la poer said you need not be afraid of that likeness barbara  whatever else she may have brought from her parsonage she has brought the spirit of truth  though knowing that something awful hung over her head kate was all the more resolved to profit by her brief minutes of enjoyment and the little maidens all went racing and flying along the passages together kate feeling as if the rapid motion among the other young feet was life once more  well your frock is all right i hope your aunt will not be very angry with you said adelaide  she know adelaide now for grace was the inky one  it is not a thing to be angry for added grace  no it would not have been at my home said kate with a sigh but oh i hope she will not keep me from coming here again  she shall not exclaimed adelaide papa wont let her  she said your mamma would mind what your papa did not said kate who was not very well informed on the nature of mammas  oh thats all stuff decidedly cried adelaide  when papa told us about you she said poor child  i wish i had her here  prudent fanny made an endeavour at chocking her little sister but the light in kates eye and the responsive face drew grace on to ask she didnt punish you i hope for your tumbling off the bracket  no your papa made her promise not but she was very cross  did he tell you about it  oh yes and what do you think ernest wrote  you must know he had grumbled excessively at papas having business with lady barbara but his letter said it wasnt at all slow at lady barbaras for there was the jolliest fellow there you ever knew mind you get her to play at acting  lady fanny did not think this improving and was very glad that the maid came in with hot water and towels and put an end to it with the work of scrubbing  going home lady barbara was as much displeased as kate had expected and with good reason  after all her pains it was very strange that katharine should be so utterly unfit to behave like a wellbred girl there might have been excuse for her before she had been taught but now it was mere obstinacy  she should be careful how she took her out for a long time to come  kates heart swelled within her  it was not obstinacy she know and that bit of injustice hindered her from seeing that it was really wilful recklessness  she was elated with ernests foolish schoolboy account of her which a more maidenly little girl would not have relished she was strengthened in her notion that she was illused by hearing that the de la poers pitied her and because she found that aunt barbara was considered to be a little wrong she did not consider that she herself had ever been wrong at all  and lady barbara was not far from the truth when she told her sister that katharine was perfectly hard and reckless there was no such thing as making her sorry    chapter vi    after that first visit kate did see something of the de la poers but not more than enough to keep her in a constant ferment with the uncertain possibility and the longing for the meetings  the advances came from them lady barbara said very truly that she could not be responsible for making so naughty a child as her niece the companion of any wellregulated children she was sure that their mother could not wish it since nice and good as they naturally were this unlucky katharine seemed to infect them with her own spirit of riot and turbulence whenever they came near her  there was no forwarding of the attempts to make appointments for walks in the park though really very little harm had ever come of them guarded by the two governesses and by lady fannys decided ideas of propriety  that kate embarked in long stories and in their excitement raised her voice was all that could be said against her on those occasions and mrs lacy forbore to say it  once indeed kate was allowed to ask her friends to tea but that proved a disastrous affair  fanny was prevented from coming and in the absence of her quiet eldersisterly care the spirits of grace and adelaide were so excited by kates drollery that they were past all check from mary and drew her along with them into a state of frantic fun and mad pranks  they were full of merriment all tea time even in the presence of the two governesses and when that was over and kate showed the bracket they began to grow almost ungovernable in their spirit of frolic and fun  they went into kates room resolved upon being desert travellers set up an umbrella hung round with cloaks for a tent made camels of chairs and finding those tardy attempted riding on each otherwith what results to aunt janes ears below may be imagineddressed up wild arabs in bournouses of shawls and made muskets of parasols charging desperately and shrieking for attack defence for triumph or despair as kate observed in one of her magnificent quotations  finally the endangered traveller namely grace rushed down the stairs headlong with the two arabs clattering after him banging with their muskets and shouting their warcry the whole height of the house  the ladies in the drawingroom had borne a good deal but aunt jane was by this time looking meekly distracted and lady barbara sallying out met the arab sheikh with his white frock over his head descending the stairs in the rear calling to his tribe in his sweet voice not to be so noisybut not seeing before him through the said bournouse he had very nearly struck lady barbara with his parasol before he saw her  no one could be more courteous or full of apologies than the said sheikh who was in fact a good deal shocked at his unruly tribe and quite acquiesced in the request that they would all come and sit quiet in the drawingroom and play at some suitable game there  it would have been a relief to mary to have them thus disposed of safely and adelaide would have obeyed but the other two had been worked up to a state of wildness such as befalls little girls who have let themselves out of the control of their better sense  they did not see why they should sit up stupid in the drawingroom mary was as cross as lady barbara herself to propose it said grace unfortunately just as the lady herself was on the stairs to enforce her desire in her gravely courteous voice whereupon kate half tired and wholly excited burst out into a violent passionate fit of crying and sobbing declaring that it was very hard that whenever she had ever so little pleasure aunt barbara always grudged it to her  none of them had ever heard anything like it to the little de la poers she seemed like one beside herself and grace clung to mary and adelaide to miss oswald almost frightened at the screams and sobs that kate really could not have stopped if she would  lady jane came to the head of the stairs pale and trembling begging to know who was hurt and mrs lacy tried gentle reasoning and persuading but she might as well have spoken to the storm beating against the house  lady barbara sternly ordered her off to her room but the child did not stirindeed she could not except that she rocked herself to and fro in her paroxysms of sobbing which seemed to get worse and worse every moment  it was miss oswald at last who being more used to little girls and their naughtiness than any of the others saw the right moment at last and said as she knelt down by her half kindly half severely my dear you had better let me take you up stairs  i will help you  and you are only shocking everyone here  kate did let her take her upstairs though at every step there was a pause a sob a struggle but a gentle hand on her shoulder and firm persuasive voice in her ear moved her gradually onwards till the little pink room was gained and there she threw herself on her bed in another agony of wild subs unaware of miss oswalds parley at the door with lady barbara and mrs lacy and her entreaty that the patient might be left to her which they were nothing loth to do  when kate recovered her speech she poured out a wild and very naughty torrent about being the most unhappy girl in the world the aunts were always unkind to her she never got any pleasure she could not bear being a countess she only wanted to go back to her old home to papa and mary and sylvia and nobody would help her  miss oswald treated the poor child almost as if she had been a little out of her mind let her say it all between her sobs and did not try to argue with her but waited till the talking and the sobbing had fairly tried her out and by that time the hour had come at which the little visitors were to go home  the governess rose up and said she must go asking in a quiet tone as if all that had been said were mere mad folly whether lady caergwent would come down with her and tell her aunts she was sorry for the disturbance she had made  kate shrank from showing such a spectacle as her swollen tear stained redmarbled visage  she was thoroughly sorry and greatly ashamed and she only gasped out i cant i cant dont let me see anyone  then i will wish mary and her sisters goodbye for you  yes please  kate had no words for more of her sorrow and shame  and shall i say anything to your aunt for you  ii dont know only dont let anyone come up  then shall i tell lady barbara you are too much tired out now for talking but that you will tell her in the morning how sorry you are  well yes said kate rather grudgingly  oh must you go  i am afraid i must my dear  their mamma does not like addie and grace to be kept up later than their usual bedtime  i wish you could stay  i wish you were my governess said kate clinging to her and receiving her kind friendly pitying kiss  and when the door had shut upon her kates tears began to drop again at the thought that it was very hard that the little de la poers who had father mother and each other should likewise have such a nice governess while she had only poor sad dull mrs lacy  had kate only known what an unselfish little girl and mrs lacy might have been to each other  however the first thing she could now think of was to avoid being seen or spoken to by anyone that night and for this purpose she hastily undressed herself bundledup her hair as best she might as in former days said her prayers and tumbled into bed drawing the clothes over her head resolved to give no sign of being awake come who might  her shame was real and very great  such violent crying fits had overtaken her in past times but had been thought to be outgrown she well recollected the last  it was just after the death of her aunt mrs wardour just when the strange stillness of sorrow in the house was beginning to lessen and the children had forgotten themselves and burst out into noise and merriment till they grew unrestrained and quarrelsome charlie had offended kate she had struck him and mary coming on them grieved and hurt at their conduct at such a time had punished kate for the blow but missed perception of charlies offence and the notion of injustice had caused the shrieking cries and violent sobs that had brought mr wardour from the study in grave sorrowful severity  what she had heard afterwards from him about not making poor marys task harder and what she had heard from mary about not paining him had really restrained her and she had thought such outbreaks passed by among the baby faults she had left behind and was the more grieved and ashamed in consequence  she felt it a real exposure she remembered her young friends surprised and frightened eyes and not only had no doubt their mother would really think her too naughty to be their playfellow but almost wished that it might be soshe could never never bear to see them again  she heard the street door close after them she heard the carriage drive away she felt half relieved but then she hid her face in the pillow and cried more quietly but more bitterly  then some one knocked she would not answer  then came a voice saying katharine  it was aunt barbaras but it was rather wavering  she would not answer so the door was opened and the steps scarcely audible in the rustling of the silk came in and kate felt that her aunt was looking at her wondered whether she had better put out her head ask pardon and have it over but was afraid and presently heard the moire antique go sweeping away again  and then the foolish child heartily wished she had spoken and was seized with desperate fears of the morrow more of the shame of hearing of her tears than of any punishment  why had she not been braver  after a time came a light and josephine moving about quietly and putting away the clothes that had been left on the floor  kate was not afraid of her but her caressing consolations and pity would have only added to the miserable sense of shame so there was no sign no symptom of being awake though it was certain that before josephine went away the candle was held so as to cast a light over all that was visible of the face  kate could not help hearing the low muttering of the frenchwoman who was always apt to talk to herself asleep  ah yes  she sleeps profoundly  how ugly la petite has made herself  what cries  ah she is like miladi her aunt a demon of a temper  kate restrained herself till the door was shut again and then rolled over and over till she had made a strange entanglement of her bed clothes and brought her passion to an end by making a mummy of herself bound hand and foot snapping with her month all the time as if she longed to bite  o you horrible frenchwoman  you are a flatterer a base flatterer such as always haunt the great  i hate it all  i a demon of a temper  i like aunt barbara  oh you wretch  ill tell aunt barbara a tomorrow and get you sent away  those were some of kates fierce angry thoughts in her first vexation but with all her faults she was not a child who ever nourished rancour or malice and though she had been extremely wounded at first yet she quickly forgave  by the time she had smoothed out her sheet and settled matters between it and her blanket she had begun to think more coolly  no no i wont  it would be horribly dishonourable and all that to tell aunt barbara  josephine was only thinking out loud and she cant help what she thinks  i was very naughty no wonder she thought so only next time she pets me i will say to her you cannot deceive me josephine i like the plain truth better than honeyed words  and now that kate had arrived at the composition of a fine speech that would never be made it was plain that her mind was pretty well composed  that little bit of forgiveness though it had not even cost an effort had been softening soothing refreshing it had brought peacefulness and kate lay not absolutely asleep but half dreaming in the summer twilight in the soft undefined fancies of one tired out with agitation  she was partly roused by the various sounds in the house but not startledthe light nights of summer always diminished her alarms and she heard the clocks strike and the bell ring for prayers the doors open and shut all mixed in with her hazy fancies  at last came the silken rustlings up the stairs again and the openings of bedroom doors close to her  kate must have gone quite to sleep for she did not know when the door was opened and how the soft voices had come in that she heard over her  poor little dear  how she has tossed her bed about  i wonder if we could set the clothes straight without wakening her  how very sweet and gentle aunt janes voice was in that low cautious whisper  some oneand kate knew the peculiar sound of mrs lacys crapewas moving the bedclothes as gently as she could  poor little dear again said lady jane it is very sad to see a child who has cried herself to sleep  i do wish we could manage her better  do you think the child is happy she ended by asking in a wistful voice  she has very high spirits was the answer  ah yes her impetuosity it is her misfortune poor child  barbara is so calm and resolute thatthat  was lady jane really going to regret anything in her sister  she did not say it however but kate heard her sigh and add ah well if i were stronger perhaps we could make her happier but i am so nervous  i must try not to look distressed when her spirits do break out for perhaps it is only natural  and i am so sorry to have brought all this on her and spoilt those poor childrens pleasure  lady jane bent over the child and kate reared herself up on a sudden threw her arms round her neck and whispered aunt jane dear aunt jane ill try never to frighten you again  i am so sorry  there there have i waked you  dont my dear your aunt will hear  go to sleep again  yes do  but aunt jane was kissing and fondling all the time and the end of this sad naughty evening was that kate went to sleep with more softness love and repentance in her heart than there had been since her coming to bruton street    chapter vii    lady caergwent was thoroughly ashamed and bumbled by that unhappy evening  she looked so melancholy and subdued in the morning with her heavy eyelids and inflamed eyes and moved so meekly and sadly without daring to look up that lady barbara quite pitied her and saidmore kindly than she had ever spoken to her before  i see you are sorry for the exposure last night so we will say no more about it  i will try to forget it  i hope our friends may  that hope sounded very much like i do not think they will and truly kate felt that it was not in the nature of things that they ever should  she should never have forgotten the sight of a little girl in that frenzy of passion  no she was sure that their mamma and papa knew all about it and that she should never be allowed to play with them again and she could not even wish to meet them she should be miserably ashamed and would not know which way to look  she said not one word about meeting them and for the first day or two even begged to walk in the square instead of the park and she was so good and steady with her lessons and so quiet in her movements that she scarcely met a word of blame for a whole week  one morning while she was at breakfast with lady barbara and mrs lacy the unwonted sound of a carriage stopping and of a double knock was heard  in a moment the colour flushed into lady barbaras face and her eyes lighted  then it passed away into a look of sadness  it had seemed to her for a moment as if the bright young nephew who had been the light and hope of her life were going to look in on her and it had only brought the remembrance that he was gone for ever and that in his stead there was only the poor little girl to whom rank was a misfortune and who seemed as if she would never wear it becomingly  kate saw nothing of all this she was only eager and envious for some change and variety in these long dull days  it was lord de la poer and his daughter adelaide who the next moment were in the room and she remembered instantly that she had heard that this was to be adelaides birthday and wished her many happy returns in all due form her heart beating the while with increasing hope that the visit concerned herself  and did it not  her head swam round with delight and suspense and she could hardly gather up the sense of the words in which lord de la poer was telling lady barbara that adelaides birthday was to be spent at the crystal palace at sydenham that the other girls were gone to the station with their mother and that he had come round with adelaide to carry off kate and meet the rest at ten oclock lady de la poer would have written but it had only boon settled that morning on finding that he could spare the day  kate squeezed adelaides hand in an agony  oh would that aunt let her go  you would like to come asked lord de la poer bending his pleasant eyes on her  have you ever been there  never  oh thank you  i should like it so much  i never saw any exhibition at all except once the gigantic cabbagemay i go aunt barbara  really you are very kind after  oh we never think of afters on birthdaysdo we addie  if you are so very good perhaps mrs lacy will kindly bring her to meet you  i am sure said he turning courteously to that lady that we should be very sorry to give mrs lacy so much trouble  if this is to be a holiday to everyone i am sure you would prefer the quiet day  no one could look at the sad face and widows cap without feeling that so it must be even without the embarrassed thank you my lord if  ifif katharine were more to be trusted began lady barbara  now barbara he said in a drolly serious fashion if you think the court of chancery would seriously object say so at once  lady barbara could not keep the corners of her mouth quite stiff but she still said you do not know what you are undertaking  do you deliberately tell me that you think myself and fanny to say nothing of young fanny who is the wisest of us all unfit to be trusted with this one young lady said he looking her full in the face and putting on a most comical air  it is humiliating i own  ah if katharine were like your own daughters i should have no fears said the aunt  buthowever since you are so goodif she will promise to be very careful  oh yes yes aunt barbara  i make myself responsible said lord de la poer  now young woman run off and get the hat we have no time to lose  kate darted off and galloped up the stairs at a furious pace shouted josephine at the top and then receiving no answer pulled the bell violently after which she turned round and obliged adelaide with a species of dancing hug rather to the detriment of that young ladys muslin jacket  i was afraid to look back before she breathlessly said as she released adelaide i felt as if your papa were orpheus when   stern proserpine relented and gave him back the fair   and i was sure aunt barbara would catch me like eurydice if i only looked back  what a funny girl you are to be thinking about orpheus and eurydice said adelaide  arent you glad  glad  aint i just as charlie would say  oh dear your papa is a delicious man id rather have him for mine than anybody except uncle wardour  id rather have him than anyone said the little daughter because he is yours said kate but somehow though he is more funny and goodnatured than uncle wardour i wouldntno i shouldnt like him so well for a papa  i dont think he would punish so well  punish cried adelaide  is that what you want  why mamma says children ought to be always pleasure and no trouble to busy fathers but there kate you are not getting readyand we are to be at the station at ten  i am waiting for josephine  why doesnt she come said kate ringing violently again  why dont you get ready without her  i dont know where anything is  it is very tiresome of her when she knows i never dress myself said kate fretfully  dont you  why grace and i always dress ourselves except for the evening  let me help you  are not those your boots  kate rushed to the bottom of the attic stairs and shouted josephine at the top of her shrill voice then receiving no answer she returned condescended to put on the boots that adelaide held up to her and noisily pulled out some drawers but not seeing exactly what she wanted she again betook herself to screams of her maids name at the third of which out burst mrs bartley in a regular state of indignation  lady caergwent  will your ladyship hold your tongue  theres lady jane startled up and its a mercy if her nerves recover it the whole daymaking such a noise as that  but josephine wont come and im going out bartley said kate piteously  where is josephine  gone out my lady so it is no use making a piece of work said bartley crossly retreating to lady jane  kate was ready to cry but behold that handy little adelaide had meantime picked out a nice black silk cape with hat and feather gloves and handkerchief which if not what kate had intended were nice enough for anything and would havesome months agoseemed to the orphan at the parsonage like robes of state  kind adelaide held them up so triumphantly that kate could not pout at their being only everyday things and as she began to put them on out came mrs bartley again by lady janes orders pounced upon lady caergwent and made her repent of all wishes for assistance by beginning upon her hair and in spite of all wriggles and remonstrances dressing her in the peculiarly slow and precise manner by which a maid can punish a troublesome child until finally katefar too much irritated for a word of thanks tore herself out of her hands caught up her gloves and flew downstairs as if her life depended on her speed  she thought the delay much longer than it had really been for she found lord de la poer talking so earnestly to her aunt that he hardly looked up when she came insomething about her uncle giles in india and his coming homewhich seemed to be somehow becoming possiblethough at a great loss to himself but there was no making it out and in a few minutes he rose and after some fresh charges from lady barbara to her niece not to forgot herself kate was handed into the carriage and found herself really off  then the tingle of wild impatience and suspense subsided and happiness began  it had not been a good beginning but it was very charming now  adelaide and her father were full of jokes together so quick and bright that kate listened instead of talking  she had almost lost the habit of merry chatter and it did not come to her quickly again but she was greatly entertained and thus they came to the station where lady de la poer and her other three girls were awaiting them and greeted kate with joyful faces  they were the more relieved at the arrival of the three because the station was close and heated and it was a very warm summer day so that the air was extremely oppressive  it feels like thunder said some one  and thenceforth kates perfect felicity was clouded  she had a great dislike to a thunder storm and she instantly began asking her neighbours if they really thought it would be thunder  i hope it will said lady fanny it would cool the air and sound so grand in those domes  kate thought this savage and with an imploring look asked lady de la poer if she thought there would be a storm  i cant see the least sign of one was the answer  see how clear the sky is as they steamed out of the station  but do you think there will be one today demanded kate  i do not expect it said lady de la poer smiling and there is no use in expecting disagreeables  disagreeables  o mamma it would be such fun cried grace if we only had a chance of getting wet through  here lord de la poer adroitly called off the public attention from the perils of the clouds by declaring that he wanted to make out the fourth line of an advertisement on the banks of which he said he had made out one line as he was whisked by on each journey he had made and as it was four times over in four different languages he required each damsel to undertake one and there was a great deal of laughing over which it should be that should undertake each language fanny and mary were humble and sure they could never catch the german and kate more enterprising undertook the italian  after all while they were chattering about it they went past the valuable document and were come in sight of the monsters in the gardens and lord de la poer asked kate if she would like to catch a pretty little frog to which mary responded oh what a tadpole it must have been and the discovery that her friends had once kept a preserve of tadpoles to watch them turn into frogs was so delightful as entirely to dissipate all remaining thoughts of thunder and leave kate free for almost breathless amazement at the glittering domes of glass looking like enormous bubbles in the sun  what a morning that was among the bright buds and flowers the wonders of nature and art all together  it was to be a long day and no hurrying so the party went from court to court at their leisure sat down and studied all that they cared for or divided according to their tastes  fanny and mary wanted time for the wonderful sculptures on the noble gates in the italian court but the younger girls preferred roaming more freely so lady de la poer sat down to take care of them while her husband undertook to guide the wanderings of the other three  he particularly devoted himself to kate partly in courtesy as to the guest of the party partly because as he said he felt himself responsible for her and she was in supreme enjoyment talking freely to one able and willing to answer her remarks and questions and with the companionship of girls of her own age besides  she was most of all delighted with the alhambrathe beauty of it was to her like a fairy tale and she had read washington irvings siege of granada so that she could fancy the courts filled with the knightly moors who were so noble that she could not think why they were not christiansnay the tears quite came into her eyes as she looked up in lord de la poers face and asked why nobody converted the abencerrages instead of fighting with them  it was a pity that kate always grew loud when she was earnest and lord de la poers interest in the conversation was considerably lessened by the discomfort of seeing some strangers looking surprised at the five syllables in the squeaky voice coming out of the mouth of so small a lady  gently my dear he softly said and kate for a moment felt it hard that the torment about her voice should pursue her even in such moments and spoil the alhambra itself  however her good humour recovered the next minute at the fountain of lions  she wanted to know how the moors came to have lions she thought she had heard that no mahometans were allowed to represent any living creature for fear it should be an idol  lord de la poer said she was quite right and that the mahometans think these forms will come round their makers at the last day demanding to have souls given to them but that her friends the moors of spain were much less strict than any others of their faith  she could see however that the carving of such figures was a new art with them since these lions were very rude and clumsy performances for people who could make such delicate tracery as they had seen within  and then while kate was happily looking with adelaide at the orange trees that completed the spanish air of the court and hoping to see the fountain play in the evening he told grace that it was worth while taking people to see sights if they had as much intelligence and observation as kate had and did not go gazing idly about thinking of nothing  he meant it to stir up his rather indolentminded gracehe did not mean the countess to hear it but some peoples eyes and ears are wonderfully quick at gathering what is to their own credit and kate who had not heard a bit of commendation for a long time was greatly elated  luckily for appearances she remembered how miss edgeworths frank made himself ridiculous by showing off to mrs j  and how she herself had once been overwhelmed by the laughter of the wardour family for having rehearsed to poor mrs brown all the characters of the gods of the northmenodin thor and allwhen she had just learnt them  so she was more careful than before not to pour out all the little that she knew and she was glad she had not committed herself for she had very nearly volunteered the information that pompeii was overwhelmed by mount etna before she heard some one say vesuvius and perceived her mistake feeling as if she had been rewarded for her modesty like a good child in a book  she applauded herself much more for keeping back her knowledge till it was wanted than for having it but this selfsatisfaction looked out in another loophole  she avoided pedantry but she was too much elated not to let her spirits get the better of her and when lady de la poer and the elder girls came up they found her in a suppressed state of capering more like a puppy on its hind logs than like a countess or any other wellbred child  the party met under the screen of kings and queens and there had some dinner at one of the marble tables that just held them pleasantly  the cold chicken and tongue were wonderfully good on that hot hungry day and still better were the strawberries that succeeded them and oh what mirth went on all the time  kate was chattering fastest of all and loudestnot to say the most nonsensically  it was not nice nonsensethat was the worst of it it was pert and saucy  it was rather the family habit to laugh at mary de la poer for ways that were thought a little fanciful and kate caught this up and bantered without discretion in a way not becoming towards anybody especially one some years her elder  mary was goodhumoured but evidently did not like being asked if she had stayed in the mediaeval court because she was afraid the great bulls of nineveh would run at her with their five legs  she will be afraid of being teazed by a little goose another time said lord de la poer intending to give his little friend a hint that she was making herself very silly but kate took it quite another way and not a pretty one for she answered dear me mary cant you say bo to a goose  say what cried adelaide who was always apt to be a good deal excited by kate and who had been going off into fits of laughter at all these foolish sallies  it is not a very nice thing to say answered her mother gravely so there is no occasion to learn it  kate did take the hint this time and coloured up to the ears partly with vexation partly with shame  she sat silent and confused for several minutes till her friends took pity on her and a few good natured words about her choice of an ice quite restored her liveliness  it is well to be goodhumoured but it is unlucky nay wrong when a check from friends without authority to scold does not suffice to bring soberness instead of rattling giddiness  lady de la poer was absolutely glad to break up the dinner so as to work off the folly and excitement by moving about before it should make the little girl expose herself or infect adelaide  they intended to have gone into the gardens till four oclock when the fountains were to play but as they moved towards the great door they perceived a dark heavy cloud was hiding the sun that had hitherto shone so dazzlingly through the crystal walls  that is nice said lady fanny it will be cool and pleasant now before the rain  if the rain is not imminent began her father  oh is it going to be a thunderstorm cried kate  oh dear  i do so hate thunder  what shall i do cried she all her excitement turning into terror  before anyone could answer her there was a flash of bright white light before all their eyes and a little scream  shes struck shes struck cried adelaide her hands before her eyes  for kate had disappeared  no she was in the great pond beside which they had been standing and mary was kneeling on the edge holding fast by her frock  but before the deep voice of the thunder was roaring and reverberating through the vaults lord de la poer had her in his grasp and the growl had not ceased before she was on her feet again drenched and trembling beginning to be the centre of a crowd who were running together to help or to see the child who had been either struck by lightning or drowned  is she struck  will she be blind sobbed adelaide still with her hands before her eyes and the inquiry was echoed by the nearer people while more distant ones told each other that the young lady was blind for life  struck nonsense said lord de la poer the lightning was twenty miles off at least  are you hurt my dear  no said kate shaking herself and answering no more decidedly only i am so wet and my things stick to me  how did it happen asked grace  i dont know  i wanted to get away from the thunder said bewildered kate  meantime an elderly lady who had come up among the spectators was telling lady de la poer that she lived close by and insisting that the little girl should be taken at once to her house put to bed and her clothes dried  lady de la poer was thankful to accept the kind offer without loss of time and in the fewest possible words it was settled that she would go and attend to the little drowned rat while her girls should remain with their father at the palace till the time of going home when they would meet at the station  they must walk to the good ladys house be the storm what it would as the best chance of preventing kate from catching cold  she looked a rueful spectacle dripping so as to make a little pool on the stone floor her hat and feather limp and streaming her hair in long lank rats tails each discharging its own waterfall her clothes ribbons and all pasted down upon her  there was no time to be lost and the stranger took her by one hand lady de la poer by the other and exchanging some civil speeches with one another half out of breath they almost swung her from one step of the grand stone stairs to another and hurried her along as fast as these beplastered garments would let her move  there was no rain as yet but there was another clap of thunder much louder than the first but they held kate too fast to let her stop or otherwise make herself more foolish  in a very few minutes they were at the good ladys door in another minute in her bedroom where while she and her maid bustled off to warm the bed lady de la poer tried to get the clothes offa service of difficulty when every tie held fast every button was slippery and the tighter garments fitted like skins  kate was subdued and frightened she gave no trouble but all the help she gave was to pull a string so as to make a hopeless knot of the bow that her friend had nearly undone  however by the time the bed was warm the dress was off and the child rolled up in a great loose nightdress of the kind ladys was installed in it feelingsultry day though it werethat the warm dryness was extremely comfortable to her chilled limbs  the good lady brought her some hot tea and moved away to the window talking in a low murmuring voice to lady de la poer  presently a fresh flash of lightning made her bury her head in the pillow and there she began thinking how hard it was that the thunder should come to spoil her one days pleasure but soon stopped this remembering who sends storm and thunder and feeling afraid to murmur  then she remembered that perhaps she deserved to be disappointed  she had been wild and troublesome had spoilt adelaides birthday teazed mary and made kind lady de la poer grave and displeased  she would say how sorry she was and ask pardon  but the two ladies still stood talking  she must wait till this stranger was gone  and while she was waitinghow it was she knew notbut countess kate was fast asleep    chapter viii    when kate opened her eyes again and turned her face up from the pillow she saw the drops on the window shining in the sun and lady de la poer with her bonnet off reading under it  all that had happened began to return on kates brain in a funny medley and the first thing she exclaimed was oh those poor little fishes how i must have frightened them  my dear  do you think i did much mischief said kate raising herself on her arm  i am sure the fishes must have been frightened and the water lilies broken  oh you cant think how nasty their great coiling stems werejust like snakes  but those pretty blue and pink flowers  did it hurt them much do you thinkor the fish  i should think the fish had recovered the shock said lady de la poer smiling but as to the lilies i should be glad to be sure you had done yourself as little harm as you have to them  oh no said kate im not hurtif aunt barbara wont be terribly angry  now i wouldnt mind that only that ive spoilt addies birthday and all your day  please im very sorry  she said this so sadly and earnestly that lady de la poer came and gave her a kind hiss of forgiveness and said  never mind the girls are very happy with their father and the rest is good for me  kate thought this very comfortable and kind and clung to the kind hand gratefully but though it was a fine occasion for one of the speeches she could have composed in private all that came out of her mouth was how horrid it isthe way everything turns out with me  nay things need not turn out horrid if a certain little girl would keep herself from being silly  but i am a silly little girl cried kate with emphasis  uncle wardour says he never saw such a silly one and so does aunt barbara  well my dear said lady de la poer very calmly when clever people take to being silly they can be sillier than anyone else  clever people cried kate half breathlessly  yes said the lady you are a clever child and if you made the most of yourself you could be very sensible and hinder yourself from being foolish and unguarded and getting into scrapes  kate gasped  it was not pleasant to be in a scrape and yet her whole self recoiled from being guarded and watchful even though for the first time she heard she was not absolutely foolish  she began to argue i was naughty i know to teaze mary and mary at home would not have let me but i could not help the tumbling into the pond  i wanted to get out of the way of the lightning  now kate you are trying to show how silly you can make yourself  but i cant bear thunder and lightning  it frightens me so i dont know what to do and aunt jane is just as bad  she always has the shutters shut  your aunt jane has had her nerves weakened by bad health but you are young and strong and you ought to fight with fanciful terrors  but it is not fancy about lightning  it does kill people  a storm is very awful and is one of the great instances of gods power  he does sometimes allow his lightnings to fall but i do not think it can be quite the thought of this that terrifies you kate for the recollection of his hand is comforting  no said kate honestly it is not thinking of that  it is that the glarecoming no one knows whenand the great rattling clap are soso frightful  then my dear i think all you can do is to pray not only for protection from lightning and tempest but that you may be guarded from the fright that makes you forget to watch yourself and so renders the danger greater  you could not well have been drowned where you fell but if it had been a river  i know said kate  and try to get selfcommand  that is the great thing after all that would hinder things from being horrid said lady de la poer with a pleasant smile just as a knock came to the door and the maid announced that it was five oclock and misss things were quite ready and in return she was thanked and desired to bring them up  miss said kate rather hurt  dont they know who we are  it is not such a creditable adventure that we should wish to make your name known said lady de la poer rather drily and kate blushed and became ashamed of herself  she was really five minutes before she recovered the use of her tongue and that was a long time for her  lady de la poer meantime was helping her to dress as readily as josephine herself could have done and brushing out the hair which was still damp  kate presently asked where the old lady was  she had to go back as soon as the rain was over to look after a nephew and niece who are spending the day with her  she said she would look for our party and tell them how we were getting on  then i have spoilt three peoples pleasure more said kate ruefully  is the niece a little girl  i dont know i fancy her grown up or they would have offered clothes to you  then i dont care said kate  what for  why for not telling my name  once it would have been like a fairy tale to sylvia and me and have made up for anything to see a countessespecially a little girl  but dont you think seeing me would quite spoil that  lady de la poer was so much amused that she could not answer at first and kate began to feel as if she had been talking foolishly and turned her back to wash her hands  certainly i dont think we are quite as well worth seeing as the crystal palace  you put me in mind of what madame campan said  she had been governess to the first napoleons sisters and when in the days of their grandeur she visited them one of them asked her if she was not awestruck to find herself among so much royalty really she said i cant be much afraid of queens whom i have whipped  they were only mock queens said kate  very true  but little woman it is all mockery unless it is the self that makes the impression and i am afraid being perched upon any kind of pedestal makes little faults and follies do more harm to others  but come put on your hat  we must not keep papa waiting  the hat was the worst part of the affair the colour of the blue edge of the ribbon had run into the white and the pretty soft feather had been so daggled in the wet that an old hen on a wet day was respectability itself compared with it and there was nothing for it but to take it out and even then the hat reminded kate of a certain amelia matilda bunny whose dirty finery was a torment and a byword in st jamess parsonage  her frock and white jacket had been so nicely ironed out as to show no traces of the adventure and she disliked all the more to disfigure herself with such a thing on her head for the present as well as to encounter aunt barbara byandby  theres no help for it said lady de la poer seeing her disconsolately surveying it perhaps it will not be bad for you to feel a few consequences from your heedlessness  whether it were the hat or the shock kate was uncommonly meek and subdued as she followed lady de la poer out of the room and after giving the little maid half a sovereign and many thanks for having so nicely repaired the damage they walked back to the palace and up the great stone stairs kate hanging down her head thinking that everyone was wondering how amelia matilda bunny came to be holding by the hand of a lady in a beautiful black lace bonnet and shawl so quiet and simple and yet such a lady  she hardly even looked up when the glad exclamations of the four girls and their father sounded around her and she could not bear their inquiries whether she felt well again  she knew that she owed thanks to mary and her father and apologies to them all but she had not manner enough to utter them and only made a queer scrape with her foot like a hen scratching out corn hung her head and answered yes  they saw she was very much ashamed and they were in a hurry besides so when lord de la poer had said he had given all manner of thanks to the good old lady he took hold of kates hand as if he hardly ventured to let go of her again and they all made the best of their way to the station and were soon in full career along the line kates heart sinking as she thought of aunt barbara  fanny tried kindly to talk to her but she was too anxious to listen made a short answer and kept her eyes fixed on the two heads of the party who were in close consultation rendered private by the noise of the train  if ever i answer for anyone again said lord de la poer  and now for facing barbara  you had better let me do that  what do you think i am afraid and kate thought the smile on his lip very cruel as she could not hear his words  i dont do you much injustice in thinking so as he shrugged up his shoulders like a boy going to be punished but i think barbara considers you as an accomplice in mischief and will have more mercy if i speak  very well  im not the man to prevent you  tell barbara ill undergo whatever she pleases for having ever let go the young ladys hand  she may have me up to the lord chancellor if she pleases  a little relaxation in the noise made these words audible and kate who knew the lord chancellor had some power over her and had formed her notions of him from a picture in a history book at home of judge jefferies holding the bloody assize began to get very much frightened and her friends saw her eyes growing round with alarm and not knowing the exact cause pitied her lord de la poer seated her upon his knee and told her that mamma would take her home and take care aunt barbara did not punish her  i dont think she will punish me said kate she does not often but pray come home with me she added getting hold of the ladys hand  what would she do to you then  she wouldonlybe dreadful said kate  lord de la poer laughed but observed well is it not enough to make one dreadful to have little girls taking unexpected baths in public  now kate please to inform me in confidence what was the occasion of that remarkable somerset  only the lightning muttered kate  oh  i was not certain whether your intention might not have been to make that polite address to an aquatic bird for which you pronounced mary not to have sufficient courage  lady de la poer thinking this a hard trial of the poor childs temper was just going to ask him not to tease her but kate was really candid and good tempered and she said i was wrong to say that  it was mary that had presence of mind and i had not  then the fruit of the adventure is to be i hope look before you leapeh lady caergwent  and at the same time the train stopped and among kisses and farewells kate and kind lady de la poer left the carriage and entering the brougham that was waiting for them drove to bruton street kate very grave and silent all the way and shrinking behind her friend in hopes that the servant who opened the door would not observe her plightindeed she took her hat off on the stairs and laid it on the table in the landing  to her surprise the beginning of what lady de la poer said was chiefly apology for not having taken better care of her  it was all quite true  there was no false excuse made for her she felt when aunt barbara looked ashamed and annoyed and said how concerned she was that her niece should be so unmanageable and her protector answered  not that i assure you  she was a very nice little companion and we quite enjoyed her readiness and intelligent interest but she was a little too much excited to remember what she was about when she was startled  and no wonder said lady jane  it was a most tremendous storm and i feel quite shaken by it still  you cant be angry with her for being terrified by it barbara dear or i shall know what you think of mehalf drowned toopoor child  and aunt jane put her soft arm round kate and put her cheek to hers perhaps the night of kates tears had really made jane resolved to try to soften even barbaras displeasure and the little girl felt it very kind though her love of truth made her cry out roughly not half drowned  mary held me fast and lord de la poer pulled me out  i am sure you ought to be extremely thankful to them said lady barbara and overcome with shame at all the trouble and annoyance you have given  lady de la poer quite understood what the little girl meant by her aunt being dreadful  she would gladly have protected her but it was not what could be begged off like punishment nor would truth allow her to say there had been no trouble nor annoyance  so what she did say was when one has ten children one reckons upon such things and smiled as if they were quite pleasant changes to her  not i am sure with your particularly quiet little girls said aunt barbara  i am always hoping that katharine may take example by them  take care what you hope barbara said lady de la poer smiling and at any rate forgive this poor little maiden for our disaster or my husband will be in despair  i have nothing to forgive said lady barbara gravely  katharine cannot have seriously expected punishment for what is not a moral fault  the only difference will be the natural consequences to herself of her follyyou had better go down to the schoolroom katharine have your tea and then go to bed it is nearly the usual time  lady de la poer warmly kissed the child and then remained a little while with the aunts trying to remove what she saw was the impression that kate had been complaining of severe treatment and taking the opportunity of telling them what she herself thought of the little girl  but though aunt barbara listened politely she could not think that lady de la poer knew anything about the perverseness heedlessness illtemper disobedience and rude ungainly ways that were so tormenting  she said no word about them herself because she would not expose her nieces faults but when her friend talked kates bright candid conscientious character her readiness sense and intelligence she said to herself and perhaps justly that here was all the difference between at home and abroad an authority and a stranger  meantime kate wondered what would be the natural consequences of her folly  would she have a rheumatic fever or consumption like a child in a bookand she tried breathing deep and getting up a little cough to see if it was coming  or would the lord chancellor hear of it  he was new bugbear recently set up and more haunting than even a gunpowder treason in the cellars  what did he do with the seals did he seal up mischievous heiresses in closets as she had seen a door fastened by two seals and a bit of string  perhaps the court of chancery was full of such prisons  and was the woolsack to smother them with like the princes in the tower  it must be owned that it was only when half asleep at night that kate was so absurd  by day she knew very well that the lord chancellor was only a great lawyer but she also knew that whenever there was any puzzle or difficulty about her or her affairs she always heard something mysteriously said about applying to the lord chancellor till she began to really suspect that it was by his commands that aunt barbara was so stern with her and that if he knew of her fall into the pond something terrible would come of it  perhaps that was why the de la poers kept her name so secret  she trembled as she thought of it and here was another added to her many terrors  poor little girl  if she had rightly feared and loved one she would have had no room for the many alarms that kept her heart fluttering    chapter ix    it may be doubted whether countess kate ever did in her childhood discover what her aunt barbara meant by the natural consequences of her folly but she suffered from them nevertheless  when the summer was getting past its height of beauty and the streets were all sun and misty heat and the grass in the parks looked brown and the rooms were so close that even aunt jane had one window open kate grew giddy in the head almost every morning and so weary and dull all day that she had hardly spirit to do anything but read story books  and mrs lacy was quite poorly too though not saying much about it was never quite without a headache and was several times obliged to send kate out for her evening walk with josephine  it was high time to be going out of town and mrs lacy was to go and be with her son in his vacation  this was the time when kate and the wardours had hoped to be together  but the natural consequence of the nonsense kate had talked about being always allowed to do rude and careless things and her wild rhodomontade about romping games with the boys had persuaded her aunts that they were very improper people for her to be with and that it would be wrong to consent to her going to oldburgh  that was one natural consequence of her folly  another was that when the de la poers begged that she might spend the holidays with them and from father and mother downwards were full of kind schemes for her happiness and good lady barbara said to her sister that it was quite impossible these good friends did not know what they were asking and that the child would again expose herself in some way that would never be forgotten unless she were kept in their own sight till she had been properly tamed and reduced to order  it was selfdenying in lady barbara to refuse that invitation for she and her sister would have been infinitely more comfortable together without their troublesome countessabove all when they had no governess to relieve them of her  the going out of town was sad enough to them for they had always paid a long visit at caergwent castle which had felt like their home through the lifetime of their brother and nephew but now it was shut up and their grief for their young nephew came back all the more freshly at the time of year when they were used to be kindly entertained by him in their native home  but as they could not go there they went to bournemouth and the first run kate took upon the sands took away all the giddiness from her head and put an end to the tired feeling in her limbs  it really was a run  aunt barbara gave her leave to go out with josephine and though josephine said it was very sombre and savage between the pinewoods and the sea kate had not felt her heart leap with such fulness of enjoyment since she had made snowballs last winter at home  she ran down to the waves and watched them sweep in and curl over and break as if she could never have enough of them and she gazed at the grey outline of the isle of wight opposite feeling as if there was something very great in really seeing an island  when she came in there was so much glow on her brown check and her eyelids looked so much less heavy that both the aunts gazed at her with pleasure smiled to one another and lady jane kissed her while lady barbara said this was the right thing  she was to be out as much as possible so her aunt made a set of new rules for the day  there was to be a walk before breakfast then breakfast then lady barbara heard her read her chapter in the bible and go through her music  and really the music was not half as bad as might have been expected with aunt barbara  kate was too much afraid of her to give the half attention she had paid to poor mrs lacyfright and her aunts decision of manner forced her to mind what she was about and though aunt barbara found her really very dull and unmusical she did get on better than before and learnt something though more like a machine than a musician  then she went out again till the hottest part of the day during which a bit of french and of english reading was expected from her and half an hour of needlework then her dinner and then out again with her aunts this time aunt jane in a wheeledchair and aunt barbara walking with herthis was rather dreary but when they went in she was allowed to stay out with josephine with only one interval in the house for tea till it grew dark and she was so sleepy with the salt wind that she was ready for bed and had no time to think of the lord chancellor  at first watching those wonderful and beautiful waves was pleasure enough and then she was allowed to her wonder and delight to have a holland dress and dig in the sand making castles and moats or rocks and shipwrecks with beautiful stories about them and sometimes she hunted for the few shells and seaweeds there or she sat down and read some of her favourite books especially poetryit suited the sea so well and she was trying to make ellens isle and all the places of the lady of the lake in sand only she never had time to finish them and they always were either thrown down or washed away before she could return to them  but among all these amusements she was watching the families of children who played together happy creatures  the little sturdy boys that dabbled about so merrily and minded so little the now masters of their indignant nurses the little girls in brown hats with their baskets full the big boys that even took off shoes and dabbled in the shallow water the great sieges of large castles where whole parties attacked and defendedit was a sort of melancholy glimpse of fairyland to her for she had only been allowed to walk on the beach with josephine on condition she never spoke to the other children  would the lord chancellor be after her if she did  her heart quite yearned for those games or even to be able to talk to one of those little damsels and one day when a brightfaced girl ran after her with a piece of weed that she had dropped she could hardly say thank you for her longing to say more and many were the harangues she composed within herself to warn the others not to wish to change places with her for to be a countess was very poor fun indeed  however one morning at the end of the first week kate looked up from a letter from sylvia and said with great glee aunt barbara o aunt barbara  alice and the other sylviasylvia joannaare coming  i may play with them maynt i  who are they said her aunt gravely  uncle wardours nieces said kate sylvias cousins you know only we never saw them but they are just my age and it will be such funonly alice is ill i believe  praypleaselet me play with them and kate had tears in her eyes  i shall see about it when they come  oh butbut i cant have them theresylvias own own cousinsand not play with them  please aunt barbara  you ought to know that this impetuosity never disposes me favourably katharine i will inquire and consider  kate had learnt wisdom enough not to say any more just then but the thought of sociability the notion of chattering freely to young companions and of a real game at play and the terror of having all this withheld and of being thought too proud and haughty for the wardours put her into such an agony that she did not know what she was about made mistakes even in reading and blundered her music more than she had over done under lady barbaras teaching and then when her aunt reproved her she could not help laying down her head and bursting into a fit of crying  however she had not forgotten the terrible teadrinking and was resolved not to be as bad as at that time and she tried to stop herself exclaiming between her sobs o aunt barbaraicannothelp it  and lady barbara did not scold or look stern  perhaps she saw that the little girl was really trying to chock herself for she said quite kindly dont my dear  and just then to kates great wonder in came lady jane though it was full half an hour earlier than she usually left her room and lady barbara looked up to her and said quite as if excusing herself indeed jane i have not been angry with her  and kate somehow understanding that she might flung herself down by aunt jane and hid her face in her lap not crying any more though the sobs were not over and feeling the fondling hands on her hair very tender and comforting though she wondered to hear them talk as if she were asleep or deafor perhaps they thought their voices too low or their words too long and fine for her to understand nor perhaps did she though she gathered their drift well enough and that kind aunt jane was quite pleading for herself in having come to the rescue  i could not help it indeedyou remember lady de la poer dr woodman bothexcitable nervous temperamentalmost hysterical  this unfortunate intelligenceuntoward coincidence said lady barbara  but i have been trying to make her feel i am not in anger and i hope there really was a struggle for selfcontrol  kate took her head up again at this a little encouraged and lady jane kissed her forehead and repeated aunt barbara was not angry with you my dear  no for i think you have tried to conquer yourself said lady barbara  she did not think it wise to tell kate that she thought she could not help it though oddly enough the very thing had just been said over the childs head and kate ventured on it to get up and say quietly yes it was not aunt barbaras speaking to me that made me cry but i am so unhappy about alice and sylvia joanna and a soft caress from aunt jane made her venture to go on  it is not only the playing with them though i do wish for that very very much indeed but it would be so unkind and so proud and ungrateful to despise my own cousins cousins  this was more like the speeches kate made in her own head than anything she had ever said to her aunts and it was quite just besides and not spoken in naughtiness and lady barbara did not think it wrong to show that she attended to it  you are right katharine she said no one wishes you to be either proud or ungrateful  i would not wish entirely to prevent you from seeing the children of the family but it must not be till there is some acquaintance between myself and their mother and i cannot tell whether you can be intimate with them till i know what sort of children they are  much too must depend on yourself and whether you will behave well with them  kate gave a long sigh and looked up relieved and for some time she and her aunt were not nearly so much at war as hitherto but seemed to be coming to a somewhat better understanding  yet it rather puzzled kate  she seemed to herself to have got this favour for crying for it and it was a belief at home not only that nothing was got by crying but that if by some strange chance it were it never came to good and she began the more to fear some disappointment about the expected wardours  for two or three days she was scanning every group on the sands with all her might in hopes of some likeness to sylvia but at last she was taken by surprise  just as she was dressed and aunt barbara was waiting in the drawingroom for aunt jane there came a knock at the door and mrs wardour was announced  in came a small quietlooking lady in mourning and with her a girl of about kates own age there was some curtseying and greeting between the two ladies and her aunt said here is my niececome and speak to mrs wardour my dear and motioned her forwards  now to be motioned forwards by aunt barbara always made kate shrink back into herself and the presence of a little girl before elders likewise rendered her shy and bashful so she came forth as if intensely disgusted put out her hand as if she were going to poke and muttered her favourite do so awkwardly and coldly that lady barbara felt how proud and ungracious it looked and to make up said my niece has been very eager for your coming  and then the two little girls drew off into the window and looked at each other under their eyelashes in silence  sylvia joanna wardour was not like her namesake at home sylvia katharine  she was a thin slight quietlooking child with so little to note about her face that kate was soon wondering at her dress being so much smarter than her own was at present  she herself had on a holland suit with a deep cape which except that they were adorned with labyrinths of white braid were much what she had worn at home also a round brown hat shading her face from the sun whereas sylvias face was exposed by a little turban hat so deeply edged with blue velvet that the white straw was hardly seen had a little wateredsilk jacket and a little flounced frock of a dark silk figured with blue that looked slightly fuzzed out and perhaps she was not at ease in this fine dress for she stood with her head down and one hand on the windowsill pretending to look out of window but really looking at kate  meanwhile the two grownup ladies were almost as stiff and shy though they could not keep dead silence like the children  mrs wardour had heard before that lady barbara umfraville was a formidable person and was very much afraid of her and lady barbara was not a person to set anyone at ease  so there was a little said about taking the liberty of calling for her brotherinlaw was so anxious to hear of lady caergwent  and lady barbara said her niece was very well and healthy and had only needed change of air  and then came something in return about mrs wardours other little girl a sad invalid she said on whose account they were come to bournemouth and there was a little more said of bathing and walking and whether the place was full and then mrs wardour jumped up and said she was detaining lady barbara and took leave kate though she had not spoken a word to sylvia wardour looking at her wistfully with all her eyes and feeling more than usually silly  and when the guests were gone her aunt told her how foolish her want of manner was and how she had taken the very means to make them think she was not glad to see them  she hung down her head and pinched the ends of her gloves she knew it very well but that did not make it a bit more possible to find a word to say to a stranger before the elders unless the beginning were made for her as by the de la poers  however she knew it would be very different out of doors and her heart bounded when her aunt added they seem to be quiet ladylike inoffensive people and i have no objection to your associating with the little girl in your walks as long as i do not see that it makes you thoughtless and ungovernable  oh thank you thank you aunt barbara cried kate with a bouncing bound that did not promise much for her thought or her governableness but perhaps lady barbara recollected what her own childhood would have been without jane for she was not much discomposed only she said  it is very odd you should be so uncivil to the child in her presence and so ecstatic now  however take care you do not get too familiar  remember these wardours are no relations and i will not have you letting them call you by your christian name  kates bright looks sank  that old marriedwoman sound lady caergwent seemed as if it would be a bar between her and the free childish fun she hoped for  yet when so much had been granted she must not call her aunt cross and unkind though she did think it hard and proud  perhaps she was partly right but after all little people cannot judge what is right in matters of familiarity  they have only to do as they are told and they may be sure of this that friendship and respect depend much more on what people are in themselves than on what they call one another  this lady was the widow of mr wardours brother and lived among a great clan of his family in a distant county where mary and her father had sometimes made visits but the younger ones never  kate was not likely to have been asked there for it was thought very hard that she should be left on the hands of her aunts husband  and much had been said of the duty of making her grand relations provide for her or of putting her into the clergy orphan asylum  and there had been much displeasure when mr wardour answered that he did not think it right that a child who had friends should live on the charity intended for those who had none able to help them and soon after the decision he had placed his son armyn in mr browns office instead of sending him to the university  all the wardours were much vexed then but they were not much better pleased when the little orphan had come to her preferment and he made no attempt to keep her in his hands and obtain the large sum allowed for her boardonly saying that his motherless household was no place for her and that he could not at once do his duty by her and by his parish  they could not understand the real love and uprightness that made him prefer her advantage to his ownwhat was right to what was convenient  mrs george wardour had not scolded her brotherinlaw for his want of prudence and care for his own childrens interests but she had agreed with those who did and this perhaps made her feel all the more awkward and shy when she was told that she must go and call upon the lady umfravilles whom the whole family regarded as first so neglectful and then so ungrateful and make acquaintance with the little girl who had once been held so cheap  she was a kind gentle person and a careful anxious mother but not wishing to make great acquaintance nor used to fine people large or small and above all wrapped up in her poor little delicate alice  the next time kate saw her she was walking by the side of alices wheeledchair and sylvia by her side in a more plain and suitable dress  kate set off running to greet them but at a few paces from them was seized by a shy fit and stood looking and feeling like a goose drawing great cs with the point of her parasol in the sand josephine looking on and thinking how bete english children were mrs wardour was not much less shy but she knew she must make a beginning and so spoke in the middle of kates second c  and there was a shaking of hands and walking together  they did not get on very well  nobody talked but mrs wardour and she asked little frightened questions about the oldburgh party as she called them which kate answered as shortly and shylythe more so from the uncomfortable recollection that her aunt had told her that this was the very way to seem proud and unkind but what could she do  she felt as if she were frozen up stiff and could neither move nor look up like herself  at last mrs wardour said that alice would be tired and must go in and then kate managed to blurt out a request that sylvia might stay with her  poor sylvia looked a good deal scared and as if she longed to follow her mamma and sister but the door was shut upon her and she was left alone with those two strange peoplethe countess and the frenchwoman  however kate recovered the use of her limbs and tongue in a moment and instantly took her prisoners hand and ran off with her to the corner where the scenery of loch katrine had so often been begun and began with great animation to explain  thisa hole that looked as if an old hen had been grubbing in itwas loch katrine  loch katharinethats yours  and which is to be loch sylvia said the child recovering as she began to feel by touch motion and voice that she had only to do with a little girl after all  loch nonsense said kate rather bluntly  did you never hear of the lochs the lakes in scotland  loch lomond loch katrine loch awe loch nessbut i dont do my geography out of doors  tisnt geography tis the the lady of the lake  is that a new game  dear me did you never read the lady of the lakesir walter scotts poem    the summer dawns reflected hue   oh  ive learnt that in my extracts but i never did my poetry task out of doors  tisnt a tasktis beautiful poetry  dont you like poetry better than anything  i like it better than all my other lessons when it is not very long and hard  kate felt that her last speech would have brought armyn and charlie down on her for affectation and that it was not strictly true that she liked poetry better than anything for a game at romps and a very amusing story were still better things so she did not exclaim at the other sylvias misunderstanding but only said the lady of the lake is story and poetry too and we will play at it  and how  ill tell you as we go on  im the kingthat is the knight of snowdonjames fitzjames for im in disguise you know and youre ellen  must i be ellen  we had a horrid nurse once who used to slap us and was called ellen  but it was her name  she was ellen douglas and was in banishment on an island with her father  you are ellen and josephine is your old harperallan bane she talks french you know and that will do for highland  gallic and gaelic sound alike you know  there  then im going out hunting and my dear gallant grey will drop down dead with fatigue and i shall lose my way and when you hear me wind my horn tootoo you get upon your hoopthat will be your boat you knowand answer father and when i tootoo again answer malcolm and then put up your hand behind your ear and stand listening   with locks thrown back and lips apart like monument of grecian art   and then ill tell you what to do  away scudded the delighted kate and after having lamented her gallant grey and admired the trosachs came up tootooing through her hand with all her might but found poor ellen very unlike a monument of grecian art absolutely crying and allan bane using his best english and kindest tones to console her  miladi la stupefaitela pauvre petite began josephine and kate in consternation asking what was the matter and josephine encouraging her it was all sobbed out  she did not like to be called ellenand she thought it unkind to send her into banishment and she had fancied she was to get astride on her hoop which she justly thought highly improperand above all she could not bear to say fatherbecause   i never thought you would mind that said kate rather abashed  i never did and i never saw my papa or mamma either  noso you didnt care  well then said kate gravely we wont play at that  lets have marmion instead and ill be killed  but i dont like you to be killed  it is only in play  pleaseplease let us have a nice play  well what do you call a nice play  alice and i used to drive hoops  thats tiresome  my hoop always tumbles down  think of something else  alice and i used to play at ball but theres no ball here  then ill stuff my pockethandkerchief with seaweed and make one and kate spread out her delicate cambric onenot quite so fit for such a purpose as the little cheap cotton ones at home that mary tried in vain to save from cruel misuse  heres a famous piece  look it is all wriggled it is a mermaids old staylace that she has used and thrown away  perhaps she broke it in a passion because her grandmother made her wear so many oyster shells on her tail  there are no such creatures as mermaids said sylvia looking at her solemnly  this was not a promising beginning sylvia joanna was not a bit like sylvia katharine nor like adelaide and grace de la poer yet by seeing each other every day she and kate began to shake together and become friends  there was no fear of her exciting kate to run wild she was a little pussycat in her dread of wet and guarded her clothes as if they could feelindeed her happiest moments were spent in the public walks by alices chair studying how the people were dressed but still she thought it a fine thing to be the only child in bournemouth who might play with the little countess and was so silly as to think the others envied her when she was dragged and ordered about bewildered by kates loud rapid talk about all kinds of odd things in books and distressed at being called on to tear through the pine woods or grub in wet sand  but it was not all silly vanity  she was a gentle loving little girl very goodnatured and sure to get fond of all who were kind to her and she liked kates bright ways and amusing mannerperhaps really liking her more than if she had understood her better and kate liked her and rushed after her on every occasion as the one creature with whom it was possible to play and to chatter  no not quite the one for poor sick alice was better for talk and quiet play than her sister  she read a great deal and there was an exchange of storybooks and much conversation over them between her and kateindeed the spirit and animation of this new friend quite made her light up and brighten out of her languor whenever the shrill laughing voice came near  and kate after having got over her first awe at coming near a child so unlike herself grew very fond of her and felt how good and sweet and patient she was  she never ran off to play till alice was taken indoors and spent all her spare time indoors in drawing picture stories which were daily explained to the two sisters at some seat in the pinewoods  there was one very grand one that lasted all the latter part of the stay at bournemouthas the evenings grew longer and kate had more time for preparing it at the rate of four or five scenes a day drawn and paintedbeing the career of a very good little girl whose parents were killed in a railway accident a most fearful picture was thatall blunders being filled up by spots of vermilion blood and orangecoloured flame and then came all the wonderful exertions by which she maintained her brothers and sisters taught them and kept them in order  they all had names and there was a naughty little alexander whose monkey tricks made even sylvia laugh  sylvia was very anxious that the admirable heroine hilda should be rewarded by turning into a countess and could not enter into kates first objectionfounded on factthat it could not be without killing all the brothers  why couldnt it be done in play like so many other things  to which kate answered there is a sort of true in play but as sylvia could not understand her nor she herself get at her own idea she went on to her other objection a still more startling onethat she couldnt wish hilda anything so nasty  and this very ignoble word was long a puzzle to alice and sylvia  thus the time at the seaside was very happyquite the happiest since kates change of fortune  the one flaw in those times on the sands was when she was alone with sylvia and josephine not in sylvias dulnessthat she had ceased to care aboutbut in a little want of plain dealing  sylvia was never wild or rude but she was not strictly obedient when out of sight and when kate was shocked would call it very unkind and caress and beseech her not to tell  they were such tiny things that they would hardly bear mention but one will do as a specimen  sylvia was one of those very caressing children who can never be happy without clinging to their friends kissing them constantly and always calling them dear love and darling  now mrs wardour knew it was not becoming to see all this embracing in public and was sure besides that lady barbara would not like to see the countess hung upon in sylvias favourite way so she forbade all such demonstrations except the parting and meeting kiss  it was a terrible grievance to sylviait seemed as if her heart could not love without her touch but instead of training herself in a little selfcontrol and obedience she thought it cross and mamma was no sooner out of sight than her arm was around kates waist  kate struggled at firstit did not suit her honourable conscientiousness but then sylvia would begin to cry at the unkindness say kate did not love her that she would not be proud if she was a countess  and kate gave in liked the loveof which poor child she got so littleand let sylvia do as she pleased but never without a sense of disobedience and dread of being caught  so too about her title  sylvia called her darling duck and love and she called sylvia by plenty of such names but she had been obliged to tell of her aunts desirethat katharine and kate should never be used  sylvias ready tears fell but the next day she came back cheerful with the great discovery that darling lady caergwent might be called k her initial and the first syllable of her title  it was the cleverest invention sylvia had ever made and she was vexed when kate demurred honestly thinking that her aunts would like it worse than even kate and that therefore she ought not to consent  but when sylvia coaxingly uttered my own dear duck of a k and the soft warm arm squeezed her and the eyes would have been weeping and the tongue reproaching in another moment she allowed it to go onit was so precious and sweet to be loved and she told sylvia she was a star in the dark night  no one ever found out those and one or two other instances of small disobedience  they were not mischievous josephine willingly overlooked them and there was nothing to bring them to light  it would have been better for sylvia if her faults had been of a sort that brought attention on them more easily  meanwhile lady barbara had almost found in her a model childexcept for her foolish shy silence before her elders before whom she always whisperedand freely let the girls be constantly together  the aunt little knew that this meek wellbehaved maiden was giving the first warp to that upright truth that had been the one sterling point of kates character    chapter x    it had been intended that mrs lacy should rejoin her pupil at bournemouth at the end of six weeks but in her stead came a letter saying that she was unwell and begging for a fortnights grace  at the fortnights end came another letter to which lady barbara answered that all was going on so well that there was no need to think of returning till they should all meet in london on the 1st of october  but before that 1st poor mrs lacy wrote again with great regret and many excuses for the inconvenience she was causing  her son and her doctor had insisted on her resigning her situation at once and they would not even allow her to go back until her place could be supplied  poor thing said lady jane  i always thought it was too much for her  i wish we could have made her more comfortable  it would have been such a thing for her  so it would answered lady barbara if she had had to do with any other child  a little consideration or discretion such as might have been expected from a girl of eleven years old towards a person in her circumstances would have made her happy and enabled her to assist her son  but i have given up expecting feeling from katharine  that speech made kate swell with anger at her aunts tone and in her anger she forgot to repent of having been really thoughtless and almost unkind or to recollect how differently her own gentle sylvia at home would have behaved to the poor lady  she liked the notion of novelty and hoped for a new governess as kind and bright as miss oswald  moreover she was delighted to find that mrs george wardour was going to live in london for the present that alice might be under doctors and sylvia under masters  kate cared little for the why but was excessively delighted with plans for meeting hopes of walks talks and teadrinkings together promises that the other dear sylvia should come to meet her and above all an invitation to spend sylvia joannas birthday with her on the 21st of october and go all together either to the zoological gardens or to the british museum according to the weather  with these hopes kate was only moderately sorry to leave the sea and pinetrees behind her and find herself once more steaming back to london carrying in her hand a fine blue and white travellingbag worked for her by her two little friends but at which lady barbara had coughed rather dryly  in the bag were a great many small white shells done up in twists of paper that pretty story the blue ribbons and a small blank book in which whenever the train stopped kate wrote with all her might  for kate had a desire to convince sylvia joanna that one was much happier without being a countess and she thought this could be done very touchingly and poetically by a fable in verse so she thought she had a very good idea by changing the old daisy that pined for transplantation and found it very unpleasant into a harebell   a harebell blue on a tuft of moss in the wind her bells did toss   that was her beginning and the poor harebell was to get into a hot house where they wanted to turn her into a tall stately campanula and she went through a great deal from the gardeners  there was to be a pretty fairy picture to every verse and it would make a charming birthday present much nicer than anything that could be bought and kate kept on smiling to herself as the drawings came before her minds eye and the rhymes to her minds ear  so they came home but it was odd the old temper of the former months seemed to lay hold of kate as soon as she set foot in the house in bruton street as if the cross feelings were lurking in the old corners  she began by missing mrs lacy very much  the kind soft governess had made herself more loved than the wayward child knew and when kate had run into the schoolroom and found nobody sitting by the fire no sad sweet smile to greet her no one to hear her adventures and remembered that she had worried the poor widow and that she would never come back again she could have cried and really had a great mind to write to her ask her pardon and say she was sorry it would perhaps have been the beginning of better things if she had but of all things in the world what prevented her  just thisthat she had an idea that her aunt expected it of her  o kate  kate  so she went back to the harebell and presently began rummaging among her books for a picture of one to copy and just then lady barbara came in found half a dozen strewn on the floor and ordered her to put them tidy and then be dressed  that put her out and after her old bouncing fashion she flew upstairs caught her frock in the old hitch at the turn and half tore off a flounce  no wonder lady barbara was displeased and that was the beginning of things going wrongnay worse than before the going to bournemouth lady barbara was seeking for a governess but such a lady as she wished for was not to be found in a day and in the meantime she was resolved to do her duty by her niece and watched over her behaviour and gave her all the lessons that she did not have from masters  whether it was that lady barbara did not know exactly what was to be expected of a little girl or whether kate was more fond of praise than was good for her those daily lessons were more trying than ever they had been  generally she had liked them but with aunt barbara the being told to sit upright hold her book straight or pronounce her words rightly always teased her and put her out of humour at the beginning  or she was reminded of some failure of yesterday and it always seemed to her unjust that bygones should not be bygones or even when she knew she had been doing her best her aunt always thought she could have done better so that she had no heart or spirit to try another time but went on in a dull savetrouble way hardly caring to exert herself to avoid a scolding it was so certain to come  it was not righta really diligent girl would have won for herself the peaceful sense of having done her best and her aunt would have owned it in time whereas poor kates resistance only made herself and her aunt worse to each other every day and destroyed her sense of duty and obedience more and more  lady barbara could not be always with her and when once out of sight there was a change  if she were doing a lesson with one of her masters she fell into a careless attitude in an instant and would often chatter so that there was no calling her to order except by showing great determination to tell her aunt  it made her feel both sly and guilty to behave so differently out of sight and yet now that she had once begun she seemed unable to help going on and she was sure foolish child that aunt barbaras strictness made her naughty  then there were her walks  she was sent out with josephine in the morning and desired to walk nowhere but in the square and in the afternoon she and josephine were usually set down by the carriage together in one of the parks and appointed where to meet it again after lady jane had taken her airing when she was well enough for she soon became more ailing than usual  they were to keep in the quiet paths and not speak to anyone  but neither josephine nor her young lady had any turn for what was triste  one morning when kate was in great want of a bit of indiarubber and had been sighing because of the displeasure she should meet for having lost her own through using it in playhours josephine offered to take heronly a little out of her wayto buy a new piece  kate knew this was not plain dealing and hated herself for it but she was tired of being scolded and consented  and then how miserable she was how afraid of being asked where she had been how terrified lest her aunt should observe that it was a new not an old piece how humiliated by knowing she was acting untruth  and then josephine took more liberties  when kate was walking along the path thinking how to rhyme to pride she saw josephine talking over the iron rail to a man with a beard and she told her maid afterwards that it was wrong but josephine said miladi had too good a heart to betray her and the man came again and again and once even walked home part of the way with josephine a little behind the young lady  kate was desperately affronted and had a great mind to complain to her aunts  but then josephine could have told that they had not been in the square garden at all that morning but in much more entertaining streets  poor kate these daily disobediences did not weigh on her nearly as much as the first one did it was all one general sense of naughtiness  working at her harebell was the pleasantest thing she did but her eagerness about it often made her neglectful and brought her into scrapes  she had filled one blank book with her verses and pictures some rather good some very bad and for want of help and correction she was greatly delighted with her own performance and thought it quite worthy of a little ornamental album where she could write out the verses and gum in the drawings  please aunt barbara let me go to the soho bazaar today  i cannot take you there i have an engagement  but may i not go with josephine  certainly not  i would not trust you there with her  besides you spend too much upon trumpery as it is  i dont want it for myself i want something to get ready for sylvias birthdaythe sylvia that is come to london i mean  i do not approve of a habit of making presents  oh but aunt barbara i am to drink tea with her on her birthday and spend the day and go to the zoological gardens and i have all ready but my presents and it will not be in time if you wont let me go today  i never grant anything to pertinacity answered lady barbara  i have told you that i cannot go with you today and you ought to submit  but the birthday aunt barbara  i have answered you once katharine you ought to know better than to persist  kate pouted and the tears swelled in her eyes at the cruelty of depriving her of the pleasure of making her purchase and at having her beautiful fanciful production thus ruined by her aunts unkindness  as she sat over her geography lesson out of sight of her own bad writing her brokenbacked illuminated capitals her lumpy campanulas crookedwinged fairies queer perspective and dabs of blue paint she saw her performance not as it was but as it was meant to be heard her own lines without their awkward rhymes and bits like prose and thought of the wonder and admiration of all the wardour family and of the charms of having it secretly lent about as a dear simple sweet effusion of the talented young countess who longed for rural retirement  and down came a great tear into the red trimming of british north america and kate unadvisedly trying to wipe it up with her handkerchief made a red smear all across to cape verd  formerly she would have exclaimed at once now she only held up the other side of the book that her aunt might not see and felt very shabby all the time  but lady barbara was reading over a letter and did not look  if kate had not been wrapt up in herself she would have seen that anxious distressed face  there came a knock to the schoolroom door  it was mr mercer the doctor who always came to see lady jane twice a week and startled and alarmed lady barbara sprang up  do you want me mr mercer ill come  no thank you said the doctor coming in  it was only that i promised i would look at this little lady just to satisfy lady jane who does not think her quite well  kates love of being important always made her ready to be looked at by mr mercer who was a kind fatherly old gentleman not greatly apt to give physic very goodnatured and from his long attendance more intimate with the two sisters than perhaps any other person was lady barbara gave an odd sort of smile and said oh very well and the old gentleman laughed as the two bright clear eyes met his and said no great weight there i think  only a geography fever eh  any more giddy heads lately eh  or only when you make cheeses  i cant make cheeses now my frocks are so short said kate whose spirits always recovered with the least change  no more dreams  not since i went to bournemouth  your tongue  and as kate who had a certain queer pleasure in the operation put out the long pinky member with its ruddier tip quivering like an animal he laughed again and said thank you lady caergwent it is a satisfaction once in a way to see something perfectly healthy  you would not particularly wish for a spoonful of codliver oil would you  kate laughed made a face and shook her head  well said the doctor as he released her i may set lady janes mind at rest  nothing the matter there with the health  nothing the matter but perverseness i am afraid said lady barbara as kate stole back to her place and shut her face in with the board of her atlas  it is my sister who is the victim and i cannot have it go on  she is so dreadfully distressed whenever the child is in disgrace that it is doing her serious injury  do you not see it mr mercer  she is very fond of the child said mr mercer  that is the very thing  she is constantly worrying herself about her takes all her naughtiness for illness and then cannot bear to see her reproved  i assure you i am forced for my sisters sake to overlook many things which i know i ought not to pass by  kate shuddered  but the very anxiety about her is doing great harm  i thought lady jane nervous and excited this morning said mr mercer  but that seemed to me to be chiefly about the colonels return  yes said lady barbara of course in some ways it will be a great pleasure but it is very unlucky after staying till the war was over that he has had to sell out without getting his promotion  it will make a great difference  on account of his sons health is it not  yes of course everything must give way to that but it is most unfortunate  the boy has never recovered from his wound at lucknow and they could not bear to part or they ought to have sent him home with his mother long ago and now my brother has remained at his post till he thought he could be spared but he has not got his promotion which he must have had in a few months  when do you expect him  they were to set off in a fortnight from the time he wrote but it all depended on how giles might be  i wish we knew i wish there could be any certainty this is so bad for my sister  and just at this very time without a governess when some children would be especially thoughtful and considerate that we should have this strange fit of idleness and perverseness  it is very trying i feel quite hopeless sometimes  some children as lady barbara said would have been rendered thoughtful and considerate by hearing such a conversation as this and have tried to make themselves as little troublesome to their elders as possible but there are others who unless they are directly addressed only take in in a strange dreamy way that which belongs to the grownup world though quick enough to catch what concerns themselves  thus kate though aware that aunt barbara thought her naughtiness made aunt jane ill and that there was a fresh threat of the lord chancellor upon the return of her great uncle from india did not in the least perceive that her aunt barbara was greatly perplexed and harassed divided between her care for her sister and for her niece grieved for her brothers anxiety and disappointed that he had been obliged to leave the army instead of being made a general  the upshot of all that she carried away with her was that it was very cross of aunt barbara to think she made aunt jane ill and very very hard that she could not go to the bazaar  lady jane did not go out that afternoon and lady barbara set her niece and josephine down in the park saying that she was going into belgravia and desiring them to meet her near apsley house  they began to walk and kate began to lament  if she could only have gone to the bazaar for her album  it was very hard  eh josephine said why should they not go  there was plenty of time  miladi barbe had given them till four  she would take la petite  kate hung back  she knew it was wrong  she should never dare produce the book if she had it  but josephine did not attend to the faltered english words or disposed of them with a bah  miladi will guess nothing and she had turned decidedly out of the park and was making a sign to a cab kate was greatly frightened but was more afraid of checking josephine in the open street and making her dismiss the cab than of getting into it  besides there was a very strong desire in her for the red and gold square book that had imprinted itself on her imagination  she could not but be glad to do something in spite of aunt barbara  so they were shut in and went off along piccadilly kates feelings in a strange whirl of fright and triumph amid the clattering of the glasses  just suppose she saw anyone she knew  but they got to soho square at last and through the glass door in among the stallsthat fairy land in general to kate but now she was too much frightened and bewildered to do more than hurry along the passages staring so wildly for her albums that josephine touched her and said tenez miladi they will think you farouche  ah see the beautiful wreaths  come on josephine said kate impatiently  but it was not so easy to get the french maid on  a bazaar was felicity to her and she had her little lady in her power she stood and gazed admired and criticised at every stall that afforded ornamental wearing apparel or work patterns and kate making little excursions and coming back again to her side could not get her on three yards in a quarter of an hour and was too shy and afraid of being lost to wander away and transact her own business  at last they did come to a counter with ornamental stationery and after looking at four or five books kate bought a purple embossed one not at all what she had had in her minds eye just because she was in too great a fright to look further and then step by step very nearly crying at last so as to alarm josephine lest she should really cry she got her out at last  it was a quarter to four and josephine was in vain sure that miladi barbe would never be at the place in time kates heart was sick with fright at the thought of the shame of detection  she begged to get out at the marble arch and not risk driving along park lane but josephine was triumphant in her certainty that there was time and on they went kate fancying every bay nose that passed the window would turn out to have the brougham the manservant and aunt barbara behind it  at length they were set down at what the frenchwoman thought a safe distance and paying the cabman set out along the side path josephine admonishing her lady that it was best not to walk so swiftly or to look guilty or they would be trahies  but just then kate really saw the carriage drawn up where there was an opening in the railings and the servant holding open the door for them  had they been seen  there was no knowing  lady barbara did not say one single word but that need not have been surprisingonly how very straight her back was how fixed her marble mouth and chin it was more like dianas head than everdiana when she was shooting all niobes daughters thought kate in her dreamy vague alarm then she looked at josephine on the back seat to see what she thought of it but the brown sallow face in the little bonnet was quite still and like itselfbeyond kates power to read  the stillness doubt and suspense were almost unbearable  she longed to speak but had no courage and could almost have screamed with desire to have it over end as it would  yet at last when the carriage did turn into bruton street fright and shame had so entirely the upper hand that she read the numbers on every door wishing the carriage would only stand still at each or go slower that she might put off the moment of knowing whether she was found out  they stopped the few seconds of ringing of opening the doors of getting out were over  she knew how it would be when instead of going upstairs her aunt opened the schoolroom door beckoned her in and said gravely lady caergwent while you are under my charge it is my duty to make you obey me  tell me where you have been  there was something in the sternness of that low ladylike voice and of that dark deep eye that terrified kate more than the brightest flash of lightning  and it was well for her that the habit of truth was too much fixed for falsehood or shuffling even to occur to her she did not dare to do more than utter in a faint voice scarcely audible to the bazaar  in direct defiance of my commands  but the sound of her own confession the relief of having told gave kate spirit to speak i know it was naughty she said looking up i ought not  aunt barbara i have been very naughty  ive been often where you didnt know  tell me the whole truth katharine and lady barbaras look relaxed and the infinite relief of putting an end to a miserable concealment was felt by the little girl so she told of the shops she had been at and of her walks in frequented streets adding that indeed she would not have gone but that josephine took her  i did like it she added candidly but i know i ought not  yes katharine said lady barbara almost as sternly as ever i had thought that with all your faults you were to be trusted  i have told you the truth cried kate  now you may have but you have been deceiving me all this time you who ought to set an example of upright and honourable conduct  no no aunt exclaimed kate her eyes flashing  i never spoke one untrue word to you and i have not nownor ever  i never deceived  i do not say that you have told untruths  it is deceiving to betray the confidence placed in you  kate knew it was yet she had never so felt that her aunt trusted her as to have the sense of being on honour and she felt terribly wounded and grieved but not so touched as to make her cry or ask pardon  she knew she had been audaciously disobedient but it was hard to be accused of betraying trust when she had never felt that it was placed in her and yet the conviction of deceit took from her the last ground she had of peace with herself  drooping and angry she stood without a word and her aunt presently said i do not punish you  the consequences of your actions are punishment enough in themselves and i hope they may warn you or i cannot tell what is to become of you in your future life and of all that will depend on you  you must soon be under more strict and watchful care than mine and i hope the effect may be good meantime i desire that your aunt jane may be spared hearing of this affair little as you seem to care for her peace of mind  and away went lady barbara while kate flinging herself upon the sofa sobbed out i do care for aunt jane  i love aunt jane  i love her ten hundred times more than you you horrid cross old diana but i have deceived  oh i am getting to be a wicked little girl  i never did such things at home  nobody made me naughty there  but its the fashionable world  it is corrupting my simplicity  it always does  and i shall be lost  o mary mary  o papa papa  oh come and take me home  and for a little while kate gasped out these calls as if she had really thought they would break the spell and bring her back to oldburgh  she ceased crying at last and slowly crept upstairs glad to meet no one and that not even josephine was there to see her red eyes  her muslin frock was on the bed and she managed to dress herself and run down again unseen she stood over the fire so that the housemaid who brought in her tea should not see her face and by the time she had to go to the drawingroom the mottling of her face had abated under the influence of a storybook which always drove troubles away for the time  it was a very quiet evening  aunt barbara read bits out of the newspaper and there was a little talk over them  and kate read on in her book to hinder herself from feeling uncomfortable  now and then aunt jane said a few soft words about giles and emily but her sister always led away from the subject afraid of her exciting herself and getting anxious  and if kate had been observing she would have heard in the weary sound of aunt barbaras voice and seen in those heavy eyelids that the troubles of the day had brought on a severe headache and that there was at least one person suffering more than even the young ill used countess  and when bedtime came she learnt more of the consequences of her actions  stiff mrs bartley stood there with her candle  where is josephine  she is gone away my lady  kate asked no more but shivered and trembled all over  she recollected that in telling the truth she had justified herself and at josephines expense  she knew josephine would call it a blacknessa treason  what would become of the poor bright merry frenchwoman  should she never see her again  and all because she had not had the firmness to be obedient  oh loss of trust loss of confidence disobedience  how wicked this place made her and would there be any end to it  and all night she was haunted through her dreams with the lord chancellor in his wig trying to catch her and stuff her into the woolsack and uncle wardours voice always just out of reach  if she could only get to him    chapter xi    the young countess was not easily broken down  if she was ever so miserable for one hour she was ready to be amused the next and though when left to herself she felt very desolate in the present and much afraid of the future the least enlivenment brightened her up again into more than her usual spirits  even an entertaining bit in the history that she was reading would give her so much amusement that she would forget her disgrace in making remarks and asking questions till lady barbara gravely bade her not waste time and decided that she had no feeling  it was not more easy to find a maid than a governess to lady barbaras mind nor did she exert herself much in the matter for as kate heard her tell mr mercer she had decided that the present arrangement could not last and then something was asked about the colonel and mrs umfraville to which the answer was oh no quite impossible she could never be in a house with an invalid and then ensued something about the chancellor and an establishment which as usual terrified kates imagination  indeed that night terrors were at their height for mrs bartley never allowed dawdling and with a severely respectful silence made the undressing as brief an affair as possible brushing her hair till her head tingled all over putting away the clothes with the utmost speed and carrying off the candle as soon as she had uttered her grim goodnight my lady leaving kate to choose between her pet terrorseither of the lord chancellor or of the house on fireor a very fine new one that someone would make away with her to make way for her uncle giles and his son to come to her title  somehow lady barbara had contrived to make her exceedingly in awe of her uncle giles the strict stern soldier who was always implicitly obeyed and who would be so shocked at her  she wished she could hide somewhere when he was coming  but there was one real good bright pleasure near that would come before her misfortunes and that was the birthday to be spent at the wardours  as to the present josephine had had the album in her pocket and had never restored it and kate had begun to feel a distaste to the whole performance to recollect its faults and to be ashamed of the entire affair but that was no reason she should not be very happy with her friends who had promised to take her to the zoological gardens  she had not seen them since her return to london they were at westbourne road too far off for her to walk thither even if she had had anyone to go with her and though they had called no one had seen them but she had had two or three notes and had sent some story pictures by the post  and the thoughts of that day of freedom and enjoyment of talking to alice being petted by mrs wardour and caressed by sylvia seemed to bear her through all the dull morning walks in which she was not only attended by bartley but by the manservant all the lessons with her aunt and the still more dreary exercise which lady barbara took with her in some of the parks in the afternoon  she counted the days to the 21st whenever she woke in the morning and at last saturday was come and it would be monday  katharine said lady barbara at breakfast you had better finish your drawing today here is a note from madame to say it will suit her best to come on monday instead of tuesday  oh but aunt barbara i am going to westbourne road on monday  indeed  i was not aware of it  oh it is sylvias birthday and i am going to the zoological gardens with them  and pray how came you to make this engagement without consulting me  it was all settled at bournemouth  i thought you knew  did not mrs wardour ask your leave for me  mrs wardour said something about hoping to see you in london but i made no decided answer  i should not have allowed the intimacy there if i had expected that the family would be living in london and there is no reason that it should continue  constant intercourse would not be at all desirable  but may i not go on monday said kate her eyes opening wide with consternation  no certainly not  you have not deserved that i should trust you i do not know whom you might meet there  and i cannot have you going about with any chance person  o aunt barbara  aunt barbara  i have promised  your promise can be of no effect without my consent  but they will expect me  they will be so disappointed  i cannot help that  they ought to have applied to me for my consent  perhaps said kate hopefully mrs wardour will write today  if she does will you let me go  no katharine  while you are under my charge i am accountable for you and i will not send you into society i know nothing about  let me hear no more of this but write a note excusing yourself and we will let the coachman take it to the post  kate was thoroughly enraged and forgot even her fears  i shant excuse myself she said i shall say you will not let me go  you will write a proper and gentlewomanlike note said lady barbara quietly so as not to give needless offence  i shall say exclaimed kate more loudly that i cant go because you wont let me go near old friends  go into the schoolroom and write a proper note katharine i shall come presently and see what you have said repeated lady barbara commanding her own temper with some difficulty  kate flung away into the schoolroom muttering and in a tumult of exceeding disappointment anger and despair too furious even to cry and dashing about the room calling aunt barbara after every horrible heroine she could think of and pitying herself and her friends till the thought of sylvias disappointment stung her beyond all bearing  she was still rushing hither and thither inflaming her passion when her aunt opened the door  where is the note she said quietly  i have not done it  sit down then this instant and write said lady barbara with her diana face and cool way the most terrible of all  kate sulkily obeyed but as she seated herself muttered i shall say you wont let me go near them  write as i tell youmy dear mrs wardour  there  i fear you may be expecting to see me on monday  i dont fear i know she is  writei fear you may be expecting me on monday as something passed on the subject at bournemouth and in order to prevent inconvenience i write to say that it will not be in my power to call on that day as my aunt had made a previous engagement for me  i am sure i shant say that cried kate breaking out of all bounds in her indignation  recollect yourself lady caergwent said lady barbara calmly  it is not true cried kate passionately jumping up from her seat you had not made an engagement for me  i wont write it  i wont write lies and you shant make me  i do not allow such words or such a manner in speaking to me said lady barbara not in the least above her usual low voice and her calmness made kate the more furious and jump and dance round with passion repeating ill never write lies nor tell lies for you or anyone you may kill me but i wont  that is enough exposure of yourself lady caergwent said her aunt when you have come to your senses and choose to apologize for insulting me and show me the letter written as i desire you may come to me  and away walked lady barbara as cool and unmoved apparently as if she had been made of cast iron though within she was as sorry and hardly less angry than the poor frantic child she left  kate did not fly about now  she was very indignant but she was proud of herself too she had spoken as if she had been in a book and she believed herself persecuted for adhering to old friends and refusing to adopt fashionable falsehoods such as she had read of she was a heroine in her own eyes and that made her inclined to magnify all the persecution and cruelty  they wanted to shut her up from the friends of her childhood to force her to be false and fashionable they had made her naughtier and naughtier ever since she came there they were teaching her to tell falsehoods now and to give up the wardours  she would never never do it  helpless girl as she was she would be as brave as the knights and earls her ancestors and stand up for the truth  but what would they do at her  oh could she bear aunt barbaras dreadful set diana face again and not write as she was told  the poor weak little heart shrank with terror as she only looked at aunt barbaras chairnot much like the sir giles de umfraville she had thought of just now  and im naughty now i did betray my trust  im much naughtier than i was  oh if papa was but here and then a light darted into kates eye and a smile came on her lip why should not i go home  papa would have me again i know he would  he would die rather than leave his child kate to be made wicked and forced to tell lies  perhaps hell hide me  oh if i could go to school with the children at home in disguise and let uncle giles be earl of caergwent if he likes  ive had enough of grandeur  ill come as cardinal wolsey did when he said he was come to lay his bones among themand sylvia and mary and charlie and armynoh i must go where someone will be kind to me again  can i really though  why not and her heart beat violently  yes yes nothing would happen to me i know how to manage  if i can only get there they will hide me from aunt barbara and the lord chancellor and even if i had to go back i should have had one kiss of them all perhaps if i dont go now i shall never see them again  with thoughts something like these kate moving dreamily as if she were not sure that it was herself or not opened her little writing case took out her purse and counted the money  there was a sovereign and some silver more than enough as she well knew  then she took out of a chiffoniere her worked travelling bag and threw in a few favourite books then stood and gasped and opened the door to peep out  the coachman was waiting at the bottom of the stairs for orders so she drew in her head looked at her watch and considered whether her room would be clear of the housemaids  if she could once get safely out of the house she would not be missed till her dinner time and perhaps then might be supposed sullen and left alone  she was in a state of great fright starting violently at every sound but the scheme having once occurred to her it seemed as if st jamess parsonage was pulling her harder and harder every minute she wondered if there were really such things as heartstrings if there were hers must be fastened very tight round sylvia  at last she ventured out and flew up to her own room more swiftly than ever she had darted before  she moved about quietly and perceived by the sounds in the next room that mrs bartley was dressing aunt jane and aunt barbara reading a letter to her  this was surely a good moment but she knew she must dress herself neatly and not look scared if she did not mean to be suspected and stopped and she managed to get quietly into her little shaggy coat her black hat and feather and warm gloveseven her boots were rememberedand then whispering to herself it cant be wrong to get away from being made to tell stories  im going to papa she softly opened the door went on tiptoe past ladys janes door then after the first flight of stairs rushed like the wind unseen by anyone got the street door open pulled it by its outside handle and heard it shut  it was done now  she was on the wide worldin the street  she could not have got in again without knocking ringing and making her attempt known and she was far more terrified at the thought of lady barbaras stern face and horror at her proceedings than even at the long journey alone  every step was a little bit nearer sylvia mary and papait made her heart bound in the midst of its frightened throbsevery step was farther away from aunt barbara and she could hardly help setting off in a run  it was a foggy day when it was not so easy to see far but she longed to be out of bruton street where she might be known yet when beyond the quiet familiar houses the sense of being alone left to herself began to get very alarming and she could hardly control herself to walk like a rational person to the cabstand in davies street  nobody remarked her she was a tall girl for her age and in her sober dark dress with her little bag might be taken for a tradesmans daughter going to school even if anyone had been out who had time to look at her  trembling she saw a cabman make a sign to her and stood waiting for him jumped in as he opened his door and felt as if she had found a refuge for the time upon the dirty red plush cushions and the straw  to the waterloo station said she with as much indifference and selfpossession as she could manage the man touched his hat and rattled off  he perhaps wondering if this were a young runaway and if he should get anything by telling where she was gone she working herself into a terrible fright for fear he should be going to drive round and round london get her into some horrible den of iniquity and murder her for the sake of her money her watch and her clothes  did not cabmen always do such things  she had quite decided how she would call a policeman and either die like an umfraville or offer a ransom of untold gold and had gone through all possible catastrophes long before she found herself really safe at the railway station and the man letting her out and looking for his money  the knowledge that all depended on herself and that any signs of alarm would bring on inquiry made her able to speak and act so reasonably that she felt like one in a dream  with better fortune than she could have hoped for a train was going to start in a quarter of an hour and the station clerk was much too busy and too much hurried to remark how scared were her eyes and how trembling her voice as she asked at his pigeonhole for a firstclass ticket to oldburgh if you please offered the sovereign in payment swept up the change and crept out to the platform  a carriage had oldburgh marked on it she tried to open the door but could not reach the handle then fancied a stout porter who came up with his key must be some messenger of the lord chancellor come to catch her and was very much relieved when he only said where for miss and on her answer oldburgh opened the door for her and held her bag while she tripped up the steps  any luggage miss no thank you  he shot one inquiring glance after her but hastened away and she settled herself in the very farthest corner of the carriage and lived in an agony for the train to set off before her flight should be detected  once off she did not care she should be sure of at least seeing sylvia and telling her uncle her troubles  she had one great start when the door was opened and a gentleman peered in but it was merely to see if there was room for she heard him say only a child and in came a lady and two gentlemen who at least filled up the window so that nobody could see her while they talked a great deal to someone on the platform  and then after some bellringing whistling sailing backwards and forwards and stopping they were fairly offgetting away from the roofs of londonseeing the sky clear of smoke and foggetting nearer home every moment and countess kate relaxed her shy frightened drawnup attitude gave a long breath felt that the deed was done and began to dwell on the delight with which she should be greeted at home and think how to surprise them all  there was plenty of time for thinking and planning and dreaming some few possible things but a great many more most impossible ones perhaps the queerest notion of all was her plan for being disguised like a schoolchild all day and always noticed for her distinguished appearance by ladies who came to see the school or overheard talking french to sylvia and then in the midst of her exceeding anxiety not to be detected she could not help looking at her travelling companions and wondering if they guessed with what a grand personage they had the honour to be travelling  only a child indeed  what would they think if they knew  and the little goose held her pocket handkerchief in her hand feeling as if it would be like a story if they happened to wonder at the coronet embroidered in the corner and when she took out a storybook she would have liked that the fly leaf should just carelessly reveal the caergwent written upon it she did not know that selfishness had thrown out the branch of self consequence  however nothing came of it they had a great deal too much to say to each other to notice the little figure in the corner and she had time to read a good deal settle a great many fine speeches get into many a fright lest there should be an accident and finally grow very impatient alarmed and agitated before the last station but one was passed and she began to know the cut of the hedgerowtrees and the shape of the hillsto feel as if the cattle and sheep in the fields were old friends and to feel herself at home  oldburgh station  they were stopping at last and she was on her feet pressing to the window between the strangers  one of the gentlemen kindly made signs to the porter to let her out and asked if she had any baggage or anyone to meet her  she thanked him by a smile and shake of the head she could not speak for the beating of her heart she felt almost as much upon the world as when the door in bruton street had shut behind her and besides a terrible wild fancy had seized hersuppose just suppose they were all gone away or ill or someone dead  perhaps she felt it would serve her right and that was the reason she was in such terror    chapter xii    when kate had left the train she was still two miles from st jamess and it was halfpast three oclock so that she began to feel that she had run away without her dinner and that the beatings of her heart made her knees ache so that she had no strength to walk  she thought her best measure would be to make her way to a pastry cooks shop that looked straight down the street to the grammar school and where it was rather a habit of the family to meet charlie when they had gone into the town on business and wanted to walk out with him  he would be out at four oclock and there would not be long to wait  so feeling shy and even more guilty and frightened than on her first start kate threaded the streets she knew so well and almost gasping with nervous alarm popped up the steps into the shop and began instantly eating a bun and gazing along the street she really could not speak till she had swallowed a few mouthfuls and then she looked up to the woman and took courage to ask if the boys were out of school yet  oh no miss not for a quarter of an hour yet  do you know ifif master charles wardour is there today added kate with a gulp  i dont miss  and the woman looked hard at her  do you know if any of themany of them from st jamess are in to day  no miss i have not seen any of them but very likely they may be i saw mr wardour go by yesterday morning  so far they were all well then and kate made her mind easier and went on eating like a hungry child till the great clock struck four when she hastily paid for her cakes and tarts put on her gloves and stood on the step half in and half out of the shop staring down the street  out came the boys in a rush making straight for the shop and brushing past kate she half alarmed half affronted descended from her post still looking intently  half a dozen more big fellows eagerly talking almost tumbled over her and looked as if she had no business there she seemed to be quite swept off the pavement into the street and to be helpless in the midst of a mob dashing around her  they might begin to tease her in a minute and more terrified than at any moment of her journey she was almost ready to cry when the tones of a wellknown voice came on her ear close to heri say will you come and see my new terrier and before the words were uttered with a cry of charlie charlie she was clinging to a stout boy who had been passing without looking at her  let go i say  who are you was the first rough greeting  o charlie charlie almost sobbing and still grasping his arm tight  oh i say and he stood with open mouth staring at her  o charlie take me home  yes yes come alongget off with you fellows he addedturning round upon the other boys who were beginning to stareand exclaimed its nothing but our kate  oh what a thrill there was in hearing those words and the boys who were wellbehaved and gentlemanly were not inclined to molest her so she hurried on holding charless arm for several steps till they were out of the hubbub when he turned again and stared and again exclaimed i say all that he could at present utter and kate looked at his ruddy face and curly head and dusty coat and inky collar as if she would eat him for very joy  i say and this time he really did say where are the rest of them  at home arent they  what didnt they bring you in  oh no  come dont make a tomfoolery of it thats enough  i shall have all the fellows at me for your coming up in that way you know  why couldnt you shake hands like anyone else  o charlie i couldnt help it  please let us go home  do you mean that you arent come from there  no said kate half ashamed but far more exultant and hanging down her head i came from londoni came by myself  my aunt wanted me to tell a story andand i have run away  o charlie take me home and with a fresh access of alarm she again threw her arms round him as if to gain his protection from some enemy  oh i say again he cried looking up the empty street and down again partly for the enemy partly to avoid eyes but he only beheld three dirty children and an old woman so he did not throw her off roughly  ran away and he gave a great whistle  yes yes  my aunt shut me up because i would not tell a story said kate really believing it herself  oh let us get home charlie do  very well if you wont throttle a man and let me get tony in here he added going on a little way towards a small inn stable yard  oh dont go cried kate who once more protected could not bear to be left alone a moment but charlie plunged into the yard and came back not only with the pony but with a plaid and presently managed to mount kate upon the saddle throwing the plaid round her so as to hide the short garments and long scarlet stockings that were not adapted for riding all with a boys rough and tender care for the propriety of his sisters appearance  there that will do said he holding the bridle  so you found it poor fun being my lady and all that  oh it was awful charlie  you little know in your peaceful retirement what are the miseries of the great  come kate dont talk bosh out of your books  what did they do to you  they didnt lick you did they  no no nonsense said kate rather affronted but they wanted to make me forget all that i cared for and they really did shut me up because i said i would not write a falsehood to please them  they did charlie and her eyes shone  well i always knew they must be a couple of horrid old owls began charlie  oh  i didnt mean aunt jane said kate feeling a little compunction  ah with a start and scream who is coming as she heard steps behind them  you little donkey youll be off  who should it be but armyn  for armyn generally overtook his brother on a saturday and walked home with him for the sunday  charles hailed him with a loud hollo armyn  what dye think ive got here  kate  why how dye do  why they never told me you were coming to see us  they didnt know whispered kate  shes run away like a jolly brick said charlie patting the pony vehemently as he made this most inappropriate comparison  run away  you dont mean it cried armyn standing still and aghast so much shocked that her elevation turned into shame and charles answered for her   yes to be sure she did when they locked her up because she wouldnt tell lies to please them  how did you get out kittens what jolly good fun it must have been  is this so kate said armyn laying his hand on the bridle and his displeasure roused her spirit of selfdefence and likewise a sense of illusage  to be sure it is she said raising her head indignantly  i would not be made to tell fashionable falsehoods and soand so i came home for papa to protect me and if she had not had to take care to steady herself on her saddle she would have burst out sobbing with vexation at armyns manner  and no one knew you were coming said he  no of course not i slipped out while they were all in confabulation in aunt janes room and they were sure not to find me gone till dinner time and if they are very cross not then  you go on charlie said armyn restoring the bridle to his brother ill overtake you by the time you get home  what are you going to do cried boy and girl with one voice  well i suppose it is fair to tell you said armyn  i must go and telegraph what is become of you  there was a howl and a shriek at this  they would come after her and take her away when she only wanted to be hid and kept safe it was a cruel shame and charles was ready to fly at his brother and pommel him indeed armyn had to hold him by one shoulder and say in the voice that meant that he would be minded steady boy iim very sorry my little katie its a melancholy matter but you must have left those poor old ladies in a dreadful state of alarm about you and they ought not to be kept in it  oh but armyn armyn do only get home and see what papa says  i am certain what he will say and it would only be the trouble of sending someone in and keeping the poor women in a fright all the longer  besides depend on it the way to have them sending down after you would be to say nothing  now if they hear you are safe you are pretty secure of spending tomorrow at least with us  let me go kate it must be done  i cannot help it  even while he spoke the kind way of crossing her will was so like home that it gave a sort of happiness and she felt she could not resist so she gave a sigh and he turned back  how much of the joy and hope of her journey had he not carried away with him  his manner of treating her exploit made her even doubt how his father might receive it and yet the sight of old scenes and the presence of charlie was such exceeding delight that it seemed to kill off all unpleasant fears or anticipations and all the way home it was one happy chatter of inquiries for everyone of bits of home news and exclamations at the sight of some wellknown tree or the outline of a house remembered for some adventure the darker the twilight the happier her tongue  the dull suburb all little pert square redbrick houses with slated roofs and fine names in the sloppiness of a grey november day was dear to kate every little shop window with the light streaming out was like a friend and she anxiously gazed into the rough parties out for their saturday purchases intending to nod to anyone she might know but it was too dark for recognitions and when at length they passed the dark outline of the church she was silent her heart again bouncing as if it would beat away her breath and senses  the windows were dark it was a sign that evening service was just over  the children turned in at the gate just as armyn overtook them  he lifted kate off her pony  she could not have stood but she could run and she flew to the drawingroom  no one was there perhaps she was glad  she knew the cousins would be dressing for tea and in another moment she had torn open sylvias door  sylvia who was brushing her hair turned round  she staredas if she had seen a ghost  then the two children held out their arms and rushed together with a wild scream that echoed through the house and brought mary flying out of her room to see who was hurt and to find rolling on her sisters bed a thing that seemed to have two bodies and two faces glued together four legs and all its arms and hands wound round and round  sylvia  what is it  who is it  what is she doing to you began mary but before the words were out of her mouth the thing had flown at her neck and pulled her down too and the grasp and the clinging and the kisses told her long before she had room or eyes or voice to know the creature by  a sort of sobbing out of each name between them was all that was heard at first  at last just as mary was beginning to say my own own katie how did you come  mr wardours voice on the stairs called mary  have you seen him my dear  no but kate was afraid now she had heard his voice for it was grave  mary  and mary went  kate sat up holding sylvias hand  they heard him ask is kate there  yes  and then there were lower voices that kate could not hear and which therefore alarmed her and sylvia puzzled and frightened sat holding her hand listening silently  presently mr wardour came in and his look was graver than his tone but it was so pitying that in a moment kate flew to his breast and as he held her in his arms she cried o papa  papa  i have found you again you will not turn me away  i must do whatever may be right my dear child said mr wardour holding her close so that she felt his deep love though it was not an undoubting welcome  i will hear all about it when you have rested and then i may know what is best to be done  oh keep me keep me papa  you will be here tomorrow at least he said disengaging himself from her  this is a terrible proceeding of yours kate but it is no time for talking of it and as your aunts know where you are nothing more can be done at present so we will wait to understand it till you are rested and composed  he went away and kate remained sobered and confused and mary stood looking at her sad and perplexed  o kate  kate she said what have you been doing  what is the matter  are not you glad cried sylvia and the squeeze of her hand restored kates spirits so much that she broke forth with her story told in her own way of persecution and escape as she had wrought herself up to believe in it and sylvia clung to her with flushed cheeks and ardent eyes resenting every injury that her darling detailed triumphing in her resistance and undoubting that here she would be received and sheltered from all while mary distressed and grieved and cautioned by her father to take care not to show sympathy that might be mischievous was carried along in spite of herself to admire and pity her child and burn with indignation at such illtreatment almost in despair at the idea that the child must be sent back again yet still not discarding that trust common to all mr wardours children that papa would do anything to hinder a temptation  and so with eager words and tender hands kate was made ready for the evening meal and went down clinging on one side to mary on the other to sylviaa matter of no small difficulty on the narrow staircase and almost leading to a general avalanche of young ladies all upon the head of little lily who was running up to greet and be greeted and was almost devoured by kate when at length they did get safe downstairs  it was a somewhat quiet grave meal mr wardour looked so sad and serious that all felt that it would not do to indulge in joyous chatter and the little girls especially were awed though through all there was a tender kindness in his voice and look whenever he did but offer a slice of bread to his little guest such as made her feel what was home and what was lovelike a shower of rain after a parched desert as she said to herself and she squeezed sylvias hand under the table whenever she could  mr wardour spoke to her very little  he said he had seen colonel umfravilles name in the gazette and asked about his coming home and when she had answered that the time and speed of the journey were to depend on giless health he turned from her to armyn and began talking to him about some public matters that seemed very dull to kate and one little foolish voice within her said he is not like mrs george wardour he forgets what i am but there was a wiser more loving voice to answer dear papa he thinks of me as myself he is no respecter of persons  oh i hope he is not angry with me  when tea was over mr wardour stood up and said i shall wish you children goodnight now i have to read with john bailey for his confirmation and to prepare for tomorrowand you kate must go to bed earlymary she had better sleep with you  this was rather a blank for sleeping with sylvia again had been kates dream of felicity yet this was almost lost in the sweetness of once more coming in turn for the precious kiss and goodnight in the midst of which she faltered o papa dont be angry with me  i am not angry katie he said gently i am very sorry  you have done a thing that nothing can justify and that may do you much future harm and i cannot receive you as if you had come properly  i do not know what excuse there was for you and i cannot attend to you tonight indeed i do not think you could tell me rightly but another time we will talk it all over and i will try to help you now goodnight my dear child  those words of his i will try to help you were to kate like a promise of certain rescue from all her troubles and elastic ball that her nature was no sooner was his anxious face out of sight and she secure that he was not angry than up bounded her spirits again she began wondering why papa thought she could not tell him properly and forthwith began to give what she intended for a full and particular history of all that she had gone through  it was a happy party round the fire kate and sylvia both together in the large armchair and lily upon one of its arms charles in various odd attitudes before the fire armyn at the table with his book half reading half listening mary with her work and kate pouring out her story making herself her own heroine and describing her adventures her way of life and all her varieties of miseries in the most glowing colours  how she did rattle on  it would be a great deal too much to tell indeed it would be longer than this whole story  sylvia and charlie took it all in pitied wondered and were indignant with all their hearts indeed charlie was once heard to wish he could only get that horrid old witch near the horsepond and when kate talked of her diana face he declared that he should get the old brute of a cat into the field and set all the boys to stone her  little lily listened not sure whether it was not all what she called a madeup story only for prettiness and mary sitting over her work was puzzled and saw that her father was right in saying that kate could not at present give an accurate account of herself  mary knew her truthfulness and that she would not have said what she knew to be invention but those black eyes glowing like little hot coals and those burning cheeks as well as the loud squeaky key of the voice all showed that she had worked herself up into a state of excitement such as not to know what was invented by an exaggerating memory  besides it could not be all true it did not agree the illtreatment was not consistent with the grandeur  for kate had taken to talking very big as if she was an immensely important personage receiving much respect wherever she went and though armyn once or twice tried putting in a sober matteroffact question for the fun of disconcerting her she was too mad to care or understand what he said  oh no she never was allowed to do anything for herself  that was quite a rule and very tiresome it was  like the king of spain you cant move your chair away from the fire without the proper attendant  i never do put on coals or wood there  there may be several reasons for that said armyn recollecting how nearly kate had once burnt the house down  oh i assure you it would not do for me said kate  if it were not so inconvenient in that little house i should have my own man servant to attend to my fire and walk out behind me  indeed now perkins always does walk behind me and it is such a bore  and what was the consequence of all this wild chatter  when mary had seen the hotfaced eager child into bed she came down to her brother in the drawingroom with her eyes brimful of tears saying poor dear child  i am afraid she is very much spoilt  dont make up your mind tonight said armyn  she is slightly insane as yet  never mind mary her heart is in the right place if her head is turned a little  it is very much turned indeed said mary  how wise it was of papa not to let sylvia sleep with her  what will he do with her  oh dear    chapter xiii    the sunday at oldburgh was not spent as kate would have had it  it dawned upon her in the midst of horrid dreams ending by wakening to an overpowering sick headache the consequence of the agitations and alarms of the previous day and the long fast appeased by the contents of the pastrycooks shop with the journey and the excitement of the meetingaltogether quite sufficient to produce such a miserable feeling of indisposition that if kate could have thought at all of anything but present wretchedness she would have feared that she was really carrying out the likeness to cardinal wolsey by laying her bones among them  that it was not quite so bad as that might be inferred from her having no doctor but mary wardour who attended to her most assiduously from her first moans at four oclock in the morning till her dropping off to sleep about noon when the valiant mary in the absence of everyone at church took upon herself to pen a note to catch the early sunday post on her own responsibility to lady barbara umfraville to say that her little cousin was so unwell that it would be impossible to carry out the promise of bringing her home on monday which mr wardour had written on saturday night  sleep considerably repaired her little ladyship and when she had awakened and supped up a bason of beeftea toast and all with considerable appetite she was so much herself again that there was no reason that anyone should be kept at home to attend to her marys absence was extremely inconvenient as she was organist and leader of the choir  so katie dear she said when she saw her patient on her legs again making friends with the last new kitten of the old cat you will not mind being left alone will you  it is only for the litany and catechising you know  kate looked blank and longed to ask that sylvia might stay with her but did not venture knowing that she was not ill enough for it to be a necessity and that no one in that house was ever kept from church except for some real and sufficient cause  but the silly thoughts that passed through the little head in the hour of solitude would fill two or three volumes  in the first place she was affronted  they made very little of her considering who she was and how she had come to see them at all risks and how ill she had been  they would hardly have treated a little village child so negligently as their visitor the countess   then her heart smote her  she remembered marys tender and assiduous nursing all the morning and how she had already stayed from service and sunday school and she recollected her honour for her friends for not valuing her for her rank and in that mood she looked out the psalms and lessons which she had not been able to read in the morning and when she had finished them began to examine the book case in search of a new or else a very dear old sunday book  but then something went crackor else it was kates fancyfor she started as if it had been a cannonball and though she sat with her book in her lap by the fire in marys room all the dear old furniture and pictures round her her head was weaving an unheardof imagination about robbers coming in rifling everythingcoming up the stairscreak creak was that their stepshe held her breath and her eyes dilatedseizing her for the sake of her watch  what article there would be in the papermelancholy disappearance of the youthful countess of caergwent  then aunt barbara would be sorry she had treated her so cruelly then mary would know she ought not to have abandoned the child who had thrown herself on her protection  that was the way lady caergwent spent her hour  she had been kidnapped and murdered a good many times before there was a buzz in the street her senses came back and she sprang out on the stairs to meet her cousins calling herself quite well again  and then they had a very peaceful pleasant time she was one of them again when as of old mr wardour came into the drawingroom and she stood up with charles sylvia and little lily who was now old enough for the catechism and then the collect and a hymn  yes she had collect and hymn ready too and some of the gospel aunt barbara always heard her say them on sunday besides some very difficult questions not at all like what mr wardour asked out of his own head  kate was a little afraid he would make his teaching turn on submitting to rulers it was an epistle that would have given him a good opportunity for it was the fourth epiphany sunday brought in at the end of the sundays after trinity  if he made his teaching personal something within her wondered if she could bear it and was ready to turn angry and defiant  but no such thing what he talked to them about was the gentle presence that hushed the waves and winds in outward nature and calmed the wild spiritual torments of the possessed and how all fears and terrors all foolish fancies and passionate tempers will be softened into peace when the thought of him rises in the heart  kate wondered if she should be able to think of that next time she was going to work herself into an agony  but at present all was like a precious dream to be enjoyed as slowly as the moments could be persuaded to pass  out came the dear old dutch bible history with pictures of everythingpictures that they had looked at every sunday since they could walk and could have described with their eyes shut and now kate was to feast her eyes once again upon them and hear how many little lily knew and a pretty sight it was that tiny child with her fat hands clasped behind her so as not to be tempted to put a finger on the print going so happily and thoroughly through all the creatures that came to adam to be named and showing the whole procession into the ark and her favourite of all the angels coming down to jacob  then came tea and then kate was pronounced to her great delight well enough for evening service  the evening service she always thought a treat with the lighted church and the choicest singing the only singing that had ever taken hold of kates tuneless ear and that seemed to come home to her  at least tonight it came home as it had never done before it seemed to touch some tender spot in her heart and when she thought how dear it was and how little she had cared about it and how glad she had been to go away she found the candles dancing in a green mist and great drops came down upon the prayerbook in her hand  then it could not be true that she had no feeling  she was crying the first time she had ever known herself cry except for pain or at reproof and she was really so far pleased that she made no attempt to stop the great tears that came trickling down at each familiar note at each thought how long it had been since she had heard them she cried all church time for whenever she tried to attend to the prayers the very sound of the voice she loved so well set her off again and sylvia tenderly laying a hand on her by way of sympathy made her weep the more though still so softly and gently that it was like a strange sort of happinessalmost better than joy and merriment  and then the sermonupon the text peace be still was on the same thought on which her uncle had talked to the children  not that she followed it much the very words peace and be still seemed to be enough to touch soften and dissolve her into those sweet comfortable tears  perhaps they partly came from the weakening of the mornings indisposition at any rate when she moved after the blessing holding the pitying sylvias hand she found that she was very much tired her eyelids were swollen and aching and in fact she was fit for nothing but bed where mary and sylvia laid her and she slept and slept in dreamless soundness till she was waked by marys getting up in the morning and found herself perfectly well  and now sylvia she said as they went downstairs handinhand let us put it all out of our heads and try and think all day that it is just one of our old times and that i am your old kate  let me do my lessons and go into school and have some fun and quite forget all that is horrid  but there was something to come before this happy return to old times  as soon as breakfast was over mr wardour said now kate i want you  and then she knew what was coming and somehow she did not feel exactly the same about her exploit and its causes by broad daylight now that she was cool  perhaps she would have been glad to hang back yet on the whole she had a great deal to say to papa and it was a relief though rather terrific to find herself alone with him in the study  now kate said he again with his arm round her as she stood by him will you tell me what led you to this very sad and strange proceeding  kate hung her head and ran her fingers along the mouldings of his chair  why was it my dear asked mr wardour  it was and she grew bolder at the sound of her own voice and more confident in the goodness of her causeit was because aunt barbara said i must write what was not true andand ill never tell a falsehoodnever for no one and her eyes flashed  gently kate he said laying his hand upon hers i dont want to know what you never will do only what you have done  what was this falsehood  why papa the other sylviasylvia joanna you knowhas her birthday today and we settled at bournemouth that i should spend the day with her and on saturday when aunt barbara heard of it she said she did not want me to be intimate there and that i must not go and told me to write a note to say she had made a previous engagement for me  and do you know that she had not done so  o papa she could not for when i said i would not write a lie she never said it was true  was that what you said to your aunt  yesand kate hung her headi was in a passion  then kate i do not wonder that lady barbara insisted on obedience instead of condescending to argue with a child who could be so insolent  but papa said kate abashed for a moment then getting eager she does tell fashionable falsehoods she says she is not at home when she is and  stay kate it is not for you to judge of grown peoples doings neither i nor mary would like to use that form of denying ourselves but it is usually understood to mean only not ready to receive visitors  in the same way this previous engagement was evidently meant to make the refusal less discourteous and you were not even certain it did not exist  my italian mistress did want to come on monday faltered kate but it was not previous  then kate who was it that went beside the mark in letting us believe that lady barbara locked you up to make you tell falsehoods  indeed papa i did not say lockedcharlie and sylvia said that  but did you correct them  o papa i did not mean it  but i am naughty now  i always am naughty so much worse than i used to be at home  indeed i am and i never do get into a good vein now  o papa papa cant you get me out of it all  if you could only take me home again  i dont think my aunts want to keep methey say i am so bad and horrid and that i make aunt jane ill  oh take me back papa  he did take her on his knee and held her close to him  i wish i could my dear he said i should like to have you again but it cannot be  it is a different state of life that has been appointed for you and you would not be allowed to make your home with me with no older a person than mary to manage for you  if your aunt had not been taken from us then and kate ventured to put her arm round his neckthen this would have been your natural home but as things are with us i could not make my house such as would suit the requirements of those who arrange for you  and my poor child i fear we let the very faults spring up that are your sorrow now  oh no no papa you helped me  aunt barbara only makes meoh may i sayhate her for indeed there is no helping it  i cant be good there  what is it  what do you mean my dear  what is your difficulty and i will try to help you  poor kate found it not at all easy to explain when she came to particulars  always cross was the clearest idea in her mind never pleased with her never liking anything she didnot punishing but much worse  she had not made out her case she knew but she could only murmur again it all went wrong and i was very unhappy  mr wardour sighed from the bottom of his heart he was very sorrowful too for the child that was as his own  and then he went back and thought of his early college friend and of his own wife who had so fondled the little orphanall that was left of her sister it was grievous to him to put that child away from him when she came clinging to him and saying she was unhappy and led into faults  it will be better when your uncle comes home he began  oh no papa indeed it will not  uncle giles is more stern than aunt barbara  aunt jane says it used to make her quite unhappy to see how sharp he was with poor giles and frank  i never saw him in his own family said mr wardour thoughtfully but this i know kate that your father looked up to him young as he then was more than to anyone that he was the only person among them all who ever concerned himself about you or your mother and that on the two occasions when i saw him i thought him very like your father  i had rather he was like you papa sighed kate  oh if i was but your child she added led on by a little involuntary pressure of his encircling arm  dont let us talk of what is not but of what is said mr wardour let us try to look on things in their right light  it has been the will of heaven to call you my little girl to a station where you will if you live have many peoples welfare depending on you and your example will be of weight with many  you must go through training for it and strict training may be the best for you indeed it must be the best or it would not have been permitted to befall you  but it does not make me good it makes me naughty  no kate nothing nobody can make you naughty nothing is strong enough to do that  kate knew what he meant and hung her head  my dear i do believe that you feel forlorn and dreary and miss the affection you have had among us but have you ever thought of the friend who is closest of all to us and who is especially kind to a fatherless child  i canti cant feel itpapa i cant  and then why was it made so that i must go away from you and all  you will see some day though you cannot see now my dear  if you use it rightly you will feel the benefit  meantime you must take it on trust just as you do my love for you though i am going to carry you back  yes but i can feel you loving me  my dear child it only depends on yourself to feel your heavenly father loving you  if you will set yourself to pray with your heart and think of his goodness to you and ask him for help and solace in all your present vexatious and difficulties never mind how small you will become conscious of his tender pity and love to you  ah but i am not good  but he can make you so kate  your have been wearied by religious teaching hitherto have you not  except when it was pretty and like poetry whispered kate  put your heart to your prayers now kate  look in the psalms for verses to suit your loneliness recollect that you meet us in spirit when you use the same prayers read the same lessons and think of each other  or better still carry your troubles to him and when you have felt his help you will know what that is far better than i can tell you  kate only answered with a long breath not feeling as if she could understand such comfort but with a resolve to try  and now said mr wardour i must take you home tomorrow and i will speak for you to lady barbara and try to obtain her forgiveness but kate i do not think you quite understand what a shocking proceeding this was of yours  i know it was wrong to fancy that and say that about aunt barbara ill tell her so said kate with a trembling voice  yes that will be right but it was thisthis expedition that i meant  it was coming to you papa  yes kate but did you think what an outrageous act it was  there is something particularly grievous in a little girl or a woman of any age casting off restraint and setting out in the world unprotected and contrary to authority  do you know it frightened me so much that till i saw more of you i did not like you to be left alone with sylvia  the deep red colour flushed all over kates face and neck in her angry shame and confusion burning darker and more crimson so that mr wardour was very sorry for her and added i am obliged to say this because you ought to know that it is both very wrong in itself and will be regarded by other people as more terrible than what you are repenting of more  so if you do find yourself distrusted and in disgrace you must not think it unjust and cruel but try to submit patiently and learn not to be reckless and imprudent  my poor child i wish you could have so come to us that we might have been happier together  perhaps you will some day and in the meantime if you have any troubles or want to know anything you may always write to me  writing is not speaking said kate ruefully  no but it comes nearer to it as people get older  now go my dear i am busy and you had better make the most of your time with your cousins  kates heart was unburthened now and though there was much alarm pain and grief in anticipation yet she felt more comfortable in herself than she had done for months  papa had never been so tender with her and she knew that he had forgiven her  she stept back to the drawingroom very gentle and subdued and tried to carry out her plans of living one of her old days by beginning with sharing the lessons as usual and then going out with her cousins to visit the school and see some of the parishioners  it was very nice and pleasant she was as quiet and loving as possible and threw herself into all the dear old home matters  it was as if for a little while katharine was driven out of katharine and a very sweet little maiden left insteadthinking about other things and people instead of herself and full of affection and warmth  the improvement that the half years discipline had made in her bearing and manners was visible now her uncouth abrupt ways were softened though still she felt that the naturally gentle and graceful sylvia would have made a better countess than she did  they spent the evening in little tastes of all their favourite drawingroom games just for the sake of having tried them once more and papa himself came in and took a sharea very rare treatand he always thought of such admirable things in twenty questions and made whats my thought like  more full of fun than anyone  it was a very happy eveningone of the most happy that kate had ever passed  she knew how to enjoy her friends now and how precious they were to her and she was just so much tamed by the mornings conversation and by the dread of the future as not to be betrayed into dangerously high spirits  that loving pitying way of marys and her own sylvias exceeding pleasure in having her were delightful and all through she felt the difference between the real genuine love that she could rest on and the mere habit of fondling of the other sylvia  o sylvia she said as they walked upstairs hand in hand pausing on every stop to make it longer how could i be so glad to go away before  we didnt know said sylvia  no as they crept up another step sylvia will you always think of me just here on this step as you go up to bed  yes said sylvia that i will  and katie would it be wrong just to whisper a little prayer then that you might be good and happy  it couldnt be wrong sylvia only couldnt you just ask too for me to come home  i dont know said sylvia thoughtfully pausing a long time on the step  you see we know it is sure to be gods will that you should be good and happy but if it was not for you to come home we might be like balaam you know if we asked it too much and it might come about in some terrible way  i didnt think of that said kate  and the two little girls parted gravely and peacefully kate somehow feeling as if though grievous things were before her the good little kind sylvias hearty prayers must obtain some good for her  there is no use in telling how sad the parting was when mr wardour and the little countess set out for london again  mary had begged hard to go too thinking that she could plead for kate better than anyone else but mr wardour thought lady barbara more likely to be angered than softened by their clinging to their former charge and besides it was too great an expense  he had no doubt of lady barbaras displeasure from the tone of the note that morning received coldly thanking him and miss wardour for their intelligence and his promise to restore lady caergwent on tuesday  she was sorry to trouble him to bring the child back she would have come herself but that her sister was exceedingly unwell from the alarm coming at a time of great family affliction  if lady caergwent were not able to return on tuesday she would send down her own maid to bring her home on wednesday  the letter was civility itself but it was plain that lady barbara thought kates illness no better than the previous engagement in the note that never was written  what was the family affliction  kate could not guess but was inclined to imagine privately that aunt barbara was magnifying uncle giless return without being a general into a family affliction on purpose to aggravate her offence  however in the train mr wardour who had been looking at the supplement of the times lent to him by a fellowtraveller touched her and made her read   on the 11th at alexandria in his 23rd year lieutenant giles de la poer umfraville of the 109th regiment eldest and last survivor of the children of the honourable giles umfraville late lieutenant colonel of the 109th regiment  kate knew she ought to be very sorry and greatly pity the bereaved father and mother but somehow she could not help dwelling most upon the certainty that everyone would be much more hard upon her and cast up this trouble to her as if she had known of it and run away on purpose to make it worse  it must have been this that they were talking about in aunt janes room and this must have made them so slow to detect her flight  in due time the train arrived a cab was taken and kate beginning to tremble with fright sat by mr wardour and held his coat as if clinging to him as long as she could was a comfort  sometimes she wished the cab would go faster so that it might be over sometimes especially when the streets became only too well known to hershe wished that they would stretch out and out for ever that she might still be sitting by papa holding his coat  it seemed as if that would be happiness enough for life  here was bruton street here the door that on saturday had shut behind her  it was only too soon open and kate kept her eyes on the ground ashamed that even the butler should see her  she hung back waiting till mr wardour had paid the cabman but there was no spinning it out she had to walk upstairs her only comfort being that her hand was in his  no one was in the drawingroom but before long lady barbara came in kate durst not look up at her but was sure from the tone of her voice that she must have her very sternest face and there was something to make one shiver in the rustle of her silk dress as she curtsied to mr wardour  i have brought home my little niece he said drawing kate forward and i think i may truly say that she is very sorry for what has passed  there was a pause kate knew the terrible black eyes were upon her but she felt besides the longing to speak out the truth and a sense that with papa by her side she had courage to do so  i am sorry aunt barbara she said i was very selfwilled i ought not to have fancied things nor said you used me ill and wanted me to tell stories  kates heart was lighter though it beat so terribly as she said those words  she knew that they pleased one of the two who were present and she knew they were right  it is well you should be so far sensible of your misconduct said lady barbara but her voice was as dry and hard as ever and mr wardour added she is sincerely sorry it is from her voluntary confession that i know how much trouble she has given you and i think if you will kindly forgive her that you will find her less selfwilled in future  and he shoved kate a little forward squeezing her hand and trying to withdraw his own  she perceived that he meant that she ought to ask pardon and though it went against her more than her first speech had done she contrived to say i do beg pardon aunt barbara i will try to do better  my pardon is one thing katharine said lady barbara  if your sorrow is real of course i forgive you and she took kates right handthe left was still holding by the fingers ends to mr wardour but the consequences of such behaviour are another consideration my personal pardon cannot and ought not to avert themas i am sure you must perceive mr wardour she added as the frightened child retreated upon him  those consequences of aunt barbaras were fearful things  mr wardour said something to which kate scarcely attended in her alarm and her aunt went on   for lady caergwents own sake i shall endeavour to keep this most unfortunate step as much a secret as possible  i believe that scarcely anyone beyond this house is aware of it and i hope that your family will perceive the necessity of being equally cautious  mr wardour bowed and assented  but added lady barbara it has made it quite impossible for my sister and myself to continue to take the charge of her  my sisters health has suffered from the constant noise and restlessness of a child in the house  the anxiety and responsibility are far too much for her and in addition to this she had such severe nervous seizures from the alarm of my nieces elopement that nothing would induce me to subject her to a recurrence of such agitation  we must receive the child for the present of course but as soon as my brother returns and can attend to business the matter must be referred to the lord chancellor and an establishment formed with a lady at the head who may have authority and experience to deal with such an ungovernable nature  perhaps said mr wardour under these circumstances it might be convenient for me to take her home again for the present  kate quivered with hope but that was far too good to be true lady barbara gave a horrid little cough and there was a sound almost of offence in her thank you you are very kind but that would be quite out of the question  i am at present responsible for my niece  i thought perhaps said mr wardour as an excuse for the offer that as lady jane is so unwell and colonel umfraville in so much affliction it might be a relief to part with her at present  thank you again said lady barbara as stiffly as if her throat were lined with whalebone no inconvenience can interfere with my duty  mr wardour knew there was no use in saying any more and inquired after lady jane  she had it appeared been very ill on saturday evening and had not since left her room  mr wardour then said that kate had not been aware till a few hours ago of the death of her cousin and inquired anxiously after the father and mother but lady barbara would not do more than answer direct questions and only said that her nephew had been too much weakened to bear the journey and had sunk suddenly at alexandria and that his father was she feared very unwell  she could not tell how soon he was likely to be in england  then she thanked mr wardour for having brought lady caergwent home and offered him some luncheon but in such a grave grand way that it was plain that she did not want him to eat it and feeling that he could do no more good he kissed poor kate and wished lady barbara goodbye  poor kate stood drooping too much constrained by dismay even to try to cling to him or run after him to the foot of the stairs  now katharine said her aunt come up with me to your aunt janes room  she has been so much distressed about you that she will not be easy till she has seen you  kate followed meekly and found aunt jane sitting by the fire in her own room looking flushed hot and trembling  she held out her arms and kate ran into them but neither of them dared to speak and lady barbara stood up saying she says she is very sorry and thus we may forgive her as i know you do all the suffering you have undergone on her account  lady jane held the child tighter and kate returned her kisses with all her might but the other aunt said that will do  she must not be too much for you again  and they let go as if a cold wind had blown between them  did mr wardour bring her home asked lady jane  yes and was kind enough to propose taking her back again was the answer with a sneer that made kate feel desperately angry though she did not understand it  in truth lady barbara was greatly displeased with the wardours  she had always been led to think her nieces faults the effect of their management and she now imagined that there had been some encouragement of the childs discontent to make her run away and that if they had been sufficiently shocked and concerned the truant would have been brought home much sooner  it all came of her having allowed her niece to associate with those children at bournemouth she would be more careful for the future  careful indeed she was  she had come to think of her niece as a sort of small wild beast that must never be let out of sight of some trustworthy person lest she should fly away again  a daily governess an elderly person very grave and silent came in directly after breakfast walked with the countess and heard the lessons and after her departure kate was always to be in the room with her aunts and never was allowed to sit in the schoolroom and amuse herself alone but her tea was brought into the diningroom while her aunts were at dinner and morning noon and night she knew that she was being watched  it was very bitter to her  it seemed to take all the spirit away from her as if she did not care for books lessons or anything else  sometimes her heart burnt with hot indignation and she would squeeze her hands together or wring round her handkerchief in a sort of misery but it never got beyond that she never broke out for she was depressed by what was still worse the sense of shame  lady barbara had not said many words but had made her feel in spite of having forgiven her that she had done a thing that would be a disgrace to her for ever a thing that would make people think twice before they allowed their children to associate with her and that put her below the level of other girls  the very pain that lady barbara took to hush it up her fears lest it should come to the ears of the de la poers her hopes that it might not be necessary to reveal it to her brother assisted to weigh down kate with a sense of the heinousness of what she had done and sunk her so that she had no inclination to complain of the watchfulness around her  and aunt janes sorrowful kindness went to her heart  how could you do it my dear she said in such a wonderful wistful tone when kate was alone with her  kate hung her head  she could not think now  it is so sad added lady jane i hoped we might have gone on so nicely together  and now i hope your uncle giles will not hear of it  he would be so shocked and never trust you again  you will trust me when i have been good a long time aunt jane  my dear i would trust you any time you know but then thats no use  i cant judge and your aunt barbara says after such lawlessness you need very experienced training to root out old associations  perhaps the aunts were more shocked than was quite needful and treated kate as if she had been older and known better what she was doing but they were sincere in their horror at her offence and once she even heard lady barbara saying to mr mercer that there seemed to be a doom on the familyin the loss of the promising young manand the words were not spoken but kate knew that she was this greatest of all misfortunes to the family  poor child  in the midst of all this there was one comfort  she had not put aside what mr wardour had told her about the comforter she could always have  she did say her prayers as she had never said them before and she looked out in the psalms and lessons for comforting verses  she knew she had done very wrong and she asked with all the strength of her heart to be forgiven and made less unhappy and that people might be kinder to her  sometimes she thought no help was coming and that her prayers did no good but she went on and then perhaps she got a kind little caress from lady jane or mr mercer spoke goodnaturedly to her or lady barbara granted her some little favour and she felt as if there was hope and things were getting better and she took courage all the more to pray that uncle giles might not be very hard upon her nor the lord chancellor very cruel    chapter xiv    a fortnight had passed and had seemed nearly as long as a year since kates return from oldburgh when one afternoon when she was lazily turning over the leaves of a storybook that she knew so well by heart that she could go over it in the twilight she began to gather from her aunts words that somebody was coming  they never told her anything direct but by listening a little more attentively to what they were saying she found out that a letter no a telegramhad come while she was at her lessons that aunt barbara had been taking rooms at a hotel that she was insisting that jane should not imagine they would come tonightthey would not come till the last train and then neither of them would be equal   poor dear emily  but could we not just drive to the hotel and meet them  it will be so dreary for them  you go out at night and for such a meeting when you ought to be keeping yourself as quiet as possible  no depend upon it they will prefer getting in quietly and resting tonight and giles perhaps will step in to breakfast in the morning  and then you will bring him up to me at once  i wonder if the boy is much altered  throb throb throb went kates heart  so the terrible stern uncle was in england and this was the time for her to be given up to the lord chancellor and all his myrmidons a word that always came into her head when she was in a fright  she had never loved aunt jane so well she almost loved aunt barbara and began to think of clinging to her with an eloquent speech pleading to be spared from the lord chancellor  tomorrow morningthat was a respite  there was a sound of wheels  lady jane started  they are giving a party next door said lady barbara  but the bell rang  only a parcel coming home said lady barbara  pray do not be nervous jane  but the red colour was higher in barbaras own cheeks as there were steps on the stairs and in quite a triumphant voice the butler announced as he opened the door colonel and mrs umfraville  kate stood up and backed  it was aunt barbaras straight handsome terrible face and with a great black moustache to make it worse she saw that and it was all she feared  she was glad the sofa was between them  there was a lady besides all black bonnet and cloak and there was a confusion of sounds a little half sobbing of aunt janes but the other sister and the brother were quite steady and grave  it was his keen dark eye sparkling like some wild animals in the firelight as kate thought which spied her out and his deep grave voice said my little niece as he held out his hand  come and speak to your uncle katharine said lady barbara and not only had she to put her hand into that great firm one but her forehead was scrubbed by his moustache  she had never been kissed by a moustache before and she shuddered as if it had been on a panthers lip  but then he said there emily and she found herself folded up in such arms as had never been round her before with the very sweetest of kisses on her cheeks the very kindest of eyes full of moisture gazing at her as if they had been hungry for her  even when the embrace was over the hand still held hers and as she stood by the new aunt a thought crossed her that had never come before i wonder if my mamma was like this  there was some explanation of how the travellers had come on c and it was settled that they were to stay to dinner after which mrs umfraville went away with lady barbara to take off her bonnet  colonel umfraville came and sat down by his sister on the sofa and said well jane how have you been  oh much as usual and then there was a silence till she moved a little nearer to him put her hand on his arm looked up in his face with swimming eyes and said o giles  giles  he took her hand and bent over her saying in the same grave steady voice do not grieve for us jane  we have a great deal to be thankful for and we shall do very well  it made that loving tenderhearted aunt jane break quite down cling to him and sob o gilesthose dear noble boyshow little we thoughtand dear caergwent tooand you away from home  she was crying quite violently so as to be shaken by the sobs and her brother stood over her saying a kind word or two now and then to try to soothe her while kate remained a little way off with her black eyes wide open thinking her uncles face was almost displeasedat any rate very rigid  he looked up at kate and signed towards a scentbottle on the table  kate gave it and then as if the movement had filled her with a panic she darted out of the room and flew up to the bedrooms crying out aunt barbara aunt jane is crying so terribly  she will have one of her attacks  oh began lady barbara catching up a bottle of salvolatile  had we not better leave her and giles to one another said the tones that kate liked so much  oh my dear you dont know what these attacks are and away hurried lady barbara  the bonnet was off now leaving only a little plain net cap under it round the calm gentle face  there was a great look of sadness and the eyelids were heavy and drooping but there was something that put kate in mind of a mother dove in the softness of the large tender embrace and the full sweet caressing tone  what a pity that such an aunt must know that she was an illbehaved child a misfortune to her lineage  she stood leaning against the door very awkward and conscious  mrs umfraville turned round after smoothing her hair at the glass smiled and said i thought i should find you here my little niece  you are kate i think  i used to be but my aunts here call me katharine  is this your little room said mrs umfraville as they came out the fact was that she thought the sisters might be happier with their brother if she delayed a little so she came into kates room and was beginning to look at her books when lady barbara came hurrying up again  she is composed now emily  oh it is all right i did not know where katharine might be  kates colour glowed  she could not bear that this sweet aunt emily should guess that she was a state prisoner kept in constant view  lady jane was quiet again and nothing more that could overthrow her spirits passed all the evening there was only a little murmur of talk generally going on chiefly between lady barbara and mrs umfraville though occasionally the others put in a word  the colonel sat most of the time with his set serious face and his eye fixed as if he was not attending though sometimes kate found the quick keen brilliance of his look bent full upon her so as to terrify her by its suddenness and make her hardly know what she was saying or doing  the worst moments were at dinner  she was in the first place sure that those dark questioning eyes had decided that there must be some sad cause for her not being trusted to drink her tea elsewhere and then in the pause after the first course the eyes came again and he said and to her i hope your good relations the wardours are well  quite wellthank you faltered kate  when did you see them last  aa fortnight ago began kate  mr wardour came up to london for a few hours said lady barbara looking at kate as if she meant to plunge her below the floor at least so the child imagined  the sense that this was not the whole truth made her especially miserable and all the rest of the evening was one misery of embarrassment when her limbs did not seem to be her own but as if somebody else was sitting at her little table walking upstairs and doing her work  even mrs umfravilles kind ways could not restore her she only hung her head and mumbled when she was asked to show her work and did not so much as know what was to become of her piece of crossstitch when it was finished  there was some inquiry after the de la poers and mrs umfraville asked if she had found some playfellows among their daughters  yes faintly said kate and with another flush of colour thought of having been told that if lady de la poer knew what she had done she would never be allowed to play with them again and therefore that she never durst attempt it  they were very nice children said mrs umfraville  remarkably nice children returned lady barbara in a tone that again cut kate to the heart  bedtime came and she would have been glad of it but that all the time she was going to sleep there was the lord chancellor to think of and the uncle and aunt with the statue faces dragging her before him  sunday was the next day and the uncle and aunt were not seen till after the afternoon service when they came to dinner and much such an evening as the former one passed but towards the end of it mrs umfraville said now barbara i have a favour to ask  will you let this child spend the day with me tomorrow  giles will be out and i shall be very glad to have her for my companion  kates eyes glistened and she thought of stern proserpine  my dear emily you do not know what you ask  she will be far too much for you  ill take care of that said mrs umfraville smiling  and i dont know about trusting her  i cannot go out and jane cannot spare bartley so early  i will come and fetch her said the colonel  and bring her back too  i will send the carriage in the evening but do not let her come without you said lady barbara earnestly  had they told or would they tell after she was gone to bed  kate thought aunt barbara was a woman of her word but did not quite trust her  consent was given but would not that stern soldier destroy all the pleasure  and people in sorrow too  kate thought of mrs lacy and had no very bright anticipations of her day yet a holiday was something and to be out of aunt barbaras way a great deal more  she had not been long dressed when there was a ring at the bell and before she had begun to expect him the tall man with the dark lip and grey hair stood in her schoolroom  she gave such a start that he asked did you not expect me so soon  i did not think you would come till after breakfast  but  and with an impulse of running away from his dread presence she darted off to put on her hat but was arrested on the way by lady barbara at her bedroom door  uncle giles is come for me she said and would have rushed on but her aunt detained her to say recollect katharine that wildness and impetuosity at all times unbecoming are particularly so where there is affliction  if consideration for others will not influence you bear in mind that on the impression you make on your uncle and aunt it depends whether i shall be obliged to tell all that i would willingly forget  kates heart swelled and without speaking she entered her own room thinking how hard it was to have even the pleasure of hoping for ease and enjoyment taken away  when she came down she found her auntas she believedwarning her uncle against her being left to herself and then came if she should be too much for emily only send a note and bartley or i will come to fetch her home  she wants him to think me a little wild beast thought kate but her uncle answered emily always knows how to deal with children goodbye  to deal with children  what did that mean thought the countess as she stepped along by the side of her uncle not venturing to speak and feeling almost as shy and bewildered as when she was on the world alone  he did not speak but when they came to a crossing of a main street he took her by the hand and there was something protecting and comfortable in the feel so that she did not let go and presently as she walked on she felt the fingers close on hers with such a quick tight squeeze that she looked up in a fright and met the dark eye turned on her quite soft and glistening  she did not guess how he was thinking of little clasping hands that had held there before and he only said something rather hurriedly about avoiding some coals that were being taken in through a round hole in the pavement  soon they were at the hotel and mrs umfraville came out of her room with that greeting which kate liked so much helped her to take off her cloak and smooth her hair and then set her down to breakfast  it was a silent meal to kate  her uncle and aunt had letters to read and things to consult about that she did not understand but all the time there was a kind watch kept up that she had what she liked and aunt emilys voice was so much like the deep notes of the woodpigeons round oldburgh that she did not care how long she listened to it even if it had been talking hindostanee  as soon as breakfast was over the colonel took up his hat and went out and mrs umfraville said turning to kate now my dear i have something for you to help me in i want to unpack some things that i have brought home  oh i shall like that said kate feeling as if a weight was gone with the grave uncle  mrs umfraville rang and asked to have a certain box brought in such a box all smelling of choice indian wood the very shavings that stuffed it were delightful  and what an unpacking  it was like nothing but the indian stall at the baker street bazaar  there were two beautiful large ivory workboxes inlaid with stripes and circles of tiny mosaic and there were even more delicious little boxes of soft fragrant sandal wood and a set of chessmen in ivory  the kings were riding on elephants with canopies over their heads and ladders to climb up by and each elephant had a tiger in his trunk  then the queens were not queens but grand viziers because the queen is nobody in the east  and each had a lesser elephant the bishops were men riding on still smaller elephants the castles had camels the knights horses and the pawns were little footsoldiers the white ones with guns as being european troops the red ones with bows and arrows  kate was perfectly delighted with these men and looked at and admired them one by one longing to play a game with them  then there was one of those wonderful clusters of chinese ivory balls all loose one within the other carved in different patterns of network and there were shells spotted and pinkmouthed cardcases red shining boxes queer indian dolls figures in all manner of costumes in gorgeous colours painted upon shining transparent talc or on soft ricepaper  there was no describing how charming the sight was nor how kate dwelt upon each article and how pleasantly her aunt explained what it was intended for and where it came from answering all questions in the nicest kindest way  when all the wool and shavings had been pinched and the curledup toes of the slippers explored so as to make sure that no tiny shell nor ivory carving lurked unseen the room looked like a museum and mrs umfraville said most of these things were meant for our home friends  there is an indian scarf and a cashmere shawl for your two aunts and i believe the chessmen are for lord de la poer  o aunt emily i should so like to play one game with them before they go  i will have one with you if you can be very careful of their tender points said mrs umfraville without one of the objections that kate had expected but first i want you to help me about some of the other things  your uncle meant one of the workboxes for you  o aunt emily how delightful  i really will work with such a dear beautiful box cried kate opening it and again peeping into all its little holes and contrivances  here is the very place for a dormouse to sleep in  and who is the other for  for fanny de la poer who is his godchild  oh i am so glad  fanny always has such nice pretty work about  and now i want you to help me to choose the other presents  there these pointing to a scarf and a muslin dress adorned with the wings of diamond beetles are for some young cousins of my own but you will be able best to choose what the other de la poers and your cousins at oldburgh would like best  my cousins at oldburgh cried kate  may they have some of these pretty things  and as her aunt answered we hope they will kate flew at her and hugged her quite tight round the throat then when mrs umfraville undid the clasp and returned the kiss she went like an indiarubber ball with a backward bound put her hands together over her head and gasped out oh thank you thank you  my dear dont go quite mad  you will jump into that calabash and then it wont be fit for anybody  are you so very glad  oh so glad  pretty things do come so seldom to oldburgh  well we thought you might like to send miss wardour this shawl  it was a beautiful heavy shawl of the soft wool of the cashmere goats really of every kind of brilliant hue but so dexterously blended together that the whole looked dark and sober  but kate did not look with favour on the shawl  a shawl is so stupid she said  if you please i had rather mary had the workbox  but the workbox is for lady fanny  oh but i meant my own said kate earnestly  if you only knew what a pity it is to give nice things to me they always get into such a mess  now mary always has her things so nice and she works so beautifully she has never let lily wear a stitch but of her setting and she always wished for a box like this  one of her friends at school had a little one and she used to say when we played at roes egg that she wanted nothing but an ivory workbox and she has nothing but an old blue one with the steel turned black  we must hear what your uncle says for you must know that he meant the box for you  it isnt that i dont care for it said kate with a sudden glistening in her eyes it is because i do care for it so very much that i want mary to have it  i know it is my dear and her aunt kissed her but we must think about it a little  perhaps mary would not think an indian shawl quite so stupid as you do  mary isnt a nasty vain conceited girl cried kate indignantly she always looks nice but i heard papa say her dress did not cost much more than sylvias and mine because she never tore anything and took such care  well we will see said mrs umfraville perhaps not entirely convinced that the shawl would not be a greater prize to the thrifty girl than kate perceived  kate meanwhile had sprung unmolested on a beautiful sandalwood case for sylvia and a set of ricepaper pictures for lily and the appropriating other treasures to the de la poers packing them up and directing them accompanied with explanations of their habits and tastes lasted till so late that after the litter was cleared away there was only time for one game at chess with the grand pieces and in truth the honour of using them was greater than the pleasure they covered up the board so that there was no seeing the squares and it was necessary to be most inconveniently cautious in lifting them  they were made to be looked at not played with and yet wonderful to relate kate did not do one of the delicate things a mischief  was it that she was really grown more handy or was it that with this gentle aunt she was quite at her ease yet too much subdued to be careless and rough  the luncheon came and after it she drove with her aunt first to a few shops and then to take up the colonel who had been with his lawyer  kate quaked a little inwardly lest it should be about the lord chancellor and tried to frame a question on the subject to her aunt but even the most chattering little girls know what it is to have their lips sealed by an odd sort of reserve upon the very matters that make them most uneasy and just because her wild imagination had been thinking that perhaps this was all a plot to waylay her into the lord chancellors clutches she could not utter a word on the matter while they drove through the quiet squares where lawyers live  mrs umfraville however soon put that out of her head by talking to her about the wardours and setting open the flood gates of her eloquence about sylvia  so delightful was it to have a listener that kate did not grow impatient long as they waited at the lawyers door in the dull square and indeed was sorry when the colonel made his appearance  he just said to her that he hoped she was not tired of waiting and as she replied with a frightened little no thank you began telling his wife something that kate soon perceived belonged to his own concerns not to hers so she left off trying to gather the meaning in the rumble of the wheels and looked out of window for she could never be quite at ease when she felt that those eyes might be upon her  on coming back to the hotel mrs umfraville found a note on the table for her  she read it gave it to her husband and said i had better go directly  will it not be too much  can you he said very low and there was the same repressed twitching of the muscles of his face as kate had seen when he was left with his sister jane  oh yes she said fervently i shall like it  and it is her only chance you see she goes tomorrow  the carriage was ordered again and mrs umfraville explained to kate that the note was from a poor invalid lady whose son was in their own regiment in india that she was longing to hear about him and was going out of town the next day  and what shall i give you to amuse yourself with my dear asked mrs umfraville  i am afraid we have hardly a book that will suit you  kate had a great mind to ask to go and sit in the carriage rather than remain alone with the terrible black moustache but she was afraid of the colonels mentioning aunt barbaras orders that she was not to be let out of sight  if you please she said if i might write to sylvia  her aunt kindly established her at a little table with a leathern writingcase and her uncle mended a pen for her  then her aunt went away and he sat down to his own letters  kate durst not speak to him but she watched him under her eyelashes and noticed how he presently laid down his pen and gave a long heavy sad sigh such as she had never heard when his wife was present then sat musing looking fixedly at the grey window till rousing himself with another such sigh he seemed to force himself to go on writing but paused again as if he were so wearied and oppressed that he could hardly bear it  it gave kate a great awe of him partly because a little girl in a book would have gone up slid her hand into his and kissed him but she could nearly as soon have slid her hand into a lions and she was right it would have been very obtrusive  some little time had passed before there was an opening of the door and the announcement lord de la poer  up started kate but she was quite lost in the greeting of the two friends lord de la poer with his eyes full of tears wringing his friends hand hardly able to speak but just saying dear giles i am glad to have you at home  how is she  wonderfully well said the colonel with the calm voice but the twitching face  she is gone to see mrs ducie the mother of a lad in my regiment who was wounded at the same time as giles and whom she nursed with him  is not it very trying  nothing that is a kindness ever is trying to emily he said and his voice did tremble this time  kate had quietly reseated herself in her chair  she felt that it was no moment to thrust herself in nor did she feel herself aggrieved even though unnoticed by such a favourite friend something in the whole spirit of the day had made her only sensible that she was a little girl and quite forgot that she was a countess  the friends were much too intent on one another to think of her as she sat in the recess of the window their backs to her  they drew their chairs close to the fire and began to talk bending down together and kate felt sure that as her uncle at least knew she was there she need not interrupt  besides what they spoke of was what she had longed to hear and would never have dared to ask  lord de la poer had been like a father to his friends two sons when they were left in england and now the colonel was telling himas perhaps he could have told no one elseabout their brave spirit and especially of giless patience and resolution through his lingering illness how he had been entirely unselfish in entreating that anything might happen rather than that his father should resign his post but though longing to be with his parents and desponding as to his chance of recovery had resigned himself in patience to whatever might be thought right and how through the last sudden accession of illness brought on by the journey his sole thought had been for his parents  and she has borne up said lord de la poer  as he truly said as long as she has anyone to care for she will never break down  luckily i was entirely knocked up for a few days just at first and coming home we had a poor young woman on board very ill and emily nursed her day and night  and now you will bring her to fanny and me to take care of  thank youanother time  but old fellow i dont know whether we either of us could stand your house full of children yet  emily would be always among them and think she liked it but i knew how it would be  it was just so when i took her to a kind friend of ours after the little girls were taken she had the children constantly with her but i never saw her so ill as she was afterwards  reaction  well whenever you please you shall have your rooms to yourselves and only see us when you like  but i dont mean to press you only what are you going to do next  i can hardly tell  there are business matters of our own and about poor jamess little girl to keep us here a little while  who is that thought kate  then you must go into our house  i was in hopes it might be so and told the housekeeper to make ready  thank you if emilywe will see when she comes in i want to make up my mind about that child  have you seen much of her  kate began to think honour required her to come forward but her heart throbbed with fright  not so much as i could wish  it is an intelligent little monkey and our girls were delighted with her but i believe barbara thinks me a corrupter of youth for she discountenances us  ah one of the last times i was alone with giles he said smiling that little girl in bruton street will be just what mamma wants and i know emily has never ceased to want to get hold of the motherless thing ever since mrs wardours death  i know it would be the greatest comfort to emily but i only doubted taking the child away from my sisters  i thought it would be such a happy thing to have janes kind heart drawn out and if barbara had forgiven the old sore and used her real admirable good sense affectionately it would have been like new life to them  besides it must make a great difference to their income  but is it possible that it can be the old prejudice de la poer  barbara evidently dislikes the poor child and treats her like a state prisoner  honour prevailed entirely above fear and curiosity  out flew kate to the exceeding amaze and discomfiture of the two gentlemen  no no uncle giles it isit is because i ran away  aunt barbara said she would not tell for if you knew it you wouldyou would despise meand you looking at lord de la poer would never let me play with grace and addy again  she covered her face with her handsit was all burning red and she was nearly rushing off but she felt herself lifted tenderly upon a knee and an arm round her  she thought it her old friend but behold it was her uncles voice that said in the softest gentlest way my dear i never despise where i meet with truth  tell me how it was or had you rather tell your aunt emily  ill tell you said kate all her fears softened by his touch  oh no please dont go lord de la poer i do want you to know for i couldnt have played with grace and adelaide on false pretences and encouraged by her uncles tender pressure she murmured out i ran awayi didi went home  to oldburgh  yesyes  it was very wrong papauncle wardour i meanmade me see it was  and what made you do it said her uncle kindly  do not be afraid to tell me  it was because i was angry  aunt barbara would not let me go to the other wardours and wanted me to write awhat i thoughta fashionable falsehood and when i said it was a lie if possible kate here became deeper crimson than she was before she sent me to my room till i would beg her pardon and write the note  soso i got out of the house and took a cab and went home by the train  i didnt know it was so very dreadful a thing or indeed i would not  and kate hid her burning face on her uncles breast and was considerably startled by what she heard next from the marquis  hm  all i have to say is that if barbara had the keeping of me i should run away at the end of a week  probably and lord de la poer saw what kate did not the first shadow of a smile on the face of his friend as he pressed his arm round the still trembling girl but you see barbara justly thinks you corrupt youthmy little girl you must not let him make you think lightly of this  oh no i never could  papa was so shocked and she was again covered with confusion at the thought  but added her uncle it is not as if you had not gone to older and better friends than any you have ever had my poor child  i am afraid you have been much tried and have not had a happy life since you left oldburgh  i have always been naughty said kate  then we must try if your aunt emily can help you to be good  will you try to be as like her own child to her as you can katharine  and to you actually whispered kate for somehow at that moment she cared much more for the stern uncle than the gentle aunt  he lifted her up and kissed her but set her down again with the sigh that told how little she could make up to him for the son he had left in egypt  yet perhaps that sigh made kate long with more fervent love for some way of being so very good and affectionate as quite to make him happy than if he had received her demonstration as if satisfied by it    chapter xv    nothing of note passed during the rest of the evening  mrs umfraville came home but kate had fallen back into the shy fit that rendered her unwilling to begin on what was personal and the colonel waited to talk it over with his wife alone before saying any more  besides there were things far more near to them than their little greatniece and mrs umfraville could not see lord de la poer without having her heart very full of the sons to whom he had been so kind  again they sat round the fire and this time in the dark while once more giles and frank and all their ways were talked over and over and kate was forgotten but she was not sitting alone in the dark windowno she had a footstool close to her uncle and sat resting her head upon his knee her eyes seeking red caverns in the coals her heart in a strange peaceful rest her ears listening to the mothers subdued tender tones in speaking of her boys and the friends voice of sympathy and affection  her uncle leant back and did not speak at all but the other two went on and on and mrs umfraville seemed to be drinking in every little trait of her boys english life not weeping over it but absolutely smiling when it was something droll or characteristic  kate felt subdued and reverent and loved her new relations more and more for their sorrows and she began to dream out castles of the wonderful goodness by which she would comfort them then she looked for her uncles hand to see if she could dare to stroke it but one was over his brow the other out of reach and she was shy of doing anything  the dinner interrupted them and kate had the pleasure of dining late and sitting opposite to lord de la poer who talked now and then to her and told her what adelaide and grace were doing but he was grave and sad out of sympathy with his friends and kate was by no means tempted to be foolish  indeed she began to feel that she might hope to be always good with her uncle and aunt and that they would never make her naughty  only too soon came the announcement of the carriage for lady caergwent and when aunt emily took her into the bedroom to dress she clung to that kind hand and fondled it  my dear little girl and aunt emily held her in her arms i am so glad  kate i do think your dear uncle is a little cheered tonight if having you about him does him any good how i shall love you katie and she hugged her closer  and it is so kind in lord de la poer to have come  oh now he will be better  i am so thankful he is in england again  you must be with us whenever barbara can spare you katie dear for i am sure he likes it  each wants me to do the other good thought kate and she was so much touched and pleased that she did not know what to do and looked foolish  uncle giles took her down stairs and when they were in the carriage in the dark he seemed to be less shy  he lifted her on his knee and said i will talk to your aunt and we will see how soon you can come to us my dear  oh do let it be soon said kate  that must depend upon your aunt barbara he answered and upon law matters perhaps  and you must not be troublesome to her she has suffered very much and will not think of herself so you must think for her  i dont know how uncle giles said poor sincere kate  at home they always said i had no consideration  you must learn he said gravely  she is not to be harassed  kate was rather frightened but he spoke in a kinder voice  at home you say  do you mean with my sisters or at oldburgh  oh at oldburgh uncle giles  you are older now he answered and need not be so childish  and please one thing  well  there came a great choking in her throat but she did get it out please please dont think all i do wrong is the wardours fault i know i am naughty and horrid and unladylike but it is my own own fault indeed it is and nobody elses  mary and uncle wardour would have made me goodand it was all my fault  my dear and he put the other hand so that he completely encircled the little slim waist i do quite believe that mr wardour taught you all the good you have  there is nothing i am so glad of as that you love and reverence him as he deservesas far as such a child can do  i hope you always will and that your gratitude will increase with your knowledge of the sacrifices that he made for you  it was too much of a speech for kate to answer but she nestled up to him and felt as if she loved him more than ever  he added i should like to see mr wardour but i can hardly leave your aunt yet would he come to london  kate gave a gasp  oh dear  sylvia said he would have no money for journeys now  it cost so much his coming in a firstclass carriage with me  you see how necessary it is to learn consideration said the colonel i must run down to see him and come back at night  by this time they were at the aunts door and both entered the drawingroom together  lady barbara anxiously hoped that katharine had behaved well  perfectly well he answered and his face was really brighter and tenderer  it was kates bedtime and she was dismissed at once  she felt that the kiss and momentary touch of the hand with the bless you were far more earnest than the mere greeting kiss  she did not know that it had been his wonted goodnight to his own children  when she was gone he took a chair and explained that he could remain for a little while as lord de la poer would bear his wife company  lady jane made room for him on the sofa and lady barbara looked pleased  i wished to talk to you about that child he said  i have been wishing it for some time said lady barbara waiting in fact to make arrangements till your return  what arrangements  for forming an establishment for her  the childs natural home is with you or with me  there was a little silence then lady jane nervously caught her brothers hand saying o giles giles you must not be severe with her poor little thing  why should i be severe jane he said  what has the child done to deserve it  i do not wish to enter into particulars said lady barbara  but she is a child who has been so unfortunately brought up as to require constant watching and to have her in the house does so much harm to janes health that i strongly advise you not to attempt it in emilys state of spirits  it would little benefit emilys spirits to transfer a duty to a stranger said the colonel  but i wish to know why you evidently think so ill of this girl barbara  her entire behaviour since she has been with us began lady barbara  generalities only do mischief barbara  if i have any control over this child i must know facts  the truth is giles said his sister distressed and confused that i promised the child not to tell you of her chief piece of misconduct unless i was compelled by some fresh fault  an injudicious promise barbara  you do the child more harm by implying such an opinion of her than you could do by letting me hear what she has actually done  but you are absolved from the promise for she has herself told me  told you  that girl has no sense of shame  after all the pains i took to conceal it  no barbara it was with the utmost shame that she told me  it was unguarded of me i own but de la poer and i had entirely forgotten that she was present and i asked him if he could account for your evident dislike and distrust of her  the childs honourable feelings would not allow her to listen and she came forward and accused herself not you  before lord de la poer  giles how could you allow it cried lady barbara confounded  that whole family will tell the story and she will be marked for ever  de la poer has some knowledge of child nature said the colonel slightly smiling  a gentleman often encourages that sort of child but condemns her the more  she will be a byword in that family  i always knew she would be our disgrace  o giles do tell barbara it cannot be so very bad entreated lady jane  she is such a childpoor little dearand so little used to control  i have only as yet heard her own confused account  lady barbara gave her own  i see said the colonel the child was both accurate and candid you should be thankful that your system has not destroyed her sincerity  but indeed dear giles pleaded lady jane you know barbara did not want her to say what was false  no said the colonel  that was a mere misunderstanding  it is the spirit of distrust thatassuming that a child will act dishonourablyis likely to drive her to do so  i never distrusted katharine till she drove me to do so said lady barbara with cold stern composure  i would never bring an accusation of breach of trust where i had not made it evident that i reposed confidence said the colonel  i see how it is said lady barbara you have heard one side  i do not contradict  i know the girl would not wilfully deceive by word and i am willing to confess that i am not capable of dealing with her  only from a sense of duty did i ever undertake it  of duty barbara he asked  yesof duty to the family  we do not see those things in the same light he said quietly  i thought as you know that the duty was more incumbent when the child was left an orphana burthen on relatives who could ill afford to be charged with her  perhaps barbara if you had noticed her then instead of waiting till circumstances made her the head of our family you might have been able to give her that which has been wanting in your otherwise conscientious trainingaffection  lady barbara held up her head stiffly but she was very near tears of pain and wounded pride but she would not defend herself and she saw that even her faithful jane did not feel with her  i came home barbara continued the colonel resolving thatmuch as i wished for emilys sake that this little girl should need a home with usif you had found in her a new interest and delight and were in herlet me say it barbarahealing old sores and giving her your own good sense and high principle i would not say one word to disturb so happy a state of things  i come and find the child a state prisoner whom you are endeavouring by all means to alienate from the friends to whom she owes a daughters gratitude i find her not complaining of you but answering me with the saddest account a child can give of herselfshe is always naughty  after this barbara i can be doing you no injury in asking you to concur with me in arrangements for putting the child under my wifes care as soon as possible  tomorrow if you like said lady barbara  i took her only from a sense of duty and it has half killed jane  i would not keep her upon any consideration  o barbara it has not hurt meo giles she will always be so anxious about me it is all my fault for being nervous and foolish cried lady jane with quivering voice and tears in her eyes  if it had not been for that we could have made her so happy dear little spirited thing  but dear barbara spoils me and i know i give way too much  this will keep you awake all night said barbara as the colonels tender gesture agitated jane more  indeed giles you should have chosen a better moment for this conversationon almost your first arrival too  but the very existence of this child is a misfortune  let us trust that in a few years she may give you reason to think otherwise said the colonel  did you mean what you saidthat you wished us to take her tomorrow  not to incommode emily  she can go on as she has done till your plans are made  you do not know what a child she is  emily shall come and settle with you tomorrow said colonel umfraville  i have not yet spoken to her but i think she will wish to have the child with her  and you will be patient with her  you will make her happy said lady jane holding his hand  everything is made happy by emily he answered  but has she spirits for the charge  she has always spirits enough to give happiness to others he answered and the dew was on his dark lashes  and you gilesyou will not be severe even if the poor child is a little wild  i know what you are thinking of jane he said kindly  but indeed my dear such a wife as mine and such sorrows as she has helped me to bear would have been wasted indeed if by gods grace they had not made me less exacting and impatient than i used to be barbara he added after a pause i beg your pardon if i have spoken hastily or done you injustice  all you have done has been conscientious and if i spoke in displeasureyou know how ones spirit is moved by seeing a child unhappyand my training in gentleness is not as complete as it ought to be i am sorry for the pain i gave you  lady barbara was struggling with tears she could not repress and at last she broke quite down and wept so that lady jane moved about in alarm and distress and her brother waited in some anxiety  but when she spoke it was humbly  you were right giles  it was not in me to love that child  it was wrong in me  perhaps if i had overcome the feeling when you first told me of it when her mother died it would have been better for us all  now it is too late  our habits have formed themselves and i can neither manage the child nor make her happy  it is better that she should go to you and emily  and giles if you still bring her to us sometimes i will try  the last words were lost  you will he said affectionately when there are no more daily collisions  dear barbara if i am particularly anxious to train this poor girl up at once in affection and in selfrestraint it is because my whole lifeever since i grew uphas taught me what a grievous task is left us after we are our own masters  if our childish faultssuch as impetuosity and sullennessare not corrected on principle not for convenience while we are children  after this conversation everyone will be sure that mrs umfraville came next day and after many arrangements with lady barbara carried off the little countess with her to the house that lord de la poer had lent them  kate was subdued and quiet  she felt that she had made a very unhappy business of her life with her aunts and that she should never see bruton street without a sense of shame  lady barbara too was more soft and kind than she had ever seen her and aunt jane was very fond of her and grieved over her not having been happier  oh never mind aunt jane it was all my naughtiness  i know aunt emily will make me good and nobody could behave ill in the house with uncle giles could they now  so i shall be sure to be happy and ill tell you what aunt jane some day you shall come to stay with us and then ill drive you out in a dear delicious open carriage with two prancing ponies  and when she wished her other aunt goodbye she eased her mind by saying aunt barbara i am very sorry i was such a horrid plague  there were faults on both sides katharine her aunt answered with dignity  perhaps in time we may understand one another better  the first thing katharine heard when she had left the house with mrs umfraville was that her uncle had gone down to oldburgh by an early train and that both box and shawl had gone with him  but when he came back late to lord de la poers house whom had he brought with him  mary  mary wardour herself  he had as a great favour begged to have her for a fortnight in london to take care of her little cousin till further arrangements could be made and to talk over with mrs umfraville the childs character and what would be good for her  if there was one shy person in the house that night there was another happier than words could tell  moreover before very long the countess of caergwent had really seen the lord chancellor and found him not so very unlike other people after all indeed unless uncle giles had told her she never would have found out who he was  and when he asked her whether she would wish to live with colonel umfraville or with lady barbara and lady jane it may be very easily guessed what answer she made  so it was fixed that she should live at caergwent castle with her uncle and aunt and be brought up to the care of her own village and poor people and to learn the duties of her station under their care  and before they left london mrs umfraville had chosen a very bright pleasant young governess to be a friend and companion as well as an instructress  further it was settled that as soon as christmas was over sylvia should come for a long visit and learn of the governess with kate  those who have learned to know countess kate can perhaps guess whether she found herself right in thinking it impossible to be naughty near uncle giles or aunt emily  but of one thing they may be surethat uncle giles never failed to make her truly sorry for her naughtiness and increasingly earnest in the struggle to leave it off  and as time went on and occupations and interests grew up round colonel and mrs umfraville and their niece lost her childish wildness and loved them more and more they felt their grievous loss less and less and did not so miss the vanished earthly hope  their own children had so lived that they could feel them safe and they attached themselves to the child in their charge till she was really like their own  yet all the time kate still calls mr wardour papa and sylvia spends half her time with her  some people still say that in manners looks and ways sylvia would make a better countess than lady caergwent but there are things that both are learning together which alone can make them fit for any lot upon earth or for the better inheritance in heaven
