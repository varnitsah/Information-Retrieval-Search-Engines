86077430	hunting the lions by rm ballantyne    chapter one  begins to unfold the tale of the lions by describing the lion of the tale  we trust good reader that it will not cause you a feeling of disappointment to be told that the name of our hero is browntom brown it is important at the beginning of any matter that those concerned should clearly understand their position therefore we have thought fit even at the risk of throwing a wet blanket over you to commence this tale on one of the most romantic of subjects by statingand now repeating that our hero was a member of the large and supposed to be unromantic family of the browns  a word in passing about the romance of the family  just because the brown family is large it has some to be deemed unromantic  every one knows that two of the six greengrocers in the next street are browns the fat sedate butcher round the corner is david brown and the milkman is james brown  the latter is a squarefaced practical man who is looked up to as a species of oracle by all his friends  half a dozen drapers within a mile of you are named brown and all of them are shrewd men of business who have feathered their nests well and stick to business like burrs  you will certainly find that several of the hardestworking clergymen and one or more of the city missionaries are named brown and as to doctor browns there is no end of them  but why go further  the fact is patent to every unprejudiced person  now instead of admitting that the commonness of the name of brown proves its owners to be unromantic we hold that this is a distinct evidence of the deepseated romance of the family  in the first place it is probable that their multitudinosity is the result of romance which as every one knows has a tendency to cause men and women to fall in love and marry early in life  brown is almost always a good husband and a kind father  indeed he is a good steadygoing man in all the relations of life and his name in our mind at least is generally associated with troops of happy children who call him daddy and regard him in the light of an elephantine playmate  and they do so with good reason for brown is manly and thoroughgoing in whatever he undertakes whether it be the transaction of business or romping with his children  but besides this the multitudinosity of the browns cuts in two directions  if there are so many of them greengrocers butchers and milkmenwho without sufficient reason are thought to be unromanticit will be found that they are equally numerous in other walks of life and wherever they walk they do so coolly deliberately goodhumouredly and very practically  look at the learned professions for instance  what a host of browns are there  the engineers and contractors too how they swarm in their lists  if you want to erect a suspension bridge over the british channel the only man who is likely to undertake the job for you is adam brown ce and abel brown will gladly provide the materials as to the army here their name is legion they compose an army of themselves and they are all enthusiastsbut quiet steadygoing not noisy or boastful enthusiasts  in fact the romance of brown consists very much in his willingness to fling himself heart and soul into whatever his hand finds to do  the man who led the storming party and achieved immortal glory by getting himself riddled to death with bullets was lieutenant brownbetter known as ned brown by his brother officers who could not mention his name without choking for weeks after his sad but socalled glorious fall  the other man who accomplished the darling wish of his heartto win the victoria crossby attaching a bag of gunpowder to the gate of the fortress and blowing it and himself to atoms to small that no shred of him big enough to hang the victoria cross upon was ever found was corporal brown and there was scarcely a dry eye in the regiment when he went down  go abroad among the barbarians of the earth to china for instance and ask who is yonder thickset broadchested man with the hearty expression of face and the splendid eastern uniform and you will be told that he is too foo the commanderinchief of the imperial forces in that department  if still indulging curiosity you go and introduce yourself to him he will shake you heartily by the hand and in good english tell you that his name is walter brown and that he will be charmed to show you something of oriental life if you will do him the favour to take a slice of puppy dog in his pagoda after the review  if there is a chief of a hill tribe in hindustan in want of a prime minister who will be able to carry him through a serious crisis there is a brown at hand who speaks not only his own language but all the dialects and languages of hindustan who is quite ready to assume office  it is the same at the diggings whether of australia california or oregon and we are persuaded that the man whose habitation is nearest to the pole at this moment whether north or south is a brown if he be not a jones robinson or smith  need more be said to prove that this great branch of the human family is truly associated with all that is wild grand and romantic  we think not and we hope that the reader is now somewhat reconciled to the factwhich cannot be altered and which we would not alter if we couldthat our heros name is tom brown  tom was the son of a settler at the cape of good hope who after leading the somewhat rough life of a trader into the interior of africa made a fortune and retired to a suburban villa in cape town there to enjoy the same with his wife and family  having been born in cape town our hero soon displayed a disposition to extend his researches into the unknown geography of his native land and on several occasions lost himself in the bush  thereafter he ran away from school twice having been seized with a romantic and irresistible desire to see and shoot a lion  in order to cure his son of this propensity mr brown sent him to england where he was put to school became a good scholar and a proficient in all games and athletic exercises  after that he went to college intending thereafter to return to the cape join his father and go on a trading expedition into the interior in order that he might learn the business and carry it on for himself  tom browns mother and sistersthere were six of the latterwere charming ladies  everybody said what pleasant people the browns were that there was no nonsense about them and that they were so practical yet so lively and full of spirit  mrs brown moreover actually held the belief that people had souls as well as bodies which required feeding in order to prevent starvation and ensure healthy growth  on the strength of this belief she fed her children out of that oldfashioned yet ever new volume the bible and the consequence was that the miss browns were among the most useful members of the church to which they belonged a great assistance to the clergymen and missionaries who waited those regions and a blessing to the poor of the community  but we must dismiss the family without further remark for our story has little or nothing to do with any member of it except tom himself  when he went to school in england tom carried his love for the lion along with him  the mere word had a charm for him which he could not account for  in childhood he had dreamed of lionhunting in riper years he played at games of his own invention which had for their chief point the slaying or capturing of lions  zoological gardens and wild beast shows had for him attractions which were quite irresistible  as he advanced in years richard of the lionheart became his chief historical hero androcles and the lion stirred up all the enthusiasm of his nature  indeed it might have been said that the lionrampant was stamped indelibly on his heart while the british lion became to him the most attractive myth on record  when he went to college and studied medicine his imagination was sobered down a little but when he had passed his examinations and was capped and was styled dr brown by his friends and began to make preparations for going back to the cape all his former enthusiasm about lions returned with tenfold violence  toms father intended that he should study medicine not with a view to practising it professionally but because he held it to be very desirable that every one travelling in the unhealthy regions of south africa should possess as much knowledge of medicine as possible  one morning young dr brown received a letter from his father which ran as follows    my dear toma capital opportunity of letting you see a little of   the country in which i hope you will ultimately make your fortune has   turned up just now  two officers of the cape rifles have made up   their minds to go on a hunting excursion into the interior with a   trader named hicks and want a third man to join them  i knew you   would like to go on such an expedition remembering your leaning in   that direction in days of old so i have pledged you to them  as they   start three months hence the sooner you come out the better  i   enclose a letter of credit to enable you to fit out and start at once   your mother and sisters are all well and send loveyour   affectionate father jb  tom brown uttered a wild cheer of delight on reading this brief and businesslike epistle and his curious landlady immediately answered to the shout by entering and wishing to know if he had called and if he wanted hanythink  no mrs pry i did not call but i ventured to express my feelings in regard to a piece of good news which i have just received  la sir  yes mrs pry im going off immediately to south africa to hunt lions  you dont mean it sir  indeed i do mrs pry so pray let me have breakfast without delay and make up my bill to the end of the week i shall leave you then  sorry to part mrs pry  i have been very comfortable with you  i ope so sir  yes very comfortable and you may be assured that i shall recommend your lodgings highly wherever i gonot that there is much chance of my recommendation doing you any good for out in the african bush i shant see many men who want furnished lodgings in london and wild beasts are not likely to make inquiries being already well provided in that way at home  by the way when you make up your bill dont forget to charge me with the tumbler i smashed yesterday in making chemical experiments and the teapot cracked in the same good cause  accidents will happen you know mrs pry and bachelors are bound to pay for em  certainly sir and please sir what am i to do with the cupboard full of skulls and uman bones downstairs  anything you choose mrs pry said tom laughing i shall trouble my head no more with such things so you may sell them if you please or send them as a valuable gift to the british museum only dont bother me about them and do take yourself off like a good soul for i must reply to my fathers letter immediately  mrs pry retired and tom brown sat down to write a letter to jb in which he briefly thanked him for the letter of credit and assured him that one of the dearest wishes of his heart was about to be realised for that stillnot less but rather more than when he was a runaway boyhis soul was set upon hunting the lions    chapter two  sport begins in earnest  time which is ever on the wing working mighty changes in the affairs of man soon transported our hero from mrs prys dingy little back parlour in london to the luxuriant wilds of africa  there on the evening of a splendid day he sat down to rest under the grateful shade of an umbrageous tree in company with major garret and lieutenant wilkins both of whom had turned out to be men after tom browns own heart  they were both bronzed strapping warriors and had entered those regions not only with a view to hunting lions but also for the purpose of making collections of the plants and insects of the country the major being a persevering entomologist while the lieutenant was enthusiastically botanical  to the delight of these gentlemen they found that tom although not deeply learned on these subjects was nevertheless extremely intelligent and appreciative  the major was very tall thin strong wiry and blackbearded  the lieutenant was very short thickset deepchested and powerful  tom himself was burly ruddy broad and rather above middle size  now this is what i call real felicity observed the major pulling out a pipe which he proceeded to fill  tom brown followed his example and bob wilkins who was not a smoker and had a somewhat facetious disposition amused himself by quizzing his comrades and carving a piece of wood with his penknife  does the real felicity major result from the tobacco or the surrounding circumstances asked wilkins  from both bob replied the other with a smile and you need not spoil my felicity by repeating your wellknown set of phrases about the evils of smoking for i know them all by heart and i dare say so does tom  impossible said wilkins i have not yet been two weeks in his company he cannot therefore have heard a tithe of the irresistible arguments which i bring to bear on that pernicious practice and which i hope some day to throw into shape and give to the public in the form of a bulky volume  which will end in smoke interrupted the major  in a literal sense too added tom brown for it will be sold as wastepaper and be made up into matches  we shall see retorted wilkins cutting carefully round the right nostril of a baboons head which he had carved on the end of a walkingstick meanwhile major as you are better acquainted than we are with this outlandish country and have taken on yourself the leadership of the party will you condescend to give tom brown and me some idea of your intended movementsthat is if smoke and felicity will permit you to do so  with pleasure my dear fellow said the major puffing vigorously for a few moments to get his pipe well alight  it was my intention to make for big buffalos village or kraal as they call it here and getting the assistance of some of his sable majestys subjects hunt the country in his neighbourhood but i heard from hicks this morning before we left the camp that a band of traders at a kraal not far from us are about to start for the zulu country and it struck me that we might as well join forces and advance together for i prefer a large party to a small onethere is generally more fun to be got out of it  would it be well to tie ourselves to any one asked tom brown  i have always found that a small party is more manageable than a large one however i do but throw out the suggestion in all humility  he shall not necessarily be tied to them replied the major relighting his pipe which had a bad habit of going out when he talked we may keep company as long as we find it agreeable to do so and part when we please  but what say you to the change of plan  i think it will bring us into a better hunting country  whatever you think best major will please me said tom for im ignorant of everything here and place myself entirely under your directions  and i am agreeable added bob wilkins  you are neither agreeable nor grammatical said the major  well if you insist on it im agreed  but do put your pipe out tom and let us resume our march for we have a long way to go and much work to do before reaching the camp tonight  thus admonished tom brown made an extinguisher of the end of his forefinger put his short clay pipe in his waistcoat pocket and shouldering his rifle followed his companions into the forest on the edge of which they had been resting  the country through which they passed was extremely beautiful particularly in the eyes of our hero for whom the magnificence of tropical vegetation never lost its charms  the three sportsmen had that morning left their baggage in a wagon drawn by oxen in charge of hicks the trader who had agreed to allow them to accompany him on a trading expedition and to serve them in the capacity of guide and general servant  they had made a detour through the forest with a party of six natives under the guidance of a caffre servant named mafuta and were well repaid for the time thus spent by the immense variety of insects and plants which the naturalists found everywhere  but that which delighted them most was the animal life with which the whole region teemed  they saw immense herds of wolves deer of various kinds hyenas elands buffalo and many other wild beasts besides innumerable flocks of waterfowl of all kinds  but they passed these unmolested having set their hearts that day on securing higher game  as wilkins said nothing short of a lion an elephant a rhinoceros or hippopotamus would satisfy them and that they had some chance of securing one or more of these formidable brutes was clear because their voices had been several times heard and their footprints had been seen everywhere  about an hour after resuming their walk the major went off in hot pursuit of an enormous bee which he saw humming round a bush  about the same time wilkins fell behind to examine one of the numerous plants that were constantly distracting his attention so that our hero was left for a time to hunt alone with the natives  he was walking a considerable distance in advance of them when he came to a dense thicket which was black as midnight and so still that the falling of a leaf might have been heard  tom brown surveyed the thicket quietly for a few seconds and observing the marks of some large animal on the ground he beckoned to the caffre who carried his spare doublebarrelled gun  up to this date our hero had not shot any of the large denizens of the african wilderness and now that he was suddenly called upon to face what he believed to be one of them he acquitted himself in a way that might have been expected of a member of the brown family  he put off his shoes cocked his piece and entered the thicket alonethe natives declining to enter along with him  coolly and very quietly he advanced into the gloomy twilight of the thicket and as he went he felt as though all the vivid dreams and fervid imaginings about lions that had ever passed through his mind from earliest infancy were rushing upon him in a concentrated essence  yet there was no outward indication of the burning thoughts within save in the sparkle of his dark brown eye and the flush of his brown cheek  as he wore a brown shootingcoat he may be said to have been at that time brown all over  he had proceeded about fifty yards or so when just as he turned a winding in the path he found himself face to face with an old buffalobull fast asleep and lying down not ten yards off  to drop on one knee and level his piece was the work of an instant but unfortunately he snapped a dry twig in doing so  the eyes of the huge brute opened instantly and he had half risen before the loud report of the gun rang through the thicket  leaping up tom brown took advantage of the smoke to run back a few yards and spring behind a bush where he waited to observe the result of his shot  it was more tremendous then he had expected  a crash on his right told him that another and unsuspected denizen of the thicket had been scared from his lair while the one he had fired at was on his legs snuffing the air for his enemy evidently the wind had been favourable for immediately he made a deadset and charged right through the bush behind which our hero was concealed  tom leaped on one side the buffalobull turned short round and made another dash at him  there was only the remnant of the shattered bush between the two the buffalo stood for a few seconds eyeing him furiously the blood streaming down its face from a bullethole between the two eyes and its head garnished with a torn mass of the bush  again it charged and again tom unable to get a favourable chance for his second barrel leaped aside and evaded it with difficulty  the bush was now trampled down and scarcely formed a shadow of a screen between them nevertheless tom stood his ground hoping to get a shot at the bulls side and never for a single instant taking his eye off him  once more he charged and again our hero escaped  he did not venture however to stand another but turned and fled closely followed by the infuriated animal  a few yards in front the path turned at almost right angles  tom thought he felt the hot breath of his pursuer on his neck as he doubled actively round the corner  his enemy could neither diverge from nor check his onward career right through a fearfully tangled thicket he went and broke into the open beyond carrying an immense pile of rubbish on his horns  tom instantly threw himself on his back in the thicket to avoid being seen and hoped that his native followers would now attract the bulls attention but not one of them made his appearance so he started up and just as the disappointed animal had broken away over the plain going straight from him he gave him the second barrel and hit him high up on the last rib on the off side in front of the hip  he threw up his tail made a tremendous bound in the air dashed through bushthorns so dense and close that it seemed perfectly marvellous how he managed it and fell dead within two hundred yards  note  if the reader should desire fuller accounts of such battles we recommend to him african hunting a very interesting work by wc baldwin esquire to whom with dr livingstone du chaillu and others i am indebted for most of the information contained in this volume rmb  the moment it fell the natives descended from the different trees in which they had taken refuge at the commencement of the fray and were lavish in their compliments but tom who felt that he had been deserted in the hour of need did not receive these very graciously and there is no saying how far he might have proceeded in rebuking his followers for the brown family is pugnacious under provocation had not the majors voice been heard in the distance shouting hallo look out a buffalo where are you tom brown wilkins  hallo he added bursting suddenly into the open where they were standing whats thisabuffalo dead  have ee killed him why i saw him alive not two minutes  his speech was cut short by a loud roar as the buffalo he had been in chase of scared by the approach of wilkins burst through the underwood and charged down on the whole party  they fled right and left but as the brute passed wilkins from the other side of the open fired at it and put a ball in just behind the shoulderblade  it did not fall however and the three hunters ran after it at full speed wilkins leading tom brown next and the major last  the natives kept well out of harms way on either side not that they were unusually timid fellows but they probably felt that where such able hands were at work it was unnecessary for them to interfere  as the major went racing clumsily alongfor he was what may be called an illjointed man nevertheless as bold as a lion and a capital shot he heard a clatter of hoofs behind him and looking over his shoulder observed another buffalo in full career behind  he stopped instantly took quick aim at the animals breast and fired but apparently without effect  there chanced to be a forked tree close at hand to which the major rushed and scrambled up with amazing rapidity  he was knocked out of it again quite as quickly by the shock of the tremendous charge made by the buffalo which almost split its skull and rolled over dead at the treeroot shot right through the heart  meanwhile tom brown and the lieutenant had overtaken and killed the other animal so that they returned to camp well laden with the best part of the meat of three buffaloes  here while resting after the toils of the day beside the roaring campfires and eating their wellearned supper hicks the trader told them that a native had brought news of a desperate attack by lions on a kraal not more than a days journey from where they lay  its not far out o the road said hicks who was a white manof what country no one knewwith a skin so weatherbeaten by constant exposure that it was more like leather than flesh if you want some sport in that way id advise ee to go there tomorrow  want some sport in that way echoed wilkins in an excited tone why what do you suppose we came here for  of course well go there at once that is if my comrades have no objection  with all my heart said the major with a smile as he carefully filled his beloved pipe  tom brown said nothing but he smoked his pipe quietly and nodded his head gently and felt a slight but decided swelling of the heart as he murmured inwardly to himself yes ill have a slap at the lions tomorrow    chapter three  in which great deeds are done and tom brown has a narrow escape  but tom was wrong  either the report had been false or the lions had a special intimation that certain destruction approached them for our hunters waited two nights at the native kraal without seeing one although the black king thereof stoutly affirmed that they had attacked the cattle enclosures nearly every night for a week past and committed great havoc  one piece of good fortune however attended them which was that they unexpectedly met with the large party which the major had expressed his wish to join  it consisted of about thirty men four of whom were sportsmen and the rest natives with about twenty women and children twelve horses seventy oxen five wagons and a few dogs all under the leadership of a trader named hardy  numerous though the oxen were there were not too many of them as the reader may easily believe when we tell him that the wagons were very large clumsy and heavily ladenone of them besides other things carrying a small boatand that it occasionally required the powers of twenty oxen to drag one wagon up some of the bad hills they encountered on the journey to the zulu country  the four sportsmen who were named respectively pearson ogilvie anson and brand were overjoyed at the addition to the party of tom brown and his companions the more so that tom was a doctor for the constitutions of two of them ogilvie and anson had proved to be scarcely capable of withstanding the evil effects of the climate  tom prescribed for them so successfully that they soon regained their strength a result which he believed however was fully as much due to the cheering effects of the addition to their social circle as to medicine  having rested at the kraal a few days partly to recruit the travellers and partly to give the lions an opportunity of returning and being shot the whole band set forth on their journey to the umveloose river having previously rendered the king of the kraal and his subjects happy by a liberal present of beads brass wire blue calico and blankets  at the kraal they had procured a large quantity of provisions for the journeyamobella meal for porridge mealies rice beans potatoes and watermelons and while there they had enjoyed the luxury of as much milk as they could drink so that all the party were in pretty good condition and excellent spirits when they left  but this did not last very long for the weather suddenly changed and rain fell in immense quantities  the long rank grass of those regions became so saturated that it was impossible to keep onesself dry and to add to their discomforts mosquitoes increased in numbers to such an extent that some of the european travellers could scarcely obtain a wink of sleep  oh dear groaned poor wilkins one night as he lay between the major and tom brown on the wet grass under the shelter of a bullockwagon covered with a wet blanket how i wish that the first mosquito had never been born  if the world could get on without rain growled the major my felicity would be complete  there is a particular stream which courses down the underside of the right shaft of the wagon and meets with some obstruction just at the point which causes it to pour continuously down my neck  ive shifted my position twice but it appears to follow me and i have had sensations for the last quarter of an hour which induce me to believe that a rivulet is bridged by the small of my back  ha have you killed him this time  the latter remark was addressed to tom brown who had for some time past been vigorously engaged slapping his own face in the vain hope of slaying his tormentorsvain not only because they were too quick to be caught in that way but also because if slain by hundreds at every blow there would still have remained thousands more to come on  no replied tom with a touch of bitterness in his tone hes not dead yet  he exclaimed wilkins do you mean to say that you are troubled by only one of the vile creatures  oh no said tom there are millions of em humming viciously round my head at this moment but one of them is so big and assiduous that i have come to recognise his voicethere dyou hear it  hear it cried wilkins how can you expect me to hear one of yours when i am engaged with a host of my own  ah but i hear that he added laughing as another tremendous crack resounded from tom browns cheek what a tough skin you must have to be sure to stand such treatment  i am lost in admiration of the amiableness of your temper tom remarked the major  if i were to get such a slap in the face as that even from myself i could not help flying in a passion  hope the enemy is defeated at last  iithink so said tom in that meditative tone which assures the listener that the speaker is intensely on the qui vive yes i believe i haveehnothere heoh  another pistolshot slap concluded the sentence and poor toms companions in sorrow burst into a fit of laughter  let im bite sir growled the deep bass voice of hardy who lay under a neighbouring wagon when hes got his beak well shoved into you and begins to suck he cant get away so quick cause of havin to pull it out again hit out hard and quick then an youre sure of him  but the best ways to let em bite an go to sleep  good advice ill try to take it said tom turning round with a sigh and burying his face in the blanket  his companions followed his example and in spite of rain and mosquitoes were soon fast asleep  this wet weather had a very depressing effect on their spirits and made the region so unhealthy that it began ere long to tell on the weaker members of the sporting party as for the natives they being inured to it were proof against everything  being all but naked they did not suffer from wet garments and as they smeared their bodies over with grease the rain ran off them as it does off the ducks  however it did not last long at that time  in a few days the sky cleared and the spirits of the party revived with their health  the amount of animal life seen on the journey was amazing  all travellers in africa have borne testimony to the fact that it teems with animals  the descriptions which not many years ago were deemed fabulous have been repeated to us as sober truth by men of unquestionable veracity  indeed no description however vivid can convey to those whose personal experience has been limited to the fields of britain an adequate conception of the teeming millions of living creatures great and small fourfooted and winged which swarm in the dense forests and mighty plains of the african wilderness  of course the hunters of the party were constantly on the alert and great was the slaughter done but great also was the capacity of the natives for devouring animal food so that very little of the sport could be looked upon in the light of life taken in vain  huge and curious as well as beautiful were the creatures bagged  on one occasion tom brown went out with the rest of the party on horseback after some elephants the tracks of which had been seen the day before  in the course of the day tom was separated from his companions but being of an easygoing disposition and having been born with a thorough belief in the impossibility of anything very serious happening to him he was not much alarmed and continued to follow what he thought were the tracks of elephants expecting every moment to fall in with or hear shots from his friends  during the journey tom had seen the major who was an old sportsman kill several elephants so that he conceived himself to be quite able for that duty if it should devolve upon him  he was walking his horse quietly along a sort of path that skirted a piece of thicket when he heard a tremendous crashing of trees and looking up saw a troop of fifty or sixty elephants dashing away through a grove of mapanitrees tom at once put spurs to his horse unslung his largebore doublebarrelled gun and coming close up to a cowelephant sent a ball into her behind the shoulder  she did not drop so he gave her another shot when she fell heavily to the ground  at that moment he heard a shot not far off  immediately afterwards there was a sound of trampling feet which rapidly increased and in a few moments the whole band of elephants came rushing back towards him having been turned by the major with a party of natives  not having completed the loading of his gun tom hastily rode behind a dense bush and concealed himself as well as he could  the herd turned aside just before reaching the bush and passed him about a hundred yards off with a tremendous rush their trunks and tails in the air and the major and wilkins with a lot of natives and dogs in full pursuit  tom was beginning to regret that he had not fired a long shot at them when he heard a crash behind him and looking back saw a monstrous bullelephant making a terrific charge at him  it was a wounded animal mad with rage and pain which had caught sight of him in passing  almost before he was aware of its approach it went crashing through the thicket trumpeting furiously and tearing down trees bushes and everything before it  tom lay forward on the neck of his steed and drove the spurs into him away they went like the wind with the elephant close behind  in his anxiety tom cast his eyes too often behind him  before he could avoid it he was close on the top of a very steep slope or stony hill which went down about fifty yards to the plain below  to rein up was impossible to go down would have been almost certain death to horse and man  with death before and behind our hero had no alternative but to swerve for the trunk of the huge creature was already almost over the haunch of his terrified horse  he did swerve  pulling the horse on his haunches and swinging him round at the same moment as if on a pivot he made a bound to the left  the elephant passed him with a shriek like that of a railway engine stuck out its feet before it and went sliding wildly down the slopeas little boys are sometimes wont to dosending dust atones and rubbish in a stupendous cloud before him  at the foot he lost his balance and the last that tom saw of him was a flourish of his stumpy tail as he went heels over head to the bottom of the hill but he could not stop to see more his horse was away with him and fled over the plain on the wings of terror for a mile in the opposite direction before he consented to be pulled up  toms companions meanwhile had shot two elephantsone a cow the other a pretty old calf and on their way back to camp they killed a buffalo  the other hunters had been also successful so that the camp resounded with noisy demonstrations of joy and the atmosphere ere long became redolent of the fumes of roasting meat while the black bodies of the natives absolutely glittered with grease  on summing up the result of the days work it was found that they had bagged six elephants three elands two buffaloes and a variety of smaller game  a good bag observed the major as he sipped his tea but i have seen better  however we must rest content  by the way pearson they tell me you had a narrow escape from a buffalobull  so i had replied pearson pausing in the midst of a hearty meal that he was making off a baked elephants foot but for anson there i believe it would have been my last hunt  how did he help you asked tom brown  come tell them anson you know best said pearson i am too busy yet to talk  oh it was simple enough said anson with a laugh  he and i had gone off together after a small herd of buffaloes ogilvie and brand were away following up the spoor of an elephant  we came upon the buffaloes unexpectedly and at the first shot pearson dropped one deadshot through the heart  we were both on foot having left our horses behind because the ground was too stony for them  after a hard chase of two hours we came up with the herd  pearson fired at a young bull and broke its leg nevertheless it went off briskly on the remaining three so i fired and shot off its tail  this appeared to tickle his fancy for he turned at once and charged pearson who dropped his gun sprang into a thorntree and clambered out of reach only just in time to escape the brute which grazed his heel in passing  poor fellow he got such a fright  false cried pearson with his mouth full of meat  that he fell off the tree continued anson and the bull turned to charge again so out of pity for my friend i stopped him with a bullet in the chest  it was well done anson im your debtor for life said pearson holding out his plate just give me a little more of that splendid foot and youll increase the debt immeasurably you see the adventure has not taken away my appetite  as he said this a savage growl was heard close to the wagon beside which they were seated  it was followed by a howl from one of the dogs  they all sprang up and ran towards the spot whence the sound came just in time to see a panther bounding away with one of the dogs  a terrific yell of rage burst from every one and each hastily threw something or other at the bold intruder  pearson flung his knife and fork at it having forgotten to drop those light weapons when he leaped up  the major hurled after it a heavy mass of firewood  hardy and hicks flung the huge marrow bones with which they happened to be engaged at the time  tom brown swung a large axe after it and wilkins in desperation shied his cap at it  but all missed their mark and the panther would certainly have carried off his prize had not a very tall and powerfullybuilt caffre named mafuta darted at it an assegai or long native spear which wounding it slightly caused it to drop its prey  the poor dog was severely hurt about the neck it recovered however soon afterwards  the same night on which this occurred one of the oxen was killed by a lion but although all the people were more or less on the alert the monarch of the woods escaped unpunished  at an early hour next morning the train of wagons got into motion and the hunters went out to their usual occupation    chapter four  tom sees wonderful sights and at last has his dreams fulfilled  thus the travellers advanced day by daysometimes in sunshine sometimes in rain now successful in hunting and now unsuccessfuluntil they reached the zulu country and the banks of the river umveloose  here they called a halt for a time and began to hunt vigorously in all directions aiming at every species of game  our heros first introduction to the river scenery was interesting to himself at least and singular  having placed himself at the disposal of his friends to be appointed to whatever duty they pleased he was sent off in the small boat belonging to the party with plenty of ammunition and provisions lieutenant wilkins being his companion and the tall caffre mafuta his guide and instructor in african warfare against the brute creation  between tom brown and this man mafuta there had sprung up a species of friendship which grew stronger the more they became acquainted with each other  mafuta was an unusually honest affectionate and straightforward caffre who had been much in the settlements and could speak a little english  he first drew forth our heros regard by nursing him with almost womanly tenderness during a threedays severe illness at the beginning of the journey  thereafter tom gained his affection by repeated little acts of kindness done in a quiet offhand careless way as though he had pleasure in being kind and did not care much whether the kindness were appreciated or not  he also excited his admiration by the imperturbable coolness and smiling goodhumour with which he received every event in life from the offer of an elephant steak to the charge of a black rhinoceros  mafuta was also fond of wilkins but he worshipped tom brown  on reaching the river the boat was launched on a part where there was nothing particularly striking to merit notice so tom said dyou know bob ive taken a fancy to ramble alone for an hour along the banks of this river will you like a good fellow get into the boat with mafuta and let me go along the banks on foot for a few miles  as your work will only be dropping down stream you wont find it hard  by all means tom a pleasant journey to you but see that you dont fall into the jaws of a lion or a crocodile  our hero smiled as he waved his hand to his companions and turning away was soon lost to sight among the bushes  now the fact was that tom brown so far from being the unromantic creature that his name is erroneously supposed to imply had such a superabundance of romance in his composition that he had for some time past longed to get away from his companions and the noise and bustle of the wagon train and go off alone into the solitudes of the great african wilderness there to revel in the full enjoyment of the fact that he was in reality far far away from the haunts of civilised men alone with primeval nature  the day happened to be delightful  not too hot for walking yet warm enough to incline one of toms temperament to throw open his vest and bare his broad bosom to any breeze that might chance to gambol through the forest  with characteristic nonchalance he pushed his wideawake off his forehead for the sake of coolness and in so doing tilted it very much on one side which gave him a somewhat rakish air  he carried his heavy doublebarrelled gun on one of his broad shoulders with the butt behind him and his right hand grasping the muzzle while in his left he held a handkerchief with which he occasionally wiped his heated brow it was evident that tom experienced the effects of the heat much but he did not suffer from it  he perspired profusely breathed heavily and swaggered unwittingly while a beaming smile played on his ruddy countenance which told of peace with himself and with all mankind  not so however with brute kind as became apparent after he had advanced about half a mile in a dreamy state down the banks of the quiet river for happening to observe something of a tawny yellow colour among the bushes he brought his gun to the present with great precipitancy cocked both barrels and advanced with the utmost caution  up to this period he had not been successful in accomplishing his great wishthe shooting of a lion  many a time had he heard the strong voices of the brutes and once or twice had seen their forms dimly in the night sneaking round the bullocks wagons but he had not yet managed to get a fair full view of the forest king or a good shot at him  his heart now beat high with hope for he believed that he was about to realise his ancient dream  slowly step by step he advanced avoiding the dense bushes stepping lightly over the small ones insinuating himself through holes and round stems and conducting himself in a way that would have done credit to a north american indian until he gained a tree close on the other side of which he knew the tawny object lay with beating heart but steady hand and frowning eye he advanced another step and foundthat the object was a yellow stone  there was a sudden motion about toms jaws as if he had gnashed his teeth and a short gasp issued from his mouth but that was all  the compressed steam was off a smile wrinkled his visage immediately after and quietly uncocking his gun he threw it over his shoulder and resumed his march  on rounding a point a few minutes after he was again arrested by a scene which while it charmed amazed him  often had he observed the multitudes of living creatures with which the creator has peopled that great continent but never before had he beheld such a concentrated picture as was presented at that moment  before him lay a wide stretch of the river so wide and apparently currentless that it seemed like a calm lake and so perfectly still that every object on and around it was faithfully mirrored on its depthseven the fleecy clouds that floated in the calm sky were repeated far down in the azure vault below  every part of this beautiful scene teemed with living creatures of every sort and size from the huge alligators that lay like stranded logs upon the mudbanks basking in the sun to the tiny plover that waded in cheerful activity among the sedges  there were tall reeds in many places and among these were thousands of cranes herons flamingoes and other members of that longnecked and longlegged family some engaged in solemnly searching for food while others already gorged stood gravely on one leg as if that position assisted digestion and watched with quiet satisfaction the proceedings of their companions the glassy surface of the mirror was covered in places with a countless host of geese widgeons teals and other waterfowl either gambolling about in sport or sleeping away a recent surfeit and thousands of other small birds and beasts swarmed about everywhere giving a sort of faint indication of the inconceivable numbers of the smaller creatures which were there though not visible to the observer  but toms interest was chiefly centred on the huge animalsthe crocodiles and hippopotamiwhich sprawled or floated about  not far from the bush from behind which he gazed two large crocodiles lay basking on a mudbankrugged and rough in the hide as two ancient treesthe one using the back of the other as a pillow  a little beyond these three hippopotami floated in the water only the upper parts of their heads and rotund bodies being visible  these lay so motionless that they might have been mistaken for floating puncheons and the observer would have thought them asleep had he not noticed an occasional turn of the whites of their small eyes and a slight puff of steam and water from their tightly compressed nostrils  truly it was a grand sight one calculated to awaken in the most unthinking minds some thoughts about the infinite power of him who made them all  toms mind did rise upwards for a little  although not at that time very seriously inclined he was nevertheless a man whose mind had been trained to think with reverence of his creator  he was engaged in solemn contemplation of the scene before him when a deep gurgling plunge almost under the bush at his feet aroused him  it was a hippopotamus which had been standing on the riverbrink within six yards of the muzzle of his gun  tom cocked and presented but thinking that the position of the animal did not afford him a good chance of killing it he waited feeling sure at all events of securing one of the various huge creatures that were lying so near him  it says much for toms powers of woodcraft that he managed to advance as near as he did to these animals without disturbing them  few hunters could have done it but it must be remembered that our hero like all other heroes was a man of unusual and astonishing parts  while he hesitated for a few moments undecided whether to fire at the crocodiles or the hippopotami one of the latter suddenly uttered a prolonged snort or snore and opened a mouth of such awful dimensions that toms head and shoulders would have easily found room in it  as he gazed into the dark red throat he felt that the wild fictions of untravelled men fell far short of the facts of actual life in regard to grandeur and horribility and it struck him that if the front half of a hippopotamus were sewed to the rear half of a crocodile there would be produced a monster incomparably more grand and horrible than the fiercest dragon st george ever slew  while these ideas were passing quickly through his excited brain the boat which he had totally forgotten came quietly round the bend of the river above him  but the sharpeared and quickeyed denizens of the wilderness were on the alert it had scarcely shown its prow round the point of land and the hippopotamus had not quite completed its lazy yawn when the entire winged host rose with a rushing noise so thunderous yet so soft and peculiar that words cannot convey the idea of the sight and sound  at the same time many grunts and snorts and heavy plunges told that sundry amphibious creatures had been disturbed and were seeking safety in the clear stream  tom hesitated no longer  he aimed at the yawning hippopotamus and fired hitting it on the skull but at such an angle that the ball glanced off  if there was noise before the riot and confusion now was indescribable  waterfowl that had not moved at the first alarm now sprang in myriads from reeds and sedges and darkened the very air  the two alligators just under toms nose spun their tails in the air with a whirl of awful energy that seemed quite incompatible with their sluggish nature and rushed into the river  the hippopotami dived with a splash that covered the water around them with foam and sent a wave of considerable size to the shore  the sudden burst of excitement noise splutter and confusion was not less impressive than the previous calm had been but tom had not leisure to contemplate it being himself involved in the whirl  four shots from the boat told him that his companions were also engaged  one of the crocodiles reappeared suddenly as if to have another look at tom who discharged his second barrel at it sent a ball into its brain and turned it over dead  he reloaded in great haste and was in the act of capping when he heard a loud shout in the direction of the boat and looking up observed that wilkins was standing in the bow gesticulating violently  he listened for a moment but could not make out what he said  hallo he cried shout louder i dont hear you  again wilkins shouted at the top of his voice and waved his arms more frantically than before  tom could not make out the words  he judged however that no man would put himself to such violent physical exertion without good reason so he turned and looked cautiously around him presently he heard a crashing sound in the bushes and a few moments afterwards observed three buffaloes tearing along the path in which he stood  it was these that wilkins had seen from the boat when he attempted in vain to warn his friend  tom jumped behind a bush and as they passed tried to fire but the foliage was so dense that he failed to get a good aim  reserving his fire therefore he dashed after them at full speed  after running some distance the buffaloes stood still and the nearest bull turned round and looked at tom who instantly sent a two ounce ball crashing into his shoulder  this turned them and they all three made off at once but the wounded one fell behind  tom therefore stopped to reload feeling pretty sure of him  starting off in pursuit he gained on the wounded animal at every stride and was about to fire again when his limbs were for a moment paralysed and his heart was made almost to stand still at the sight of three fullgrown lions which sprang at the unfortunate brute from a neighbouring thicket they had no doubt gone there to rest for the day but the sight of a lame and bleeding buffalo was a temptation too strong for them  the lions did not leap upon him but seizing him with their teeth and claws stood on their hind legs and tried to tear him down with terrible ferocity  our hero who as we have said was for a few moments bereft of the power of action could do nothing but stand and gaze in amazement  all the dreams of his youth and manhood were as nothing to this  the poor buffalo fought nobly but it had no chance against such odds and would certainly have been torn to pieces and devoured had not tom recovered his selfpossession in a few minutes  creeping up to within thirty yards he fired at one of the lions with such good aim that it fell dead almost on the spot having time only to turn and seize a bush savagely with its teeth ere it died  the second barrel was discharged but not with the same effect  another of the lions was wounded and sprang into the bushes with an angry roar  the third merely lifted his head looked at tom for a moment as if with indignant surprise and then went on tearing at the carcass as hard as ever  with a feeling of thankfulness that this particular king of the forest had treated him so contemptuously tom slunk behind a tree and recharged his gun after which he advanced cautiously and sent a ball crashing through the lions shoulder  it ought to have killed him he thought but it did not for he made off as fast as possible just as wilkins and mafuta arrived panting on the scene of action  what a magnificent fellow exclaimed wilkins going up to the dead lion  bravissimo tom youve done it at last  done it cried tom as he loaded hastily why ive all but done three  follow up the trail man as fast as you can  ill overtake you in no time  wilkins did not wait for more but dashed into the thicket after mafuta who had preceded him  tom was quickly on their heels and they had not gone far when one of the wounded lions was found lying on the ground quite dead  the other was not overtaken but as wilkins said two lions a buffalo and a hippopotamus which latter he had shot from the boat was not a bad beginning  that night they encamped under the shelter of a spreading tree and as they reclined at full length between two fires which were kindled to keep off the wild beasts enjoying a pipe after having feasted luxuriously on hippopotamus steaks and marrow bones tom brown remarked well my dream has been realised at last and upon my word i have not been disappointed    chapter five  more about lions  as we have now introduced our readers to the lion we think it but right to say something about his aspect and character as given by some of our best authorities  dr livingstone that greatest of african travellers seems to be of opinion that untravelled men are prone to overrate the lion both as to his appearance and courage  from him we learn that when a lion is met with in the daytimea circumstance by no means uncommon in africathe traveller will be disappointed with the appearance of the animal which they had been accustomed to hear styled noble and majestic that it is somewhat larger than the largestsized dog partakes very strongly of the canine features and does not much resemble our usual drawings of lions which he condemns as bearing too strong a resemblance to old womens faces in nightcaps  the doctor also talks slightingly of its roar and says that having made particular inquiry as to the opinions of european travellers who have heard the roar of the lion and that of the ostrich he found they invariably admitted that they could not detect any difference between the two when the animals were at a distance  now really although we are bound to admit that the doctors opinion is of great weight we cannot without a humble protest allow ourselves to be thus ruthlessly stripped of all our romantic notions in regard to the king of beasts  we suspect that the doctor disgusted with the twaddle that has undoubtedly been talked in all ages about the magnanimity of the noble lion and his terrific aspect has been led unintentionally to underrate him  in this land we have opportunities of seeing and hearing the lion in his captive state and we think that most readers will sympathise with us when we say that even in a cage he has at least a very grand and noble aspect and that when about to be fed his intermittent growls and small roars so to speak have something very awful and impressive which nothing like the bellowing of a bull can at all equal  to say that the roar of the ostrich is equal to that of the lion is no argument at all it does not degrade the latter it merely exalts the former  and further in regard to aspect the illustrations in dr livingstones own most interesting work go far to prove that the lion is magnificent in appearance  thus much we dare venture to say because on these points we with all men are in a position to form a judgment for ourselves  we however readily believe the great traveller when he tells us that nothing he ever heard of the lion led him to ascribe to it a noble character and that it possesses none of the nobility of the newfoundland or st bernard dogs  the courage of the lion although not greater than that of most large and powerful animals is without doubt quite sufficient but he fortunately possesses a wholesome dread of man else would he certainly long ere now have become king of africa as well as of beasts when encountered in the daytime he usually stands a second or two gazing then turns slowly round and walks leisurely away for a dozen paces or so looking over his shoulder as he goes  soon he begins to trot and when he thinks himself out of sight bounds off like a greyhound  as a rule there is not the smallest danger of a lion attacking man by day if he be not molested except when he happens to have a wife and young family with him  then indeed his bravery will induce him to face almost any danger  if a man happens to pass to windward of a lion and lioness with cubs both parents will rush at him but instances of this kind ere of rare occurrence  it would seem that light of any kind has a tendency to scare away lions bright moonlight is a safeguard against them as well as daylight  so well is this understood that on moonlight nights it is not thought necessary to tie up the oxen which are left loose by the wagons while on dark rainy nights it is deemed absolutely necessary to tether them because if a lion chanced to be in the vicinity he would be almost sure to attack and perhaps kill an ox notwithstanding the vigilance of guards and the light of the campfires  he always approaches stealthily like the cat except when wounded but anything having the appearance of a trap will induce him to refrain from making the last fatal spring  this is a peculiarity of the whole feline species  it has been found in india that when a hunter pickets a goat on a plain as a bait a tiger has whipped it off so quickly by a stroke of his paw that it was impossible to take aim  to obviate this difficulty a small pit is dug in the bottom of which the goat is picketed with a small stone tied in its ear to make it cry the whole night  when the suspicious tiger sees the appearance of a trap he walks round and round the pit thus giving the hunter in ambush a fair shot  when a hungry lion is watching for prey the sight of any animal will make him commence stalking it  on one occasion a man was very busy stalking a rhinoceros when happening to glance behind him he found to his consternation that a lion was stalking him he escaped by springing up a tree  the strength of the lion is tremendous owing to the immense mass of muscle around its jaws shoulders and forearms  what one hears however of his sometimes seizing an ox or a horse in his mouth and running away with it as a cat does with a mouse and even leaping hedges etcetera is nonsense  dr livingstone says that most of the feats of strength he has seen performed by lions consisted not in carrying but dragging or trailing the carcass along the ground  he usually seizes his prey by the flank near the hind leg or by the throat below the jaw  he has his particular likings and titbits and is very expert in carving out the parts of an animal that please him best  an eland may be sometimes disembowelled by a lion so completely that he scarcely seems cut up at all and the bowels and fatty parts of the interior form a full meal for the lion however large or hungry he may be  his pert little follower the jackal usually goes after him sniffing about and waiting for a share and is sometimes punished for his impudent familiarity with a stroke of the lions paw which of course kills him  lions are never seen in herds but sometimes six or eightprobably one familyare seen hunting together  much has been said and written about the courage of the lion and his ability to attack and kill any other animal  his powers in this respect have been overrated  it is questionable if a single lion ever attacks a fullgrown buffalo  when he assails a calf the cow will rush upon him and one toss from her horns is sufficient to kill him  the amount of roaring usually heard at night when a buffalo is killed seems to indicate that more than one lion has been engaged in the fight  they never attack any elephants except the calves  every living thing writes livingstone retires before the lordly elephant yet a fullgrown one would be an easier prey to the lion than a rhinoceros  the lion rushes off at the mere sight of this latter beast  when a lion grows too old to hunt game he frequently retires to spend the decline of life in the suburbs of a native village where he is well content to live by killing goats  a woman or a child happening to go out at night sometimes falls a prey also  being unable of course to alter this style of life when once he is reduced to it he becomes habitually what is styled a maneater and from this circumstance has arisen the idea that when a lion has once tasted human flesh he prefers it to any other  in reality a maneater is an old fellow who cannot manage to get anything else to eat and who might perhaps be more appropriately styled a woman and child eater  when extreme old age comes upon him in the remote deserts far from human habitations he is constrained to appease the cravings of hunger with mice  the african lion is of a tawny colour like that of some mastiffs  the mane in the male is large and gives the idea of great power  in some the ends of the hair are black and these go by the name of blackmaned lions but as a whole all of them look of a tawny yellow colour  having said thus much about his general character and appearance we shall resume the thread of our story and show how the lions behaved to tom brown and his friends the very night after the event narrated in the last chapter  the hunters had got back to the wagons and were about to turn in for the night in order to recruit for the work of the following day when the sky became overcast and gave every indication of a coming storm  a buffalo bull had been shot by pearson an hour before the arrival of our hero and his companions and the caffres were busily engaged on his carcass  a fire had been lighted the animal cut up and part of him roasted and the natives alternately ate a lump of roasted flesh and an equal quantity of the inside raw  when the sky began to darken however they desisted for a time and set about making preparations for the coming storm  it burst upon them ere long with awful fury and grandeur the elements warring with incredible vehemence  rain fell in such floods that it was scarcely possible to keep the fires burning and the night was so pitchy dark that the hand could scarcely be seen when held close to the eyes to add to the horror of the scene crashing peals of thunder appeared to rend the sky and these were preceded by flashes of lightning so vivid that each left the travellers with the impression of being stoneblind  after an hour or two the storm passed by leaving them drenched to the skin  however the fires were stirred up and things made as comfortable as circumstances would admit of  just a little before daybreak they were all wakened by the bellowing of the oxen and the barking of dogs  something there muttered hicks leaping up and seizing his gun  the major tom brown wilkins pearson and the others were immediately on their feet and wide awake  there was just light enough to distinguish objects dimly when close at hand but the surrounding woods resembled a wall of impenetrable darkness  close to the wagon in which our hero lay the natives had erected a temporary hut of grass about six feet high  on the top of this he saw a dark form which by the sound of his voice he recognised to be that of a native named jumbo who was more noted for good nature and drollery than for courage  he was shouting lustily for a percussioncap  tom sprang on the top of the hut and supplied him with several caps at the same time exclaiming  hallo  jumbo dont make such a row  youll scare everything away  ho  me wish um could said jumbo his teeth chattering in his head with fear as he listened to the dying groans of a poor ox and heard the lions growling and roaring beside him  they were not more than fourteen yards off but so dark was the night that they could not be seen  the ox however which was a black one was faintly distinguishable tom brown therefore aimed as near as he could guess about a foot above him and fired  no result followed  he had evidently missed  while he was reloading the major and wilkins rushed forward and leaped on the hut exclaiming eagerly where are they have you hit  immediately afterwards pearson brand ogilvie and anson rushed up and attempted to clamber on the hut  no room here cried the major resisting them quite full outside inside not safe  but theres no room on the wagon pleaded pearson the niggers are clustering on it like monkeys  cant help it replied the major theres not an inch of  here a tremendous roar interrupted him and a loud report followed as jumbo and wilkins having caught sight of something near the carcass fired simultaneously  pearson and his companions in trouble vanished like smoke while the major failing to see anything fired in the direction of the lions on chance  tom also fired at what he felt convinced was the head of a lioness  still the animals appeared to be unhurt and indifferent  the sportsmen were busy loading when tom became aware for one instant that something was moving in the air  next moment he was knocked backwards off the hut head over heels several times having been struck full in the chest by a lions head  half inclined to believe that he was killed he scrambled to his feet still holding fast to his gun however like a true hunter and rushed towards the wagon where he found all the caffres who could not get inside sticking on the outside as pearson had said like monkeys  there was literally no room for more but tom cared not for that  he seized legs arms and hair indiscriminately and in another moment was on the top of the living mass  he had leaped very smartly to this point of vantage nevertheless he found jumbo there before him chattering worse than ever  the major and and wilkins came up breathless next moment clambered halfway up slipped and fell to the ground with a united roar but making a second attempt they succeeded in getting up wilkins at once presented in the direction of the lions and again fired whether any of them fell is a matter of dispute but certain it is that wilkins fell for the recoil of the gun knocked him back his footing being insecure and he went down on the top of a tent which had been pitched on the other side of the wagon and broke the pole of it  after this several more shots were fired apparently without success  while they were reloading a lion leaped on a goat which was tethered to the grasshut and carried it away before any one could fire  not daring to descend from their places of security there the whole party sat in the cold during the remainder of that night listening to the growling of the lions as they feasted on their prey  it was not till grey dawn appeared that the enemy beat a retreat and allowed the shivering travellers to get once more between the blankets  they had not lain long however when a double shot aroused them all and they rushed out to find that mafuta had killed a lioness  she was a splendid creature and had succumbed to a bullet sent through her ribs  it was found on examination that another ball had hit her just behind the head and travelling along the spine had stuck near the root of the tail  me no hab fire at head said mafuta with a disappointed look  me hit him in ribs wid wan barl an miss him wid tother  what is that you say cried tom brown examining the bullethole ha i claim that lioness because i fired at her head last night and there you have the bullethole  cut out the ball and see said hicks drawing his knife  when the ball was extracted it was indeed found to have been fired from toms gun so according to sporting law in that region which ordains that he who first draws blood claims the game the lioness was adjudged to belong to tom  our hero returned to his blankets once more congratulating himself not a little on his good fortune when his attention was arrested by two shots in succession at no great distance  seizing his gun he ran to the place expecting to find that more game had been slain but he only found hardy standing over one of the oxen which was breathing its last  the lions had driven it mad with terror during the night and the trader had been obliged to shoot it  this was a great misfortune for it was about the best ox in the train    chapter six  gives a few hints to wouldbe hunters and a friend in need is introduced  in describing the principal incidents of a long journey it is impossible to avoid crowding them together so as to give a somewhat false impression of the expedition as a whole  the reader must not suppose that our hunters were perpetually engaged in fierce and deadly conflict with wild beasts and furious elements  although travelling in africa involves a good deal more of this than is to be experienced in most other parts of the world it is not without its periods of calm and repose  neither must it be imagined that the hunterswhom hitherto we have unavoidably exhibited in the light of men incapable of being overcome either by fatigues or alarmswere always in robust health ready at any moment to leap into the grasp of a lion or the jaws of a crocodile  their life on the whole was checkered  sometimes health prevailed in the camp and all went on well and heartily so that they felt disposed to regard wagontravellingin the words of a writer of great experienceas a prolonged system of picnicking excellent for the health and agreeable to those who are not overfastidious about trifles and who delight in being in the open air  at other times especially when passing through unhealthy regions some of their number were brought very low by severe illness and otherseven the strongestsuffered from the depressing influence of a deadly climate but they were all men of true pluck who persevered through heat and cold health and sickness until in two instances death terminated their career  it may not be out of place here to make a few remarks for the benefit of those ardent spirits who feel desperately heroic and emulative when reading at their own firesides and who are tempted by descriptions of adventure to set their hearts on going forth to do and dare as others have done and dared before them  all men are not heroes and in many countries men may become average hunters without being particularly heroic  in norway for instance and in north america any man of ordinary courage may become a nimrod and even heroes will have opportunities afforded them of facing dangers of a sufficiently appalling nature if they choose to throw themselves in their way but in africa a man must be really a hero if he would come off scatheless and with credit  we have proved this to some extent already and more proof is yet to come  the dangers that one encounters in hunting there are not only very great and sufficiently numerous but they are absolutely unavoidable  the writer before quoted says on this point a young sportsman no matter how great among foxes pheasants and hounds would do well to pause before resolving to brave fever for the excitement of risking the terrific charge of the elephant  the step of that enormous brute when charging the hunter though apparently not quick is so long that the pace equals the speed of a good horse at a canter  its trumpeting or screaming when infuriated is more like what the shriek of a french steamwhistle would be to a man standing on the dangerous part of a railroad than any other earthly sound  a horse unused to it will sometimes stand shivering instead of taking his rider out of danger  it has happened often that the poor animals legs do their duty so badly that he falls and exposes his rider to be trodden into a mummy or losing his presence of mind the rider may allow the horse to dash under a tree and crack his cranium against a branch  as one charge of an elephant has often been enough to make embryo hunters bid a final adieu to the chase incipient nimrods would do well to try their nerves by standing on railways till the engines are within a few yards of them before going to africa  begging pardon for this digression we return to our tale  while our sportsmen were advancing in company with the bullockwagons one evening at the close of a long and trying day in which they had suffered a good deal from want of good water they fell in with another party travelling in the opposite direction and found that they belonged to the train of a missionary who had been on an expedition into the interior  they gladly availed themselves of the opportunity thus afforded of encamping with a countryman and called a halt for the night at a spot where a desert well existed  as they sat round the fire that night the missionary gave them some interesting and useful information about the country and the habits of the animals as well as the condition of the natives  those who inhabit this region said he have always been very friendly to us and listen attentively to instruction conveyed to them in their own tongue  it is however difficult to give an idea to an englishman of the little effect produced by our teaching because no one can realise the degradation to which their minds have sunk by centuries of barbarism and hard struggling for the necessaries of life  like most other savages they listen with respect and attention to our talk but when we kneel down and address an unseen being the position and the act often appear to them so ridiculous that they cannot refrain from bursting into uncontrollable laughter  after a short time however they get over this tendency  i was once present when a brother missionary attempted to sing in the midst of a wild heathen tribe of natives who had no music in their composition and the effect on the risible faculties of the audience was such that the tears actually ran down their cheeks  surely if this be so said tom brown it is scarcely worth your while to incur so much labour expense and hardship for the sake of results so trifling  i have not spoken of results but of beginnings replied the missionary  where our efforts have been longcontinued we have through gods blessing been successful i sincerely believe in bringing souls to the saviour  of the effects of longcontinued instruction there can be no reasonable doubt and a mere nominal belief has never been considered by any body of missionaries as a sufficient proof of conversion  true our progress has been slow and our difficulties have been great but let me ask my dear sir has the slowness of your own journey to this point and its great difficulty damped your ardour or induced you to think it scarcely worth your while to go on  certainly not replied tom i dont mean to give in yet  i confess that our bag is not at present very largenothing compared to what some sportsmen have had but then if we persevere for a few months we are almost certain to succeed whereas in your case the labour of many years seems to have been very much in vain  not in vain answered the other our influence has been powerfully felt although the results are not obviously clear to every one who casts a mere passing glance at us and our field of labour  but you speak of persevering labour in hunting as being almost certain of success whereas we missionaries are absolutely certain of it because the word which cannot err tells us that our labour is not in vain in the lord and besides even though we had no results at all to point to we have the command from which even if we would we cannot escape go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature  well sir said the major with the air of a man who highly approves of the philanthropic efforts of all men so long as they do not interfere with the even tenor of his own way i am sure that your disinterested labours merit the gratitude of all good men and i heartily wish you success  in the course of your remarks tonight you have happened to mention that peculiar bird the ostrich  may i ask if you have seen many of late  the missionary smiled at this very obvious attempt to change the subject of conversation but readily fell in with the majors humour and replied  oh yes you will find plenty of them in the course of a few days if you hold on the course you are going  is it true that he goes at the pace of a railway locomotive asked wilkins  it is not possible replied the missionary laughing to give a direct answer to that question inasmuch as the speed of the locomotive varies  well say thirty miles an hour said wilkins  his pace is not far short of that answered the other  when walking his step is about twentysix inches long but when terrified and forced to run his stride is from twelve to fourteen feet in length  once i had a pretty fair opportunity of counting his rate of speed with a stopwatch and found that there were about thirty steps in ten seconds this taking his average stride at twelve feet gives a speed of twentysix miles an hour  generally speaking ones eye can no more follow the legs than it can the spokes of a carriage wheel in rapid motion  i do hope we may succeed in falling in with one observed the major  if you do there is not much chance of your shooting it said the missionary  why not  because he is so difficult to approach  usually he feeds on some open spot where no one can approach him without being detected by his wary eye  however you have this in your favour that his stupidity is superior to his extreme caution  if a wagon should chance to move along far to windward of him he evidently thinks it is trying to circumvent him for instead of making off to leeward as he might easily do he rushes up to windward with the intention of passing ahead of the wagon and sometimes passes so near the front oxen that one may get a shot at the silly thing  i have seen this stupidity of his taken advantage of when he was feeding in a valley open at both ends  a number of men would commence running as if to cut off his retreat from the end through which the wind came and although he had the whole country hundreds of miles before him by going to the other end he rushed madly on to get past the men and so was speared for it is one of his peculiarities that he never swerves from the course he has once adopted but rushes wildly and blindly forward anxious only to increase his speed  sometimes a horseman may succeed in killing him by cutting across his undeviating course  it is interesting to notice a resemblance between this huge bird and our english wild duck or plover i have several times seen newlyhatched young in charge of a cockostrich who made a very good attempt at appearing lame in order to draw off the attention of pursuers  the young squat down and remain immoveable when too small to run far but they attain a wonderful degree of speed when about the size of common fowls  it requires the utmost address of the bushmen creeping for miles on their stomach to stalk them successfully yet the quantity of feathers collected annually shows that the numbers slain must be considerable as each bird has only a few feathers in the wings and tail  well observed the major shaking the ashes out of his pipe your account of the bird makes me hope that we shall fall in with him before our expedition is over  do you mean to be out long  as long as we can manage which will be a considerable time answered the major because we are well supplied with everything except i regret to say medicine  the fact is that none of us thought much about that for we have always been in such a robust state of health that we have scarce believed in the possibility of our being knocked down but the first few weeks of our journey hither taught some of us a lesson when too late  ah we are often taught lessons when too late said the missionary however it is not too late on this occasion for i am happy to say that i can supply you with all the physic you require  the major expressed much gratification on hearing this and indeed he felt it for the country into which they were about to penetrate was said to be rather unhealthy  you are very kind sir he said my companions and i shall feel deeply indebted to you for this opportune assistance  are you quite sure asked the missionary pointedly that you are supplied with everything else that you require  i think so replied the major  let me seeyes i dont know that we need anything more now that you have so kindly offered to supply us with physic which i had always held up to the period of my residence in africa was fit only to be thrown to the dog  the missionary looked earnestly in the majors face and said  excuse me sir have you got a bible  wellareally my dear sir he replied somewhat confusedly i must confess that i have not  the fact is that it is somewhat inconvenient to carry books in such regions and i did not think of bringing a bible perhaps some one of our party may have one however  none of the party replied to the majors look except tom brown who quietly said  there is one i believe in the bottom of my trunk one of my sisters told me she put it there but i cannot say positively that i have seen it  will you accept of one said the missionary rising we start at an early hour in the morning and before going i would like to remind you gentlemen that eternity is nearnearer perchance than we suppose to some of us and that medicine is required for the soul even more than for the body  jesus christ the great physician will teach you how to use it if you will seek advice from himself  i feel assured that you will not take this parting word ill  good night gentlemen  i will give the drugs to your guide before leaving and pray that god may prosper you in your way and give you success  there was a long silence round the campfire after the missionary had left  when night closed in and the sportsmen had retired to rest the minds of most of them dwelt somewhat seriously on the great truth which he had statedthat medicine is needed not only for the body but the soul    chapter seven  describes river hunting  well major what are your orders for the day asked tom brown one fine morning after breakfast while they were enjoying their usual pipe under the shade of a large umbrageous tree  youd better try the river that we have just come to said the major  do you think me amphibious that you should always assign me that work asked tom  not exactly tom but i know you are fond of telling fibs and perhaps the amphibious animals may afford you some scope in that way  at all events they are capable of such astonishing feats that if you merely relate the truth about them you will be sure to get credit in england for telling fibslike poor mungo park who was laughed at all his life for a notorious drawer of the longbow although there never was a more truthful man  people wont judge us so harshly major said wilkins for so many african travellers have corroborated mungo parks stories that the truth is pretty well known and believed by people of average education  but pray is it your lordships pleasure that i should accompany tom  you know he cannot take care of himself and no one of the party can act so powerfully as a check on his inveterate propensity to inordinate smoking as myself  you must have studied johnsons dictionary very closely in your boyhood said tom puffing a prolonged cloud as a termination to the sentence  but major if you do condemn me to his company please let us have mafuta again for wilkins and i are like two uncongenial stones and he acts as lime to keep us together  dont you think that hicks had better be consulted before we make arrangements suggested pearson  hear hear cried ogilvie and i should like to know what is to be done with brand and anson for they are both very much down with fever of some sort this morning  leave jumbo with them said tom brown hes better at nursing than hunting  by the way was it not he who nursed the native that died last night in the kraal  it was and they say he killed the poor nigger by careless treatment said pearson  what nigger do you refer to asked ogilvie  the one who diedbut i forgot you were out after that hyena when it happened and so i suppose have not heard of it said pearson  we had a funeral in the village over there last night and they say that our fellow jumbo who it seems was once a friend of the sick man offered to sit up with him last night  there is a rumour that he was an enemy of jumbos and that our cowardly scoundrel made this offer in order to have an opportunity of killing him in a quiet way  hicks even goes the length of saying he is sure that jumbo killed him for when he saw the sick man last he was under the impression what he had got the turn and gave him a powder that would have been certain to cure  or kill interrupted tom brown ive no faith in hickss skill as a practitioner  of course not said wilkins proverbial philosophy asserts and requires that doctors should disagree  be that as it may continued pearson the native did die and was buried so thats an end of him and yonder sits jumbo eating his breakfast at the campfire as if he had done a most virtuous action the fact is i dont believe the reports  i cannot believe that poor jumbo coward though he is would be guilty of such an act  perhaps not said the major rising but theres no possibility of settling the question now and here comes hicks so ill go and make arrangements with him about the days proceedings  they have a primitive mode of conducting funerals here said tom brown when the major had left  i happened to be up at the kraal currying favour with the chief man for he has the power of bothering us a good deal if he chooses and i observed what they did with this same dead man  i saw that he was very low as i passed the hut where he lay and stopped to look on  his breath was very short and presently he fell into what either might have been a profound sleep or a swoon or death i could not be quite sure which not being used to black fellows  i would have examined the poor man but the friends kicked up a great row and shoved me off  before the breath could have been well out of his body they hoisted him up and carried him away to burial  i followed out of mere curiosity and found that the lazy rascals had shoved the body into an anteaters hole in order to save the trouble of digging a grave  while tom and his friends were thus conversing over their pipes their attention was attracted by a peculiar cry or howl of terror such as they had never heard from any animal of those regions  starting up they instinctively grasped their guns and looked about them  the utterer of the cry was soon obvious in the person of jumbo who had leaped up suddenlyoverturning his breakfast in the actand stood gazing before him with his eyes starting out of their sockets his teeth rattling together like a pair of castanets his limbs quivering and in fact his whole person displaying symptoms of the most abject terror of which the human frame is capable  the major and hicks who stood not far from him were both unusually pale in the face as they gazed motionless before them  the fixedness of their looks directed the eyes of tom brown and his comrades towards a neighbouring thicket where they beheld an object that was well calculated to inspire dread  it appeared to be a living skeleton covered with a black skin of the most ghastly appearance and came staggering towards them like a drunken man  as it drew nearer jumbos limbs trembled more and more violently and his face became of a leaden blue colour  at last he became desperate turned round dashed right through the embers of the fire and fled wildly from the spot with a howl that ended in a shriek of terror  no wonder hes terrified observed tom brown to his alarmed comrades i felt more than half certain the nigger was not dead last night and now it is beyond question that they had buried him alive  jumbo evidently thinks its his ghost  wont he give his friend a fright said wilkins on observing that the poor man went staggering on in the direction of the kraal  he will said hicks laughing but theyll make up for their haste by taking good care of him now  i declare i thought for a moment or two that it was a real ghost  come now gentlemen if you want good sport youve got the chance before you today  the last party that passed this way left an old boat on the river  i dare say it wont be very leaky  some of you had better take it and go after the potimusses theres plenty of buffalo and elephants in this region also and the natives are anxious to have a dash at them along with you  divide yourselves as you choose and ill go up to make arrangements with the old chief  in accordance with the traders advice the party was divided  tom brown wilkins and mafuta as on a former occasion determined to stick together and take to the boat  the others under the major went with hicks and the natives after elephants  another capital stream remarked tom to his companion as they emerged from the bushes on the banks of a broad river the surface of which was dotted here and there with loglike hippopotami some of which were floating quietly while others plunged about in the water  capital exclaimed wilkins now for the boat  according to directions we must walk upstream till we find it  as they advanced they came suddenly on one of the largest crocodiles they had yet seen  it was lying sound asleep on a mudbank not dreaming doubtless of the daring bipeds who were about to disturb its repose  hallo exclaimed wilkins cocking and levelling his gun what a splendid chance  it was indeed a splendid chance for the brute was twenty feet long at least the rugged knobs of its thick hide showed here and there through a coat of mud with which it was covered and its partially open jaws displayed a row of teeth that might have made the lion himself shrink the mud had partially dried in the sun so that the monster as it lay sprawling might have been mistaken for a dead carcass had not a gentle motion about the soft parts of his body given evidence of life  before wilkins could pull the trigger mafuta seized him by the arm with a powerful grip  hold on he cried with a look of intense anxiety what you go do fright all de potimus away for dis yer crackodl  oh fy go away  thats true bob said tom brown who although he had prepared to fire in case of need intended to have allowed his friend to take the first shot twould be a pity to lose our chance of a seacow which is good for food for the sake of a monster which at the best could only give us a fine specimenhead for a museum for his entire body is too big to haul about through the country after us  well be it so said wilkins somewhat disappointed but im determined to kick him up anyhow  saying this he advanced towards the brute but again the powerful hand of mafuta seized him  what you do want git kill altogidder  you is a fool  the black had lost temper a little  him got nuff strong in hims tail to crack off de legs of oo like stempipes  yis kom back  wilkins felt a strong tendency to rebel and the caffre remonstrated in so loud a voice that the crocodile awoke with a start and immediately convinced the obstinate hunter that he had at least been saved broken bones by mafuta for he never in his life before had seen anything like the terrific whirl that he gave his tail as he dashed into the water some fifteen yards ahead  almost immediately afterwards he turned round and there floating like a log on the stream took a cool survey of the disturbers of his mornings repose  its hard to refuse such an impudent invitation to do ones worst said wilkins again raising his gun  no you mustnt cried tom brown grasping his friends arm come along i see the bow of the boat among the rushes not far ahead of us and yonder is a hippopotamus or seacow as they call it here waiting to be shot  without further delay they embarked in the boat which though small was found to be sufficiently tight and rowed off towards the spot where the hippopotamus had been seen  presently his blunt ungainly head rose within ten feet of them  wilkins got such a start that he tripped over one of the thwarts in trying to take aim and nearly upset the boat  he recovered himself however in a moment and firedsending a ball into the brute which just touched the brain and stunned it  he then fired his second barrel and while he was loading tom put two more balls into it  it proved hard to kill however for they fired alternately and put sixteen bulletsseven to the poundinto different parts of its head before they succeeded in killing it  they towed their prize to the shore intending to land and secure it when a calf hippopotamus shoved its blunt nose out of the water close at hand gazed stupidly at them and snorted  tom at once shot it in the head and it commenced to bellow lustily  instantly the mothers head cleft the surface of the water as she came up to the rescue and rushed at the boat the gunwale of which she seized in her mouth and pulled it under  quick shouted tom as he fired his second barrel into her ear  wilkins did not require to be urged as the water was flowing into the boat like a deluge  he delivered both shots into her almost simultaneously and induced her to let go  another shot from tom in the back of her neck entered the spine and killed her  by this time a large band of natives had collected and were gazing eagerly on the proceedings  they had come down from the kraal to enjoy the sport and get some of the meat of which they are particularly fond they were not disappointed in their expectations for the hippopotami were very numerous in that place and the sportsmen shot well  four other animals fell before their deadly guns before another hour had passed and as the bay was shallow the natives waded in to drag them ashore  this was a very amusing scene because crocodiles were so numerous that it was only possible for them to accomplish the work safely by entering the water together in large numbers with inconceivable noise yelling and splashing in order to scare them away  they would not have ventured in singly or in small numbers on any account whatever but on the present occasion being numerous they were very courageous and joining hands so as to form a line from the shore to the floating animals soon dragged them out  as the carcasses belonged to hicks the trader these black fellows knew well enough that they were not at liberty to do with them as they pleased so they waited as patiently as they could for the glorious feast which they fondly hoped was in store for them  when the sportsmen at last landed to look after their game they found four fine seacows and the calf drawn up on the banks side by side with upwards of a hundred caffres gazing at them longingly  nothing could be more courteous than the behaviour of these savages when mafuta cut off such portions as his party required but no sooner was the remainder of the spoil handed over to them than there ensued a scene of indescribable confusion  they rushed at the carcasses like vultures with assegais knives sticks and axes hallooing bellowing shoving and fighting in a manner that would have done credit to the wildest of the wild beasts by which they were surrounded  yet there was a distinct sense of justice among them  it was indeed a desperate fight to obtain possession but no one attempted to dispossess another of what he had been fortunate enough to secure  the strongest savages got at the carcasses first and cut off large lumps which they hurled to their friends outside the struggling circle  these caught the meat thus thrown and ran with it each to a separate heap on which he deposited his piece and left it in perfect security  in order to introduce a little more fair play however for the benefit of the weaker brethren mafuta dashed in among them with a terrible sjambok or whip of rhinoceros hide which he laid about him with wonderful effect  in a very short time the whole of the meat was disposed of not a scrap being left large enough to satisfy the cravings of the smallest conceivable crocodile that ever dwelt in that river  the effects of this upon the native mind was immediate and satisfactory that night the sportsmen received from the kraal large and gratifying gifts of eggs bread rice beer pumpkins and all the produce of the land  but we must not forestall  before these dainties were enjoyed that night the other members of the expedition had to come in with the result of their days hunt  let us therefore turn for a little to follow their footsteps    chapter eight  shows that too high a price is sometimes paid for success in hunting  the successful commencement of this part of the days hunt was somewhat curiously brought about by the major  most people have a distinct and strong antipathy for some creature which has the power of inspiring them with a species of loathing amounting almost to terror  some who would face a mad bull coolly enough spring with disgust from a cockroach or a centipede  others there are who would permit a mouse to creep about their person with indifference but would shudder at the bare idea of a frog happening to get under their bedclothes  now major garrets peculiar horror was a serpent  he was a daring man by nature and experience had made him almost foolhardy  he would have faced a lion or an enraged elephant any day without flinching and cared nothing for a buffalobull however mad provided he had a trustworthy gun in his hand but a serpent would cause him to leap into the air like a kangaroo and if it chanced to come at him unawares he would fly from it like the wind in a paroxysm of horrorif not fear  there was no lack of serpents in that region to trouble the worthy major  numbers of them of all kinds and sizes were to be seen  one in particular which mafuta killed with an assegai was eight feet three inches long and so copiously supplied with poison that one of the dogs which attacked it and was bitten died almost instantaneously while another died in about five minutes  tom brown on another occasion knocked over one of the same species and it continued to distil pure poison from the fangs for hours after its head was cut off  besides these there were the puffadders which were very dangerous and several vipers as well as many other kinds which were comparatively harmless but the poor majors horror was so great as to cause him to regard the whole family in one light  he never paused to observe whether a serpent was poisonous  enough for him that it was one of the hated race to be killed in a violent hurry or fled from in tremendous haste  this being the case it is not to be regarded as a wonder that when the party early in the day were passing a thicket out of which glided a very large serpent the major should give a shout and incontinently discharge both barrels at it simultaneously  it chanced to be a python of great size full fifteen feet long and thicker than a mans thigh but a really harmless species of serpent  the major however did not know this or did not care  his shots although fired at random hit the creature in the spine nevertheless it retained power to raise its head fully five feet in the air and to open its mouth in a very threatening manner within a few feet of the majors face  this was more than he could bear  he turned dropped his gun and fled like a maniac while his comrades who had recognised the species of serpent stood laughing at him heartily  he did not stop until he dashed headlong into a thicket far away to the right of their line of march  here the waitabit thorns effectually checked his progress  now it chanced that in this very thicket which would have been passed by unnoticed but for the python there was a portly young female elephant with a very stout little daughter  amazed at the very sudden and reckless intrusion of the sportsman this anxious mother at once sounded her wartrumpet and charged  the major turned and fled back to his friends as fast as he had run away from them  the elephant did not follow but the hunters having discovered her retreat were not slow to follow and attack her  as they drew near the mother elephant set herself on the danger side of her little one and putting her proboscis over it as if to assure it of protection urged it to run which it did pretty smartly  but neither of them galloped their quickest pace was only a sharp walk which however was quick enough to oblige the pursuers to run at full speed the big one frequently glanced back apparently to see if she were gaining ground and then looked at her young one and ran after it sometimes sideways as if her feelings were divided between anxiety to protect her offspring and desire to revenge the temerity of her persecutors  the hunters kept about a hundred yards in her rear and as they were pretty sure of securing her the european sportsmen held back in order to have an opportunity of witnessing the method of attack practised by the band of natives who were with them  presently they came to a rivulet and the time spent by the elephants in descending and getting up the opposite bank enabled the natives to get within twenty yards of them when they discharged their spears at them the old one received the most of these in various parts of her body for she did her best to shield the young one but the latter received a few notwithstanding  after the first discharge the old ones sides ran down with blood and in a short time she bristled all over with spears like a monstrous porcupine  she soon seemed to give up all thought of defending her young and began to flee for her life so that the calf was quickly killed but no sooner did the mother observe this than all fear forsook her she stopped in her career turned round and with a shriek of rage charged her pursuers who fled right and left like a band of huge black monkeys  the elephant ran straight on and went right through the whole party but came near no one  she then continued her flight in the course of which she crossed several rivulets and at each of these received fresh spears  several times she turned and charged but never in any ease did she run more than a hundred yards  gradually she grew weak from loss of blood which poured from her like rain and at last when she was making a charge she staggered round and sank down dead in a kneeling posture  the natives were overjoyed of course at their success and at the prospect of a baked elephants foot for supper and hicks was much pleased with the tusks which were large and valuable  he surveyed them with a complacent smile and observed that he had much need of a little ivory like that for the expenses of a trading expedition were very heavy  but you have reason to expect a good deal in this part of the country said the major if all that is rumoured be true  no doubt there is some truth in what is reported we shall see meanwhile yonder goes something to encourage us  he pointed towards an opening in a thicket close at hand where an elephant was seen running towards them as if ignorant of their presence  some one must be after that fellow said hicks  about a dozen natives emerged from the thicket as he spoke  they were evidently driving the elephant which was a large bull towards the hunters for the purpose of letting them have a good shot so the latter at once hid themselves when the elephant drew near it seemed to suspect danger ahead for it burned to the right when at a distance of about a hundred yards  this was a great disappointment so the major rather than be balked altogether tried a long shot and broke the animals foreleg  then running after him at a pace which even the supple natives could not equal he got close up and sent a ball into his head which stunned him but it took four additional shots to kill him  this was an unusually fortunate case for elephants are not easily killed  the african elephant is in many respects different from that of india and is never killed like the ceylon elephant by a single ball in the brain  dr livingstone tells us that on one occasion when he was out with a large party of natives a troop of elephants were attacked by them and that one of these in running away fell into a hole and before he could extricate himself an opportunity was allowed for all the men to throw their spears  when the elephant rose he was like a huge porcupine for each of the seventy or eighty men had discharged more than one spear at him  as they had no more they sent for the doctor to shoot him  he anxious to put the animal at once out of pain went up to within twenty yards rested his gun on an anthill so as to take steady aim but though he fired twelve twoounce bullets all he had into different parts he could not kill it  as it was getting dark they were obliged to leave it standing there intending to return in the morning in the full expectation of finding it dead but though they searched all that day and went over more than ten miles of ground they never saw it again  the female elephant killed by our hunters at this time was a comparatively small one  its height was eight feet eight inches  many of those which were afterwards killed were of much greater height indian elephants never reach to the enormous size of the african elephant which is distinguished from that of india by a mark that cannot be mistaken namely the ear which in the african species is enormously large  that of the female just killed measured four feet five inches in length and four feet in breadth  a native has been seen to creep under an elephants ear so as to be quite covered from the rain  the african elephant has never been tamed at the cape nor has one ever been exhibited in england  but to return to our hunters  before that day had closed the major and his friends had made good bags  the total result of the days hunt by both parties was five seacows four elephants two buffaloes a giraffe and a number of birds of various kinds  of course this set the natives of the kraal into a ferment of joyous festivity and the sportsmen rose very high in their estimation insomuch that they overwhelmed them with gifts of native produce  our hero was an especial favourite because on several occasions he turned his medical and surgical knowledge to good account and afforded many of them great relief from troubles which their own doctors had failed to cure or charm away  some time after this when they were travelling through a comparatively dry district they encamped near a pool of water and the sights they saw there were most amazing for all the animals in the neighbourhood flocked to the pool to slake their burning thirst  after supper instead of going to rest tom brown and most of the party resolved to go and watch this poolthe moon being bright at the time they had not lain long in ambush beside it when a troop of elephants came rushing into it and began to drink with great avidity spirting the water over each other and shrieking with delight  for some hours the hunters remained on the watch there and saw animals of all kinds come down to drinkantelopes zebras buffaloes etcetera in great numbers  thus they passed through the country enjoying themselves and adding considerably to hickss stock of ivory when an incident occurred which threw a deep gloom over the party for some time  one day they went out after some elephants which were reported to be near to their encampment and about noon rested a little to refresh themselves  they had set out as a united party on this occasion accompanied by a large band of natives armed with spears  just after leaving the spot where they rested the major discovered that he had left his knife behind him and went back to look for it in company with tom brown  as it was only quarter of a mile off or less they foolishly left their guns behind them  on nearing the spot tom stopped a few moments and bent down to examine a beautiful flower  the major walked on but had not gone many paces when three lions walked out of a thicket not twenty paces off  tom had risen and saw the lions and for the first time in his life felt a sensation about the heart which is popularly known as the blood curdling in the vein  the major being totally unarmed stopped and stood motionless like a statue  the lions stopped also being evidently taken by surprise at the sudden and unexpected apparition of a man  had the major turned and fled it is almost certain that his fate would have been sealed but he stood firm as a rock and tom observed that he did not even change colour as he gazed with a fixed glassy stare at the lions  unused to such treatment the animals winced under it  their own glances became uneasy then they turned slowly round and slunk away with the air of creatures which know that they have been doing wrong in a few moments they bounded off at full speed their pace being accelerated by the terrible yell which burst simultaneously from tom and the major who found intense relief in this violent expression of their pentup feelings  but this good reader is not the gloomy incident to which we have referred  it was just after the occurrence of this minor episode in the proceedings of the day that the party came upon fresh tracks of a troop of elephants and set off in pursuit  the englishmen were on horseback having obtained steeds from a trader whom they had met farther south but the nativesa very large bandwere on foot  while they were advancing through a somewhat open part of the country four lions were seen on the top of a low sandhill which was covered with bushes and a few stunted trees  it was at once resolved that they should be surrounded  accordingly the natives were ordered to form a wide ring round the hill  now said hicks who assumed command of the party in virtue of his superior knowledge we must separate and advance from different directions and be sure gentlemen that you dont shoot the niggers look well before you  that hollow is a very likely place for one of them to run along therefore the best shot among you had better go up there  who is the best shot  the trader smiled knowingly for he knew that the major esteemed himself the best  i think i am said wilkins with an air of great simplicity  there was a general laugh at this for it was well known that wilkins was the worst shot of the party  well now said he with a goodnatured smile since you have insulted me so grossly i think myself entitled to name the best man i therefore suggest tom brown  right said pearson  the others being all agreed tom consented with becoming modesty to take the post of honour and of danger  are we to ride or walk he asked  walk of course said hicks  the ground is much too rough for horses  and i trust tom said wilkins that you will permit me to follow you  i am the worst shot you know and the worst and best should go together on the acknowledged principle that extremes meet  this being arranged the sportsmen dismounted fastened their horses to trees and separated  the circle of men gradually closed in and ascended the hill pretty near to each other  presently tom brown observed one of the lions get upon a piece of rock  the major also saw him and being anxious to secure the first shot fired somewhat hastily and hit the rock on which the magnificent brute was standing as if it had got up there to take a cool survey of the field  he bit at the spot struck as a dog bites at a stick or stone thrown at him  next moment tom brown sent a bullet straight into his heart and his tail made a splendid flourish as he fell off his pedestal  almost immediately after two of the other lions broke cover dashed towards the circle of men went right through them and escaped  the courage of the natives proved unequal to the danger of facing such a charge  a great shoutpartly no doubt of disappointmentwas given when the lions escaped  this had the effect of causing the fourth lion to break cover and leap upon a rock as the first had done  the hunter nearest to him was pearson who was not farther off than shout thirty yards  he took good aim fired both barrels at him and tumbled him off the rock into a small bush beside it  he is wounded cried hicks but not killed  have a care  pearson was loading his gun as fast as possible when he heard a loud shout and cries of look out  take care  starting and turning half round he saw the animal in the act of springing on him  before he could move he was struck on the head and next moment the lion and he went down together  growling horribly the enraged brute seized poor pearson and shook him as a terrier dog shakes a rat  although stunned he was able to turn a little to relieve himself of its weight for the lion had placed one paw on the back of his head  instantly the major tom brown and hicks ran up and fired six shots into him almost simultaneously and at a few yards distance  with a terrific roar he left pearson and springing on hicks caught him by the leg  mafuta immediately rushed at him with a spear but was caught by the lion on the shoulder and dragged down  seeing this tom brown caught up the spear and plunged it deep into the chest of the brute which seized it savagely in his teeth and snapped it in two like a twig throwing tom down in the act but another bullet from wilkins and the effects of the previous shots caused him to drop down suddenly quite dead  it was found on examination that the injuries received by poor pearson were mortal  as could just speak but could not move  a litter was therefore hastily prepared for him and one also for hicks whose leg was severely injured though fortunately not broken  mafutas hurts were trifling and tom brown had only received one or two scratches in his fall  in a short time the litters were ready and the party returned to their encampment  that night pearson expressed a strong desire to have the bible read to him and tom brown who had done all that professional skill could accomplish to relieve his comrades suffering body sought out from the bottom of his box that precious book which the missionary had told him contained medicine for the soul  the dying man was very anxious  as gave tom no rest but questioned him eagerly and continuously during the whole night about the things which concerned his soul  his doctor could not assist him much and keenly did he feel at that time how awful it is to postpone thoughts of eternity to a dying hour  as did his best however to comfort his friend by reading passage after passage from the sacred book dwelling particularly on and repeating this textthe blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth from all sin towards morning pearson fell into a lethargic sleep out of which he never awoke  next day they buried him under the shade of a spreading tree and left him therealone in the wilderness    chapter nine  the last  from this period everything like good fortune seemed to forsake the hunters  the traders wound became so painful that he resolved to return to the settlements and accordingly their faces were turned southward  but the way was toilsome the heat intense and the water scarcemore so than it had been on the outward journey  to add to their troubles fever and ague attacked most of the white men and one of them ogilvie died on the journey  at last tom brown who had up to that time been one of the strongest of the party broke down and it was found to be necessary to leave him behind at a native village for it would have been certain death to the others to have remained with him and their doing so could have done him no good  i cannot tell you tom said the major as he sat beside his friends couch the night before they parted how deeply it grieves me to leave you in this way but you see my dear fellow that the case is desperate  you are incapable of moving  if we remain here the most of us will die for i find that it is all i can do to drag one leg after the other and i have grave doubts as to whether i shall ever get out of this rascally country alive  as to poor bob wilkins he is in a worse condition than myself  now our intention is to leave you all the physic push on as fast as possible to the nearest settlement where we shall get more for ourselves and send out a party of natives under some trustworthy trader to fetch you out of the country  you are very kind major said tom languidly but i cannot allow you to leave me all the physic  your own life may depend on having some of it and  there dont exhaust yourself tom with objections for bob and i have made up our minds to do it  the very fact that every day we are getting nearer the habitable parts of the world will keep our spirits up and give us strength and you may depend upon it my poor fellow that we wont waste time in sending help to you  the majors voice trembled a little for he had become very weak and had secret misgivings that he would never see his friend again  we are going to leave mafuta with you he added quickly  thats right exclaimed tom with an expression of satisfaction  if any one is able to pull me through this bout mafuta is the man  by the way major will you do me the favour to open my portmanteau and fetch me the bible you will find there  i mean to read it  do you know i have been thinking that we are great fools to keep calling ourselves christians when we have scarcely any of the signs of christianity about us and particularly in putting off the consideration of our souls interests to a time like this  upon my word tom i agree with you said the major  well then said tom like a good fellow get the bible for me and let me advise you as a friend to make use of the one the missionary gave you  i mean to turn over a new leaf  my only fear is that if i get well i shall become as indifferent as i was before  no fear of that tom you are much too honesthearted to be so changeable  hm i dont know said tom with an attempt at a smile i should not be easy if my salvation depended on the honesty of my heart  i rather fear major that your method of comforting me is not what the missionary would call orthodox  but good night old fellow i feel tired and find it wonderfully difficult not only to speak but to think so ill try to sleep  saying this our hero turned on his side and soon fell into a quiet slumber out of which he did not awake until late the following morning  the major meanwhile sought for and found the bible in his portmanteau and laid it on his pillow so that he might find it there on awaking for a long time he and wilkins sat by the sick mans side next morning in the hope of his awaking that they might bid him goodbye but tom did not rouse up so being unwilling to disturb him they left without having the sad satisfaction of saying farewell  when tom brown awoke late in the day he found mafuta sitting at his feet with a broad grin on his dusky countenance  what are you laughing at you rascal demanded tom somewhat sternly  me laffin at yous face  indeed is it then so ridiculous  yis oh yis yous bery riclous  jist no thicker dan de edge ob hatchet  tom smiled  well im not fat thats certain but i feel refreshed dyou know mafuta i think i shall get well after all  ho yis said mafuta with a grin nodding his woolly head violently and displaying a magnificent double row of teeth yous git well you had slep an swet mos bootiful  me wish de major see you now  the major is he gone  yis hoed off dis morrownin  and mr wilkins  hoed off too  tom brown opened his eyes and stared silently for a few minutes at his companion  then we are all alone you and i he said suddenly  yis all alone sept de two tousand caffres ob de kraal but dey is nobodyonly black beasts  tom laughed to hear his attendant talk so scornfully of his countrymen and mafuta laughed to see his master in such good spirits after which the former became grave and feeling a slight twinge of hunger made a sudden demand for food  mafuta rose and left the tent and tom turning on his side observed the bible lying on the pillow  he opened it but forgot to read in consequence of his attention being arrested by the extreme thinness of his hands  recovering himself he turned to the twentyfirst psalm but had only read the first verse when the book dropt from his fingers and he again fell sound asleep  this was the turningpoint in his illness  he began to mend a little but so slowly that he almost lost heart once or twice and felt convinced that if he did not make an attempt to get out of the unhealthy region he should never regain strength  acting on this belief he left the native village on foot carrying nothing but his rifle which seemed to him in his weak condition to be as heavy as a small cannon  mafuta went on in advance heavily laden with the blankets a small tent provisions ammunition etcetera necessary for the journey  at first tom could scarcely walk a mile without sitting down several times to rest on which occasions mafuta endeavoured to cheer him up by threatening to leave him to his fate  this was a somewhat singular mode of stimulating but he deemed it the wisest course and acted on it when tom lay down under the shade of a tree thoroughly knocked up the caffre would bid him farewell and go away but in a short time he would return and urge him to make another attempt  thus tom brown travelled day after day under the broiling sun  during that periodwhich he afterwards described as the most dreadful of his lifefever and ague reduced him to a state of excessive weakness  in fact it was a battle between the dire disease and that powerful constitution for which the brown family is celebrated  for a considerable time it appeared very doubtful how the battle would end  one morning tom was awakened by his faithful attendant to resume his weary journey  he got up with a heavy sigh and almost fell down again from weakness  i think mafuta said tom gravely that im pretty nearly used up youll have to leave me i fear and make the best of your way out of this wretched country alone  dis a fussrate kontry said the caffre quietly  ah true mafuta i forgot for a moment that it is your native land however i am bound to admit that it is a firstrate country for sport also for killing englishmen  i dont feel able to move a step  tom sat down as he said this and uttering a sort of groan leaned his back against a tree  wat yous no go fadder  no said tom with some asperity for he felt too much exhausted to speak  berry good me say goodbye  mafuta nodded his head as he spoke and gravely shouldering his load marched away  tom looked after him with a melancholy smile for he quite understood the ruse by this time and knew that he would return although the simple native sincerely believed that his motives and intentions had been concealed with deep wisdom  tom was not sorry to get a respite and threw himself flat down in order to make the most of it but mafuta was more anxious than usual about his companion that morning  he returned in ten minutes or so having sat for that period behind a neighbouring tree to brood over his circumstances  yous come on now eh he said gently regarding tom with an anxious expression of countenance  well well replied our hero getting up with a sort of desperate energy lets push on i can at all events walk till my legs refuse to carry me and then it will not be i who shall have given in but the legseh mafuta  smiling languidly at this conceit tom walked on almost mechanically for nearly twenty miles that day with scarcely any shelter from the sun  at night he reached a native village the chief of which considerately let him rest in an old hut  when tom flung himself down in a corner of this he felt so ill that he called his servant and bade him fetch the package which contained his slender stock of medicine  open it mafuta and lets see what we have left  im resolved to make some change in myself for better or worse if i should have to eat up the whole affair  better be poisoned at once than die by inches in this way  no more kineen said the caffre as he kneeled by his masters side turning over the papers and bottles  no more quinine repeated tom sadly no more life that means  noting more bot tree imuttics an small drop ludnum said mafuta  three emetics said tom and some laudanum come ill try these mix the whole of em in a can and be quick like a good fellow ill have one good jorum whatever happens  bot yous vil bost said mafuta remonstratively  no fear  do as i bid you  the caffre obeyed and tom swallowed the potion  the result however was unsatisfactory for contrary to what was anticipated they produced no effect whatever  to make matters worse the hut in which they lay was overrun with rats which were not only sleepless and active but daring for they kept galloping round the floor all night and chasing one another over toms body and face  after a time he became desperate  here mafuta he cried strike a light and get me a long feather of some sort out of a birds wings  the wondering native got up and did as he was commanded  now mafuta shove the feather down my throat  dont be afraid  ill give you a dig in the ribs if you go too far  the result of this operation was speedy and complete  the sick man was relieved  in a short time he fell into a deep sleep which lasted for several hours  after this he awoke much refreshed and having obtained some rice from the native chief ate a little with relish  next day they resumed their journey and travelled till four in the afternoon when the fit of ague prostrated tom for a couple of hours as it had been in the habit of doing regularly at the same hour for some time past leaving him in a very exhausted state of body and much depressed in spirits  in the course of a week however this extreme depression passed away and he managed to get along painfully it is true but creditably they were fortunate enough soon after to meet with a trader from whom our hero purchased two stout horses and thenceforward the journey became more agreeableat least toms returning strength enabled him to enjoy it for it could not be said that the fatigues or privations of the way had decreased on the contrary in some respects they had increased considerably  one day while tom was ambling along the margin of a belt of thick wood with his sable guide riding in advance he came suddenly in sight of a herd of giraffes  he had been short of fresh meat for a couple of days because although there was no lack of game his arm had not become sufficiently steady to enable him to take a good aim and being unwilling to resign the office of hunter to his attendant until reduced to the last extremity he had taken all the chances that occurred and had missed on every occasion  being determined not to miss this opportunity he at once put spurs to his steed and dashed after the giraffes at a breakneck pace  the ground was very rocky uneven and full of holes and scrubby bushes the longnecked creatures at once set off at a pace which tried toms steed although a good one to the utmost  there was a thick forest of makolani trees about a mile away to the left towards which the giraffes headed evidently with the intention of taking refuge there  tom observed this and made a detour in order to get between them and the wood  this made it necessary to put on a spurt to regain lost distance but on such ground the speed was dangerous  he neared one of the animals however and was standing up in his stirrups intent on taking a flying shot when his horse suddenly put his foot in a hole and fell so violently that he rolled heels over head several times like a hare shot in full career  fortunately his rider was sent out of the saddle like a rocket and fell a considerable distance ahead and out of the way of the rolling horse  a friendly bush received him and saved his neck but tore his coat to tatters  jumping up he presented at the giraffe which was galloping off about two hundred yards ahead  in the fall the barrel of his rifle had been so covered with dead leaves and dust that he could not take aim  hastily wiping it with his sleeve he presented again and fired  the ball hit the giraffe on the hip but it failed to bring him down  a second shot however broke his leg and the stately animal rolled over  before tom reached him he was dead  thus the travellers were supplied with a sufficiency of meat for some days and they pushed steadily forward without paying attention to the game which happened to be very plentiful in that district as their great desire was to get out of the unhealthy region as quickly as possible  sometimes however they were compelled to shoot in selfdefence  upon one occasion while mafuta was looking for water in the bush he was charged by a black rhinoceros and had a very narrow escape  tom brown was within sight of him at the time engaged also in looking for water  he heard the crash of bushes when the monster charged and looking hastily round saw mafuta make a quick motion as if he meant to run to a neighbouring tree but the rhinoceros was so close on him that there was no time  quick man shouted tom in an agony of alarm as he ran to the rescue for the caffre had no gun  but mafuta instead of taking this advice suddenly stood stock still as if he had been petrified  tom threw forward his rifle intending in desperation to try the effect of a long shot although certain that it was impossible to kill the rhinoceros even if he should hit while the risk of killing his faithful servant was very great  before he had time to fire however the animal ran past the motionless caffre without doing him any injury  whether it is owing to the smallness of its eyes or to the horns on its nose being in the way we cannot tell but it is a fact that the black rhinoceros does not see well and mafuta aware of this defect had taken advantage of it in a way what is sometimes practised by bold men had he continued to run he would certainly have been overtaken and killed but standing perfectly still he was no doubt taken for a tree stump by the animal  at all events it brushed past him and mafuta doubling on his track ran to a tree up which he vaulted like a monkey  meanwhile tom brown got within range and sent a ball crashing against the animals hard sides without doing it any injury  the second barrel was discharged with no better result except that a splinter of its horn was knocked off  before he could reload the rhinoceros was gone and tom had to content himself with carrying off the splinter as a memorial of the adventure  that night the travellers made their encampment at the foot of a tree on the lower branches of which they hung up a quantity of meat  tom lay in a small tent which he carried with him but mafuta preferred to sleep by the fire outside  during the day they had seen and heard several lions  it was therefore deemed advisable to picket the horses close to the tent between it and the fire  mafuta said tom brown as he lay contemplating the fire on which the caffre had just heaped fresh logs give me some more tea and cook another giraffe steak  dyou know i feel my appetite coming back with great force  dat am good said mafuta  yes that is undoubtedly good said tom  i never knew what it was to have a poor appetite until i came to this wonderful land of yours and i assure you that i will not pay it another visit in a hurryalthough upon the whole im very well pleased to have hunted in it  wat for you come because of asked mafuta  well i came for fun as the little boys in my country say  i came for change for variety for amusement for relaxation for sport  do you understand any of these expressions  me not onderstan moch answered mafuta with great simplicity of manner bot why you want for change  me nivir wants no change  ah mafuta replied tom with a smile youre a happy man  the fact is that we civilised people lead artificial lives to a large extent and therefore require a change sometimes to recruit our energiesthat is to put us right again whereas you and your friends live in a natural way and therefore dont require putting right  dyou understand  not moch answered the caffre gazing into the fire with a puzzled look  you say we lives natral life an dont need be put right berry good why you not live natral life too an no need be put rightbe always right  tom laughed at this  its not easy to answer that question mafuta  we have surrounded ourselves with a lot of wants some of which are right and some wrong for instance we want clothes and houses and books and tobacco and hundreds of other things which cost a great deal of money and in order to make the money we must work late and early which hurts our health and many of us must sit all day instead of walk or ride so that we get ill and require a change of life such as a trip to africa to shoot lions else we should die too soon  in fact most of our lives consists in a perpetual struggle between healthy constitutions and false modes of living  dat berry foolish said mafuta shaking his head  me onderstan dat baccy good berry good bot what de use of cloes why you not go nakit spose cause you not black eh  well not exactly  the fact is  at this point the conversation was interrupted by the low murmuring growl of the lion  the two men gazed at one another earnestly and listened  tom quietly laid his hand on his rifle which always lay ready loaded at his side and mafuta grasped the handle of the knife that hung at his girdle  for some minutes they remained silent and motionless waiting for a repetition of the sound while the campfire glittered brightly lighting up the expressive countenance of our hero and causing the whites of mafutas eyes to glisten  again they heard the growl much nearer than before and it became evident that the lion was intent on claiming hospitality  the horses pricked up their ears snuffed the night air wildly and showed every symptom of being ill at ease  tom brown without rising slowly cocked his rifle and mafuta drawing his knife showed his brilliant white teeth as if he had been a dog  gradually and stealthily the king of the forest drew near muttering to himself as it were in an undertone  he evidently did not care to disturb the horses having set his heart upon the meat which hung on the tree and the anxious listeners in the tent heard him attempting to claw it down  tom brown was hastily revolving in his mind the best mode of killing or scaring away this presumptuous visitor when the lion in its wanderings round the tree tripped over one of the lines of the tent causing it to vibrate  he uttered a growl of dissatisfaction and seized the cord in his teeth  look out mafuta exclaimed tom as he observed the shadow of the beast against the curtain  he fired as he spoke  a terrific roar followed the canvas was instantly torn open and the whole tent fell in dire confusion on the top of its inmates  tom brown did not move  he always acted on the principle of letting well alone and feeling that he was unhurt lay as still as a mouse but mafuta uttered a wild yell sprang through the rent canvas and bounded up the tree in violent haste  there he remained and tom lay quietly under the tent for full ten minutes without moving almost without breathing but as no sound was heard our hero at last ventured to raise his head  then he got slowly upon his knees and gently removing the incumbent folds of canvas looked out  the sight that he beheld was satisfactory  an enormous lion lay stretched out at the font of the tree quite dead  his half random shot at the shadow had been most successful having passed right through the lions heart    not long after this tom brown reached the settlements where he found the major and wilkins who had quite recovered from the effects of their excursion into the interior and from whom he learned that a party had been sent off in search of himself  thereafter he went to the cape where he joined his father in business he did not however give up hunting entirely for he belonged to a family which as we have said elsewhere is so sternly romantic and full of animal life that many of its members are led to attempt and to accomplish great things both in the spiritual and physical worlds undamped by repeated rebuffs and failures  moreover he did not forget his resolutions or his bible after he got well but we are bound to add that he did forget his resolve never again to visit the african wilderness for if report speaks truth he was seen there many a time in after years with mafuta hunting the lions  the end
