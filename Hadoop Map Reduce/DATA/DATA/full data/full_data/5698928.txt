words and acts to thee however ill that i whateer i say or be may serve thee still  o let my thoughts abide in thee lest i should fall show me thyself in all i see thou lord of all   lo in thine honest eyes i read   lo in thine honest eyes i read the auspicious beacon that shall lead after long sailing in deep seas to quiet havens in june ease  thy voice sings like an inland bird first by the seaworn sailor heard and like road sheltered from lifes sea thine honest heart is unto me   though deep indifference should drowse   though deep indifference should drowse the sluggish life beneath my brows and all the external things i see grow snowshowers in the street to me yet inmost in my stormy sense thy looks shall be an influence  though other loves may come and go and long years sever us below shall the thin ice that grows above freeze the deep centrewell of love no still below light amours thou shalt rule me as thou rulst me now  year following year shall only set fresh gems upon thy coronet and time grown lover shall delight to beautify thee in my sight and thou shalt ever rule in me crowned with the light of memory   my heart when first the blackbird sings   my heart when first the blackbird sings my heart drinks in the song cool pleasure fills my bosom through and spreads each nerve along  my bosom eddies quietly my heart is stirred and cool as when a windmoved briar sweeps a stone into a pool  but unto thee when thee i meet my pulses thicken fast as when the maddened lake grows black and ruffles in the blast   i dreamed of forest alleys fair   i  i dreamed of forest alleys fair and fields of grayflowered grass where by the yellow summer moon my jenny seemed to pass  i dreamed the yellow summer moon behind a cedar wood lay white on fields of rippling grass where i and jenny stood  i dreamed  but fallen through my dream in a rainy land i lie where wan wet morning crowns the hills of grim reality  ii  i am as one that keeps awake all night in the month of june that lies awake in bed to watch the trees and great white moon  for memories of love are more than the white moon there above and dearer than quiet moonshine are the thoughts of her i love  iii  last night i lingered long without my last of loves to see alas the moonwhite windowpanes stared blindly back on me  today i hold her very hand her very waist embrace  like clouds across a pool i read her thoughts upon her face  and yet as now through her clear eyes i seek the inner shrine  i stoop to read her virgin heart in doubt if it be mine   o looking long and fondly thus what vision should i see no vision but my own white face that grins and mimics me  iv  once more upon the same old seat in the same sunshiny weather the elmtrees shadows at their feet and foliage move together  the shadows shift upon the grass the dial point creeps on the clear sun shines the loiterers pass as then they passed and shone  but now deep sleep is on my heart deep sleep and perfect rest hopes flutterings now disturb no more the quiet of my breast   st martins summer   as swallows turning backward when halfway oer the sea at one words trumpet summons they came again to me  the hopes i had forgotten came back again to me  i know not which to credit o lady of my heart your eyes that bade me linger your words that bade us part  i know not which to credit my reason or my heart  but be my hopes rewarded or be they but in vain i have dreamed a golden vision i have gathered in the grain  i have dreamed a golden vision i have not lived in vain   dedication   my first gift and my last to you i dedicate this fascicle of songs  the only wealth i have just as they are to you  i speak the truth in soberness and say i had rather bring a light to your clear eyes had rather hear you praise this bosomful of songs  than that the whole hard world with one consent in one continuous chorus of applause poured forth for me and mine the homage of ripe praise  i write the finis here against my love this is my loves last epitaph and tomb here the road forks and i go my way far from yours   the old chimaeras old receipts   the old chimaeras old receipts for making happy land the old political beliefs swam close before my hand  the grand old communistic myths in a middle state of grace quite dead but not yet gone to hell and walking for a space  quite dead and looking it and yet all eagerness to show the socialcontract forgeries by chatterton  rousseau   a hundred such as these i tried and hundreds after that i fitted social theories as one would fit a hat  full many a marshfire lured me on i reached at many a star i reached and grasped them and behold  the stump of a cigar  all through the sultry sweltering day the sweat ran down my brow the still plains heard my distant strokes that have been silenced now  this way and that now up now down i hailed full many a blow alas beneath my weary arm the thicket seemed to grow  i take the lesson wipe my brow and throw my axe aside and sorely wearied i go home in the tranquil eventide  and soon the rising moon that lights the eve of my defeat shall see me sitting as of yore by my old masters feet   prelude   by sunny marketplace and street wherever i go my drum i beat and wherever i go in my coat of red the ribbons flutter about my head  i seek recruits for wars to come  for slaughterless wars i beat the drum and the shilling i give to each new ally is hope to live and courage to die  i know that new recruits shall come wherever i beat the sounding drum till the roar of the march by country and town shall shake the tottering dagons down  for i was objectless as they and loitering idly day by day but whenever i heard the recruiters come i left my all to follow the drum   the vanquished knight   i have left all upon the shameful field honour and hope my god and all but life spurless with sword reversed and dinted shield degraded and disgraced i leave the strife  from him that hath not shall there not be taken een that he hath when he deserts the strife life left by all lifes benefits forsaken o keep the promise lord and take the life   to the commissioners of northern lights   i send to you commissioners a paper that may please ye sirs for troth they say it might be worse an i believet and on your business lay my curse before i leavt  i thocht id serve wi you sirs yince but ive thocht better of it since the maitter i will nowise mince but tell ye true ill service wi some ither prince an no wi you  ive no been very deep yell think cam delicately to the brink an when the water gart me shrink straucht took the rue an didna stoop my fill to drink  i own it true  i kent on cape and isle a light burnt fair an clearly ilka night but at the service i took fright as sunes i saw an being still a neophite gaed straucht awa  anither course i now begin the weeg ill cairry for my sin the court my voice shall echo in an  wha can tell  some ither day i may be yin o you mysel   the relic taken what avails the shrine   the relic taken what avails the shrine the locket pictureless  o heart of mine art thou not worse than that still warm a vacant nest where love once sat  her image nestled closer at my heart than cherished memories healed every smart and warmed it more than wine or the full summer sun in noonday shine  this was the little weather gleam that lit the cloudy promontories  the real charm was that gilded hills and woods and walked beside me thro the solitudes  the sun is set  my heart is widowed now of that companionthought  alone i plough the seas of life and trace a separate furrow far from her and grace   about the sheltered garden ground   about the sheltered garden ground the trees stand strangely still the vale neer seemed so deep before nor yet so high the hill  an awful sense of quietness a fulness of repose breathes from the dewy gardenlawns the silent garden rows  as the hoofbeats of a troop of horse heard far across a plain a nearer knowledge of great thoughts thrills vaguely through my brain  i lean my head upon my arm my hearts too full to think like the roar of seas upon my heart doth the morning stillness sink   after reading antony and cleopatra   as when the hunt by holt and field drives on with horn and strife hunger of hopeless things pursues our spirits throughout life  the seas roar fills us aching full of objectless desire  the seas roar and the white moonshine and the reddening of the fire  who talks to me of reason now it would be more delight to have died in cleopatras arms than be alive tonight   i know not how but as i count   i know not how but as i count the beads of former years old laughter catches in my throat with the very feel of tears   spring song   the air was full of sun and birds the fresh air sparkled clearly remembrance wakened in my heart and i knew i loved her dearly  the fallows and the leafless trees and all my spirit tingled my earliest thought of love and springs first puff of perfume mingled  in my still heart the thoughts awoke came lone by lone together  say birds and sun and spring is love a mere affair of weather   the summer sun shone round me   the summer sun shone round me the folded valley lay in a stream of sun and odour that sultry summer day  the tall trees stood in the sunlight as still as still could be but the deep grass sighed and rustled and bowed and beckoned me  the deep grass moved and whispered and bowed and brushed my face it whispered in the sunshine the winter comes apace   you looked so tempting in the pew   you looked so tempting in the pew you looked so sly and calm  my trembling fingers played with yours as both looked out the psalm  your heart beat hard against my arm my foot to yours was set your loosened ringlet burned my cheek whenever they two met  o little little we hearkened dear and little little cared although the parson sermonised the congregation stared   loves vicissitudes   as love and hope together walk by me for a while linkarmed the ways they travel for many a pleasant mile  linkarmed and dumb they travel they sing not but they smile  hope leaving love commences to practise on the lute and as he sings and travels with lingering laggard foot despair plays obligato the sentimental flute  until in singing garments comes royally at call  comes limberhipped indiffrence free stepping straight and tall  comes singing and lamenting the sweetest pipe of all   duddingstone   with caws and chirrupings the woods in this thin sun rejoice the psalm seems but the little kirk that sings with its own voice  the cloudrifts share their amber light with the surface of the mere  i think the very stones are glad to feel each other near  once more my whole heart leaps and swells and gushes oer with glee the fingers of the sun and shade touch music stops in me  now fancy paints that bygone day when you were here my fair  the whole lake rang with rapid skates in the windless winter air  you leaned to me i leaned to you our course was smooth as flight  we steered  a heeltouch to the left a heeltouch to the right  we swung our way through flying men your hand lay fast in mine we saw the shifting crowd dispart the level icereach shine  i swear by yon swantravelled lake by yon calm hill above i swear had we been drowned that day we had been drowned in love   stout marches lead to certain ends   stout marches lead to certain ends we seek no holy grail my friends  that dawn should find us every day some fraction farther on our way  the dumb lands sleep from east to west they stretch and turn and take their rest the cock has crown in the steadingyard but priest and people slumber hard  we two are early forth and hear the nations snoring far and near so peacefully their rest they take it seems we are the first awake   strong heart this is no royal way a thousand crossroads seek the day and hid from us to left and right a thousand seekers seek the light   away with funeral music   away with funeral music  set the pipe to powerful lips  the cup of lifes for him that drinks and not for him that sips   to sydney   not thine where marblestill and white old statues share the tempered light and mock the uneven modern flight but in the stream of daily sorrow and delight to seek a theme  i too o friend have steeled my heart boldly to choose the better part to leave the beaten ways of art and wholly free to dare beyond the scanty chart the deeper sea  all vain restrictions left behind frail bark i loose my anchored mind and large before the prosperous wind desert the strand  a new columbus sworn to find the morning land  nor too ambitious friend  to thee i own my weakness  not for me to sing the enfranchised nations glee or count the cost of warships foundered far at sea and battles lost  high on the farseen sunny hills morningcontent my bosom fills wellpleased i trace the wandering rills and learn their birth far off the clash of sovereign wills may shake the earth  the nimble circuit of the wheel the uncertain poise of merchant weal heaven of famine fire and steel when nations fall these heedful from afar i feel  i mark them all  but not my friend not these i sing my voice shall fill a narrower ring tired souls that flag upon the wing i seek to cheer brave wines to strengthen hope i bring lifes cantineer  some song that shall be suppling oil to weary muscles strained with toil shall hearten for the daily moil or widely read make sweet for him that tills the soil his daily bread  such songs in my flushed hours i dream high thought instead of armour gleam or warrior cantos ream by ream to load the shelves  songs with a lilt of words that seem to sing themselves   had i the power that have the will   had i the power that have the will the enfeebled will  a modern curse  this book of mine should blossom still a perfect gardenground of verse  white placid marble gods should keep good watch in every shadowy lawn and from clean easybreathing sleep the birds should waken me at dawn   a fairy garden  none the less throughout these gracious paths of mine all day there should be free access for stricken hearts and lives that pine  and by the folded lawns all day  no idle gods for such a land  all active love should take its way with active labour hand in hand   o dull cold northern sky   o dull cold northern sky o brawling sabbath bells o feebly twittering autumn bird that tells the year is like to die  o still spoiled trees o city ways o sun desired in vain o dread presentiment of coming rain that cloys the sullen days  thee heart of mine i greet in what hard mountain pass strivst thou  in what importunate morass sink now thy weary feet  thou runst a hopeless race to win despair  no crown awaits success but leaden gods look down on thee with evil face  and those that would befriend and cherish thy defeat with angry welcome shall turn sour the sweet homecoming of the end  yea those that offer praise to idleness shall yet insult thee coming glorious in the sweat of honourable ways   apologetic postscript of a year later   if you see this song my dear and last years toast im confoundedly in fear youll be serious and severe about the boast  blame not that i sought such aid to cure regret i was then so lowly laid i used all the gasconnade that i could get  being snubbed is somewhat smart believe my sweet and i needed all my art to restore my broken heart to its conceit  come and smile dear and forget i boasted so i apologise  regret  it was all a jest  and  yet  i do not know   to marcus   you have been far and i been farther yet since last in foul or fair an impecunious pair below this northern sky of ours we met  now winter night shall see again us two while howls the tempest higher sit warmly by the fire and dream and plan as we were wont to do  and hand in hand at large our thoughts shall walk while storm and gusty rain again and yet again shall drive their noisy charge across the talk  the pleasant future still shall smile to me and hope with wooing hands wave on to fairy lands all over dale and hill and earth and sea  and you who doubt the sky and fear the sun  you  christian with the pack  you shall not wander back for i am hopeful  i will cheer you on  come  where the great have trod the great shall lead  come elbow through the press pluck fortune by the dress  by god we must  by god we shall succeed   to ottilie   you remember i suppose how the august sun arose and how his face woke to trill and carolette all the cages that were set about the place  in the tender morning light all around lay strange and bright and still and sweet and the gray doves unafraid went their morning promenade along the street   this gloomy northern day   this gloomy northern day or this yet gloomier night has moved a something high in my cold heart and i that do not often pray would pray tonight  and first on thee i call for bread o god of might enough of bread for all  that through the famished town cold hunger may lie down with none tonight  i pray for hope no less strongsinewed hope o lord that to the struggling young may preach with brazen tongue stout labour high success and bright reward  and last o lord i pray for hearts resigned and bold to trudge the dusty way  hearts stored with song and joke and warmer than a cloak against the cold  if nothing else he had he who has this has all this comforts under pain this through the stinging rain keeps ragamuffin glad behind the wall  this makes the sanded inn a palace for a prince and this when griefs begin and cruel fate annoys can bring to mind the joys of ages since   the wind is without there and howls in the trees   the wind is without there and howls in the trees and the rainflurries drum on the glass alone by the fireside with elbows on knees i can number the hours as they pass yet now when to cheer me the crickets begin and my pipe is just happily lit believe me my friend tho the evening draws in that not all uncontested i sit  alone did i say  o no nowise alone with the past sitting warm on my knee to gossip of days that are over and gone but still charming to her and to me with much to be glad of and much to deplore yet as these days with those we compare believe me my friend tho the sorrows seem more they are somehow more easy to bear  and thou faded future uncertain and frail as i cherish thy light in each draught his lamp is not more to the miner  their sail is not more to the crew on the raft for hope can make feeble ones earnest and brave and as forth thro the years i look on believe me my friend between this and the grave i see wonderful things to be done  to do or to try and believe me my friend if the call should come early for me i can leave these foundations uprooted and tend for some new city over the sea to do or to try and if failure be mine and if fortune go cross to my plan believe me my friend tho i mourn the design i shall never lament for the man   a valentines song   motley i count the only wear that suits in this mixed world the truly wise who boldly smile upon despair and shake their bells in grandam grundys eyes singers should sing with such a goodly cheer that the bare listening should make strong like wine at this unruly time of year the feast of valentine  we do not now parade our oughts and shoulds and motives and beliefs in god their life lies all indoors sad thoughts must keep the house while gay thoughts go abroad within we hold the wake for hopes deceased but in the public streets in wind or sun keep open at the annual feast the puppetbooth of fun  our powers perhaps are small to please but even negrosongs and castanettes old jokes and hackneyed repartees are more than the parade of vain regrets let jacques stand werthering by the wounded deer  we shall make merry honest friends of mine at this unruly time of year the feast of valentine  i know how day by weary day hope fades love fades a thousand pleasures fade i have not trudged in vain that way on which lifes daylight darkens shade by shade and still with hopes decreasing griefs increased still with what wit i have shall i for one keep open at the annual feast the puppetbooth of fun  i care not if the wit be poor the old worn motley stained with rain and tears if but the courage still endure that filled and strengthened hope in earlier years if still with friends averted fate severe a glad untainted cheerfulness be mine to greet the unruly time of year the feast of valentine  priest i am none of thine and see in the perspective of still hopeful youth that truth shall triumph over thee  truth to ones self  i know no other truth i see strange days for thee and thine o priest and how your doctrines fallen one by one shall furnish at the annual feast the puppetbooth of fun  stand on your putrid ruins  stand white neckclothed bigot fixedly the same cruel with all things but the hand inquisitor in all things but the name back minister of christ and source of fear  we cherish freedom  back with thee and thine from this unruly time of year the feast of valentine  blood thou mayest spare but what of tears but what of riven households broken faith  bywords that cling through all mens years and drag them surely down to shame and death stand back o cruel man o foe of youth and let such men as hearken not thy voice press freely up the road to truth the kings highway of choice   hail childish slaves of social rules   hail  childish slaves of social rules you had yourselves a hand in making how i could shake your faith ye fools if but i thought it worth the shaking i see and pity you and then go casting off the idle pity in search of better braver men my own way freely through the city  my own way freely and not yours and careless of a towns abusing seek real friendship that endures among the friends of my own choosing ill choose my friends myself do you hear and wont let mrs grundy do it tho all i honour and hold dear and all i hope should move me to it  i take my old coat from the shelf  i am a man of little breeding and only dress to please myself  i own a very strange proceeding i smoke a pipe abroad because to all cigars i much prefer it and as i scorn your social laws my choice has nothing to deter it  gladly i trudge the footpath way while you and yours roll by in coaches in all the pride of fine array through all the citys thronged approaches o fine religious decent folk in virtues flaunting gold and scarlet i sneer between two puffs of smoke  give me the publican and harlot  ye daintyspoken stiff severe seed of the migrated philistian one whispered question in your ear  pray what was christ if you be christian if christ were only here just now among the citys wynds and gables teaching the life he taught us how would he be welcome to your tables  i go and leave your logicstraws your formerfriends with face averted your petty ways and narrow laws your grundy and your god deserted from your frail ark of lies i flee i know not where like noahs raven full to the broad unsounded sea i swim from your dishonest haven  alone on that unsounded deep poor waif it may be i shall perish far from the course i thought to keep far from the friends i hoped to cherish it may be that i shall sink and yet hear thro all taunt and scornful laughter through all defeat and all regret the stronger swimmers coming after   swallows travel to and fro   swallows travel to and fro and the great winds come and go and the steady breezes blow bearing perfume bearing love breezes hasten swallows fly towered clouds forever ply and at noonday you and i see the same sunshine above  dew and rain fall everywhere harvests ripen flowers are fair and the whole round earth is bare to the moonshine and the sun and the live air fanned with wings bright with breeze and sunshine brings into contact distant things and makes all the countries one  let us wander where we will something kindred greets us still something seen on vale or hill falls familiar on the heart so at scent or sound or sight severed souls by day and night tremble with the same delight  tremble half the world apart    to mesdames zassetsky and garschine   the wind may blaw the leegang way and aye the lift be mirk an gray an deep the moss and steigh the brae where a maun gang  theres still an hoor in ilka day for luve and sang  and canty hearts are strangely steeled by some dikeside theyll find a bield some couthy neuk by muir or field theyre sure to hit where frae the blatherin wind concealed theyll rest a bit  an weel for them if kindly fate send ower the hills to them a mate theyll crack a while o kirk an state o yowes an rain an when its time to take the gate tak ilk his ain   sic neuk beside the southern sea i soucht  sic place o quiet lee frae

ower early maun i rise an quit this happy lee   to madame garschine   what is the face the fairest face till care till care the graver  care with cunning hand etches content thereon and makes it fair or constancy and love and makes it grand   music at the villa marina   for some abiding central source of power strongsmitten steady chords ye seem to flow and flowing carry virtue  far below the vain tumultuous passions of the hour fleet fast and disappear and as the sun shines on the wake of tempests there is cast oer all the shattered ruins of my past a strong contentment as of battles won  and yet i cry in anguish as i hear the long drawn pageant of your passage roll magnificently forth into the night to yon fair land ye come from to yon sphere of strength and love where now ye shape your flight o even wings of music bear my soul  ye have the power if but ye had the will strongsmitten steady chords in sequence grand to bear me forth into that tranquil land where good is no more ravelled up with ill where she and i remote upon some hill or by some quiet rivers windless strand may live and love and wander hand in hand and follow nature simply and be still  from this grim world where sadly prisoned we sit bound with others heartstrings as with chains and if one moves all suffer  to that goal if such a land if such a sphere there be thither from life and all lifes joys and pains o even wings of music bear my soul   fear not dear friend but freely live your days   fear not dear friend but freely live your days though lesser lives should suffer  such am i a lesser life that what is his of sky gladly would give for you and what of praise step without trouble down the sunlit ways we that have touched your raiment are made whole from all the selfish cankers of mans soul and we would see you happy dear or die therefore be brave and therefore dear be free try all things resolutely till the best out of all lesser betters you shall find and we who have learned greatness from you we your lovers with a still contented mind see you well anchored in some port of rest   let love go if go she will   let love go if go she will seek not o fool her wanton flight to stay of all she gives and takes away the best remains behind her still  the best remains behind in vain joy she may give and take again joy she may take and leave us pain if yet she leave behind the constant mind to meet all fortunes nobly to endure all things with a good heart and still be pure still to be foremost in the foremost cause and still be worthy of the love that was love coming is omnipotent indeed but not love going  let her go  the seed springs in the favouring summer air and grows and waxes strong and when the summer goes remains a perfect tree  joy she may give and take again joy she may take and leave us pain o love and what care we for one thing thou hast given o love one thing is ours that nothing can remove and as the king discrowned is still a king the unhappy lover still preserves his love   i do not fear to own me kin   i do not fear to own me kin to the glad clods in which spring flowers begin or to my brothers the great trees that speak with pleasant voices in the breeze loud talkers with the winds that pass or to my sister the deep grass  of such i am of such my body is that thrills to reach its lips to kiss that gives and takes with wind and sun and rain and feels keen pleasure to the point of pain  of such are these the brotherhood of stalwart trees the humble family of flowers that make a light of shadowy bowers or star the edges of the bent they give and take sweet colour and sweet scent they joy to shed themselves abroad and tree and flower and grass and sod thrill and leap and live and sing with silent voices in the spring  hence i not fear to yield my breath since all is still unchanged by death since in some pleasant valley i may be clod beside clod or tree by tree long ages hence with her i love this hour and feel a lively joy to share with her the sun and rain and air to taste her quiet neighbourhood as the dumb things of field and wood the clod the tree and starry flower alone of all things have the power   i am like one that for long days had sate   i am like one that for long days had sate with seaward eyes set keen against the gale on some lone foreland watching sail by sail the portbound ships for one ship that was late and sail by sail his heart burned up with joy and cruelly was quenched until at last one ship the lookedfor pennant at its mast bore gaily and dropt safely past the buoy and lo the loved one was not there  was dead then would he watch no more no more the sea with myriad vessels sail by sail perplex his eyes and mock his longing  weary head take now thy rest eyes close for no more me shall hopes untried elate or ruined vex  for thus on love i waited thus for love strained all my senses eagerly and long thus for her coming ever trimmed my song till in the far skies coloured as a dove a bird goldcoloured flickered far and fled over the pathless waterwaste for me and with spread hands i watched the bright bird flee and waited till before me she dropped dead o golden bird in these dovecoloured skies how long i sought how long with wearied eyes i sought o bird the promise of thy flight and now the morn has dawned the morn has died the day has come and gone and once more night about my lone life settles wild and wide   voluntary   here in the quiet eve my thankful eyes receive the quiet light i see the trees stand fair against the faded air and star by star prepare the perfect night  and in my bosom lo content and quiet grow toward perfect peace and now when day is done brief day of wind and sun the pure stars one by one their troop increase  keen pleasure and keen grief give place to great relief farewell my tears still sounds toward me float i hear the birds small note sheep from the far sheepcote and lowing steers  for lo the war is done lo now the battle won the trumpets still the shepherds slender strain the country sounds again awake in wood and plain on haugh and hill  loud wars and loud loves cease i welcome my release and hail once more free foot and way worldwide and oft at eventide light love to talk beside the hostel door   on now although the year be done   on now although the year be done now although the love be dead dead and gone hear me o loved and cherished one give me still the hand that led led me on   in the green and gallant spring   in the green and gallant spring love and the lyre i thought to sing and kisses sweet to give and take by the flowery hawthorn brake  now is russet autumn here death and the grave and winter drear and i must ponder here aloof while the rain is on the roof   death to the dead for evermore   death to the dead for evermore a king a god the last the best of friends  wheneer this mortal journey ends death like a host comes smiling to the door smiling he greets us on that tranquil shore where neither piping bird nor peeping dawn disturbs the eternal sleep but in the stillness far withdrawn our dreamless rest for evermore we keep  for as from open windows forth we peep upon the

wandered all night long in a perplexed forest comes at length in the first hours about the matin song and when the sun uprises in his strength to the fringed margin of the wood and sees gazing afar before him many a mile of falling country many fields and trees and cities and bright streams and faroff oceans smile  i o melampus halting stand at gaze i liberated look abroad on life love and distress and dusty travelling ways the steersmans helm the surgeons helpful knife on the lone ploughmans earthupturning share the revelry of cities and the sound of seas and mountaintops aloof in air and of the circling earth the unsupported round  i looking wonder i intent adore and o melampus reaching forth my hands in adoration cry aloud and soar in spirit high above the supine lands and the low caves of mortal things and flee to the last fields of the universe untrod where is no man nor any earth nor sea and the contented soul is all alone with god   strange are the ways of men   strange are the ways of men and strange the ways of god we tread the mazy paths that all our fathers trod  we tread them undismayed and undismayed behold the portents of the sky the things that were of old  the fiery stars pursue their course in heavn on high and round the leaguered town cresttossing heroes cry  cresttossing heroes cry and martial fifes declare how small to mortal minds is merely mortal care  and to the clang of steel and cry of piercing flute upon the azure peaks a god shall plant his foot  a god in arms shall stand and seeing wide and far the green and golden earth the killing tide of war  he with uplifted arm shall to the skies proclaim the gleeful fate of man the noble road to fame   the wind blew shrill and smart   the wind blew shrill and smart and the wind awoke my heart again to go asailing oer the sea to hear the cordage moan and the straining timbers groan and to see the flying pennon lie alee  o sailor of the fleet it is time to stir the feet its time to man the dingy and to row its lay your hand in mine and its empty down the wine and its drain a health to death before we go  to death my lads we sail and its death that blows the gale and death that holds the tiller as we ride for hes the king of all in the tempest and the squall and the ruler of the ocean wild and wide   man sails the deep awhile   man sails the deep awhile loud runs the roaring tide the seas are wild and wide oer many a salt oer many a desert mile the unchained breakers ride the quivering stars beguile  hope bears the sole command hope with unshaken eyes sees flaw and storm arise hope the good steersman with unwearying hand steers under changing skies unchanged toward the land  o wind that bravely blows o hope that sails with all where stars and voices call o ship undaunted that forever goes where god her admiral his battle signal shows  what though the seas and wind far on the deep should whelm colours and sails and helm there too you touch that port that you designed  there in the midseas realm shall you that haven find  well hast thou sailed now die to die is not to sleep still your true course you keep o sailor soul still sailing for the sky and fifty fathom deep your colours still shall fly   the cocks clear voice into the clearer air   the cocks clear voice into the clearer air where westward far i roam mounts with a thrill of hope falls with a sigh of home  a rural sentry he from farm and field the coming morn descries and mankinds bugler wakes the camp of enterprise  he sings the morn upon the westward hills strange and remote and wild he sings it in the land where once i was a child  he brings to me dear voices of the past the old land and the years my father calls for me my weeping spirit hears  fife fife into the golden air o bird and sing the morning in for the old days are past and new days begin   now when the number of my years   now when the number of my years is all fulfilled and i from sedentary life shall rouse me up to die bury me low and let me lie under the wide and starry sky joying to live i joyed to die bury me low and let me lie  clear was my soul my deeds were free honour was called my name i fell not back from fear nor followed after fame bury me low and let me lie under the wide and starry sky joying to live i joyed to die bury me low and let me lie  bury me low in valleys green and where the milder breeze blows fresh along the stream sings roundly in the trees  bury me low and let me lie under the wide and starry sky joying to live i joyed to die bury me low and let me lie   what man may learn what man may do   what man may learn what man may do of right or wrong of false or true while skipperlike his course he steers through nine and twenty mingled years half misconceived and half forgot so much i know and practise not  old are the words of wisdom old the counsels of the wise and bold to close the ears to check the tongue to keep the pining spirit young to act the right to say the true and to be kind whateer you do  thus we across the modern stage follow the wise of every age and as oaks grow and rivers run unchanged in the unchanging sun so the eternal march of man goes forth on an eternal plan   small is the trust when love is green   small is the trust when love is green in sap of early years a little thing steps in between and kisses turn to tears  awhile  and see how love be grown in loveliness and power awhile it loves the sweets alone but next it loves the sour  a little love is none at all that wanders or that fears a hearty love dwells still at call to kisses or to tears  such then be mine my love to give and such be yours to take a faith to hold a life to live for lovingkindness sake  should you be sad should you be gay or should you prove unkind a love to hold the growing way and keep the helping mind  a love to turn the laugh on care when wrinkled care appears and with an equal will to share your losses and your tears   know you the river near to grez   know you the river near to grez a river deep and clear among the lilies all the way that ancient river runs today from snowy weir to weir  old as the rhine of great renown she hurries clear and fast she runs amain by field and town from south to north from up to down to present on from past  the love i hold was borne by her and now though far away my lonely spirit hears the stir of water round the starling spur beside the bridge at grez  so may that love forever hold in life an equal pace so may that love grow never old but clear and pure and fountaincold go on from grace to grace   its forth across the roaring foam   its forth across the roaring foam and on towards the west its many a lonely league from home oer many a mountain crest from where the dogs of scotland call the sheep around the fold to where the flags are flying beside the gates of gold  where all the deepsea galleons ride that come to bring the corn where falls the fog at eventide and blows the breeze at morn its there that i was sick and sad alone and poor and cold in yon distressful city beside the gates of gold  i slept as one that nothing knows but far along my way before the morning god rose and planned the coming day afar before me forth he went as through the sands of old and chose the friends to help me beside the gates of gold  i have been near i have been far my backs been at the wall yet aye and ever shone the star to guide me through it all the love of god the help of man they both shall make me bold against the gates of darkness as beside the gates of gold   an english breeze   up with the sun the breeze arose across the talking corn she goes and smooth she rustles far and wide through all the voiceful countryside  through all the land her tale she tells she spins she tosses she compels the kites the clouds the windmill sails and all the trees in all the dales  god calls us and the day prepares with nimble gay and gracious airs and from penzance to maidenhead the roads last night he watered  god calls us from inglorious ease forth and to travel with the breeze while swift and singing smooth and strong she gallops by the fields along   as in their flight the birds of song   as in their flight the birds of song halt here and there in sweet and sunny dales but halt not overlong the time one rural song to sing they pause then following bounteous gales steer forward on the wing sunservers they from first to last upon the sun they wait to ride the sailing blast  so he awhile in our contested state awhile abode not longer for his sun  mother we say no tenderer name we know  with whose diviner glow his early days had shone now to withdraw her radiance had begun or lest a wrong i say not she withdrew but the loud stream of men day after day and great dust columns of the common way between them grew and grew and he and she for evermore might yearn but to the spring the rivulets not return nor to the bosom comes the child again  and he o may we fancy so he feeling time forever flow and flowing bear him forth and far away from that dear ingle where his life began and all his treasure lay  he waxing into man and ever farther ever closer wound in this obstreperous worlds ignoble round from that poor prospect turned his face away   the piper   again i hear you piping for i know the tune so well  you rouse the heart to wander and be free tho where you learned your music not the god of song can tell for you pipe the open highway and the sea o piper lightly footing lightly piping on your way tho your music thrills and pierces far and near i tell you you had better pipe to someone else today for you cannot pipe my fancy from my dear  you sound the note of travel through the hamlet and the town you would lure the holy angels from on high and not a man can hear you but he throws the hammer down and is off to see the countries ere he die but now no more i wander now unchanging here i stay by my love you find me safely sitting here and pipe you neer so sweetly till you pipe the hills away you can never pipe my fancy from my dear   to mrs  macmarland   in schnee der alpen  so it runs to those divine accords  and here we dwell in alpine snows and suns a motley crew for half the year a motley crew we dwell to taste  a shivering band in hope and fear  that sun upon the snowy waste that alpine ether cold and clear  up from the laboured plains and up from low sealevels we arise to drink of that diviner cup the rarer air the clearer skies for as the great old godly king from mankinds turbid valley cries so all we mountainlovers sing i to the hills will lift mine eyes  the bells that ring the peaks that climb the frozen snows unbroken curd might yet revindicate in rhyme the pauseless stream the absent bird in vain  for to the deeps of life you lady you my heart have stirred and since you say you love my life be sure i love you for the word  of kindness here i nothing say  such loveless kindnesses there are in that grimacing common way that old unhonoured social war love but my dog and love my love adore with me a common star  i value not the rest above the ashes of a bad cigar   to miss cornish   they tell me lady that today on that unknown australian strand  some time ago so far away  another lady joined the band she joined the company of those lovelily dowered nobly planned who smiling still forgive their foes and keep their friends in close command  she lady as i learn was one among the many rarely good and destined still to be a sun through every dark and rainy mood she as they told me far had come by sea and land oer many a rood admired by all beloved by some she was yourself i understood  but compliment apart and free from all constraint of verses may goodness and honour grace and glee attend you ever on your way  up to the measure of your will beyond all power of mine to say  as she and i desire you still miss cornish on your natal day   tales of arabia   yes friend i own these tales of arabia smile not as smiled their flawless originals ageold but yet untamed for ages pass and the magic is undiminished  thus friend the tales of the old camaralzaman ayoub the slave of love or the calendars blindeyed and illstarred royal scions charm us in age as they charmed in childhood  fair ones beyond all numerability beam from the palace beam on humanity brighteyed in truth yet soulless houris offering pleasure and only pleasure  thus they the venal muses arabian unlike indeed the nobler divinities greek gods or old timehonoured muses easily proffer unloved caresses  lost lost the man who mindeth the minstrelsy since still in sandy glittering pleasances cold stony fruits gemlike but quite in edible flatter and wholly starve him   behold as goblins dark of mien   behold as goblins dark of mien and portly tyrants dyed with crime change in the transformation scene at christmas in the pantomime  instanter at the prompters cough the fairy bonnets them and they throw their abhorred carbuncles off and blossom like the flowers in may   so mankind to angelic eyes so through the scenes of life below in lifes ironical disguise a travesty of man ye go  but fear not ere the curtain fall death in the transformation scene steps forward from her pedestal apparent as the fairy queen  and coming frees you in a trice from all your lendings  lust of fame ungainly virtue ugly vice terror and tyranny and shame  so each at last himself for good in that dear country lays him down at last beloved and understood and pure in feature and renown   still i love to rhyme   still i love to rhyme and still more

all the tales men hear us tell still let the unfathomed ocean swell or shallower forest sound abroad below the lonely stars of god in all let something still be done still in a corner shine the sun slimankled maids be fleet of foot nor man disown the rural flute still let the hero from the start in honest sweat and beats of heart push on along the untrodden road for some inviolate abode still o beloved let me hear the great bell beating far and near the odd unknown enchanted gong that on the road hales men along that from the mountain calls afar that lures a vessel from a star and with a still aerial sound makes all the earth enchanted ground love and the love of life and act dance live and sing through all our furrowed tract till the great god enamoured gives to him who reads to him who lives that rare and fair romantic strain that whoso hears must hear again   since years ago for evermore   since years ago for evermore my cedar ship i drew to shore and to the road and riverbed and the green nodding reeds i said mine ignorant and last farewell now with content at home i dwell and now divide my sluggish life betwixt my verses and my wife in vain for when the lamp is lit and by the laughing fire i sit still with the tattered atlas spread interminable roads i tread   envoy for a childs garden of verses   whether upon the garden seat you lounge with your uplifted feet under the mays whole heaven of blue or whether on the sofa you no grown up person being by do some soft corner occupy take you this volume in your hands and enter into other lands for lo as children feign suppose you hunting in the garden rows or in the lumbered attic or the cellar  a nailstudded door and dark descending stairway found that led to kingdoms underground there standing you should hear with ease strange birds asinging or the trees swing in big robber woods or bells on many fairy citadels  there passing through a step or so  neither mamma nor nurse need know from your nice nurseries you would pass like alice through the lookingglass or gerda following little ray to wondrous countries far away well and just so this volume can transport each little maid or man presto from where they live away where other children used to play as from the house your mother sees you playing round the garden trees so you may see if you but look through the windows of this book another child far far away and in another garden play but do not think you can at all by knocking on the window call that child to hear you  he intent is still on his playbusiness bent he does not hear he will not look nor yet be lured out of this book for long ago the truth to say he has grown up and gone away and it is but a child of air that lingers in the garden there   for richmonds garden wall   when thomas set this tablet here time laughed at the vain chanticleer and ere the moss had dimmed the stone time had defaced that garrison now i in turn keep watch and ward in my red house in my walled yard of sunflowers sitting here at ease with friends and my bright canvases but hark and you may hear quite plain times chuckled laughter in the lane   hail guest and enter freely   hail guest and enter freely  all you see is for your momentary visit yours and we who welcome you are but the guests of god and know not our departure   lo now my guest   lo now my guest if aught amiss were said forgive it and dismiss it from your head for me for you for all to close the date pass now the evning sponge across the slate and to that spirit of forgiveness keep which is the parent and the child of sleep   so live so love so use that fragile hour   so live so love so use that fragile hour that when the dark hand of the shining power shall one from other wife or husband take the poor survivor may not weep and wake   ad se ipsum   dear sir goodmorrow  five years back when you first girded for this arduous track and under various whimsical pretexts endowed another with your damned defects could you have dreamed in your despondent vein that the kind god would make your path so plain non nobis domine  o may he still support my stumbling footsteps on the hill   before this little gift was come   before this little gift was come the little owner had made haste for home and from the door of where the eternal dwell looked back on human things and smiled farewell o may this grief remain the only one o may our house be still a garrison of smiling children and for evermore the tune of little feet be heard along the floor   go little book  the ancient phrase   go little book  the ancient phrase and still the daintiest  go your ways my otto over sea and land till you shall come to nellys hand  how shall i your nelly know by her blue eyes and her black brow by her fierce and slender look and by her goodness little book  what shall i say when i come there you shall speak her soft and fair see  you shall say  the love they send to greet their unforgotten friend  giant adulpho you shall sing the next and then the cradled king and the four corners of the roof then kindly bless and to your perch aloof where balzac all in yellow dressed and the dear webster of the west encircle the prepotent throne of shakespeare and of calderon shall climb an upstart  there with these you shall give ear to breaking seas and windmills turning in the breeze a distant undetermined din without and you shall hear within the blazing and the bickering logs the crowing child the yawning dogs and ever agile high and low our nelly going to and fro  there shall you all silent sit till when perchance the lamp is lit and the days labour done she takes poor otto down and warming for our sakes perchance beholds alive and near our distant faces reappear   my love was warm   my love was warm for that i crossed the mountains and the sea nor counted that endeavour lost that gave my love to me  if that indeed were love at all as still my love i trow by what dear name am i to call the bond that holds me now   dedicatory poem for underwoods   to her for i must still regard her as feminine in her degree who has been my unkind bombarder year after year in grief and glee year after year with oaken tree and yet betweenwhiles my laudator in terms astonishing to me  to the right reverend the spectator i here a humble dedicator bring the last apples from my tree  in tones of love in tones of warning she hailed me through my brief career and kiss and buffet night and morning told me my grandmamma was near whether she praised me high and clear through her unrivalled circulation or sanctimonious insincere she damned me with a misquotation  a chequered but a sweet relation say was it not my granny dear  believe me granny altogether yours though perhaps to your surprise oft have you spruced my wounded feather oft brought a light into my eyes  for notice still the writer cries in any civil age or nation the book that is not talked of dies so that shall be my termination whether in praise or execration still if you love me criticise   farewell   farewell and when forth i through the golden gates to golden isles steer without smiling through the sea of smiles isle upon isle in the seas of the south isle upon island sea upon sea why should i sail why should the breeze i have been young and i have counted friends a hopeless sail i spread too late too late why should i from isle to isle sail a hopeless sailor   the farfarers   the broad sun the bright day white sails on the blue bay the farfarers draw away  light the fires and close the door to the old homes to the loved shore the farfarers return no more   home my little children here are songs for you   come my little children here are songs for you some are short and some are long and all all are new you must learn to sing them very small and clear very true to time and tune and pleasing to the ear  mark the note that rises mark the notes that fall mark the time when broken and the swing of it all so when night is come and you have gone to bed all the songs you love to sing shall echo in your head   come from the daisied meadows   home from the daisied meadows where you linger yet  home goldenheaded playmate ere the sun is set for the dews are falling fast and the night has come at last home with you home and lay your little head at rest safe safe my little darling on your mothers breast lullaby darling your mother is watching you    shell be your guardian and shield lullaby slumber my darling till morning be    bright upon mountain and field long long the shadows fall all white and smooth at home your little bed is laid all round your head be angels   early in the morning i hear on your piano   early in the morning i hear on your piano you at least i guess its you proceed to learn to play mostly little minds should take and tackle their piano while the birds are singing in the morning of the day   fair isle at sea   fair isle at sea  thy lovely name soft in my ear like music came that sea i loved and once or twice i touched at isles of paradise   loud and low in the chimney   loud and low in the chimney the squalls suspire then like an answer dwindles and glows the fire and the chamber reddens and darkens in time like taken breath near by the sounding chimney the youth apart hearkens with changing colour and leaping heart and hears in the coil of the tempest the voice of love and death love on high in the flutelike and tender notes sounds as from april meadows and hillside cotes but the deep wood wind in the chimney utters the slogan of death   i love to be warm by the red fireside   i love to be warm by the red fireside i love to be wet with rain i love to be welcome at lamplit doors and leave the doors again   at last she comes   at last she comes o never more in this dear patience of my pain to leave me lonely as before or leave my soul alone again   mine eyes were swift to know thee   mine eyes were swift to know thee and my heart as swift to love  i did become at once thine wholly thine unalterably thine in honourable service pure intent steadfast excess of love and laughing care and as she was so am and so shall be i knew thee helpful knew thee true knew thee and pity bedfellows i heard thy talk with answerable throbbings  on the stream deep swift and clear the lilies floated fish through the shadows ran  there thou and i read kindness in our eyes and closed the match   fixed is the doom   fixed is the doom and to the last of years teacher and taught friend lover parent child each walks though near yet separate each beholds his dear ones shine beyond him like the stars we also love forever dwell apart with cries approach with cries behold the gulph the unvaulted as two great eagles that do wheel in air above a mountain and with screams confer far heard athwart the cedars yet the years shall bring us ever nearer day by day endearing week by week till death at last dissolve that long divorce  by faith we love not knowledge and by faith though far removed dwell as in perfect nearness heart to heart we but excuse those things we merely are and to our souls a brave deception cherish so from unhappy war a man returns unfearing or the seaman from the deep so from cool night and woodlands to a feast may someone enter and still breathe of dews and in her eyes still wear the dusky night   men are heavens piers   men are heavens piers they evermore unwearying bear the skyey floor mans theatre they bear with ease unfrowning cariatides i for my wife the sun uphold or dozing strike the seasons cold she on her side in fairywise deals in diviner mysteries by spells to make the fuel burn and keep the parlour warm to turn water to wine and stones to bread by her unconquered herohead a naked adam naked eve alone the primal bower

stars come then my eve and to and fro let us about our garden go and gratefulhearted hand in hand revisit all our tillage land and marvel at our strange estate for hooded ruin at the gate sits watchful and the angels fear to see us tread so boldly here meanwhile my eve with flower and grass our perishable days we pass far more the thorn observe  and see how our enormous sins go free  nor less admire beside the rose how far a little virtue goes   the angler rose he took his rod   the angler rose he took his rod he kneeled and made his prayers to god the living god sat overhead the angler tripped the eels were fed   spring carol   when loud by landside streamlets gush and clear in the greenwood quires the thrush with sun on the meadows and songs in the shadows comes again to me the gift of the tongues of the lea the gift of the tongues of meadows  straightway my olden heart returns and dances with the dancing burns it sings with the sparrows to the rain and the grimy barrows sings my heart aloud  to the silverbellied cloud to the silver rainy arrows  it bears the song of the skylark down and it hears the singing of the town and youth on the highways and lovers in byways follows and sees and hearkens the song of the leas and sings the songs of the highways  so when the earth is alive with gods and the lusty ploughman breaks the sod and the grass sings in the meadows and the flowers smile in the shadows sits my heart at ease hearing the song of the leas singing the songs of the meadows   to what shall i compare her   to what shall i compare her that is as fair as she for she is fairer  fairer than the sea what shall be likened to her the sainted of my youth for she is truer  truer than the truth  as the stars are from the sleeper her heart is hid from me for she is deeper  deeper than the sea yet in my dreams i view her flush rosy with new ruth  dreams  ah may these prove truer than the truth   when the sun comes after rain   when the sun comes after rain and the bird is in the blue the girls go down the lane two by two  when the sun comes after shadow and the singing of the showers the girls go up the meadow fair as flowers  when the eve comes dusky red and the moon succeeds the sun the girls go home to bed one by one  and when life draws to its even and the day of man is past they shall all go home to heaven home at last   late o miller   late o miller the birds are silent the darkness falls in the house the lights are lighted see in the valley they twinkle the lights of home late o lovers the night is at hand silence and darkness clothe the

snows settle around and whose small chamber grows dusk as the sloping window takes its load        the kindly hill as to complete our hap has taen us in the shelter of her lap well sheltered in our slender grove of trees and ring of walls we sit between her knees a disused quarry paved with rose plots hung with clematis the barren womb whence sprung the crowstepped house itself that now far seen stands like a bather to the neck in green a disused quarry furnished with a seat sacred to pipes and meditation meet for such a sunny and retired nook there in the clear warm mornings many a book has vied with the fair prospect of the hills that vale on vale rough brae on brae upfills halfway to the zenith all the vacant sky to keep my loose attention    horace has sat with me whole mornings through and montaigne gossiped fairly false and true and chattering pepys and a few beside that suit the easy vein the quiet tide the calm and certain stay of gardenlife far sunk from all the thunderous roar of strife there is about the small secluded place a garnish of old times a certain grace of pensive memories lays about the braes the old chestnuts gossip tales of bygone days here where some wandering preacher blest lazil perhaps or peden on the middle hill had made his secret church in rain or snow he cheers the chosen residue from woe all night the doors stood open come who might the hounded kebbock mat the mud all night nor are there wanting later tales of how prince charlies highlanders           i have had talents too  in lifes first hour god crowned with benefits my childish head flower after flower i plucked them flower by flower cast them behind me ruined withered dead full many a shining godhead disappeared from the bright rank that once adorned her brow the old childs olympus        gone are the fair old dreams and one by one as one by one the means to reach them went as one by one the stars in riot and disgrace i squandered what     there shut the door alas on many a hope too many my face is set to the autumnal slope where the loud winds shall     there shut the door alas on many a hope and yet some hopes remain that shall decide my rest of years and down the autumnal slope        gone are the quiet twilight dreams that i loved as all men have loved them gone i have great dreams and still they stir my soul on high  dreams of the knights stout heart and tempered will not in elysian lands they take their way not as of yore across the gay champaign towards some dream city towered    and my    the path winds forth before me sweet and plain not now but though beneath a stonegrey sky novembers russet woodlands toss and wail still the white road goes thro them still may i strong in new purpose god may still prevail        i and my like improvident sailors        at whose light fall awaking all my heart grew populous with gracious favoured thought and all night long thereafter hour by hour the pageant of dead love before my eyes went proudly and old hopes with downcast head followed like kings subdued in romes imperial hour followed the car and i      since thou hast given me this good hope o god   since thou hast given me this good hope o god that while my footsteps tread the flowery sod and the great woods embower me and white dawn and purple even sweetly lead me on from day to day and night to night o god my life shall no wise miss the light of love but ever climbing climb above mans one poor star mans supine lands into the azure steadfastness of death my life shall no wise lack the light of love my hands not lack the loving touch of hands but day by day while yet i draw my breath and day by day unto my last of years i shall be one that has a perfect friend her heart shall taste my laughter and my tears and her kind eyes shall lead me to the end   god gave to me a child in part   god gave to me a child in part yet wholly gave the fathers heart child of my soul o whither now unborn unmothered goest thou  you came you went and no man wist hapless my child no breast you kist on no dear knees a privileged babbler clomb nor knew the kindly feel of home  my voice may reach you o my dear a fathers voice perhaps the child may hear and pitying you may turn your view on that poor father whom you never knew  alas alone he sits who then immortal among mortal men sat hand in hand with love and all day through with your dear mother wondered over you   over the land is april   over the land is april over my heart a rose over the high brown mountain the sound of singing goes say love do you hear me hear my sonnets ring over the high brown mountain love do you hear me sing  by highway love and byway the snows succeed the rose over the high brown mountain the wind of winter blows say love do you hear me hear my sonnets ring over the high brown mountain i sound the song of spring i throw the flowers of spring do you hear the song of spring hear you the songs of spring   light as the linnet on my way i start   light as the linnet on my way i start for all my pack i bear a chartered heart forth on the world without a guide or chart content to know through all mans varying fates the eternal woman by the wayside waits   come here is adieu to the city   come here is adieu to the city and hurrah for the country again the broad road lies before me watered with last nights rain the timbered country woos

remembered childhood seen thro tears the best of heaven and the worst of hell  iv  as starts the absent dreamer when a train suddenly disengulphed below his feet roars forth into the sunlight to its

to the twin gods of mirthful wine and mirth  about my fields in the broad sun and blaze of noon there goeth one barefoot and robed in blue to scan with the hard eye of the husbandman my harvests and my cattle  her when even puts the birds astir and day has set in the great woods we seek among her garden roods with bells and cries in vain the while lamps plate and the decanter smile on the forgotten board  but she deaf blind and prone on face and knee forgets time family and feast and digs like a demented beast  tall as a guardsman pale as the east at dawn who strides in strange apparel on the lawn rails for his breakfast routs his vassals out like boys escaped from school with song and shout kind and unkind his makers final freak part we deride the child part dread the antique see where his gang like frogs among the dew crouch at their duty an unquiet crew adjust their staring kilts and their swift eyes turn still to him who sits to supervise he in the midst perched on a fallen tree eyes them at labour and guitar on knee now ministers alarm now scatters joy now twangs a halting chord now tweaks a boy thorough in all my resolute vizier plays both the despot and the volunteer

endearing din of censure and encouragement and when all else is tried in vain see her sit down and weep again she weeps to conquer she varies on her grenadiers from satire up to girlish tears  or rather to behold her when she plies for me the unresting pen and when the loud assault of squalls resounds upon the roof and walls and the low thunder growls and i raise my dictating voice on high  what glory for a boy of ten who now must three gigantic men and two enormous dapple grey new zealand packhorses array and lead and wisely resolute our daylong business execute in the far shoreside

attitude  rides off downhill into the wood  i meanwhile in the populous house apart sit snugly chambered and my silent art uninterrupted unremitting ply before the dawn by morning lamplight by the glow of smelting noon and when the sun dips past my westering hill and day is done so bending still over my trade of words i hear the morning and the evening birds the morning and the evening stars behold so there apart i sit as once of old napier in wizard merchiston and my brown innocent aides in home and husbandry wonder askance  what ails the boss they ask him richest of the rich an endless task before the earliest birds or servants stir calls and detains him daylong prisoner he whose innumerable dollars hewed this cleft in the boar and devilhaunted wood and bade therein from sun to seas and skies his manywindowed painted palace rise redroofed bluewalled a rainbow on the hill a wonder in the forest glade he still  unthinkable aladdin dawn and dark scribbles and scribbles like a german clerk we see the fact but tell o tell us why my reverend washman and wise butler cry meanwhile at times the manifold imperishable perfumes of the past and coloured pictures rise on me thick and fast and i remember the white rime the loud lamplitten city shops and the changing crowd and i remember home and the old time the winding river the white moving rhyme the autumn robin by the riverside that pipes in the grey eve  the old lady so they say but i admire your young vitality still brisk of foot still busy and keen in and about and up and down  i hear you pass with bustling feet the long verandahs round and beat your bell and lotu  lotu cry thus calling our queer company in morning or in evening dim to prayers and the oft mangled hymn  all day you watch across the sky the silent shining cloudlands ply that huge as countries swift as birds beshade the isles by halves and thirds till each with battlemented crest stands anchored in the ensanguined west an alp enchanted  all the day you hear the exuberant wind at play in vast unbroken voice uplift in roaring tree round whistling clift   air of diabellis   call it to mind o my love dear were your eyes as the day bright as the

glory died through golden hours and the shining moon arising how the boat drew homeward filled with flowers age and winter close us slowly in  level river cloudless heaven islanded reed mazes silver weirs how the silent boat with silver threads the inverted forest as she goes broke the trembling green of mirrored trees o remember and remember how the berries hung in garlands  still in the river see the shallop floats hark  chimes the falling oar still in the mind hark to the song of the past dream and they pass in their dreams  those that loved of yore o those that loved of yore hark through the stillness o darling hark through it all the ear of the mind  knows the boat of love  hark chimes the falling oar  o half in vain they grew old  now the halcyon days are over age and winter close us slowly round and these sounds at fall of even dim the sight and muffle all the sound and at the married fireside sleep of soul and sleep of fancy joan and darby silence of the world without a sound and beside the winter faggot  joan and darby sit and dose and dream and wake  dream they hear the flowing singing river see the berries in the island brake dream they hear the weir see the gliding shallop mar the stream hark in your dreams do you hear  snow has filled the drifted forest ice has bound the    stream frost has bound our flowing river snow has whitened all our island brake  berried brake and reedy island heaven below and only heaven above azure through the skys inverted image safely swam the boat that bore our love dear were your eyes as the day bright ran the stream bright hung the sky above days of april airs of eden how the glory died through golden hours and the shining moon arising how the boat drew homeward filled with flowers bright were your eyes in the night we have lived my love o we have loved my love now the    days are over age and winter close us slowly round  vainly time departs and vainly age and winter come and close us round  hark the rivers long continuous sound  hear the river ripples in the reeds  lo in dreams they see their shallop run the lilies down and drown the weeds mid the sound of crackling faggots so in dreams the new created happy past returns today recedes and they hear once more  from the old years yesterday returns today recedes and they hear with aged hearing warbles  loves own river ripple in the weeds and again the lovers
