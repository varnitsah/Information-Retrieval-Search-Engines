of boomtown the twoyearold giant of the plains as the teams drew past the last house the strangeness of the scene appealed irresistibly to the newly arrived immigrants the town lay behind them on the level treeless plain like a handful of blocks pitched upon a russet robe its houses were mainly shanties of pine onestory in height while here and there actual tents gleamed in the halflight with infinite suggestion of americas restless pioneers  the wind blew fresh and chill from the west the sun rose swiftly and the thin scarf of morning cloud melted away leaving an illimitable sweep of sky arching an almost equally majestic plain there was a poignant charm in the aira smell of freshly uncovered sod a width and splendor in the view which exalted the movers beyond words  the prairie was ridged here and there with ice and the swales were full of posh and water geese were slowly winging their way against the wind and ducks were sitting here and there on the icerimmed ponds the sod was burned black and bare and so firm with frost that the wagon chuckled noisily as it passed over it the whistle of the driver called afar startling the ducks from their allnight restingplaces  one of the teams drew a load of material for a house together with a few household utensils the driver a thinfaced blueeyed man of thirty walked beside his horses his eyes were full of wonder but he walked in silence  the second wagon was piled high with boxes and barrels of groceries and hardware and was driven by a handsome young fellow with a large brown mustache his name was bailey and he seemed to be pointing the way for his companion whom he called burke  as the sun rose a kind of transformationscene took place the whole level land lifted at the horizon till the teams seemed crawling forever at bottom of an enormous bowl mystical forms came into viewgrotesquely elongated unrecognizable hills twenty thirty miles away rose like apparitions astonishingly magnified willows became elms a settlers shanty rose like a shottowertowns hitherto unseen swam and palpitated in the yellow flood of light like shaken banners lowhung on unseen flagstaffs  burke marched with uplifted face he was like one suddenly wakened in a new world where nothing was familiar not a tree or shrub was in sight not a mark of plough or harroweverything was wild and to him mystical and glorious his eyes were like those of a man who sees a world at its birth  hour after hour they moved across the swelling land hour after hour while the yellow sun rolled up the slope putting to flight the morning shapes on the horizonstriking the plain into level prose again and warming the air into genial march hour after hour the horses toiled on till the last cabin fell away to the east like a sail at sea till the road faded into a trail almost imperceptible on the firm sod                                       and so at last they came to the land of the straddlebugthe squatters watch dogthree boards nailed together like a stack of army muskets to mark a claim burke resembled a man taking his first seavoyage his eyes searched the plain restlessly and his brain dreamed bailey an old settlerof two years experiencewhistled and sang and shouted lustily to his tired beasts  it drew toward noon baileys clear voice shouted back when we reach that swell well see the western coteaux the western coteaux to burke the man from illinois this was like discovering a new range of mountains  there they rise bailey called a little later  burke looked away to the west low down on the horizon lay a long blue bank hardly more substantial than a line of cloud how far off are they he asked in awe  about twentyfive miles our claims are just about in line with that gap bailey pointed with his whip and about twelve miles from here were on the unsurveyed land now  burke experienced a thrill of exultation as he looked around him in the distance other carriages were crawling like beetles a couple of shanties newly built on a nearby ridge glittered like gold in the sun and the piles of yellow lumber and the straddlebugs increased in number as they left the surveyed land and emerged into the finer tract which lay as yet unmapped at noon they stopped and fed their animals eating their own food on the ground beside their wagons  while they rested bailey kept his eyes on their backward trail watching for his partner rivers its about time jim showed up he said once again  burke seemed anxious they wont get off the track will they  bailey laughed at his innocence jim rivers has located about seventyfive claims out here this spring i guess he wont lose his bearings  im afraid blanchell get nervous  oh jim will take care of her she wont be lonesome either hes a great favorite with the women always gassinwell this wont feed the baby he ended leaping to his feet  they were about to start on when a swift team came into sight the carriage was a platformspring wagon with a man and woman in the front seat and in the rear a couple of alert young fellows sat holding rifles in their hands and eyeing the plain for game  hello said the driver in a pleasant shout how you getting on  pretty well replied bailey  should say you were i didnt know but wed fail to overhaul you  burke went up to the wagon well blanche what do you think of itfars youve got  not very much replied his wife candidly she was a handsome woman but looked tired and a little cross at the moment i guess ill get out and ride with you she added  why no what for asked rivers hastily why not go right along out to the store with us  why yes thats the thing to do blanche well be along soon said burke stay where you are  she sat down again as if ashamed to give her reason for not going on with these strange men  i was just in the middle of a story too added rivers humorously well so long and cracking his whip he started on well have supper ready when you arrive he shouted back  burke could not forget the look in his wifes eyes she was right it would have been pleasanter if she had stayed with him they had been married several years but his love for her had not grown less perhaps for the reason that she dominated him  she was a fine powerful girl while he was a plain man slightly stooping with thin face and prominent larynx she had brought a little property to him which was unusual enough to give her a sense of importance in all business transactions of the firm  she had consented to the sale of their farm in illinois with great reluctance and as burke rode along on his load of furniture he recalled it all very vividly and it made him anxious to know her impression of his claim as he took her position for a moment he got a sudden sense of the loneliness and rawness of this new land which he had not felt before the womans point of view was so different from that of the adventurous man  twice they were forced to partly unload in order to cross ravines where the frost had fallen out and it was growing dark as they rose over the low swell from which they could see a dim red star which burke guessed to be the shanty light even before bailey called exultantly  there she blows  the wind had grown chill and moist the quacking ducks were thickening on the pools and strange noises came from ghostly swells and hidden creeks the tired horses moved forward with soundless feet upon the sod which had softened during the day they quickened their steps when they saw the lantern shine from the pole before the building  the light of the lamp and the sight of blanche standing in the doorway of the cabin at the back of the storeroom was a beautiful sight to burke set over against the wet dark prairie with its boundless sweep of unknown soil the shanty seemed a radiant palace  suppers all ready willard called blanche and the tired mans heart leaped with joy to hear the tender familiar cadence of her voice it was her happy voice and when she used it men were her slaves  bailey came out with one of the landseekers  go in to supper boys well take care of the teams was his hearty command  the tired freighters gladly did as they were bid and scooping up some water from a nearby hollow on the sod hurriedly washed their faces and sat down to a supper of chopped potatoes bacon and eggs and tea which blanche placed steaming hot upon the table in such joy as only the weary worker knows  mrs burke was in high spirits the novelty of the trip the rude shanty with its litter of shavings and its boxes for chairs the bundles of hay for beds gave her something like the same pleasure a picnic might have done it appealed to the primeval in her she forgot her homesickness and her vague regrets and her smiles filled her husband with content  rivers and the others soon came in and after supper there was a great deal of energetic talk the young landseekers were garrulous with delight over their claims which they proudly exalted above the stumps and stones of the farms back home  why it took three generations of my folks to clear off forty acres of land said one of them they just wore themselves out on it i told hank he could have it and id go west and see if there wasnt some land out there which wouldnt take a mans lifetime to grub out and smooth down and ive found it  rivers had plainly won the friendship of mrs burke for they were having a jolly time together over by the table where he was helping to wash the dishes he had laughing brown eyes and a pleasant voice and was one of the most popular of the lawyers and landagents in boomtown there was a boyish quality in him which kept him giving and taking jocular remarks  bailey sometimes said rivers would shine up to a seventyyearold sioux squaw if she was the only woman handy but he dont mean anything by itits just his way hes one o the besthearted fellers that ever lived others took a less favorable view of the landagent and refused to trust him  bailey assumed command now fellers he said well vamoose the ranch while mrs burke turns in he opened the way to the storeroom and the men filed out all but burke who remained to put up the calico curtain with which his wife had planned to shield her bed  blanche was a little disturbed at the prospect of sleeping behind such a thin barrier  oh its no worse than the sleepingcar her husband argued  a little later he stuck his head in at the storeroom door all ready bailey  bailey was to sleep on the rickety lounge which served as bedstead and chair and the other men were to make down as best they could in the grocery  bailey went out to the front of the shanty to look at the lantern he had set up on a scantling rivers followed him  going to leave that up there all night  yes may keep some poor devil from wandering around all night on the prairie  rivers said with an abrupt change in his voice  mrs burke is a hummer isnt she howd his flatchested nibs manage to secure a queen like that i must get married baileyno use  bailey took his friends declaration more lightly than it deserved he laughed wish you would jim and relieve me of the cookin  blanche could hardly compose herself to sleep isnt it wonderful she whispered its all so strange like being out of the world someway  burke heard the ducks quacking down in the moggason and he too felt the silence and immensity of the plain outside it was enormous incredible in its wildness i believe were going to like it out here blanche he said  blanche burke rose to a beautiful and busy day the breakfast which she cooked in the early dawn was savory and rivers who helped her by bringing water and building the fire was full of life and humor he seemed to have no other business than to wait and tend on her  he called her out to see the sunrise isnt this great he called exultantly flights of geese were passing and the noise of ducks came to them from every direction he pointed out the distant hills and called her attention to a solemn row of sandhill cranes down by the swale causing her to see the wonder and beauty of this new world  youre going to like it out here he said with conviction it is a glorious climate and youll soon have more neighbors than you want  after breakfast bailey and burke left the moggason ranchas bailey called the store and shantyto carry the lumber and furniture belonging to burke on to his claim two or three miles away rivers remained to work in the store and to meet some other landseekers and mrs burke agreed to stay and get dinner for them all  during this long forenoon rivers exerted himself to prevent her from being lonely he was busy about the store but he found time to keep her fire going and to bring water and to tell her of his bachelor life with bailey she had never had anything like this swift and smiling service and she felt very grateful to him he encouraged her to make some pies and to prepare a thumping dinner it will seem like being married again he said with a chuckle  burke and bailey returned at noon to dinner  mrs burke you can sleep in your own ranch tonight announced bailey  i guess it will be a ranch  itll be new anyhow her husband said with a timid smile  after dinner she straightened things up a little and as she got into the wagon she said well there mr rivers youll have to take care o things now  rivers leered comically sighed and looked at his partner bailey i didnt know what we needed before i know now we need a woman  bailey smiled go get one dont ask a clumsy old farmer like me to provide a cook  ill get married tomorrow said rivers with a droll inflection they all laughed and burke clucked at the team well goodbye boys see you later  after leaving the ranch they struck out over the prairie where no wagonwheel but theirs had ever passed here were the buffalo trails deepworn ruts all running from northwest to southeast here lay the white bones of elk in shining crates ghastly on the fireblackened sod beside the shallow pools buffalo horns in testimony of the tragic past lay scattered thickly everywhere could be seen the signs of the swarming herds of bison which once swept to and fro from north to south over the plain all so silent and empty now  a few antelope scurried away out of the path and a wolf sitting on a height gravely watched the teams as if marvelling at their coming the wind swept out of the west clear and cold the sky held no shred of cloud the air was like some allpowerful intoxicant and when bailey pointed out a row of little stakes and said theres the railroad their imagination supplied the trains the wheat the houses the towns which were to come  at the claim blanche sat on a box and watched the two men as they swiftly built the little cabin which was to be her home their hammers rang merrily and soon she was permitted to go inside and look up at the great sky which roofed it in this was an emotional moment to her as she sat there listening to the voices of the men who were drawing this fragile shelter around her a great awe fell upon her it seemed as if she had drawn a little nearer to the almighty creator of the universe here where no white man had ever set foot she was watching the founding of her own house was it a home could it ever be a home  swiftly the roof closed over her head and the floor crept under her feet the stove came in and the flourbarrel and the few household articles which they had brought followed and as the sun was setting they all sat down to supper in her new home  the smell of the fresh pine was round them geese were flying over cranes were dancing down by the ponds prairiechickens were booming the open doorwaydoorless yetlooked out on the sealike plain glorified by the red sun just sinking over the purple line of treeless hills to the west it was the bare raw materials of a state and they were in at the beginning of it  after bailey left them the husband and wife sat in silence when they spoke it was in low voices it seemed as if god could hear what they saidthat he was just there behind the glory of the western clouds     ii  may   day by day the plain thickened with life each noon a crowd of landseekers swarmed about the moggason ranch asking for food and shelter and blanche responding to rivers entreaties went down to cook returning each night to her bed rivers professed to be very grateful for her aid  all ages and sexes came to take claims old men alone and feeble school teachers from the east young girls from the towns of the older counties boys not yet of ageeverywhere incoming claimants were setting stakes upon the green and beautiful sod  each day the grass grew more velvety green each day the sky waxed warmer the snow disappeared from the ravines the ice broke up on the moggason the ponds disappeared plover flew over with wailing cry buffalo birds prairie pigeons larks blackbirds sparrows joined their voices to those of the cranes and geese and ducks and the prairie piped and twittered and clacked and chuckled with life the gophers emerged from their winterquarters the foxes barked on the hills the skunk hobbled along the ravines and the badger raised mounds of fresh soil as if to aid the boomer by showing how deep the black loam was  everybody was in holiday mood men whistled and sang and shouted and toiledtoiled terriblyand yet it did not seem like toil they sank wells and ploughed gardens and built barns and planted seeds and yet the whole settlement continued to present the carefree manners of a great pleasure party it seemed as if no one needed to work and therefore those first months were months of gay and swift progress  it was the most beautiful spring blanche and willard burke had spent since their marriage nine years before blanche forgot to be petulant or moody she was in superb health and carried herself like a girl of eighteen she appeared to have lost all her regrets  she laughed heartily when rivers came over one afternoon and boldly declared  burke ive cme to borrow your wife weve got a lot o tenderfoots over there tonight and im a little shy of baileys biscuits im going to carry your cook away  all right only bring her back  blanche was a little embarrassed when rivers replied i dont like to agree to do that mebbe youd better come over to make sure i do  all right ill come over in time for supper burkes simple good face glowed with enjoyment of the fun he smilingly went back to beating his ploughshare with hammer and wedge as rivers drove away with blanche the clink of his steel rang through the golden light that flooded the prairie keeping time to his whistled song  in the months of april and may the world sent a skirmishline into this echoless land to take possession of a belt of territory six hundred miles long and one hundred miles broad the settlers came like locusts they sang like larks from alsace and lorraine from the north sea from russia from the alps they came and their faces shone as if they had happened upon the springtime of the world tyranny was behind them the majesty of gods wilderness before them a mystic joy within them  under their hands the straddlebug multiplied he is shortlived this prairie insect he usually dies in thirty daysby courtesy alone he lives he expresses the settlers hope and sense of justice in these spring days of good cheer he lived at times to sixty daysbut only on stony ground or firescarred peaty lowlands  he witheredthis strange threelegged voiceless insectbut in his stead arose a beetle this beetle sheltered human beings and was called a shack  they were all alike these shacks they had roofs of one slant they were built of rough lumber and roofed with tarred paper which made all food taste of tar  they were dens but little higher than a mans head and yet they sheltered the most joyous people that ever set foot to earth in one cabin lived a girl and a canarybird all alone in the next a man who cooked his own food when he did not share his rations with the girl all in frank and honorable companionship on the next claim were two schoolteachers busy as magpies using the saw and hammer with deft accuracy in the next was a bankclerk out for his healthand these clean and selfcontained people lived in free intercourse without slander and without fear only the alsatians settled in groups alien and unapproachable all others met at odd times and places breathing in the promiseful air of the clean sod resolute to put the world of hopeless failure behind them  spring merged magnificently into summer the grass upthrust the waterfowl passed on to the northern lakeregion the morning symphony of the prairiechickens died out but the whistle of the larks the chatter of the sparrows and the wailing cry of the nesting plover came to take its place  the gophers whistled and trilled the foxes barked from the hills and an occasional startled antelope or curious wolf passed through the line of settlement as if to see what lay behind this strange phalanx of ploughmen guarding their yellow shanties  week after week passed away and the government surveyors did not appear the boomtown spike told in each issue how the men of the chain and compass were pushing westward but still they did not come and the settlers hopes of getting their claims filed before winter grew fainter the mass of them had planned to take claims in the spring live on them the required six months prove up and return east for the winter  in spite of these disappointments all continued to be merry no one took any part of it very seriously the young men went out and ploughed when they pleased and came in and sat on the doorstep and talked with the women when they were weary the shanties were hot and crowded but no one minded that byandby they were to build bigger  and then all was so new and beautiful and the sky was so clear oh that marvellous lofty sky with just clouds enough to make the blue more intense oh the wonder of the wind from the wild mysterious green sea to the west with the change and sheen of the prairie incessant and magical life was made marvellous and the winter put far away  merry parties drove here and there visiting formalities counted for little and yet with all this freedom of intercourse this close companionship no one pointed the finger of gossip toward any woman the girls in their oneroom huts received calls from their bachelor neighbors with the confidence that comes from purity of purpose both felt and understood life was strangely idyllic during these spring days envy and hate and suspicion seemed exorcised from the world     iii  june   the centre of the social life was baileys store there stood the postoffice which connected the settlers with the world they had left behind there they assembled each day when the flag ran up the long pole which stood before the door as a signal for the mail on the treeless shrubless prairie one could see the flag miles away as it rose like a faint fleck of pink against the green of the prairie beyond or the blue sky above  twice a week rivers drove out with supplies these were the eventful days of the week and it was significant to observe with what tasteful care the young women thought it proper to dress on this day hats dainty and fresh cool muslins spotless cuffs ribbons they came out of their cabins with all the little airs and graces of their eastern homes bailey shared their good opinion but he was always silent and a little timid in their presence and usually disappeared as soon as rivers came the social responsibilities belong to you partner he was accustomed to say  as the summer wore on the number of those pathetically eager for letters increased the sunbright plain the beautiful almost cloudless sky and the everflooding light wore upon them they began to recall wistfully the cool streams of new england the wooded slopes of wisconsin the comfortable homesteads and meadows of illinois and they came for their mail with shining eyesand when forced to say nothing today bailey always suffered a keen pang of sympathetic pain  he himself watched the eastern horizon incessantly and unconsciously hours before the wagon was due and when it came in sight at last ran his flag up along its mast joyously  it was a great pleasure to him to sit and talk with his partner and he looked forward to his visits eagerly to jim he could utter himself freely they had known each other so long and he believed he understood his partner to the centre of his heart  he usually had supper readyoften he had help from the girls or mrs burke and while a dozen hands volunteered at the team and with the mailbag rivers was free to hurry to his table whereat he fared like a pasha attended by the flower of his harem the girls pretended it was all on account of his office as mailcarrier but they deceived no one much less an experienced beau like rivers he accepted it all with shameless egotism  to baileys mind jim was too well attended he seemed to see less and less of his partner as the season wore on they seldom sat down to talk in the good old fashion wearing out half the night smoking listening to the slumbersong of the night plain for rivers got into the habit of walking home with some of the girls after the mail was distributed leaving his partner to do the trading sometimes he went away with mrs burke if she were alone sometimes with estelle clayton whom bailey thought the finest woman in the world he secretly resented rivers attention to estelle for he had come to look upon her as under his protection her coming raised maildays to the level of a national holiday  she scared him and yet he rejoiced to see her coming down over the sod so strong so erect so cleareyed she wore her hair like a matron and that pleased him and she looked at him so frankly and unwaveringly she had been a schoolteacher in some middle western state and had been swept into this movement by her desire to go to an eastern college  bailey contrived to look very stern and very busy whenever she came in but she was wise in ways of men and treated him as if he were a good comrade and so gradually he came to talk to her almost as freely as with blanche burke  he did not know that jim almost invariably went over to burkes shantyeven when he walked home with miss clayton rivers did not impress estelle favorably she was not one to be moved by flattery nor by dimples in male cheeks she accepted his company pleasantly but there were welldefined bounds to her friendship as rivers discovered one evening as they were walking over the plain toward her home  on every side the vivid green stretched away smooth as the rounded flesh of a woman velvet in texture glorified by the saffron and orange of the sunset sky  at the cabin they met carrie for whom estelle was both sister and mother the little shanty slanted on the side of a swell like a little boat sliding up a monstrous midocean wave around it lay a little garden inhabited by a colony of chickencoopsall my own making estelle said oh of course sister held the nails and bossed but i did it i like it too its more fun than working red poppies on tidiesthats about all theyll let you do back east  it doesnt matter much what you do out here said rivers meaningly  oh yes it does some things are wrong anywhere but there are other things which people think are wrong that are only unusual she answered and he knew she knew what he meant  the talk moved on to lighter themes and then died away as the three sat in the doorway and saw the light fade out of the sky  carries thin eager face shone with angelic light she seemed to hold her breath as flame after flame of the marvellous light was withdrawn  oh the sky is so big out here she whispered estelle locked hands with her and sat in silence rivers awkward and constrained respected their emotion at last he rose  im going over to burkes a little while so ill have to be moving  mrs burke is very strange said estelle i cant seem to get on with her she seems very lonely and restless her husband is away a great deal but i cant get her to talk when i call and she never returns my call  she never seemed that way to me rivers said having nothing better in mind at the moment  i think shes homesick i wish i knew how to help her but i dont  rivers walked away with two thoughts in his mind one was the girls sentence about things that were wrong and things which people thought were wrong and the other was the question about blanchewas she homesick that puzzled him had he only seen her in her joyous moods it was not pleasant to think of her growing sadperhaps on his account  burke sat on a bench outside the door smoking silently in the dusk blanche was stirring about inside  hello rivers burke called take a seat he pointed at a vinegarkeg  blanche hurried to meet her visitor a beautiful smile on her face come inside she said ive got some work to do and i want to hear you men talk they obediently complied and she lighted a lamp i like to see you when you talk she added flashing a smile at rivers  he saw the change in her for the first time she certainly was paler her face less boyish and a deeper shadow hovered about her eyes  i came over to see if you wouldnt come down and help us get up a jollification at the store on the fourth he said  why of course what shall i do  oh stir up a cakeand make some icecream can you make icecream  you bet i canwith ice bring on your ice  ice is easy to get cook is what bothered me  that ought to be easy said burke marry one  thats what im telling bailey  why dont you set the example stelle claytonnow  rivers laughed but his eyes directed above burkes head met the unsmiling gaze of blanche and sobered  miss clayton and i dont seem to get along firstrate he said and her face lighted again  well there are lots of others round herelonesome girls blanche cant you help jim find a woman  blanche did not answer lightly she turned to her work i guess he can find one if he tries hard  she was alluring as she kneaded the bread at the table the flex of her waist and the swing of her skirts affected rivers powerfully he watched her in silence once she looked around and the penetrative glance of his eyes filled her face with a rush of blood and her eyes misted a few minutes later he said goodnight in an absentminded way and went home  burke talked on attempting to retain the cheery atmosphere which rivers had brought in but blanche refused to answer a sombre look on her sullen face she seemed falling back into her old petulant moody ways and her husband suffered a corresponding dejection  the elation was passing out of his heart their picnic was at an end  as the summer came on he was forced to go out ploughing for other settlers and she was left alone a great deal this was hard to bear there was so little to do in her little sunsmit cabin and her trip to the postoffice to get the mail and to meet the other settlers came to be a necessity like the other women she put on her best hat and gown when she went to the store and a low word of compliment from rivers as he handed out the mail put a color into her face and a joy in her heart which her husband had never been able to arouseindeed it was after these visits that she was most cruel to willard  sometimes she went with him to visit the neighbors but not often one day he said  im goin to work fr jim bradley todaywant o go long  i cant this mornin perhaps ill come over after dinner and walk home with you  i think youll like mrs bradley shes got the purtiest little baby you ever saw he did not look at her as he slung his pick and shovel on his shoulder well ill tell her youll be over about three oclock  all right tell her mebbe ill come and mebbe i wont she answered ungraciously  all that forenoon she went about her little cabin moodily or sat silently by the open door watching the buffalo birds or larks as they came up about the barn for food the green plain was all ashimmer with pleasant heat the plover nesting in the grass were nearly ready to bring forth their youngand the mother fox had already begun to lead her litter out upon the sunny hillside only this childless woman seemed unhappysad  as she came to the cabin of the bradleys willard sunk to his topknot in the ground was burrowing like a badger in the clay quite oblivious to the world above him some one was singing in the cabin and approaching the door blanche saw a picture which thrilled her with a strange hungry envious passion  a young woman was seated in the tiny room with her back to the door her hand on a cradle and as she rocked she sang softly she was a plain little woman the cradle was cheap and common and her singing was only a monotonous chant but the scene had a sort of sublimityit was so old so typical and so beautiful  the woman without the threshold stood for a long time staring straight before her then turned and walked away homewardpast the weary patient heroic man toiling deep in the earth for her sakeleaving him without a glance or a word  you didnt get over to mrs bradleys this afternoon then burke said at supper  no she replied shortly i had some sewin to do  wal go tomorrow thats an awfully cute little chapthat baby he went on after a little mrs bradley let him set on my knee today then he sighed i wisht we had one like im blanche after a pause he said mebbe god will send one some day  she didnt appear to hear and her face was dark with passion     iv  august   now the settlers began to long for rain day after day vast clouds rose above the horizon swift and portentous domed like aerial mountains only to pass with a swoop like the flight of silent great eagles followed by a trailing garment of dust often they lifted in the west with fine promise only to go muttering and bellowing by to the north or south leaving the sky and plain as beautiful as placid and as dry as before the people grew anxious and some of them became bitter but the most of them kept up good courage feeling certain that this was an unusual season  one sultry day while rivers was on his way out to the store he fell to studying the sky and air on the prairie as on the sea one studies little else there was something formidable in every sign in the west a prodigious dome of blueblack cloud was rising ragged at the edge but dense and compact at the horizon  that means business rivers said to himself and chirped to his team  the air was close and hot the southern wind had died away there was scarcely a sound in all the landscape save the regular clucking of the wagonwheels the soft rhythmical tread of the horses feet and the snapping buzz of the grasshoppers rising from the weeds far away to the west lay the blue coteaux thirty miles distant long low without break like a wall the sun was hidden by the cloud and as he passed a shanty rivers saw the family eating their supper outside the door to escape the smothering heat  he smiled as he saw the gleam of white dresses about the door of the store as he drove up a swarm of impatient folk came out to meet him the girls waved their handkerchiefs at him and the men raised a shout  youre late old man  i know it but that makes me all the more welcome he heaved the mailbag to bailey theres a letter for every girl in the crowd i know for i wrote em  well believe that when we see the letters the girls replied  he dismounted heavily somebody put my team up im hungry as a wolf and dry as a biscuit  the poor thing said one of the girls he means a cracker  estelle clayton came out of the store suppers all ready for you mr mailcarrier come right in and sit down  im acomingnow watch me he replied with intent to be funny  the girls accompanied him into the little livingroom  oh my dont some folks live genteel see the canned peaches  and the canned lobster  and the hot biscuit  sit down jim and well pour the tea and dip out the peaches  rivers seated himself at the little pine table i guess youd better whistle while youre dipping the peaches he said pointedly  miss thompson dropped the spoon what impudence  oh let him go ondont mind him said estelle lets desert him i guess that will make him sorry  upon the word they all withdrew and rivers smiled good riddance said he  miss baker presently opened the door and shaking a letter said dont you wish you knew  he pretended to hurl a biscuit at her and she shut the door with a shriek of laughter  mrs burke slipped in her voice was low and timid her face sombre  i cooked the supper jim  you did well its good the biscuits are delicious he looked at her as only a husband should lookintimate unwaveringly secure youre looking fine  she flushed with pleasure as she passed him with the tea he put his arm about her waist  be careful jim she said gently and with a revealing familiar sad cadence in her voice  he smiled at her boyishly he was beautiful to her in this mood i was hoping youd come over and stew something up for me hello theres the thunder its going to rain  another sudden boom like a cannonshot silenced the noise inside for an instant and then a sudden movement took place the movement of feet passing hurriedly about and at last only one or two persons could be heard when rivers reentered the store bailey was alone standing in the door intently watching the coming storm it was growing dusk on the plain and the lightning was beginning to play rapidly low down toward the horizon  were in for it bailey remarked very quietly cyclone  think so said rivers carelessly  sure of it jim that clouds too wide in the wings to miss us this time  a peculiar branching flash of lightning lay along the sky like a vast elmtree followed by a crashing roar  blanche cried out in alarm  now dont be scared its only a shower and will soon be over said bailey heres a letter for you  she took the letter and read it hastily looking often at the coming storm she seemed pale and distraught  do you spose ive got time to get home now she asked as she finished reading  no said rivers so decidedly that bailey looked up in surprise  cant you take me home  rivers looked out of the door by the time we get this wagon unloaded and the team hitched up the storm will be upon us no i guess youre safest right here  there was a peculiar tone a note of authority in his voice which puzzled bailey quite as much as her submission  they worked silently and swiftly getting the barrels of pork and oil and flour into the store and by the time they had emptied the wagon the room was dark so dark that the white face of the awed woman could be seen only as a blotch of gray against the shadow  they lighted the oil lamps which hung in brackets on the wall and then rivers said to blanche wont you go into the other room we must stay here and look after the goods  no no id rather be here with you its going to be terrible  hark said bailey with lifted hands there she comes  far away was heard a continuous steady lowkeyed advancing hum like the rushing of wild horses their hoofbeats lost in one mighty throbbing tumultuous roar then a deeper darkness fell upon the scene and swift as the swoop of an eagle the tornado was upon them  the advancing wall of rain struck the building with terrific force the lightning broke forth savage as the roar of siegeguns the noise of the wind and thunder was deafening the plain grew black as night save when the lightning flamed in countless streams across the clouds the cabin shook like a frightened hound bailey looked around  we must move the goods he shouted above the tumult see the rain is beating in  rivers with blanche encircled by his arm pressed her to his side reassuringly dont be afraid it cant blow down he repeated  he then leaped to baileys assistance and while the thunder crashed in their ears and the lightning blinded their eyes they worked like frantic insects to move the goods away from the western wall through which the rain was beating there was a pleasure in this assault which the woman could not share it was battle absorbing and exalting their shouts were full of joyous excitement  once when the structure trembled and groaned with the shock of a frightful blast rivers again put his arm around blanche saying it cant blow over see those heavy barrels if this store blows down there wont be a shanty standing in the county  she pushed to the window to get a glimpse of the sod when the lightning flamed she imagined the plain as it would look with every cabin flattened to earth its inmates scattered unhoused in the scant waterweighted grass  as they all stood staring out rivers pointed and shouted to bailey see that flagpole  it was made of hard pine tough and supple but it bent in the force of the wind like a willow twig again and again it bowed rose with a fling only to be borne down again at last it broke with a crash the upper half whirling down struck the roof opening a ragged hole through which the rain streamed in torrents  rivers cried in battle alarm the roof is going  no it aint trumpeted bailey sturdily swing a tub up here to catch the water  the woman forgot her fears and aided the two men as they toiled to cover the more perishable goods with bolts of cotton cloth while the appalling wind tore at the eaves and lashed the roof with broadsides of rain and hail which fell in constantly increasing force raising the roar of the storm in key till it crackled viciously the tempest had the voice of a ravenous beast cheated and angry outside the water lay in sheets the whole land was a river and the shanty was like a boat beached on a bar in the swash of it  nothing more could be done and so they waited bailey watching at the window blanche and rivers standing in the centre of the room bailey came back once to say this beats anything i ever saw there will be ruin to many a shanty out of this he added as the roar began to diminish nothing saved us but our ballast of pork and oil  as soon as it stops bob i wish youd hitch up for me i want to take mrs burke home  all right jim its letting up now i wonder if the storm was as bad over where the clayton girls are his voice betrayed anxiety greater than he knew rivers looked at him indulgently and smiled at blanche youd better go and see he said  as soon as it became possible to carry a light bailey went to the barn and brought the team to the door rivers helped blanche to a seat in the wagon and drove off across the plain leaving bailey alone in the watersoaked storeroom after a halfhours work he too set out on a tour of exploration the moon was shining on the plain as serenely as if only a dew had fallen water stood in shallow basins here and there but the land was unmarked of the passion of lightning and of wind bailey walked across the level waste straining his eyes ahead to see if the homes of his neighbors were still standing he saw lights gleaming here and there like warning lamps of distant schooners and when the infrequent silent lightning flamed over the level waste he caught glimpses of familiar shanties standing on the low swells  he hurried forward his feet splashing in water too intent to turn aside wherever a lamp burned steadily he knew a roof still remained and his heart grew lighter he came at last to the object of his search it was only a small hut but it was to him most sacred he knocked timidly at the door  whos there was the quick and startled reply  its bailey im here to see how you came through the storm  oh mr bailey replied estelle she opened the door come in were all right but wet dont step in the pans  as he entered with eyes a little dazzled by the candle carrie wrapped in a shawl rose from the bed oh im glad to see a man wasnt it terrible pans were set about the room to catch the dripping water the little shanty usually so orderly and cheerful looked dishevelled and desolate  estelle laughed and said i tried to save the chickens and i nearly blew away myself  her cheeks were flushed and her wet hair streamed down her back she was barefooted a fact which she tried to conceal by leaning forward a little  it was very good of you to come over she went on more soberly in the pause which followed we were scared no use denying that but we were too busy to dwell upon it the wind took the tarred paper off the roof and let the rain through everywhere it was the most exciting experience of our lives  she was more breathless and girlish than she had ever been in his presence and he grew correspondingly secure a subtle charm came from her streaming hair and her uncorseted and graceful figure he offered assistance but she sturdily replied  oh no thank you theres nothing to do till morning anyway we kept the bed dry and so we can sleep she smiled on him with something happy hidden in the tones of her voice she was embarrassed but not afraid she trusted him perfectly and he was exalted by that trust  well ill be over in the morning and see how badly damaged you are i couldnt go to bed till i knew you were all right  thank you youre very kind  he went out with a feeling that carrie was trying hard not to laugh at him he was sure he heard a smothered giggle as he went down the slope he glowed with admiration for estelle so frank so womanly they seemed to have drawn closer to each other in that fifteen minutes talk than in all the preceding months in the joy of this deepening friendship he splashed contentedly back to the store unheeding the pools beneath his feet     v  november   september and october passed before the surveyors long looked for came through and three months dragged out their slow length before the preemptors could file and escape from their claims  by the first of november the wonder had gone out of the life of the settlers one by one the novelties and beauties of the plain had passed away or grown familiar the plover and blackbird fell silent the prairiechickens piping cry ceased as the flocks grew toward maturity and the lark and cricket alone possessed the russet plain which seemed to snap and crackle in the midnight frost and to wither away in the bright midday sun  many of the squatters by this time had spent their last dollar and there was little work for them to do each man like his neighbor was waiting to prove up they had all lived on canned beans and crackers since march and they now faced three months more of this fare some of them had no fuel and winter was rapidly approaching  the vast treeless level so alluring in may and june had become an oppressive weight to those most sensitive to the weather and as the air grew chill and the skies overcast the women turned with apprehensive faces to the untracked northwest out of which the winds swept pitilessly cold and keen the land of the straddlebug was gray and sad  one day a cold rain mixed with sleet came on and when the sun set partly clear the coteaux to the west rose like a marble wall crenelated and shadowed in violet radiant as the bulwarks of some celestial city but it made the thoughtful husband look keenly at the thin walls of his cabin and wonder where his fuel was to come from in this unsheltered land where coal was high and doctors far away winter was a dreaded enemy  the depopulation of the newly claimed land began some of the girls went back never to return others settled in boomtown with intent to visit their claims once a month through the winter but a few like the burkes remained in their little shanties which looked still more like dens when sodded to the eaves the clayton girls flitted away to wheatland leaving the plain desolately lonely to bailey one by one the huts grew smokeless and silent until at last the only englishspeaking woman within three miles was old mrs bussy who swore and smoked a pipe and talked like a man with bronchitis she was not an attractive personality and mrs burke derived little comfort from her presence  willard was away a great deal teaming working desperately to get something laid up for the winter the summer excursion with its laughter its careless irresponsibility had become a deadly grapple with the implacable forces of winter the land of the straddlebug had become a menacing desert hard as iron pitiless as ice  now the wind had dominion over the lonely women wearing out their souls with its melancholy moanings and its vast and wordless sighs its voices seemed to enter blanche burkes soul filling it with hunger never felt before day after day it moaned in her ears and wailed about the little cabin rousing within her formless desires and bitter despairs obscure emotions unused powers of reason and recollection came to her she developed swiftly in sombre womanhood  sometimes mrs bussy came across the prairie sometimes a load of landseekers asked for dinner but mainly she was alone all the long long days she spent hours by the window watching waiting gazing at the moveless sod listening to the windvoices companioned only by her memories she began to perceive that their emigration had been a bitter mistake but her husband had not yet acknowledged it and she honestly tried not to reproach him for it nevertheless she had moments of bitterness when she raged fiercely against him  little things gave her opportunity he came home late one day she greeted him sullenly he began to apologize  i didnt intend to stay to supper but mrs bradley  mrs bradley yes you can go and have a good time with mrs bradley and leave me here all alone to rot itd serve you right if i left you to enjoy this fine home alone  he trembled with agony and weakness  oh you dont mean that blanche  for heavens sake dont call me pet names im not a child if id had any sense id never have come out here theres nothing left for us but just freeze or starve what did we ever leave illinois for anyway  he sank back into a corner in gentle sorrowful patience waiting for her anger to wear itself out  while they sat there in silence they heard the sound of hoofs on the frozen ground and a moment later baileys pleasant voice arose hullo the house burke went to the door and blanche rose to meet the visitor with a smile the knot in her forehead smoothed out there was no alloy in her pure respect and friendship for bailey  he came in cheerily his hearty voice ringing with health and goodwill he took her hand in his with a quick strong grip and the light of his brown eyes brought a glow to her heart  ive come over to see if you dont want to go to the city tomorrow ive got joe pease to stay in the store and so i thought id take an outing  burke looked at his wife she replied eagerly  i should like to go mr bailey very much our old team is so feeble we darent drive so far im afraid every time old dick stumbles hell fall down on the road  well have to get back tomorrow night burke said  oh well do that all right replied bailey  as she planned the trip with tremulous eagerness bailey studied her she was paler than he had ever seen her and more refined and thoughtful scarcely recognizable as the highcolored powerful woman for whom he had helped build the shanty in march there were times now when it seemed as if she were appealing to him and his heart ached with undefined sorrow as he looked about her prisonlike home  for half an hour she chatted with something of her oldtime vivacity but when he went out her face resumed its gloomy lines and she silenced her husband with a glance when he attempted to keep up the cheerful conversation  the next morning as she was dressing she turned sick and faint for a moment her breath seemed to fail her and she sat down dizzy and weak she was alone but the red blood came swelling back into her face as she waited  she grew better soon and rose and went about her work then the excitement and pleasure of her trip the expectation of meeting rivers helped her to put her weakness away  bailey called for the clayton girls who were making their monthly visit to their claim and mrs burke seeing the shine of a lovers joy in baileys face and the clear unwavering trust of a pure good girl in estelles gray eyes fell silent and the shadow of her own sorrow came back upon her face  the ride seemed short and the town at the end wondrously exciting rivers met them at the hotel and insisted on their being his guests during their stay they had a jolly supper together after which they all went to the little townhall to see a play blanche sat beside rivers and as she laughed at si peasley and his misadventures in the city she was girlishly happy it was not very much of an entertainment but in contrast with life in a sod shanty it was all very exciting for her  oh i wish we could live in town this winter she sighed in rivers ear  you can he answered with significant inflection  altogether the evening was one of deep pleasure for blanche she enjoyed the companionship of the clayton girls who had never been so friendly and sympathetic with her before they invited her to spend the night with them which pleased her very much and they all sat up till one oclock talking upon all sorts of tremendously interesting feminine subjects  next morning estelle went with her while she did a little shoppingpitifully little for she only had a dollar or two to spendwhile bailey loaded up his team at last and all too soon her outing ended and she faced the west with heavy heart  poor willard also felt the menace of the desolate wild prairie but he had no conception of the tumult of regret and despair which filled his wifes mind as she climbed into the wagon for their return journey she was like a prisoner whose parole had ended  the clayton girls said goodbye with pity in their voices and rivers sought opportunity to say privately i hate to see you back out there on the border if you need anything let me know  all aboard called bailey as he took his reins in hand  a bitter blast and a gray sky confronted them as they drove out of the town and not even baileys abounding vitality and goodhumor could keep blanche from sinking back into gloomy silence the wind was keen strong prophetic of the snows which were already gathering far in the north and the journey seemed endless and when late in the afternoon they drew up before the squat low hovel in which she was to spend a long and desolate winter blanche was shivering violently and so depressed that she could not coherently thank the kindly young fellow who had afforded her this brief respite from her care she staggered into the house so stiff she could scarcely walk and sank into a chair to sob out her loneliness and despair while willard pottered about building a fire on their icy hearth  willard burke had a question to ask and that night as they were sitting at their poor little table he plucked up courage to begin  blanche i want to ask you somethingthat is ive been kind o noticin you here he paused intending to be sly and suggestive seems to me this climate aint so bad after all you complain a good deal but seems to me you hadnt ought to he trembled while he smiled its done a lot for you  what do you mean she asked her face flushing with confusion  i meanhe tried to laughyour best dress seems pretty tight for you oh if it only should be  dont be a fool she angrily replied if anything like that happens ill let you know  his face lengthened and the smile went out of his eyes he accepted her tone as final too loyal to doubt her word dont be mad i was only in hopes he rose after a silence and went out with downcast head  she sat rigidly feeling as if the blood were freezing in her hands and feet the crisis was upon her the time of her judgment was comingand she was alone she burned with anger against rivers why had he waited and waited he can put things offhe is a man but i am the womani must suffer it all the pain the shame the deadly dangerall were hers  burke returned noisily stamping his feet like a boy  its snowin like all git out he said and ive got to rig up some kind of a sled i reckon winter has come in earnest now and our coalpile is low  he went to sleep with the readiness of a child and as she lay listening to his quiet breath she remembered how easy it had once been for her to sleep she had the same agony of pity for him that she would have felt for a child she had wronged malevolently  the next day mrs bussy came over at her rap blanche called come in but remained seated by the fire  the old woman entered knocking the snow off her feet like a man  how de do neighbor  blanche drew her shawl a little closer around her not very well sit down wont you  cant stop you dont seem very peart i want to know what seems to be the trouble her keen eyes had never seemed so penetrating before blanche flushed and moved uneasily she was afraid of the old creature who seemed halfman halfwoman  oh i dont know rheumatism i guess  that so well this weather is nough to give anybody rheumatiz i tell edthats my boyi tell ed we made holy fools of ourselves comin out here i never see such a damn country fr wind she rambled on about the weather for some time and at last rose well i wanted to borrow your washboiler mine leaks like an infernal old sieve and i dasent go to town to get it mended for fear of a blow whats trouble  blanche suddenly put her hand to her side and grew white and rigid then the blood flamed into her cheeks and the perspiration stood out on her forehead she clinched her lips between her teeth and lay back in her chair  ye look kind o faint cant i do something for ye got any painkiller thats good well rubbed in volunteered the old woman  no no iim all right now it was just a sharp twinge thats allyoull find the boiler in the shed i dont need it her tone was one of dismissal  the old woman rose all right ill find it set still as she went out she grinneda mocking sly aggravating grin its all rightnothin to be ashamed of ive had ten i called my first one pleurisy it didnt fool any one though she cackled and creaked with laughter as she shut the door  blanche sat motionless staring straight before her while the fire died out and the room grew cold  her terror and shame gave way at last and she allowed herself to dream of the mystical joy of maternity she permitted herself to fancy the life of a mother in a sheltered and prosperous home she felt in imagination the touch of little lips the thrust of little hands the cling of little arms my baby should come into a lovely sunlit room it should have a warm pretty cradle it should  the door opened and her husband entered  why blanchewhats the matter youve let the fire go out its cold as blixen in here youll take cold first you know     vi  december   winter came late but with a fury which appalled the strong hearts of the settlers most of them were from the wooded lands of the east and the sweep of the wind across this level sod had a terror which made them quake and cower the month of december was incredibly severe  day after day the thermometer fell so far below zero that no living thing moved on the wide white waste the snows seemed never at rest one storm followed another till the drifting icy sands were worn as fine as flour the house was like a cave its windows thick with frost let in only a pallid light at midday there was little for blanche to do and there was nothing for her to say to willard who came and went aimlessly between the barn and house his poor old team could no longer face the cold wind without danger of freezing and so he walked to the store for the mail and the groceries they lived on boiled potatoes and bacon suffering like prisonersjailed innocently he hovered about the stove feeding it twisted bundles of hay till he grew yellow with the tanning effect of the smoke while blanche cowered in her chair petulant and ungenerous  the winter deepened there were many days when the sun shone but the snow slid across the plain with a menacing hissing sound and the sky was milky with flying frost and the horizon looked cold and wild but these were merely the pauses between storms the utter dryness of the flakes and the neverresting progress of the winds kept the drifts shifting shifting  this is what youve dragged me into blanche burst out one desolate day after a weeks confinement to the house this is your fine homethis dugout this is the climate you bragged about i cant stay here any longer oh my god if i was only back home again she rose and walked back and forth her shawl trailing after her if id had any word to say about it we neverd a been out in this godforsaken country  he bowed his head to her passion and sat in silence while she raged on  do you know we havent got ten pounds of flour in the house and another blizzard likely and no butter either what y goin to do let me starve  i did intend to go over to bussys and get back the flour they borrowed of us but im a little afraid to go out today it looks like another norther the winds rising and old tom  but thats just the reason why youve got to go we cant run such risks weve got to eat or dieyou ought to know that  burke rose and began putting on his wraps ill go over and see what i can squeeze out of old lady bussy  oh this wind will drive me crazy she cried out oh i wish somebody would come she dropped upon the bed sobbing with a hysterical catching of the breath the wind was piping a highkeyed mourning note on the chimneytop a sound that rang echoing down through every hidden recess of her brain shaking her weakening her till at last she turned upon her husband with wild eyes  take me with you i cant stay here any longeri shall go crazy she turned her head to listen isnt some one coming look out and see i hear bells  burke tried to soothe her in his timid clumsy fashion  there there nowsit down you aint well blanche ill ask mrs bussy to come  she suddenly seemed to remember something dont talk to her go to craigs dont go to bussysplease dont i hate her i wont be in her debt  this pleading tone puzzled him but he promised and hitching up his thin old horses drove around to the door of the shanty blanche came out dressed to go with him but when she felt the edge of the wind she shrank her lips turned blue and she cowered back against the side of the cabin holding her shawl like a shield before her bosom i cant do it its too cold id freeze to death youll have to go alone  burke was relieved yes youd better stay he said and drove off  blanche crept back into the shanty and bent above the stove shivering violently she drew a long breath now and then like a grieving child life was over for her she had reached the point where nothing mattered she sat there until the sound of bells aroused her its jim she called and rose to her feet her face radiant with relief rivers came rushing up to the door in a twohorse sleigh and leaped out with a shout of greeting though he could not see her at the frosted window  a moment later he burst in vigorous smiling defiant of the cold  hello all alone how are you  a quick warmth ran through her chilled limbs and she lifted her hands to him  oh jim im so glad you came  keep awayim all snow he warningly called as he threw off his cap and buffalo coat now come to me he said and took her in his arms how are you sweetheart i cant kiss youmy mustache is all ice wheres burke  gone to craigs  he winked jovially while pulling the icicles from his long mustache  i thought i saw him driving across the ridge i was on my way to the store but when i saw his old rackabone team i turned off to see you how are you he asked tenderly and his voice swept away all her reserve  oh jim im not well you must take me away right off i cant stay here another daynot a day  he looked at her keenly  why whats the matter  she evaded his eyes  its so lonesome here then she dropped all evasion you know whyjim take me away i cant live without you now im going to be sick  he understood her very well his eyes fell and his face knotted in sudden gravity i was afraid of thatthats why i came yes you must get out of here at once  she understood him oh jim you wont leave me now will you  no i didnt say anything about leaving you he put his arm around her im not that kind of a man you and i were built for each otheri felt that on that first ride i guess its up to me to take you out of this he broke off his emotional utterance and grew keen and alert  ive been planning to go and im almost readyin fact i could leave now without much loss but i didnt come prepared for anything so sudden my office furniture dont amount to much and this team is baileyshe mused a moment come he said with sudden resolution its go nowwell never have a better chance  she turned white with dreadnow that she neared the actual deed  oh jim i wish there was some other way  he was a little rough her feminine hesitation he could not sympathize with  well there isnt weve got to get right out of this hurry on your things the wind is rising and we must make wheatland by five oclock i came out to hold down my claim but it aint worth it i reckon ive squeezed all the juice out of this lemon this climate is a little boisterous for me  he brought in a blanket and warmed it at the fire while she wrapped herself in cloak and shawl  id better write a little note tohim  what for ive got nothing against him except that he saw you first but i guess hes out of the running now its you and me from this day on  i hate to go without saying goodbye she said tremulously hes always been good to me she added smitten with sudden realization of her husbands kindness  he perceived that she was in earnest all rightonly it does no good and delays us every minute is valuable now the outlook is owly  the plain was getting gray as they came out of the door and the woman shrank and shivered with an instant chill but rivers tenderly tucked the robe about her and leaped into the sleigh  now boys git he shouted to the humped and windruffled team and they sprang away into the currents of powdered snow which were running along the ground in streams as smooth as oil and almost as silent  the sleigh rose and fell over the ridges like a ship off in the west the sun was shining through a peculiar smoky cloud graywhite vapory with glittering edges where it lay against the cold yellow sky every sign was ominous and the long drive seemed a desperate venture to the woman but she trusted her lover as a child depends upon a father she nestled close down under his left arm clothed in its shaggy buffaloskin coat a splendid elation in her heart she was at last with the strong man to whom she belonged  this elation did not last long her sense of safety died slowly out just as the blood chilled in her veins she was not properly clothed and her feet soon ached with cold and she drew her breath through her teeth to prevent the utterance of moans of pain she was never free now from the feeling of guardianship which is the delight and the haunting uneasiness of motherhood i must be warm she thought for its sake  she heard his voice above  i neverll settle in a prairie country againnot but what ive done well enough as a landagent but theres no big thing here for anybodynothing for the landagent now  oh jim im so cold im afraid i cant stand it she broke out desperately  there there he said as if she were a child cuddle down on my knees be brave youll get warmer soon as we turn south  nevertheless he was alarmed as he looked about him he gathered her close in his arm holding the robe about her and urged on his brave team they were hardly five miles from the shanty and yet the storm was becoming frightful even to his resolute and experienced brain the circle of his vision had narrowed till it was impossible at times to see fifty rods away the push of the wind grew each moment mightier a multitudinous soft rushing whispering roar was rising round them mixed with a hissing rustling sound like the passing of invisible winged hosts he could feel his woman shake with cold but she spoke no further word of complaint  he turned the horses suddenly to the left speaking through his teeth  we must make the store he said we must have more wraps well stop at the ranch and get warm and then go on the wind may lullanyway it will be at our backs  as the team turned to the south the air seemed a little less savage but blanche still writhed with pain her hands suffered most her feet had grown numb  well be there in a few minutes rivers cheerily repeated but he began to understand her desperate condition  a quarter of an hour later his team drew up before the door of the ranchhouse it seemed deliciously warm in the lee of the long walls  well here we are now well go in and get warm  what if mr bailey is there she stammered with stiff lips  no matter you must not freeze  he shouted hello bailey there was no reply and he leaped out come you must go in he took her in his arms and carried her into the room dim yet gloriously warm by contrast with the outside air feels good here doesnt it now while i roll up some blankets you warmwe must be quick ill find you some overshoes  blanche staggered on her numb feet which felt like clods she was weak with cold and everything grew dark before her  oh jim i cant go on ill freeze ill diei know i shall my feet are frozen solid  he dragged a chair to the hearth of the stove in which a coal fire lay his action was bold and confident  no you wont ill have you all right in a jiffy trouble is youre not half dressed you need woollen underclothing and a new fur cloak well make it sealskin to pay for this  he unlaced her shoes and slipped them off and while she sobbed with agony he rolled her stockings down and took her cold white feet in his warm swift hands in a few minutes the wrinkles of pain on her face smoothed out and a flush came into her cheeks the tears stood on her eyelashes she was like a sorrowing child who forgets its grief in a quick return of happiness  suddenly rivers stopped and listened his face grew set and dark with apprehension here put your veil back quick its bailey dont answer him unless i tell you to  outside a clear voice pierced through the wind it was bailey speaking to the horses  rivers went on angrily if youd been half dressed this wouldnt have happened therell be hell to pay unless i can convince him  a hand was laid on the knob and bailey entered  hello jim i didnt think youd come out today he eyed the muffled woman sharply whove you got with youmrs burke  it dont concern you rivers replied he saw his mistake instantly and changed his tone yes im taking her home come mrs burke we must be going  wait a minute jim said bailey he studied them both carefully somethings wrong here i feel that where are you going jim  rivers wrath flamed out none o your business come blanche he turned to her his tones betrayed him again  bailey faced him with his back to the door  wait a minute jim  get out o my way  there was a silence and in that silence the two men faced each other as if under some strange light they seemed alien to each other yet familiar too bailey spoke first  jim i know all about it youre stealing another mans wifeand by god i wont let you do it his voice shook so that he hardly uttered his sentence intelligibly the sweat of shame broke out on his face but he did not falter ive seen this coming on all summer i ought to have interfered before  rivers laid a hand on him stand out o my way or ill kill you  the quiver went out of baileys voice he took his partners hand down from his shoulder and when he dropped it there was a bracelet of whitened flesh where his fingers had circled it youll stay right here jim till i say go  rivers reached for a weapon will i he asked i wonder if i will  blanche burst out oh jim dont please dont  the men did not hear her they saw no one heard no one they were facing each other in utter disregard of time or place  baileys tone grew sad and tender but he did not move all right jim if you want to go to hell as the murderer of your best friend as well as for stealing another mans wife do it but you shant go out of this door with that woman while i live now thats final his voice was low and his words came slowly but not from weakness  for a moment hell looked from the other mans eyes he was like a tiger intercepted in his leap upon his prey the laugh had vanished from his hazel eyesthey were gray and cold and savage but there was something equally forceful in baileys gaze  rivers could not shoot he was infuriate but he was not insane he turned away cursing his luck his face twitching and white was terrible to look upon but the crisis was over  baileys eyes lightened come old man you cant afford to do this go out and put up the team and tomorrow well take mrs burke homeill explain that she came over after the mail and couldnt get back  rivers turned on him again with a sneer you cussed fool cant you see that she cant go back to burke ive made her mineyou understand  baileys hands fell slack he suddenly remembered something he brushed his hand over his brow as if to clear his vision  jim jim igood godhow could you do such a thing he was helpless as a boy in face of this hideous complication  rivers pushed his advantage he developed a species of swagger  never mind about that its done now what are you going to do can you fix up such a thing as that bailey was still silent it simply means that im her husband from this time on sit down blancheim going to put up the team but tomorrow morning we go we couldnt make it now anyway he added theres nothing for it but to stay here all night  bailey stood aside to let him go out then went to the stove and mechanically stirred it up and put some water heating this finished he sat down and leaned his head in his hands in confused thought  to his clear sense his partners act seemed monstrous he had been brought up to respect the marriage bond and to protect and honor women the illicit was impossible to his candid soul all the men he had associated with had been respecters of marriage though some of them were obscenethoughtlessly he always believedand now jim his chum had come between a man and his wife with estelle in his mind as the type of purity he could not understand how a wife could be the faithless creature blanche burke seemed her weakness opened a new world to him he could not trust himself to speak to her  the bubbling of the kettle aroused him and he rose and went about getting supper after a few moments he felt able to ask with formal politeness  wont you lay off your things mrs burke  she made no reply but sat like an old gypsy crouched low with brooding face she too was wordless she had made the curious mistake of looking to bailey for justification she had felt that he would understand and pity her and his accusing eyes hurt her sorely if i could only speak if i could only find words to tell him my thought he would at least not despise me she thought her face turned toward him piteously but she dared not lift her eyes to his he typified the world to her and furthermore he was kindly and just and yet he was about to condemn her because she could not make him understand  trained to laugh when she should weep how could she plead overmastering desire the pressure of loneliness and poverty and last of all the power of a man who stood in her fancy among the most brilliant of her world she felt herself in the grasp of forces as vast as impersonal and as illimitable as the wind and the sky but reduced to words her poor plea for mercy would have been i could not help it  her maternity which should have been her glory and her pride was at this hour an insupportable shame she had experienced her moments of emotional exaltation wherein she was lifted above selfabasement but now she crouched in the lowest depths of selfsuspicion the rising storm seemed the approach of the remorseless judgmentday the howl of the wind the voice of devils exulting in her fall  she did not trouble herself about her husband at times she flamed out in anger against his weakness his business failures his boyish gullibility sometimes she pitied him sometimes she hated him  she watched bailey furtively the firm lines of his face his sturdy figure and his frank brusque manner were as familiar to her as the face of rivers and almost as dearbut she could not speak  at last she gave up all thought of speaking and drew her shawl about her with an air of final reserve she resembled an old crone as she crouched there  rivers returned soon and took off his overcoat without looking at bailey who bustled about getting the supper his resolute cheerfulness once more aglow  rivers sat down beside blanche it would be death to attempt wheatland tonight he said i could make it all right but it would be the end of you  bailey could not hear the words she spoke in reply suppers ready said he we all have to eat no matter what comes  something in his voice and manner affected blanche deeply she buried her face in her hands and wept while rivers sat helplessly looking at her she could not rise and walk before him yet the shame of her sin weighed her down  bailey poured some tea and gave it to rivers  take this to her while i toast her some bread  she drank the tea but refused food and rivers sat down again still wearing an air of defiance though bailey did not appear to notice it he ate a hearty supper making a commonplace remark now and again  once he said were in for a hard winter  its hell on the squatters rivers replied for want of other words i dont know what theyll do no money and no work for most of them theyll have to burn hay if it hadnt been for the price on buffalo bones i guess some of them would starve  rising from the table bailey moved about doing up the work he was very thoughtful and the constraint increased in tension  the storm steadily increased its lashings of sleet grew each hour more furious the cabin did not reel for it sat close in a socket of sodsit endured in the rush of snow like a rock set in the swash of savage seas the icy dust came in around the stovepipe and fell in a fine shower down upon baileys hands fell with a faintly stinging touch and the circle of warmth about the fire grew less wide each hour if the horses dont all freeze well be in luck said he  the stove roared as a chained leopard might do in answer to a lion outside slender mice came from their dark corners and skittered across the floor before the silent men their sleek sides palpitating with timorous excitement  bailey hovered over the stove trying to figure up some accounts rivers sat beside blanche with watchful care he kept her shawl upon her shoulders and her feet wrapped in a blanket he spoke to her now and then in a voice inaudible to bailey who studied them with an occasional keen glance  well now he said at last no use sitting here like images we might as well turn in jim you take the bunk over there and mrs burke you occupy the bed ill make up a shakedown here by the stove and keep the fire going  rivers sullenly acquiesced and blanche lay down without removing her outside garments in the same bed in which she had slept that first night in this wild landthat beautiful buoyant spring night how far away it all was now  rivers heaped blankets upon her and tenderly tucked her in whispered goodnight and without a word to bailey rolled himself in a fur robe and stretched himself on his creaking narrow couch  so in the darkness while the storm intensified with shrieking wild voices with whistling roar and fluttering tumult bailey gave his whole thought to the elemental war within his mind went out first to burke who seemed some way to be the wronged man and chief sufferer cut off from help alone in the cold and snow by contrast rivers seemed lustful and savage and treacherous  such a drama had never before come into baileys life he had read of somewhat similar cases in the papers and had passed harsh judgment on the man and woman he had called the woman wanton and the man a villain but here the verdict was less easy to render he liked mrs burke and he loved his friend he had looked into their faces many times during the last six months without detecting any signs of degradation on the contrary blanche had apparently grown in womanly qualities and as for jim he had never been more manly more generous and kind if their acts were crimes why could they remain so clear of eye  without reaching a conclusion he put the question from him and willed himself to sleep  when he awoke it was morning but there was no change in the wind except in an increase of its ferocity the roar was still steady highkeyed relentless a myriad new voices seemed to have joined the screaming tumult the cold was still intense  he looked at his watch and found it marking the hour of sunrise but there was no light the world was only a gray waste he renewed the fire and began preparations for breakfast his sturdy heart undismayed by the demons without rivers awakened by the clatter of dishes rose and scraped a peephole in a windowpane nothing could be seen but a chaos of snow  no moving out of here today he muttered with a sullen curse  bailey assumed a cheerful tone  no were in for another day of it  inwardly he was appalled at the thought of what the long hours might bring to him to spend twentyfour hours more in this terrible constraint would be ghastly he set about the attempt to break it up he whistled and sang at his work calling out to his partner as if there were no evil passions between them  this is the fourth blizzard this month good thing they didnt come last winter this land wouldnt have been settled at all what do you suppose these poor squatters will do  rivers did not respond  blanche tried to rise but turned white and dizzy and fell back upon the bed seized with a sudden weakness rivers brought her some tea and sat by her side while bailey again toasted some bread for her she looked very weak and ill  bailey went out to feed the horses glad of the chance to escape his problem for a moment finding rivers still sullen upon his return he got out some old magazines and read them aloud rivers swore under his breath but blanche listened to the reading with relief the stories dealt mostly with young people who wished to marry but were prevented by somebody who wished them to wed according to their station they were innocent creatures who had not known any other attachment and their bliss was always complete and unalloyed at the end  bailey read the tender passages in the same prosaic tone with which he described the shipwreck and his elocution would have been funny to any other group of persons as it was neither of his hearers smiled  blanches heart was filled with rebellion why could she not have known jim in the days when she too was young and innocent like the heroines of these stories  at noon when rivers went out to feed the team bailey went over toward the wretched woman his face was kind but firm  mrs burke i hope youve decided not to do this thing  she looked at him with shrinking eyes  what do you mean  i mean you cant afford to go away with jim this way  what else can i do i cant live without him and i cant go back  well then go away alone go back to your folks  oh i cant do that cant you see she said finding words with effortcant you see i must go jim is my real husband i must be true to him now my folks cant help menobody can help me but jimif he stands by me i can live she stopped feeling sure she had explained nothing it was so hard to find words  there must be some way out of it he replied and his hesitation helped her she saw that he was thinking upon the problem and found it not at all a clear case against her  after rivers came back they resumed their seats about the fire talking about the stormat least bailey talked and rivers had the grace to listen he really seemed less sullen and more thoughtful  outside the warring winds howled on the eye could not penetrate the veils of snow which streamed through the air on level lines the powdered ice rose from the ground in waves which buffeted one another and fell in spray only to rise again in ceaseless tumultuous action there was no sky and no earth everything slid sifted drifted or madly swirled  the three prisoners fell at last into silence they sat in the dim yellowgray dusk and stared gloomily at the stove growing each moment more repellent to one another they met one anothers eyes at intervals with surprise and horror the world without seemed utterly lost wailing voices sobbed in the pipe and at the windows sudden agonized shrieks came out of the blur of sound the hours drew out to enormous length though the day was short the windows were furred deep with frost at four oclock it was dark and as he placed the lamp on the table bailey said  well jim were in for another night of it  rivers leaped up as if he had been struck  yes curse it it looks as if it would never let up again he raged up and down the room with the spirit of blasphemy burning in his eyes i wish id never seen the accursed country  will you go feed the team or shall i bailey quietly interrupted  ill go and he went out into the storm with savage resolution while bailey prepared supper  the storm is sure to end tonight he said as they were preparing for sleep as before blanche lay down upon the bed rivers took the bunk and bailey camped upon the floor content to see his partner well bestowed  blanche unable to sleep lay for a long time listening to the storm thinking disconnectedly on the past and the morrow the strain upon her was twisting her toward insanity the neverresting wind appalled her it was like the iron resolution of the two men she saw no end to this elemental strife it was the cyclone of july frozen into snow only more relentless more persistenta tornado of frost it filled her with such awe as she had never felt before it seemed as if she must not sleepthat she must keep awake for the sake of the little heart of which she had been made the guardian  as she lay thus a sudden mysterious exaltation came upon her and she grew warm and happy she cared no longer for any mans opinion of her she was a mother and god said to her be peaceful and hopeful light fell around her and the pleasant odors of flowers she looked through sunny vistas of oaks and appletrees bees hummed in the clover and she began to sing with them and her low humming song melted into the roar of the storm she saw birds flying like butterflies over fields of daisies and her song grew louder it became sweet and maternalfull of lullaby cadences as she lay thus lovely and careless and sinless as a prattling babe her eyes fixed upon the gleam of lights in the dark a shaking hand was laid on her shoulder and rivers spoke in anxious voice  what is it blancheare you sick  she looked at him drowsily and at last slowly said no jimi am happy see my baby there in the sunshine isnt she lovely  the man grew rigid with fear and the hair of his head moved he thought her deliriousdying perhaps of cold he gathered her hands in his and fell upon his knees  what is it dear what do you mean  nothing nothing she murmured  youre sure youre not worse cant i help you  she did not reply and he knelt there holding her hands until she sank into unmistakably quiet sleep  he feared the unspeakable he imagined her taken in premature childbirth brought on by exposure and excitement and for the first time he took upon himself the burden of his guilt the thought of danger to her had not hitherto troubled him for the poor weak fool of a husband he cared nothing but this woman was his and the child to come was his birthof which many men make a jestsuddenly took on majesty and terror and the little life seemed about to enter a world of storm which filled him with a sense of duty new to him  he bent down and laid his cheek against his womans hands and his throat choked with a passionate resolution he put his merry careless young manhood behind him at that moment and assumed the responsibilities of a husband  may god strike me dead if i dont make you happy he whispered     vii  conclusion   bailey woke in the night chilled the fire was low and as he rose to add some coal to the stove he looked about him in his way rivers bunk was empty he glanced toward the bed and saw him wrapped in his buffalo coat kneeling beside blanches pillow he seemed asleep as his cheek rested upon his right hand which was clasped in both of hers  the young pioneer sat for several minutes thinking staring straight at his friend there was something here that made all the difference in the world suppose these people really loved each other as he loved estelle then he softly fed the fire and lay down again  his brain whirled as if some sharp blow had dazzled him outside the implacable winds still rushed and warred and beat and clamored shrieking wailing like voices from hell the snow dashed like surf against the walls it seemed to cut off the little cabin from the rest of the world and to dwarf all human action like the sea it made social conventions of no value and narrowed the question of morality to the relationship of these three human souls  lying there in the dark with the elemental war of wind and snow filling the illimitable arch of sky he came to feel in a dim wordless way that this tragedy was born of conventions largely also it appeared infinitesimal like the activities of insects battling breeding dying he came also to feel that the force which moved these animalculæ was akin to the ungovernable sweep of the wind and snowall inexplicable elemental unmoral  his thought came always back to the man kneeling there and the clasp of the womans handsthat baffled him subdued him  when he awoke it was light the roar of the wind continued but faint far away like the humming of a wire with the cold he lay bewildered half dreaming not knowing what it was that had impressed him with this unwonted feeling of doubt and weariness at last he heard a movement in the room and rose on his elbow rivers was awake and was peering out at the window  blanche replied to his words of greeting with a low murmuri feel very weak  she seemed calmer also and her eyes had lost something of their tension of appeal  bailey looked at her closely and his heart softened with pity he waited upon her and tried by his cheerful smiles to comfort her nevertheless  they ate breakfast in silence as if apprehending the struggle which was still to come  at last rivers rose with abrupt resolution  well now ill bring the team around and well get away  wait a minute jim bailey said i want to say something to you there was a note of pleading in his voice wait a little ive been thinking this thing over i dont want you to go away feeling hard toward me his throat choked up and his eyes grew dim i dont want to be hard on you jim its a mighty big question and im not one to be unjust specially toward a woman of course somebodys got to suffer but it hadnt ought to be the womanive made up my mind on that seems like the woman always does get the worst of it and i want you to think of her what is to become of her  blanche turned toward him with a wondrous looka look which made him shiver with emotion he looked down a moment and his struggle to speak made him seem very boyish and gentle  i cant exactly justify this trade jim but i guess it all depends on the mother she ought to be happy anyway whether you are or not so if she thinks shed better go with you why i aint got a word to say  blanche gave a low cry a cry such as no woman had ever uttered in his presence and fell upon her knees before him  the cadence of her moan cut deep into his heart he realized for the first time some part of her suffering her temptations her eyes shone with a marvellous beauty he was awed by the rapt expression of her face  dont do that he stammered please get up  youre so good she breathed  oh no im not i dont knowi dont pretend to judgethats all yesterday i did but nowwell i leave the whole business with you and god please stand up  she rose but stood looking upon him with a fixed devouring look he had never seen tears in her eyes before she had been gay and sullen and tense and sad but now she was transfigured with some emotion he could not follow her eyes were soft and dark and her pale face sad and sweet was instinct with the tenderness of her coming maternity the sturdy plainsman thrilled with unutterable pity as he looked down upon her  there was a silence and then rivers came to baileys side and said brokenly  rob old man youve done me goodyou always have done me goodill be faithful to her so help me god  bailey understood him and shook his hand they stood for a moment palm to palm as if this were in some sense a marriage ceremony bailey broke the tension by saying  well now get your teami wouldnt let you take her out into the cold only i know she ought to be where a doctor can be reached the quicker you go the better  while rivers was gone he turned to her and helped her with her cloak and shawl his heart went out toward her with a brothers love he talked with cheerful irrelevancy and bustled about heating a bowlder for her feet and warming her overshoes  now its all right jim will take care of you dont worry about will ill go over and see him he wrapped her in every available blanket and shawl and at last helped her outside and into the sleigh he tucked the robe around her while rivers held the restless horses his voice trembled as he said  now jim get her under shelter as quick as you can leave the team at wheatland ill come after it in a day or two i want to see somebody in town anyway  the woman turned toward him he saw her eyes shine through her veil she bared her hand and extended it toward him i hope you and estelle will be happy  he covered her hand with both of his the gesture was swift and tender it seemed to shield and forgive then drawing the robe over it without a word he briskly said well jim i guess this is the fork in the road and he looked at his chum with misty eyes rivers turned away and they again clasped hands without looking at each other  goodbye old man said rivers  goodbye jim and good luck  bailey saw his partner draw the woman close down under the shelter of his shoulder while his powerful hand whirled the team to the south  he stood in the lee of the shanty until the swift sleigh was a slowly moving speck on the plain then he went in and sat down to muse on the wondrous last look in the womans eyes i wonder what estelle will say he asked himself and a sense of loneliness of longing to see her filled his heart with dreams   the end
