27361295	crome yellow  by aldous huxley     chapter i  along this particular stretch of line no express had ever passed all the trainsthe few that there werestopped at all the stations denis knew the names of those stations by heart bole tritton spavin delawarr knipswich for timpany west bowlby and finally camletonthewater camlet was where he always got out leaving the train to creep indolently onward goodness only knew whither into the green heart of england  they were snorting out of west bowlby now it was the next station thank heaven denis took his chattels off the rack and piled them neatly in the corner opposite his own a futile proceeding but one must have something to do when he had finished he sank back into his seat and closed his eyes it was extremely hot  oh this journey it was two hours cut clean out of his life two hours in which he might have done so much so muchwritten the perfect poem for example or read the one illuminating book instead of whichhis gorge rose at the smell of the dusty cushions against which he was leaning  two hours one hundred and twenty minutes anything might be done in that time anything nothing oh he had had hundreds of hours and what had he done with them wasted them spilt the precious minutes as though his reservoir were inexhaustible denis groaned in the spirit condemned himself utterly with all his works what right had he to sit in the sunshine to occupy corner seats in thirdclass carriages to be alive none none none  misery and a nameless nostalgic distress possessed him he was twentythree and oh so agonizingly conscious of the fact  the train came bumpingly to a halt here was camlet at last denis jumped up crammed his hat over his eyes deranged his pile of baggage leaned out of the window and shouted for a porter seized a bag in either hand and had to put them down again in order to open the door when at last he had safely bundled himself and his baggage on to the platform he ran up the train towards the van  a bicycle a bicycle he said breathlessly to the guard he felt himself a man of action the guard paid no attention but continued methodically to hand out one by one the packages labelled to camlet a bicycle denis repeated a green machine crossframed name of stone stone  all in good time sir said the guard soothingly he was a large stately man with a naval beard one pictured him at home drinking tea surrounded by a numerous family it was in that tone that he must have spoken to his children when they were tiresome all in good time sir deniss man of action collapsed punctured  he left his luggage to be called for later and pushed off on his bicycle he always took his bicycle when he went into the country it was part of the theory of exercise one day one would get up at six oclock and pedal away to kenilworth or stratfordonavonanywhere and within a radius of twenty miles there were always norman churches and tudor mansions to be seen in the course of an afternoons excursion somehow they never did get seen but all the same it was nice to feel that the bicycle was there and that one fine morning one really might get up at six  once at the top of the long hill which led up from camlet station he felt his spirits mounting the world he found was good the faraway blue hills the harvests whitening on the slopes of the ridge along which his road led him the treeless skylines that changed as he movedyes they were all good he was overcome by the beauty of those deeply embayed combes scooped in the flanks of the ridge beneath him curves curves he repeated the word slowly trying as he did so to find some term in which to give expression to his appreciation curvesno that was inadequate he made a gesture with his hand as though to scoop the achieved expression out of the air and almost fell off his bicycle what was the word to describe the curves of those little valleys they were as fine as the lines of a human body they were informed with the subtlety of art  galbe that was a good word but it was french le galbe evase de ses hanches had one ever read a french novel in which that phrase didnt occur some day he would compile a dictionary for the use of novelists galbe gonfle goulu parfum peau pervers potele pudeur vertu volupte  but he really must find that word curves curvesthose little valleys had the lines of a cup moulded round a womans breast they seemed the dinted imprints of some huge divine body that had rested on these hills cumbrous locutions these but through them he seemed to be getting nearer to what he wanted dinted dimpled wimpledhis mind wandered down echoing corridors of assonance and alliteration ever further and further from the point he was enamoured with the beauty of words  becoming once more aware of the outer world he found himself on the crest of a descent the road plunged down steep and straight into a considerable valley there on the opposite slope a little higher up the valley stood crome his destination he put on his brakes this view of crome was pleasant to linger over the facade with its three projecting towers rose precipitously from among the dark trees of the garden the house basked in full sunlight the old brick rosily glowed how ripe and rich it was how superbly mellow and at the same time how austere the hill was becoming steeper and steeper he was gaining speed in spite of his brakes he loosed his grip of the levers and in a moment was rushing headlong down five minutes later he was passing through the gate of the great courtyard the front door stood hospitably open he left his bicycle leaning against the wall and walked in he would take them by surprise    chapter ii  he took nobody by surprise there was nobody to take all was quiet denis wandered from room to empty room looking with pleasure at the familiar pictures and furniture at all the little untidy signs of life that lay scattered here and there he was rather glad that they were all out it was amusing to wander through the house as though one were exploring a dead deserted pompeii what sort of life would the excavator reconstruct from these remains how would he people these empty chambers there was the long gallery with its rows of respectable and though of course one couldnt publicly admit it rather boring italian primitives its chinese sculptures its unobtrusive dateless furniture there was the panelled drawingroom where the huge chintzcovered armchairs stood oases of comfort among the austere fleshmortifying antiques there was the morningroom with its pale lemon walls its painted venetian chairs and rococo tables its mirrors its modern pictures there was the library cool spacious and dark booklined from floor to ceiling rich in portentous folios there was the diningroom solidly portwinily english with its great mahogany table its eighteenthcentury chairs and sideboard its eighteenthcentury picturesfamily portraits meticulous animal paintings what could one reconstruct from such data there was much of henry wimbush in the long gallery and the library something of anne perhaps in the morningroom that was all among the accumulations of ten generations the living had left but few traces  lying on the table in the morningroom he saw his own book of poems what tact he picked it up and opened it it was what the reviewers call a slim volume he read at hazard  but silence and the topless dark vault in the lights of luna park and blackpool from the nightly gloom hollows a bright tumultuous tomb  he put it down again shook his head and sighed what genius i had then he reflected echoing the aged swift it was nearly six months since the book had been published he was glad to think he would never write anything of the same sort again who could have been reading it he wondered anne perhaps he liked to think so perhaps too she had at last recognised herself in the hamadryad of the poplar sapling the slim hamadryad whose movements were like the swaying of a young tree in the wind the woman who was a tree was what he had called the poem he had given her the book when it came out hoping that the poem would tell her what he hadnt dared to say she had never referred to it  he shut his eyes and saw a vision of her in a red velvet cloak swaying into the little restaurant where they sometimes dined together in londonthree quarters of an hour late and he at his table haggard with anxiety irritation hunger oh she was damnable  it occurred to him that perhaps his hostess might be in her boudoir it was a possibility he would go and see mrs wimbushs boudoir was in the central tower on the garden front a little staircase corkscrewed up to it from the hall denis mounted tapped at the door come in ah she was there he had rather hoped she wouldnt be he opened the door  priscilla wimbush was lying on the sofa a blottingpad rested on her knees and she was thoughtfully sucking the end of a silver pencil  hullo she said looking up id forgotten you were coming  well here i am im afraid said denis deprecatingly im awfully sorry  mrs wimbush laughed her voice her laughter were deep and masculine everything about her was manly she had a large square middleaged face with a massive projecting nose and little greenish eyes the whole surmounted by a lofty and elaborate coiffure of a curiously improbable shade of orange looking at her denis always thought of wilkie bard as the cantatrice  thats why im going to sing in opra sing in opra sing in oppoppoppoppoppopera  today she was wearing a purple silk dress with a high collar and a row of pearls the costume so richly dowagerish so suggestive of the royal family made her look more than ever like something on the halls  what have you been doing all this time she asked  well said denis and he hesitated almost voluptuously he had a tremendously amusing account of london and its doings all ripe and ready in his mind it would be a pleasure to give it utterance to begin with he said  but he was too late mrs wimbushs question had been what the grammarians call rhetorical it asked for no answer it was a little conversational flourish a gambit in the polite game  you find me busy at my horoscopes she said without even being aware that she had interrupted him  a little pained denis decided to reserve his story for more receptive ears he contented himself by way of revenge with saying oh rather icily  did i tell you how i won four hundred on the grand national this year  yes he replied still frigid and monosyllabic she must have told him at least six times  wonderful isnt it everything is in the stars in the old days before i had the stars to help me i used to lose thousands nowshe paused an instantwell look at that four hundred on the grand national thats the stars  denis would have liked to hear more about the old days but he was too discreet and still more too shy to ask there had been something of a bust up that was all he knew old priscillanot so old then of course and sprightlierhad lost a great deal of money dropped it in handfuls and hatfuls on every racecourse in the country she had gambled too the number of thousands varied in the different legends but all put it high henry wimbush was forced to sell some of his primitivesa taddeo da poggibonsi an amico di taddeo and four or five nameless sieneseto the americans there was a crisis for the first time in his life henry asserted himself and with good effect it seemed  priscillas gay and gadding existence had come to an abrupt end nowadays she spent almost all her time at crome cultivating a rather illdefined malady for consolation she dallied with new thought and the occult her passion for racing still possessed her and henry who was a kindhearted fellow at bottom allowed her forty pounds a month betting money most of priscillas days were spent in casting the horoscopes of horses and she invested her money scientifically as the stars dictated she betted on football too and had a large notebook in which she registered the horoscopes of all the players in all the teams of the league the process of balancing the horoscopes of two elevens one against the other was a very delicate and difficult one a match between the spurs and the villa entailed a conflict in the heavens so vast and so complicated that it was not to be wondered at if she sometimes made a mistake about the outcome  such a pity you dont believe in these things denis such a pity said mrs wimbush in her deep distinct voice  i cant say i feel it so  ah thats because you dont know what its like to have faith youve no idea how amusing and exciting life becomes when you do believe all that happens means something nothing you do is ever insignificant it makes life so jolly you know here am i at crome dull as ditchwater youd think but no i dont find it so i dont regret the old days a bit i have the stars she picked up the sheet of paper that was lying on the blottingpad inmans horoscope she explained i thought id like to have a little fling on the billiards championship this autumn i have the infinite to keep in tune with she waved her hand and then theres the next world and all the spirits and ones aura and mrs eddy and saying youre not ill and the christian mysteries and mrs besant its all splendid ones never dull for a moment i cant think how i used to get on beforein the old days pleasurerunning about thats all it was just running about lunch tea dinner theatre supper every day it was fun of course while it lasted but there wasnt much left of it afterwards theres rather a good thing about that in barbecuesmiths new book where is it  she sat up and reached for a book that was lying on the little table by the head of the sofa  do you know him by the way she asked  who  mr barbecuesmith  denis knew of him vaguely barbecuesmith was a name in the sunday papers he wrote about the conduct of life he might even be the author of what a young girl ought to know  no not personally he said  ive invited him for next weekend she turned over the pages of the book heres the passage i was thinking of i marked it i always mark the things i like  holding the book almost at arms length for she was somewhat longsighted and making suitable gestures with her free hand she began to read slowly dramatically  what are thousand pound fur coats what are quarter million incomes she looked up from the page with a histrionic movement of the head her orange coiffure nodded portentously denis looked at it fascinated was it the real thing and henna he wondered or was it one of those complete transformations one sees in the advertisements  what are thrones and sceptres  the orange transformationyes it must be a transformationbobbed up again  what are the gaieties of the rich the splendours of the powerful what is the pride of the great what are the gaudy pleasures of high society  the voice which had risen in tone questioningly from sentence to sentence dropped suddenly and boomed reply  they are nothing vanity fluff dandelion seed in the wind thin vapours of fever the things that matter happen in the heart seen things are sweet but those unseen are a thousand times more significant it is the unseen that counts in life  mrs wimbush lowered the book beautiful isnt it she said  denis preferred not to hazard an opinion but uttered a noncommittal hm  ah its a fine book this a beautiful book said priscilla as she let the pages flick back one by one from under her thumb and heres the passage about the lotus pool he compares the soul to a lotus pool you know she held up the book again and read a friend of mine has a lotus pool in his garden it lies in a little dell embowered with wild roses and eglantine among which the nightingale pours forth its amorous descant all the summer long within the pool the lotuses blossom and the birds of the air come to drink and bathe themselves in its crystal waters ah and that reminds me priscilla exclaimed shutting the book with a clap and uttering her big profound laughthat reminds me of the things that have been going on in our bathingpool since you were here last we gave the village people leave to come and bathe here in the evenings youve no idea of the things that happened  she leaned forward speaking in a confidential whisper every now and then she uttered a deep gurgle of laughter mixed bathingsaw them out of my windowsent for a pair of fieldglasses to make sureno doubt of it the laughter broke out again denis laughed too barbecuesmith was tossed on the floor  its time we went to see if teas ready said priscilla she hoisted herself up from the sofa and went swishing off across the room striding beneath the trailing silk denis followed her faintly humming to himself       thats why im going to sing in opra sing in opra      sing in oppoppoppoppopera  and then the little twiddly bit of accompaniment at the end rara    chapter iii  the terrace in front of the house was a long narrow strip of turf bounded along its outer edge by a graceful stone balustrade two little summerhouses of brick stood at either end below the house the ground sloped very steeply away and the terrace was a remarkably high one from the balusters to the sloping lawn beneath was a drop of thirty feet seen from below the high unbroken terrace wall built like the house itself of brick had the almost menacing aspect of a fortificationa castle bastion from whose parapet one looked out across airy depths to distances level with the eye below in the foreground hedged in by solid masses of sculptured yew trees lay the stonebrimmed swimmingpool beyond it stretched the park with its massive elms its green expanses of grass and at the bottom of the valley the gleam of the narrow river on the farther side of the stream the land rose again in a long slope chequered with cultivation looking up the valley to the right one saw a line of blue faroff hills  the teatable had been planted in the shade of one of the little summerhouses and the rest of the party was already assembled about it when denis and priscilla made their appearance henry wimbush had begun to pour out the tea he was one of those ageless unchanging men on the farther side of fifty who might be thirty who might be anything denis had known him almost as long as he could remember in all those years his pale rather handsome face had never grown any older it was like the pale grey bowler hat which he always wore winter and summerunageing calm serenely without expression  next him but separated from him and from the rest of the world by the almost impenetrable barriers of her deafness sat jenny mullion she was perhaps thirty had a tilted nose and a pinkandwhite complexion and wore her brown hair plaited and coiled in two lateral buns over her ears in the secret tower of her deafness she sat apart looking down at the world through sharply piercing eyes what did she think of men and women and things that was something that denis had never been able to discover in her enigmatic remoteness jenny was a little disquieting even now some interior joke seemed to be amusing her for she was smiling to herself and her brown eyes were like very bright round marbles  on his other side the serious moonlike innocence of mary bracegirdles face shone pink and childish she was nearly twentythree but one wouldnt have guessed it her short hair clipped like a pages hung in a bell of elastic gold about her cheeks she had large blue china eyes whose expression was one of ingenuous and often puzzled earnestness  next to mary a small gaunt man was sitting rigid and erect in his chair in appearance mr scogan was like one of those extinct birdlizards of the tertiary his nose was beaked his dark eye had the shining quickness of a robins but there was nothing soft or gracious or feathery about him the skin of his wrinkled brown face had a dry and scaly look his hands were the hands of a crocodile his movements were marked by the lizards disconcertingly abrupt clockwork speed his speech was thin fluty and dry henry wimbushs schoolfellow and exact contemporary mr scogan looked far older and at the same time far more youthfully alive than did that gentle aristocrat with the face like a grey bowler  mr scogan might look like an extinct saurian but gombauld was altogether and essentially human in the oldfashioned natural histories of the thirties he might have figured in a steel engraving as a type of homo sapiensan honour which at that time commonly fell to lord byron indeed with more hair and less collar gombauld would have been completely byronicmore than byronic even for gombauld was of provencal descent a blackhaired young corsair of thirty with flashing teeth and luminous large dark eyes denis looked at him enviously he was jealous of his talent if only he wrote verse as well as gombauld painted pictures still more at the moment he envied gombauld his looks his vitality his easy confidence of manner was it surprising that anne should like him like himit might even be something worse denis reflected bitterly as he walked at priscillas side down the long grass terrace  between gombauld and mr scogan a very much lowered deckchair presented its back to the new arrivals as they advanced towards the teatable gombauld was leaning over it his face moved vivaciously he smiled he laughed he made quick gestures with his hands from the depths of the chair came up a sound of soft lazy laughter denis started as he heard it that laughterhow well he knew it what emotions it evoked in him he quickened his pace  in her low deckchair anne was nearer to lying than to sitting her long slender body reposed in an attitude of listless and indolent grace within its setting of light brown hair her face had a pretty regularity that was almost dolllike and indeed there were moments when she seemed nothing more than a doll when the oval face with its longlashed pale blue eyes expressed nothing when it was no more than a lazy mask of wax she was henry wimbushs own niece that bowlerlike countenance was one of the wimbush heirlooms it ran in the family appearing in its female members as a blank dollface but across this dollish mask like a gay melody dancing over an unchanging fundamental bass passed annes other inheritancequick laughter light ironic amusement and the changing expressions of many moods she was smiling now as denis looked down at her her cats smile he called it for no very good reason the mouth was compressed and on either side of it two tiny wrinkles had formed themselves in her cheeks an infinity of slightly malicious amusement lurked in those little folds in the puckers about the halfclosed eyes in the eyes themselves bright and laughing between the narrowed lids  the preliminary greetings spoken denis found an empty chair between gombauld and jenny and sat down  how are you jenny he shouted to her  jenny nodded and smiled in mysterious silence as though the subject of her health were a secret that could not be publicly divulged  hows london been since i went away anne inquired from the depth of her chair  the moment had come the tremendously amusing narrative was waiting for utterance well said denis smiling happily to begin with  has priscilla told you of our great antiquarian find henry wimbush leaned forward the most promising of buds was nipped  to begin with said denis desperately there was the ballet  last week mr wimbush went on softly and implacably we dug up fifty yards of oaken drainpipes just tree trunks with a hole bored through the middle very interesting indeed whether they were laid down by the monks in the fifteenth century or whether  denis listened gloomily extraordinary he said when mr wimbush had finished quite extraordinary he helped himself to another slice of cake he didnt even want to tell his tale about london now he was damped  for some time past marys grave blue eyes had been fixed upon him what have you been writing lately she asked it would be nice to have a little literary conversation  oh verse and prose said denisjust verse and prose  prose mr scogan pounced alarmingly on the word youve been writing prose  yes  not a novel  yes  my poor denis exclaimed mr scogan what about  denis felt rather uncomfortable oh about the usual things you know  of course mr scogan groaned ill describe the plot for you little percy the hero was never good at games but he was always clever he passes through the usual public school and the usual university and comes to london where he lives among the artists he is bowed down with melancholy thought he carries the whole weight of the universe upon his shoulders he writes a novel of dazzling brilliance he dabbles delicately in amour and disappears at the end of the book into the luminous future  denis blushed scarlet mr scogan had described the plan of his novel with an accuracy that was appalling he made an effort to laugh youre entirely wrong he said my novel is not in the least like that it was a heroic lie luckily he reflected only two chapters were written he would tear them up that very evening when he unpacked  mr scogan paid no attention to his denial but went on why will you young men continue to write about things that are so entirely uninteresting as the mentality of adolescents and artists professional anthropologists might find it interesting to turn sometimes from the beliefs of the blackfellow to the philosophical preoccupations of the undergraduate but you cant expect an ordinary adult man like myself to be much moved by the story of his spiritual troubles and after all even in england even in germany and russia there are more adults than adolescents as for the artist he is preoccupied with problems that are so utterly unlike those of the ordinary adult manproblems of pure aesthetics which dont so much as present themselves to people like myselfthat a description of his mental processes is as boring to the ordinary reader as a piece of pure mathematics a serious book about artists regarded as artists is unreadable and a book about artists regarded as lovers husbands dipsomaniacs heroes and the like is really not worth writing again jeanchristophe is the stock artist of literature just as professor radium of comic cuts is its stock man of science  im sorry to hear im as uninteresting as all that said gombauld  not at all my dear gombauld mr scogan hastened to explain as a lover or a dipsomaniac ive no doubt of your being a most fascinating specimen but as a combiner of forms you must honestly admit it youre a bore  i entirely disagree with you exclaimed mary she was somehow always out of breath when she talked and her speech was punctuated by little gasps ive known a great many artists and ive always found their mentality very interesting especially in paris tschuplitski for examplei saw a great deal of tschuplitski in paris this spring  ah but then youre an exception mary youre an exception said mr scogan you are a femme superieure  a flush of pleasure turned marys face into a harvest moon    chapter iv  denis woke up next morning to find the sun shining the sky serene he decided to wear white flannel trouserswhite flannel trousers and a black jacket with a silk shirt and his new peachcoloured tie and what shoes white was the obvious choice but there was something rather pleasing about the notion of black patent leather he lay in bed for several minutes considering the problem  before he went downpatent leather was his final choicehe looked at himself critically in the glass his hair might have been more golden he reflected as it was its yellowness had the hint of a greenish tinge in it but his forehead was good his forehead made up in height what his chin lacked in prominence his nose might have been longer but it would pass his eyes might have been blue and not green but his coat was very well cut and discreetly padded made him seem robuster than he actually was his legs in their white casing were long and elegant satisfied he descended the stairs most of the party had already finished their breakfast he found himself alone with jenny  i hope you slept well he said  yes isnt it lovely jenny replied giving two rapid little nods but we had such awful thunderstorms last week  parallel straight lines denis reflected meet only at infinity he might talk for ever of carecharmer sleep and she of meteorology till the end of time did one ever establish contact with anyone we are all parallel straight lines jenny was only a little more parallel than most  they are very alarming these thunderstorms he said helping himself to porridge dont you think so or are you above being frightened  no i always go to bed in a storm one is so much safer lying down  why  because said jenny making a descriptive gesture because lightning goes downwards and not flat ways when youre lying down youre out of the current  thats very ingenious  its true  there was a silence denis finished his porridge and helped himself to bacon for lack of anything better to say and because mr scogans absurd phrase was for some reason running in his head he turned to jenny and asked  do you consider yourself a femme superieure he had to repeat the question several times before jenny got the hang of it  no she said rather indignantly when at last she heard what denis was saying certainly not has anyone been suggesting that i am  no said denis mr scogan told mary she was one  did he jenny lowered her voice shall i tell you what i think of that man i think hes slightly sinister  having made this pronouncement she entered the ivory tower of her deafness and closed the door denis could not induce her to say anything more could not induce her even to listen she just smiled at him smiled and occasionally nodded  denis went out on to the terrace to smoke his afterbreakfast pipe and to read his morning paper an hour later when anne came down she found him still reading by this time he had got to the court circular and the forthcoming weddings he got up to meet her as she approached a hamadryad in white muslin across the grass  why denis she exclaimed you look perfectly sweet in your white trousers  denis was dreadfully taken aback there was no possible retort you speak as though i were a child in a new frock he said with a show of irritation  but thats how i feel about you denis dear  then you oughtnt to  but i cant help it im so much older than you  i like that he said four years older  and if you do look perfectly sweet in your white trousers why shouldnt i say so and why did you put them on if you didnt think you were going to look sweet in them  lets go into the garden said denis he was put out the conversation had taken such a preposterous and unexpected turn he had planned a very different opening in which he was to lead off with you look adorable this morning or something of the kind and she was to answer do i and then there was to be a pregnant silence and now she had got in first with the trousers it was provoking his pride was hurt  that part of the garden that sloped down from the foot of the terrace to the pool had a beauty which did not depend on colour so much as on forms it was as beautiful by moonlight as in the sun the silver of water the dark shapes of yew and ilex trees remained at all hours and seasons the dominant features of the scene it was a landscape in black and white for colour there was the flowergarden it lay to one side of the pool separated from it by a huge babylonian wall of yews you passed through a tunnel in the hedge you opened a wicket in a wall and you found yourself startlingly and suddenly in the world of colour the july borders blazed and flared under the sun within its high brick walls the garden was like a great tank of warmth and perfume and colour  denis held open the little iron gate for his companion its like passing from a cloister into an oriental palace he said and took a deep breath of the warm flowerscented air in fragrant volleys they let fly how does it go  well shot ye firemen oh how sweet and round your equal fires do meet whose shrill report no ear can tell but echoes to the eye and smell  you have a bad habit of quoting said anne as i never know the context or author i find it humiliating  denis apologized its the fault of ones education things somehow seem more real and vivid when one can apply somebody elses readymade phrase about them and then there are lots of lovely names and wordsmonophysite iamblichus pomponazzi you bring them out triumphantly and feel youve clinched the argument with the mere magical sound of them thats what comes of the higher education  you may regret your education said anne im ashamed of my lack of it look at those sunflowers arent they magnificent  dark faces and golden crownstheyre kings of ethiopia and i like the way the tits cling to the flowers and pick out the seeds while the other loutish birds grubbing dirtily for their food look up in envy from the ground do they look up in envy thats the literary touch im afraid education again it always comes back to that he was silent  anne had sat down on a bench that stood in the shade of an old apple tree im listening she said  he did not sit down but walked backwards and forwards in front of the bench gesticulating a little as he talked books he saidbooks one reads so many and one sees so few people and so little of the world great thick books about the universe and the mind and ethics youve no idea how many there are i must have read twenty or thirty tons of them in the last five years twenty tons of ratiocination weighted with that ones pushed out into the world  he went on walking up and down his voice rose fell was silent a moment and then talked on he moved his hands sometimes he waved his arms anne looked and listened quietly as though she were at a lecture he was a nice boy and today he looked charmingcharming  one entered the world denis pursued having readymade ideas about everything one had a philosophy and tried to make life fit into it one should have lived first and then made ones philosophy to fit lifelife facts things were horribly complicated ideas even the most difficult of them deceptively simple in the world of ideas everything was clear in life all was obscure embroiled was it surprising that one was miserable horribly unhappy denis came to a halt in front of the bench and as he asked this last question he stretched out his arms and stood for an instant in an attitude of crucifixion then let them fall again to his sides  my poor denis anne was touched he was really too pathetic as he stood there in front of her in his white flannel trousers but does one suffer about these things it seems very extraordinary  youre like scogan cried denis bitterly you regard me as a specimen for an anthropologist well i suppose i am  no no she protested and drew in her skirt with a gesture that indicated that he was to sit down beside her he sat down why cant you just take things for granted and as they come she asked its so much simpler  of course it is said denis but its a lesson to be learnt gradually there are the twenty tons of ratiocination to be got rid of first  ive always taken things as they come said anne it seems so obvious one enjoys the pleasant things avoids the nasty ones theres nothing more to be said  nothingfor you but then you were born a pagan i am trying laboriously to make myself one i can take nothing for granted i can enjoy nothing as it comes along beauty pleasure art womeni have to invent an excuse a justification for everything thats delightful otherwise i cant enjoy it with an easy conscience i make up a little story about beauty and pretend that it has something to do with truth and goodness i have to say that art is the process by which one reconstructs the divine reality out of chaos pleasure is one of the mystical roads to union with the infinitethe ecstasies of drinking dancing lovemaking as for women i am perpetually assuring myself that theyre the broad highway to divinity and to think that im only just beginning to see through the silliness of the whole thing its incredible to me that anyone should have escaped these horrors  its still more incredible to me said anne that anyone should have been a victim to them i should like to see myself believing that men are the highway to divinity the amused malice of her smile planted two little folds on either side of her mouth and through their halfclosed lids her eyes shone with laughter what you need denis is a nice plump young wife a fixed income and a little congenial but regular work  what i need is you that was what he ought to have retorted that was what he wanted passionately to say he could not say it his desire fought against his shyness what i need is you mentally he shouted the words but not a sound issued from his lips he looked at her despairingly couldnt she see what was going on inside him couldnt she understand what i need is you he would say it he wouldhe would  i think i shall go and bathe said anne its so hot the opportunity had passed    chapter v  mr wimbush had taken them to see the sights of the home farm and now they were standing all six of themhenry wimbush mr scogan denis gombauld anne and maryby the low wall of the piggery looking into one of the styes  this is a good sow said henry wimbush she had a litter of fourteen  fourteen mary echoed incredulously she turned astonished blue eyes towards mr wimbush then let them fall onto the seething mass of elan vital that fermented in the sty  an immense sow reposed on her side in the middle of the pen her round black belly fringed with a double line of dugs presented itself to the assault of an army of small brownishblack swine with a frantic greed they tugged at their mothers flank the old sow stirred sometimes uneasily or uttered a little grunt of pain one small pig the runt the weakling of the litter had been unable to secure a place at the banquet squealing shrilly he ran backwards and forwards trying to push in among his stronger brothers or even to climb over their tight little black backs towards the maternal reservoir  there are fourteen said mary youre quite right i counted its extraordinary  the sow next door mr wimbush went on has done very badly she only had five in her litter i shall give her another chance if she does no better next time i shall fat her up and kill her theres the boar he pointed towards a farther sty fine old beast isnt he but hes getting past his prime hell have to go too  how cruel anne exclaimed  but how practical how eminently realistic said mr scogan in this farm we have a model of sound paternal government make them breed make them work and when theyre past working or breeding or begetting slaughter them  farming seems to be mostly indecency and cruelty said anne  with the ferrule of his walkingstick denis began to scratch the boars long bristly back the animal moved a little so as to bring himself within easier range of the instrument that evoked in him such delicious sensations then he stood stock still softly grunting his contentment the mud of years flaked off his sides in a grey powdery scurf  what a pleasure it is said denis to do somebody a kindness i believe i enjoy scratching this pig quite as much as he enjoys being scratched if only one could always be kind with so little expense or trouble  a gate slammed there was a sound of heavy footsteps  morning rowley said henry wimbush  morning sir old rowley answered he was the most venerable of the labourers on the farma tall solid man still unbent with grey sidewhiskers and a steep dignified profile grave weighty in his manner splendidly respectable rowley had the air of a great english statesman of the midnineteenth century he halted on the outskirts of the group and for a moment they all looked at the pigs in a silence that was only broken by the sound of grunting or the squelch of a sharp hoof in the mire rowley turned at last slowly and ponderously and nobly as he did everything and addressed himself to henry wimbush  look at them sir he said with a motion of his hand towards the wallowing swine rightly is they called pigs  rightly indeed mr wimbush agreed  i am abashed by that man said mr scogan as old rowley plodded off slowly and with dignity what wisdom what judgment what a sense of values rightly are they called swine yes and i wish i could with as much justice say rightly are we called men  they walked on towards the cowsheds and the stables of the carthorses five white geese taking the air this fine morning even as they were doing met them in the way they hesitated cackled then converting their lifted necks into rigid horizontal snakes they rushed off in disorder hissing horribly as they went red calves paddled in the dung and mud of a spacious yard in another enclosure stood the bull massive as a locomotive he was a very calm bull and his face wore an expression of melancholy stupidity he gazed with reddishbrown eyes at his visitors chewed thoughtfully at the tangible memories of an earlier meal swallowed and regurgitated chewed again his tail lashed savagely from side to side it seemed to have nothing to do with his impassive bulk between his short horns was a triangle of red curls short and dense  splendid animal said henry wimbush pedigree stock but hes getting a little old like the boar  fat him up and slaughter him mr scogan pronounced with a delicate oldmaidish precision of utterance  couldnt you give the animals a little holiday from producing children asked anne im so sorry for the poor things  mr wimbush shook his head personally he said i rather like seeing fourteen pigs grow where only one grew before the spectacle of so much crude life is refreshing  im glad to hear you say so gombauld broke in warmly lots of life thats what we want i like pullulation everything ought to increase and multiply as hard as it can  gombauld grew lyrical everybody ought to have childrenanne ought to have them mary ought to have themdozens and dozens he emphasised his point by thumping with his walkingstick on the bulls leather flanks mr scogan ought to pass on his intelligence to little scogans and denis to little denises the bull turned his head to see what was happening regarded the drumming stick for several seconds then turned back again satisfied it seemed that nothing was happening sterility was odious unnatural a sin against life life life and still more life the ribs of the placid bull resounded  standing with his back against the farmyard pump a little apart denis examined the group gombauld passionate and vivacious was its centre the others stood round listeninghenry wimbush calm and polite beneath his grey bowler mary with parted lips and eyes that shone with the indignation of a convinced birthcontroller anne looked on through halfshut eyes smiling and beside her stood mr scogan bolt upright in an attitude of metallic rigidity that contrasted strangely with that fluid grace of hers which even in stillness suggested a soft movement  gombauld ceased talking and mary flushed and outraged opened her mouth to refute him but she was too slow before she could utter a word mr scogans fluty voice had pronounced the opening phrases of a discourse there was no hope of getting so much as a word in edgeways mary had perforce to resign herself  even your eloquence my dear gombauld he was sayingeven your eloquence must prove inadequate to reconvert the world to a belief in the delights of mere multiplication with the gramophone the cinema and the automatic pistol the goddess of applied science has presented the world with another gift more precious even than thesethe means of dissociating love from propagation eros for those who wish it is now an entirely free god his deplorable associations with lucina may be broken at will in the course of the next few centuries who knows the world may see a more complete severance i look forward to it optimistically where the great erasmus darwin and miss anna seward swan of lichfield experimentedand for all their scientific ardour failedour descendants will experiment and succeed an impersonal generation will take the place of natures hideous system in vast state incubators rows upon rows of gravid bottles will supply the world with the population it requires the family system will disappear society sapped at its very base will have to find new foundations and eros beautifully and irresponsibly free will flit like a gay butterfly from flower to flower through a sunlit world  it sounds lovely said anne  the distant future always does  marys china blue eyes more serious and more astonished than ever were fixed on mr scogan bottles she said do you really think so bottles    chapter vi  mr barbecuesmith arrived in time for tea on saturday afternoon he was a short and corpulent man with a very large head and no neck in his earlier middle age he had been distressed by this absence of neck but was comforted by reading in balzacs louis lambert that all the worlds great men have been marked by the same peculiarity and for a simple and obvious reason greatness is nothing more nor less than the harmonious functioning of the faculties of the head and heart the shorter the neck the more closely these two organs approach one another argalit was convincing  mr barbecuesmith belonged to the old school of journalists he sported a leonine head with a greyishblack mane of oddly unappetising hair brushed back from a broad but low forehead and somehow he always seemed slightly ever so slightly soiled in younger days he had gaily called himself a bohemian he did so no longer he was a teacher now a kind of prophet some of his books of comfort and spiritual teaching were in their hundred and twentieth thousand  priscilla received him with every mark of esteem he had never been to crome before she showed him round the house mr barbecuesmith was full of admiration  so quaint so oldworld he kept repeating he had a rich rather unctuous voice  priscilla praised his latest book splendid i thought it was she said in her large jolly way  im happy to think you found it a comfort said mr barbecuesmith  oh tremendously and the bit about the lotus pooli thought that so beautiful  i knew you would like that it came to me you know from without he waved his hand to indicate the astral world  they went out into the garden for tea mr barbecuesmith was duly introduced  mr stone is a writer too said priscilla as she introduced denis  indeed mr barbecuesmith smiled benignly and looking up at denis with an expression of olympian condescension and what sort of things do you write  denis was furious and to make matters worse he felt himself blushing hotly had priscilla no sense of proportion she was putting them in the same categorybarbecuesmith and himself they were both writers they both used pen and ink to mr barbecuesmiths question he answered oh nothing much nothing and looked away  mr stone is one of our younger poets it was annes voice he scowled at her and she smiled back exasperatingly  excellent excellent said mr barbecuesmith and he squeezed deniss arm encouragingly the bards is a noble calling  as soon as tea was over mr barbecuesmith excused himself he had to do some writing before dinner priscilla quite understood the prophet retired to his chamber  mr barbecuesmith came down to the drawingroom at ten to eight he was in a good humour and as he descended the stairs he smiled to himself and rubbed his large white hands together in the drawingroom someone was playing softly and ramblingly on the piano he wondered who it could be one of the young ladies perhaps but no it was only denis who got up hurriedly and with some embarrassment as he came into the room  do go on do go on said mr barbecuesmith i am very fond of music  then i couldnt possibly go on denis replied i only make noises  there was a silence mr barbecuesmith stood with his back to the hearth warming himself at the memory of last winters fires he could not control his interior satisfaction but still went on smiling to himself at last he turned to denis  you write he asked dont you  well yesa little you know  how many words do you find you can write in an hour  i dont think ive ever counted  oh you ought to you ought to its most important  denis exercised his memory when im in good form he said i fancy i do a twelvehundredword review in about four hours but sometimes it takes me much longer  mr barbecuesmith nodded yes three hundred words an hour at your best he walked out into the middle of the room turned round on his heels and confronted denis again guess how many words i wrote this evening between five and halfpast seven  i cant imagine  no but you must guess between five and halfpast seventhats two and a half hours  twelve hundred words denis hazarded  no no no mr barbecuesmiths expanded face shone with gaiety try again  fifteen hundred  no  i give it up said denis he found he couldnt summon up much interest in mr barbecuesmiths writing  well ill tell you three thousand eight hundred  denis opened his eyes you must get a lot done in a day he said  mr barbecuesmith suddenly became extremely confidential he pulled up a stool to the side of deniss armchair sat down in it and began to talk softly and rapidly  listen to me he said laying his hand on deniss sleeve you want to make your living by writing youre young youre inexperienced let me give you a little sound advice  what was the fellow going to do denis wondered give him an introduction to the editor of john o londons weekly or tell him where he could sell a light middle for seven guineas mr barbecuesmith patted his arm several times and went on  the secret of writing he said breathing it into the young mans earthe secret of writing is inspiration  denis looked at him in astonishment  inspiration mr barbecuesmith repeated  you mean the native woodnote business  mr barbecuesmith nodded  oh then i entirely agree with you said denis but what if one hasnt got inspiration  that was precisely the question i was waiting for said mr barbecuesmith you ask me what one should do if one hasnt got inspiration i answer you have inspiration everyone has inspiration its simply a question of getting it to function  the clock struck eight there was no sign of any of the other guests everybody was always late at crome mr barbecuesmith went on  thats my secret he said i give it you freely denis made a suitably grateful murmur and grimace ill help you to find your inspiration because i dont like to see a nice steady young man like you exhausting his vitality and wasting the best years of his life in a grinding intellectual labour that could be completely obviated by inspiration i did it myself so i know what its like up till the time i was thirtyeight i was a writer like youa writer without inspiration all i wrote i squeezed out of myself by sheer hard work why in those days i was never able to do more than sixfifty words an hour and whats more i often didnt sell what i wrote he sighed we artists he said parenthetically we intellectuals arent much appreciated here in england denis wondered if there was any method consistent of course with politeness by which he could dissociate himself from mr barbecuesmiths we there was none and besides it was too late now for mr barbecuesmith was once more pursuing the tenor of his discourse  at thirtyeight i was a poor struggling tired overworked unknown journalist now at fifty he paused modestly and made a little gesture moving his fat hands outwards away from one another and expanding his fingers as though in demonstration he was exhibiting himself denis thought of that advertisement of nestles milkthe two cats on the wall under the moon one black and thin the other white sleek and fat before inspiration and after  inspiration has made the difference said mr barbecuesmith solemnly it came quite suddenlylike a gentle dew from heaven he lifted his hand and let it fall back on to his knee to indicate the descent of the dew it was one evening i was writing my first little book about the conduct of lifehumble heroisms you may have read it it has been a comfortat least i hope and think soa comfort to many thousands i was in the middle of the second chapter and i was stuck fatigue overworki had only written a hundred words in the last hour and i could get no further i sat biting the end of my pen and looking at the electric light which hung above my table a little above and in front of me he indicated the position of the lamp with elaborate care have you ever looked at a bright light intently for a long time he asked turning to denis denis didnt think he had you can hypnotise yourself that way mr barbecuesmith went on  the gong sounded in a terrific crescendo from the hall still no sign of the others denis was horribly hungry  thats what happened to me said mr barbecuesmith i was hypnotised i lost consciousness like that he snapped his fingers when i came to i found that it was past midnight and i had written four thousand words four thousand he repeated opening his mouth very wide on the ou of thousand inspiration had come to me  what a very extraordinary thing said denis  i was afraid of it at first it didnt seem to me natural i didnt feel somehow that it was quite right quite fair i might almost say to produce a literary composition unconsciously besides i was afraid i might have written nonsense  and had you written nonsense denis asked  certainly not mr barbecuesmith replied with a trace of annoyance certainly not it was admirable just a few spelling mistakes and slips such as there generally are in automatic writing but the style the thoughtall the essentials were admirable after that inspiration came to me regularly i wrote the whole of humble heroisms like that it was a great success and so has everything been that i have written since he leaned forward and jabbed at denis with his finger thats my secret he said and thats how you could write too if you triedwithout effort fluently well  but how asked denis trying not to show how deeply he had been insulted by that final well  by cultivating your inspiration by getting into touch with your subconscious have you ever read my little book pipelines to the infinite  denis had to confess that that was precisely one of the few perhaps the only one of mr barbecuesmiths works he had not read  never mind never mind said mr barbecuesmith its just a little book about the connection of the subconscious with the infinite get into touch with the subconscious and you are in touch with the universe inspiration in fact you follow me  perfectly perfectly said denis but dont you find that the universe sometimes sends you very irrelevant messages  i dont allow it to mr barbecuesmith replied i canalise it i bring it down through pipes to work the turbines of my conscious mind  like niagara denis suggested some of mr barbecuesmiths remarks sounded strangely like quotationsquotations from his own works no doubt  precisely like niagara and this is how i do it he leaned forward and with a raised forefinger marked his points as he made them beating time as it were to his discourse before i go off into my trance i concentrate on the subject i wish to be inspired about let us say i am writing about the humble heroisms for ten minutes before i go into the trance i think of nothing but orphans supporting their little brothers and sisters of dull work well and patiently done and i focus my mind on such great philosophical truths as the purification and uplifting of the soul by suffering and the alchemical transformation of leaden evil into golden good denis again hung up his little festoon of quotation marks then i pop off two or three hours later i wake up again and find that inspiration has done its work thousands of words comforting uplifting words lie before me i type them out neatly on my machine and they are ready for the printer  it all sounds wonderfully simple said denis  it is all the great and splendid and divine things of life are wonderfully simple quotation marks again when i have to do my aphorisms mr barbecuesmith continued i prelude my trance by turning over the pages of any dictionary of quotations or shakespeare calendar that comes to hand that sets the key so to speak that ensures that the universe shall come flowing in not in a continuous rush but in aphorismic drops you see the idea  denis nodded mr barbecuesmith put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a notebook i did a few in the train today he said turning over the pages just dropped off into a trance in the corner of my carriage i find the train very conducive to good work here they are he cleared his throat and read  the mountain road may be steep but the air is pure up there and it is from the summit that one gets the view  the things that really matter happen in the heart  it was curious denis reflected the way the infinite sometimes repeated itself  seeing is believing yes but believing is also seeing if i believe in god i see god even in the things that seem to be evil  mr barbecuesmith looked up from his notebook that last one he said is particularly subtle and beautiful dont you think without inspiration i could never have hit on that he reread the apophthegm with a slower and more solemn utterance straight from the infinite he commented reflectively then addressed himself to the next aphorism  the flame of a candle gives light but it also burns  puzzled wrinkles appeared on mr barbecuesmiths forehead i dont exactly know what that means he said its very gnomic one could apply it of course to the higher educationilluminating but provoking the lower classes to discontent and revolution yes i suppose thats what it is but its gnomic its gnomic he rubbed his chin thoughtfully the gong sounded again clamorously it seemed imploringly dinner was growing cold it roused mr barbecuesmith from meditation he turned to denis  you understand me now when i advise you to cultivate your inspiration let your subconscious work for you turn on the niagara of the infinite  there was the sound of feet on the stairs mr barbecuesmith got up laid his hand for an instant on deniss shoulder and said  no more now another time and remember i rely absolutely on your discretion in this matter there are intimate sacred things that one doesnt wish to be generally known  of course said denis i quite understand    chapter vii  at crome all the beds were ancient hereditary pieces of furniture huge beds like fourmasted ships with furled sails of shining coloured stuff beds carved and inlaid beds painted and gilded beds of walnut and oak of rare exotic woods beds of every date and fashion from the time of sir ferdinando who built the house to the time of his namesake in the late eighteenth century the last of the family but all of them grandiose magnificent  the finest of all was now annes bed sir julius son to sir ferdinando had had it made in venice against his wifes first lyingin early seicento venice had expended all its extravagant art in the making of it the body of the bed was like a great square sarcophagus clustering roses were carved in high relief on its wooden panels and luscious putti wallowed among the roses on the black groundwork of the panels the carved reliefs were gilded and burnished the golden roses twined in spirals up the four pillarlike posts and cherubs seated at the top of each column supported a wooden canopy fretted with the same carved flowers  anne was reading in bed two candles stood on the little table beside her in their rich light her face her bare arm and shoulder took on warm hues and a sort of peachlike quality of surface here and there in the canopy above her carved golden petals shone brightly among profound shadows and the soft light falling on the sculptured panel of the bed broke restlessly among the intricate roses lingered in a broad caress on the blown cheeks the dimpled bellies the tight absurd little posteriors of the sprawling putti  there was a discreet tap at the door she looked up come in come in a face round and childish within its sleek bell of golden hair peered round the opening door more childishlooking still a suit of mauve pyjamas made its entrance  it was mary i thought id just look in for a moment to say goodnight she said and sat down on the edge of the bed  anne closed her book that was very sweet of you  what are you reading she looked at the book rather secondrate isnt it the tone in which mary pronounced the word secondrate implied an almost infinite denigration she was accustomed in london to associate only with firstrate people who liked firstrate things and she knew that there were very very few firstrate things in the world and that those were mostly french  well im afraid i like it said anne there was nothing more to be said the silence that followed was a rather uncomfortable one mary fiddled uneasily with the bottom button of her pyjama jacket leaning back on her mound of heapedup pillows anne waited and wondered what was coming  im so awfully afraid of repressions said mary at last bursting suddenly and surprisingly into speech she pronounced the words on the tailend of an expiring breath and had to gasp for new air almost before the phrase was finished  whats there to be depressed about  i said repressions not depressions  oh repressions i see said anne but repressions of what  mary had to explain the natural instincts of sex she began didactically but anne cut her short  yes yes perfectly i understand repressions old maids and all the rest but what about them  thats just it said mary im afraid of them its always dangerous to repress ones instincts im beginning to detect in myself symptoms like the ones you read of in the books i constantly dream that im falling down wells and sometimes i even dream that im climbing up ladders its most disquieting the symptoms are only too clear  are they  one may become a nymphomaniac of ones not careful youve no idea how serious these repressions are if you dont get rid of them in time  it sounds too awful said anne but i dont see that i can do anything to help you  i thought id just like to talk it over with you  why of course im only too happy mary darling  mary coughed and drew a deep breath i presume she began sententiously i presume we may take for granted that an intelligent young woman of twentythree who has lived in civilised society in the twentieth century has no prejudices  well i confess i still have a few  but not about repressions  no not many about repressions thats true  or rather about getting rid of repressions  exactly  so much for our fundamental postulate said mary solemnity was expressed in every feature of her round young face radiated from her large blue eyes we come next to the desirability of possessing experience i hope we are agreed that knowledge is desirable and that ignorance is undesirable  obedient as one of those complaisant disciples from whom socrates could get whatever answer he chose anne gave her assent to this proposition  and we are equally agreed i hope that marriage is what it is  it is  good said mary and repressions being what they are  exactly  there would therefore seem to be only one conclusion  but i knew that anne exclaimed before you began  yes but now its been proved said mary one must do things logically the question is now  but where does the question come in youve reached your only possible conclusionlogically which is more than i could have done all that remains is to impart the information to someone you likesomeone you like really rather a lot someone youre in love with if i may express myself so baldly  but thats just where the question comes in mary exclaimed im not in love with anybody  then if i were you i should wait till you are  but i cant go on dreaming night after night that im falling down a well its too dangerous  well if it really is too dangerous then of course you must do something about it you must find somebody else  but who a thoughtful frown puckered marys brow it must be somebody intelligent somebody with intellectual interests that i can share and it must be somebody with a proper respect for women somebody whos prepared to talk seriously about his work and his ideas and about my work and my ideas it isnt as you see at all easy to find the right person  well said anne there are three unattached and intelligent men in the house at the present time theres mr scogan to begin with but perhaps hes rather too much of a genuine antique and there are gombauld and denis shall we say that the choice is limited to the last two  mary nodded i think we had better she said and then hesitated with a certain air of embarrassment  what is it  i was wondering said mary with a gasp whether they really were unattached i thought that perhaps you mightyou might  it was very nice of you to think of me mary darling said anne smiling the tight cats smile but as far as im concerned they are both entirely unattached  im very glad of that said mary looking relieved we are now confronted with the question which of the two  i can give no advice its a matter for your taste  its not a matter of my taste mary pronounced but of their merits we must weigh them and consider them carefully and dispassionately  you must do the weighing yourself said anne there was still the trace of a smile at the corners of her mouth and round the halfclosed eyes i wont run the risk of advising you wrongly  gombauld has more talent mary began but he is less civilised than denis marys pronunciation of civilised gave the word a special and additional significance she uttered it meticulously in the very front of her mouth hissing delicately on the opening sibilant so few people were civilised and they like the firstrate works of art were mostly french civilisation is most important dont you think  anne held up her hand i wont advise she said you must make the decision  gombaulds family mary went on reflectively comes from marseilles rather a dangerous heredity when one thinks of the latin attitude towards women but then i sometimes wonder whether denis is altogether seriousminded whether he isnt rather a dilettante its very difficult what do you think  im not listening said anne i refuse to take any responsibility  mary sighed well she said i think i had better go to bed and think about it  carefully and dispassionately said anne  at the door mary turned round goodnight she said and wondered as she said the words why anne was smiling in that curious way it was probably nothing she reflected anne often smiled for no apparent reason it was probably just a habit i hope i shant dream of falling down wells again tonight she added  ladders are worse said anne  mary nodded yes ladders are much graver    chapter viii  breakfast on sunday morning was an hour later than on weekdays and priscilla who usually made no public appearance before luncheon honoured it by her presence dressed in black silk with a ruby cross as well as her customary string of pearls round her neck she presided an enormous sunday paper concealed all but the extreme pinnacle of her coiffure from the outer world  i see surrey has won she said with her mouth full by four wickets the sun is in leo that would account for it  splendid game cricket remarked mr barbecuesmith heartily to no one in particular so thoroughly english  jenny who was sitting next to him woke up suddenly with a start what she said what  so english repeated mr barbecuesmith  jenny looked at him surprised english of course i am  he was beginning to explain when mrs wimbush vailed her sunday paper and appeared a square mauvepowdered face in the midst of orange splendours i see theres a new series of articles on the next world just beginning she said to mr barbecuesmith this ones called summer land and gehenna  summer land echoed mr barbecuesmith closing his eyes summer land a beautiful name beautifulbeautiful  mary had taken the seat next to deniss after a night of careful consideration she had decided on denis he might have less talent than gombauld he might be a little lacking in seriousness but somehow he was safer  are you writing much poetry here in the country she asked with a bright gravity  none said denis curtly i havent brought my typewriter  but do you mean to say you cant write without a typewriter  denis shook his head he hated talking at breakfast and besides he wanted to hear what mr scogan was saying at the other end of the table  my scheme for dealing with the church mr scogan was saying is beautifully simple at the present time the anglican clergy wear their collars the wrong way round i would compel them to wear not only their collars but all their clothes turned back to franticcoat waistcoat trousers bootsso that every clergyman should present to the world a smooth facade unbroken by stud button or lace the enforcement of such a livery would act as a wholesome deterrent to those intending to enter the church at the same time it would enormously enhance what archbishop laud so rightly insisted on the beauty of holiness in the few incorrigibles who could not be deterred  in hell it seems said priscilla reading in her sunday paper the children amuse themselves by flaying lambs alive  ah but dear lady thats only a symbol exclaimed mr barbecuesmith a material symbol of a hpiritual truth lambs signify  then there are military uniforms mr scogan went on when scarlet and pipeclay were abandoned for khaki there were some who trembled for the future of war but then finding how elegant the new tunic was how closely it clipped the waist how voluptuously with the lateral bustles of the pockets it exaggerated the hips when they realized the brilliant potentialities of breeches and topboots they were reassured abolish these military elegances standardise a uniform of sackcloth and mackintosh you will very soon find that  is anyone coming to church with me this morning asked henry wimbush no one responded he baited his bare invitation i read the lessons you know and theres mr bodiham his sermons are sometimes worth hearing  thank you thank you said mr barbecuesmith i for one prefer to worship in the infinite church of nature how does our shakespeare put it sermons in books stones in the running brooks he waved his arm in a fine gesture towards the window and even as he did so he became vaguely but none the less insistently none the less uncomfortably aware that something had gone wrong with the quotation somethingwhat could it be sermons stones books    chapter ix  mr bodiham was sitting in his study at the rectory the nineteenthcentury gothic windows narrow and pointed admitted the light grudgingly in spite of the brilliant july weather the room was sombre brown varnished bookshelves lined the walls filled with row upon row of those thick heavy theological works which the secondhand booksellers generally sell by weight the mantelpiece the overmantel a towering structure of spindly pillars and little shelves were brown and varnished the writingdesk was brown and varnished so were the chairs so was the door a dark redbrown carpet with patterns covered the floor everything was brown in the room and there was a curious brownish smell  in the midst of this brown gloom mr bodiham sat at his desk he was the man in the iron mask a grey metallic face with iron cheekbones and a narrow iron brow iron folds hard and unchanging ran perpendicularly down his cheeks his nose was the iron beak of some thin delicate bird of rapine he had brown eyes set in sockets rimmed with iron round them the skin was dark as though it had been charred dense wiry hair covered his skull it had been black it was turning grey his ears were very small and fine his jaws his chin his upper lip were dark irondark where he had shaved his voice when he spoke and especially when he raised it in preaching was harsh like the grating of iron hinges when a seldomused door is opened  it was nearly halfpast twelve he had just come back from church hoarse and weary with preaching he preached with fury with passion an iron man beating with a flail upon the souls of his congregation but the souls of the faithful at crome were made of indiarubber solid rubber the flail rebounded they were used to mr bodiham at crome the flail thumped on indiarubber and as often as not the rubber slept  that morning he had preached as he had often preached before on the nature of god he had tried to make them understand about god what a fearful thing it was to fall into his hands godthey thought of something soft and merciful they blinded themselves to facts still more they blinded themselves to the bible the passengers on the titanic sang nearer my god to thee as the ship was going down did they realise what they were asking to be brought nearer to a white fire of righteousness an angry fire  when savonarola preached men sobbed and groaned aloud nothing broke the polite silence with which crome listened to mr bodihamonly an occasional cough and sometimes the sound of heavy breathing in the front pew sat henry wimbush calm wellbred beautifully dressed there were times when mr bodiham wanted to jump down from the pulpit and shake him into lifetimes when he would have liked to beat and kill his whole congregation  he sat at his desk dejectedly outside the gothic windows the earth was warm and marvellously calm everything was as it had always been and yet and yetit was nearly four years now since he had preached that sermon on matthew xxiv 7 for nation shall rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places it was nearly four years he had had the sermon printed it was so terribly so vitally important that all the world should know what he had to say a copy of the little pamphlet lay on his deskeight small grey pages printed by a fount of type that had grown blunt like an old dogs teeth by the endless champing and champing of the press he opened it and began to read it yet once again  for nation shall rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places  nineteen centuries have elapsed since our lord gave utterance to those words and not a single one of them has been without wars plagues famines and earthquakes mighty empires have crashed in ruin to the ground diseases have unpeopled half the globe there have been vast natural cataclysms in which thousands have been overwhelmed by flood and fire and whirlwind time and again in the course of these nineteen centuries such things have happened but they have not brought christ back to earth they were signs of the times inasmuch as they were signs of gods wrath against the chronic wickedness of mankind but they were not signs of the times in connection with the second coming  if earnest christians have regarded the present war as a true sign of the lords approaching return it is not merely because it happens to be a great war involving the lives of millions of people not merely because famine is tightening its grip on every country in europe not merely because disease of every kind from syphilis to spotted fever is rife among the warring nations no it is not for these reasons that we regard this war as a true sign of the times but because in its origin and its progress it is marked by certain characteristics which seem to connect it almost beyond a doubt with the predictions in christian prophecy relating to the second coming of the lord  let me enumerate the features of the present war which most clearly suggest that it is a sign foretelling the near approach of the second advent our lord said that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come although it would be presumptuous for us to say what degree of evangelisation will be regarded by god as sufficient we may at least confidently hope that a century of unflagging missionary work has brought the fulfilment of this condition at any rate near true the larger number of the worlds inhabitants have remained deaf to the preaching of the true religion but that does not vitiate the fact that the gospel has been preached for a witness to all unbelievers from the papist to the zulu the responsibility for the continued prevalence of unbelief lies not with the preachers but with those preached to  again it has been generally recognised that the drying up of the waters of the great river euphrates mentioned in the sixteenth chapter of revelation refers to the decay and extinction of turkish power and is a sign of the near approaching end of the world as we know it the capture of jerusalem and the successes in mesopotamia are great strides forward in the destruction of the ottoman empire though it must be admitted that the gallipoli episode proved that the turk still possesses a notable horn of strength historically speaking this drying up of ottoman power has been going on for the past century the last two years have witnessed a great acceleration of the process and there can be no doubt that complete desiccation is within sight  closely following on the words concerning the drying up of euphrates comes the prophecy of armageddon that world war with which the second coming is to be so closely associated once begun the world war can end only with the return of christ and his coming will be sudden and unexpected like that of a thief in the night  let us examine the facts in history exactly as in st johns gospel the world war is immediately preceded by the drying up of euphrates or the decay of turkish power this fact alone would be enough to connect the present conflict with the armageddon of revelation and therefore to point to the near approach of the second advent but further evidence of an even more solid and convincing nature can be adduced  armageddon is brought about by the activities of three unclean spirits as it were toads which come out of the mouths of the dragon the beast and the false prophet if we can identify these three powers of evil much light will clearly be thrown on the whole question  the dragon the beast and the false prophet can all be identified in history satan who can only work through human agency has used these three powers in the long war against christ which has filled the last nineteen centuries with religious strife the dragon it has been sufficiently established is pagan rome and the spirit issuing from its mouth is the spirit of infidelity the beast alternatively symbolised as a woman is undoubtedly the papal power and popery is the spirit which it spews forth there is only one power which answers to the description of the false prophet the wolf in sheeps clothing the agent of the devil working in the guise of the lamb and that power is the socalled society of jesus the spirit that issues from the mouth of the false prophet is the spirit of false morality  we may assume then that the three evil spirits are infidelity popery and false morality have these three influences been the real cause of the present conflict the answer is clear  the spirit of infidelity is the very spirit of german criticism the higher criticism as it is mockingly called denies the possibility of miracles prediction and real inspiration and attempts to account for the bible as a natural development slowly but surely during the last eighty years the spirit of infidelity has been robbing the germans of their bible and their faith so that germany is today a nation of unbelievers higher criticism has thus made the war possible for it would be absolutely impossible for any christian nation to wage war as germany is waging it  we come next to the spirit of popery whose influence in causing the war was quite as great as that of infidelity though not perhaps so immediately obvious since the francoprussian war the papal power has steadily declined in france while in germany it has steadily increased today france is an antipapal state while germany possesses a powerful roman catholic minority two papally controlled states germany and austria are at war with six antipapal statesengland france italy russia serbia and portugal belgium is of course a thoroughly papal state and there can be little doubt that the presence on the allies side of an element so essentially hostile has done much to hamper the righteous cause and is responsible for our comparative illsuccess that the spirit of popery is behind the war is thus seen clearly enough in the grouping of the opposed powers while the rebellion in the roman catholic parts of ireland has merely confirmed a conclusion already obvious to any unbiased mind  the spirit of false morality has played as great a part in this war as the two other evil spirits the scrap of paper incident is the nearest and most obvious example of germanys adherence to this essentially unchristian or jesuitical morality the end is german worldpower and in the attainment of this end any means are justifiable it is the true principle of jesuitry applied to international politics  the identification is now complete as was predicted in revelation the three evil spirits have gone forth just as the decay of the ottoman power was nearing completion and have joined together to make the world war the warning behold i come as a thief is therefore meant for the present periodfor you and me and all the world this war will lead on inevitably to the war of armageddon and will only be brought to an end by the lords personal return  and when he returns what will happen those who are in christ st john tells us will be called to the supper of the lamb those who are found fighting against him will be called to the supper of the great godthat grim banquet where they shall not feast but be feasted on for as st john says i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried in a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great all the enemies of christ will be slain with the sword of him that sits upon the horse and all the fowls will be filled with their flesh that is the supper of the great god  it may be soon or it may as men reckon time be long but sooner or later inevitably the lord will come and deliver the world from its present troubles and woe unto them who are called not to the supper of the lamb but to the supper of the great god they will realise then but too late that god is a god of wrath as well as a god of forgiveness the god who sent bears to devour the mockers of elisha the god who smote the egyptians for their stubborn wickedness will assuredly smite them too unless they make haste to repent but perhaps it is already too late who knows but that tomorrow in a moment even christ may be upon us unawares like a thief in a little while who knows the angel standing in the sun may be summoning the ravens and vultures from their crannies in the rocks to feed upon the putrefying flesh of the millions of unrighteous whom gods wrath has destroyed be ready then the coming of the lord is at hand may it be for all of you an object of hope not a moment to look forward to with terror and trembling  mr bodiham closed the little pamphlet and leaned back in his chair the argument was sound absolutely compelling and yetit was four years since he had preached that sermon four years and england was at peace the sun shone the people of crome were as wicked and indifferent as evermore so indeed if that were possible if only he could understand if the heavens would but make a sign but his questionings remained unanswered seated there in his brown varnished chair under the ruskinian window he could have screamed aloud he gripped the arms of his chairgripping gripping for control the knuckles of his hands whitened he bit his lip in a few seconds he was able to relax the tension he began to rebuke himself for his rebellious impatience  four years he reflected what were four years after all it must inevitably take a long time for armageddon to ripen to yeast itself up the episode of 1914 had been a preliminary skirmish and as for the war having come to an endwhy that of course was illusory it was still going on smouldering away in silesia in ireland in anatolia the discontent in egypt and india was preparing the way perhaps for a great extension of the slaughter among the heathen peoples the chinese boycott of japan and the rivalries of that country and america in the pacific might be breeding a great new war in the east the prospect mr bodiham tried to assure himself was hopeful the real the genuine armageddon might soon begin and then like a thief in the nightbut in spite of all his comfortable reasoning he remained unhappy dissatisfied four years ago he had been so confident gods intention seemed then so plain and now now he did well to be angry and now he suffered too  sudden and silent as a phantom mrs bodiham appeared gliding noiselessly across the room above her black dress her face was pale with an opaque whiteness her eyes were pale as water in a glass and her strawy hair was almost colourless she held a large envelope in her hand  this came for you by the post she said softly  the envelope was unsealed mechanically mr bodiham tore it open it contained a pamphlet larger than his own and more elegant in appearance the house of sheeny clerical outfitters birmingham he turned over the pages the catalogue was tastefully and ecclesiastically printed in antique characters with illuminated gothic initials red marginal lines crossed at the corners after the manner of an oxford picture frame enclosed each page of type little red crosses took the place of full stops mr bodiham turned the pages  soutane in best black merino ready to wear in all sizes clerical frock coats from nine guineas a dressy garment tailored by our own experienced ecclesiastical cutters  halftone illustrations represented young curates some dapper some rugbeian and muscular some with ascetic faces and large ecstatic eyes dressed in jackets in frockcoats in surplices in clerical evening dress in black norfolk suitings  a large assortment of chasubles  rope girdles  sheenys special skirt cassocks tied by a string about the waistwhen worn under a surplice presents an appearance indistinguishable from that of a complete cassockrecommended for summer wear and hot climates  with a gesture of horror and disgust mr bodiham threw the catalogue into the wastepaper basket mrs bodiham looked at him her pale glaucous eyes reflected his action without comment  the village she said in her quiet voice the village grows worse and worse every day  what has happened now asked mr bodiham feeling suddenly very weary  ill tell you she pulled up a brown varnished chair and sat down in the village of crome it seemed sodom and gomorrah had come to a second birth    chapter x  denis did not dance but when ragtime came squirting out of the pianola in gushes of treacle and hot perfume in jets of bengal light then things began to dance inside him little black nigger corpuscles jigged and drummed in his arteries he became a cage of movement a walking palais de danse it was very uncomfortable like the preliminary symptoms of a disease he sat in one of the windowseats glumly pretending to read  at the pianola henry wimbush smoking a long cigar through a tunnelled pillar of amber trod out the shattering dance music with serene patience locked together gombauld and anne moved with a harmoniousness that made them seem a single creature twoheaded and fourlegged mr scogan solemnly buffoonish shuffled round the room with mary jenny sat in the shadow behind the piano scribbling so it seemed in a big red notebook in armchairs by the fireplace priscilla and mr barbecuesmith discussed higher things without apparently being disturbed by the noise on the lower plane  optimism said mr barbecuesmith with a tone of finality speaking through strains of the wild wild womenoptimism is the opening out of the soul towards the light it is an expansion towards and into god it is a hpiritual selfunification with the infinite  how true sighed priscilla nodding the baleful splendours of her coiffure  pessimism on the other hand is the contraction of the soul towards darkness it is a focusing of the self upon a point in the lower plane it is a hpiritual slavery to mere facts to gross physical phenomena  theyre making a wild man of me the refrain sang itself over in deniss mind yes they were damn them a wild man but not wild enough that was the trouble wild inside raging writhingyes writhing was the word writhing with desire but outwardly he was hopelessly tame outwardlybaa baa baa  there they were anne and gombauld moving together as though they were a single supple creature the beast with two backs and he sat in a corner pretending to read pretending he didnt want to dance pretending he rather despised dancing why it was the baabaa business again  why was he born with a different face why was he gombauld had a face of brassone of those old brazen rams that thumped against the walls of cities till they fell he was born with a different facea woolly face  the music stopped the single harmonious creature broke in two flushed a little breathless anne swayed across the room to the pianola laid her hand on mr wimbushs shoulder  a waltz this time please uncle henry she said  a waltz he repeated and turned to the cabinet where the rolls were kept he trod off the old roll and trod on the new a slave at the mill uncomplaining and beautifully well bred rum tum rumtiti tumtiti the melody wallowed oozily along like a ship moving forward over a sleek and oily swell the fourlegged creature more graceful more harmonious in its movements than ever slid across the floor oh why was he born with a different face  what are you reading  he looked up startled it was mary she had broken from the uncomfortable embrace of mr scogan who had now seized on jenny for his victim  what are you reading  i dont know said denis truthfully he looked at the title page the book was called the stock breeders vade mecum  i think you are so sensible to sit and read quietly said mary fixing him with her china eyes i dont know why one dances its so boring  denis made no reply she exacerbated him from the armchair by the fireplace he heard priscillas deep voice  tell me mr barbecuesmithyou know all about science i know a deprecating noise came from mr barbecuesmiths chair this einstein theory it seems to upset the whole starry universe it makes me so worried about my horoscopes you see  mary renewed her attack which of the contemporary poets do you like best she asked denis was filled with fury why couldnt this pest of a girl leave him alone he wanted to listen to the horrible music to watch them dancingoh with what grace as though they had been made for one anotherto savour his misery in peace and she came and put him through this absurd catechism she was like mangolds questions what are the three diseases of wheatwhich of the contemporary poets do you like best  blight mildew and smut he replied with the laconism of one who is absolutely certain of his own mind  it was several hours before denis managed to go to sleep that night vague but agonising miseries possessed his mind it was not only anne who made him miserable he was wretched about himself the future life in general the universe this adolescence business he repeated to himself every now and then is horribly boring but the fact that he knew his disease did not help him to cure it  after kicking all the clothes off the bed he got up and sought relief in composition he wanted to imprison his nameless misery in words at the end of an hour nine more or less complete lines emerged from among the blots and scratchings  i do not know what i desire when summer nights are dark and still when the winds manyvoiced quire sleeps among the muffled branches i long and know not what i will and not a sound of life or laughter stanches times black and silent flow i do not know what i desire i do not know  he read it through aloud then threw the scribbled sheet into the wastepaper basket and got into bed again in a very few minutes he was asleep    chapter xi  mr barbecuesmith was gone the motor had whirled him away to the station a faint smell of burning oil commemorated his recent departure a considerable detachment had come into the courtyard to speed him on his way and now they were walking back round the side of the house towards the terrace and the garden they walked in silence nobody had yet ventured to comment on the departed guest  well said anne at last turning with raised inquiring eyebrows to denis  well it was time for someone to begin  denis declined the invitation he passed it on to mr scogan well he said  mr scogan did not respond he only repeated the question well  it was left for henry wimbush to make a pronouncement a very agreeable adjunct to the weekend he said his tone was obituary  they had descended without paying much attention where they were going the steep yewwalk that went down under the flank of the terrace to the pool the house towered above them immensely tall with the whole height of the builtup terrace added to its own seventy feet of brick facade the perpendicular lines of the three towers soared up uninterrupted enhancing the impression of height until it became overwhelming they paused at the edge of the pool to look back  the man who built this house knew his business said denis he was an architect  was he said henry wimbush reflectively i doubt it the builder of this house was sir ferdinando lapith who flourished during the reign of elizabeth he inherited the estate from his father to whom it had been granted at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries for crome was originally a cloister of monks and this swimmingpool their fishpond sir ferdinando was not content merely to adapt the old monastic buildings to his own purposes but using them as a stone quarry for his barns and byres and outhouses he built for himself a grand new house of brickthe house you see now  he waved his hand in the direction of the house and was silent severe imposing almost menacing crome loomed down on them  the great thing about crome said mr scogan seizing the opportunity to speak is the fact that its so unmistakably and aggressively a work of art it makes no compromise with nature but affronts it and rebels against it it has no likeness to shelleys tower in the epipsychidion which if i remember rightly  seems not now a work of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form and grown out of the mountain from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high  no no there isnt any nonsense of that sort about crome that the hovels of the peasantry should look as though they had grown out of the earth to which their inmates are attached is right no doubt and suitable but the house of an intelligent civilised and sophisticated man should never seem to have sprouted from the clods it should rather be an expression of his grand unnatural remoteness from the cloddish life since the days of william morris thats a fact which we in england have been unable to comprehend civilised and sophisticated men have solemnly played at being peasants hence quaintness arts and crafts cottage architecture and all the rest of it in the suburbs of our cities you may see reduplicated in endless rows studiedly quaint imitations and adaptations of the village hovel poverty ignorance and a limited range of materials produced the hovel which possesses undoubtedly in suitable surroundings its own as it were titanic charm we now employ our wealth our technical knowledge our rich variety of materials for the purpose of building millions of imitation hovels in totally unsuitable surroundings could imbecility go further  henry wimbush took up the thread of his interrupted discourse all that you say my dear scogan he began is certainly very just very true but whether sir ferdinando shared your views about architecture or if indeed he had any views about architecture at all i very much doubt in building this house sir ferdinando was as a matter of fact preoccupied by only one thoughtthe proper placing of his privies sanitation was the one great interest of his life in 1573 he even published on this subject a little booknow extremely scarcecalled certaine priuy counsels by one of her maiesties most honourable priuy counsels fl knight in which the whole matter is treated with great learning and elegance his guiding principle in arranging the sanitation of a house was to secure that the greatest possible distance should separate the privy from the sewage arrangements hence it followed inevitably that the privies were to be placed at the top of the house being connected by vertical shafts with pits or channels in the ground it must not be thought that sir ferdinando was moved only by material and merely sanitary considerations for the placing of his privies in an exalted position he had also certain excellent spiritual reasons for he argues in the third chapter of his priuy counsels the necessities of nature are so base and brutish that in obeying them we are apt to forget that we are the noblest creatures of the universe to counteract these degrading effects he advised that the privy should be in every house the room nearest to heaven that it should be well provided with windows commanding an extensive and noble prospect and that the walls of the chamber should be lined with bookshelves containing all the ripest products of human wisdom such as the proverbs of solomon boethiuss consolations of philosophy the apophthegms of epictetus and marcus aurelius the enchiridion of erasmus and all other works ancient or modern which testify to the nobility of the human soul in crome he was able to put his theories into practice at the top of each of the three projecting towers he placed a privy from these a shaft went down the whole height of the house that is to say more than seventy feet through the cellars and into a series of conduits provided with flowing water tunnelled in the ground on a level with the base of the raised terrace these conduits emptied themselves into the stream several hundred yards below the fishpond the total depth of the shafts from the top of the towers to their subterranean conduits was a hundred and two feet the eighteenth century with its passion for modernisation swept away these monuments of sanitary ingenuity were it not for tradition and the explicit account of them left by sir ferdinando we should be unaware that these noble privies had ever existed we should even suppose that sir ferdinando built his house after this strange and splendid model for merely aesthetic reasons  the contemplation of the glories of the past always evoked in henry wimbush a certain enthusiasm under the grey bowler his face worked and glowed as he spoke the thought of these vanished privies moved him profoundly he ceased to speak the light gradually died out of his face and it became once more the replica of the grave polite hat which shaded it there was a long silence the same gently melancholy thoughts seemed to possess the mind of each of them permanence transiencesir ferdinando and his privies were gone crome still stood how brightly the sun shone and how inevitable was death the ways of god were strange the ways of man were stranger still  it does ones heart good exclaimed mr scogan at last to hear of these fantastic english aristocrats to have a theory about privies and to build an immense and splendid house in order to put it into practiseits magnificent beautiful i like to think of them all the eccentric milords rolling across europe in ponderous carriages bound on extraordinary errands one is going to venice to buy la bianchis larynx he wont get it till shes dead of course but no matter hes prepared to wait he has a collection pickled in glass bottles of the throats of famous opera singers and the instruments of renowned virtuosihe goes in for them too he will try to bribe paganini to part with his little guarnerio but he has small hope of success paganini wont sell his fiddle but perhaps he might sacrifice one of his guitars others are bound on crusadesone to die miserably among the savage greeks another in his white top hat to lead italians against their oppressors others have no business at all they are just giving their oddity a continental airing at home they cultivate themselves at leisure and with greater elaboration beckford builds towers portland digs holes in the ground cavendish the millionaire lives in a stable eats nothing but mutton and amuses himselfoh solely for his private delectationby anticipating the electrical discoveries of half a century glorious eccentrics every age is enlivened by their presence some day my dear denis said mr scogan turning a beady bright regard in his directionsome day you must become their biographerthe lives of queer men what a subject i should like to undertake it myself  mr scogan paused looked up once more at the towering house then murmured the word eccentricity two or three times  eccentricityits the justification of all aristocracies it justifies leisured classes and inherited wealth and privilege and endowments and all the other injustices of that sort if youre to do anything reasonable in this world you must have a class of people who are secure safe from public opinion safe from poverty leisured not compelled to waste their time in the imbecile routines that go by the name of honest work you must have a class of which the members can think and within the obvious limits do what they please you must have a class in which people who have eccentricities can indulge them and in which eccentricity in general will be tolerated and understood thats the important thing about an aristocracy not only is it eccentric itselfoften grandiosely so it also tolerates and even encourages eccentricity in others the eccentricities of the artist and the newfangled thinker dont inspire it with that fear loathing and disgust which the burgesses instinctively feel towards them it is a sort of red indian reservation planted in the midst of a vast horde of poor whitescolonials at that within its boundaries wild men disport themselvesoften it must be admitted a little grossly a little too flamboyantly and when kindred spirits are born outside the pale it offers them some sort of refuge from the hatred which the poor whites en bons bourgeois lavish on anything that is wild or out of the ordinary after the social revolution there will be no reservations the redskins will be drowned in the great sea of poor whites what then will they suffer you to go on writing villanelles my good denis will you unhappy henry be allowed to live in this house of the splendid privies to continue your quiet delving in the mines of futile knowledge will anne  and you said anne interrupting him will you be allowed to go on talking  you may rest assured mr scogan replied that i shall not i shall have some honest work to do    chapter xii  blight mildew and smut mary was puzzled and distressed perhaps her ears had played her false perhaps what he had really said was squire binyon and shanks or childe blunden and earp or even abercrombie drinkwater and rabindranath tagore perhaps but then her ears never did play her false blight mildew and smut the impression was distinct and ineffaceable blight mildew she was forced to the conclusion reluctantly that denis had indeed pronounced those improbable words he had deliberately repelled her attempts to open a serious discussion that was horrible a man who would not talk seriously to a woman just because she was a womanoh impossible egeria or nothing perhaps gombauld would be more satisfactory true his meridional heredity was a little disquieting but at least he was a serious worker and it was with his work that she would associate herself and denis after all what was denis a dilettante an amateur  gombauld had annexed for his paintingroom a little disused granary that stood by itself in a green close beyond the farmyard it was a square brick building with a peaked roof and little windows set high up in each of its walls a ladder of four rungs led up to the door for the granary was perched above the ground and out of reach of the rats on four massive toadstools of grey stone within there lingered a faint smell of dust and cobwebs and the narrow shaft of sunlight that came slanting in at every hour of the day through one of the little windows was always alive with silvery motes here gombauld worked with a kind of concentrated ferocity during six or seven hours of each day he was pursuing something new something terrific if only he could catch it  during the last eight years nearly half of which had been spent in the process of winning the war he had worked his way industriously through cubism now he had come out on the other side he had begun by painting a formalised nature then little by little he had risen from nature into the world of pure form till in the end he was painting nothing but his own thoughts externalised in the abstract geometrical forms of the minds devising he found the process arduous and exhilarating and then quite suddenly he grew dissatisfied he felt himself cramped and confined within intolerably narrow limitations he was humiliated to find how few and crude and uninteresting were the forms he could invent the inventions of nature were without number inconceivably subtle and elaborate he had done with cubism he was out on the other side but the cubist discipline preserved him from falling into excesses of nature worship he took from nature its rich subtle elaborate forms but his aim was always to work them into a whole that should have the thrilling simplicity and formality of an idea to combine prodigious realism with prodigious simplification memories of caravaggios portentous achievements haunted him forms of a breathing living reality emerged from darkness built themselves up into compositions as luminously simple and single as a mathematical idea he thought of the call of matthew of peter crucified of the lute players of magdalen he had the secret that astonishing ruffian he had the secret and now gombauld was after it in hot pursuit yes it would be something terrific if only he could catch it  for a long time an idea had been stirring and spreading yeastily in his mind he had made a portfolio full of studies he had drawn a cartoon and now the idea was taking shape on canvas a man fallen from a horse the huge animal a gaunt white carthorse filled the upper half of the picture with its great body its head lowered towards the ground was in shadow the immense bony body was what arrested the eye the body and the legs which came down on either side of the picture like the pillars of an arch on the ground between the legs of the towering beast lay the foreshortened figure of a man the head in the extreme foreground the arms flung wide to right and left a white relentless light poured down from a point in the right foreground the beast the fallen man were sharply illuminated round them beyond and behind them was the night they were alone in the darkness a universe in themselves the horses body filled the upper part of the picture the legs the great hoofs frozen to stillness in the midst of their trampling limited it on either side and beneath lay the man his foreshortened face at the focal point in the centre his arms outstretched towards the sides of the picture under the arch of the horses belly between his legs the eye looked through into an intense darkness below the space was closed in by the figure of the prostrate man a central gulf of darkness surrounded by luminous forms  the picture was more than half finished gombauld had been at work all the morning on the figure of the man and now he was taking a restthe time to smoke a cigarette tilting back his chair till it touched the wall he looked thoughtfully at his canvas he was pleased and at the same time he was desolated in itself the thing was good he knew it but that something he was after that something that would be so terrific if only he could catch ithad he caught it would he ever catch it  three little tapsrat tat tat surprised gombauld turned his eyes towards the door nobody ever disturbed him while he was at work it was one of the unwritten laws come in he called the door which was ajar swung open revealing from the waist upwards the form of mary she had only dared to mount halfway up the ladder if he didnt want her retreat would be easier and more dignified than if she climbed to the top  may i come in she asked  certainly  she skipped up the remaining two rungs and was over the threshold in an instant a letter came for you by the second post she said i thought it might be important so i brought it out to you her eyes her childish face were luminously candid as she handed him the letter there had never been a flimsier pretext  gombauld looked at the envelope and put it in his pocket unopened luckily he said it isnt at all important thanks very much all the same  there was a silence mary felt a little uncomfortable may i have a look at what youve been painting she had the courage to say at last  gombauld had only half smoked his cigarette in any case he wouldnt begin work again till he had finished he would give her the five minutes that separated him from the bitter end this is the best place to see it from he said  mary looked at the picture for some time without saying anything indeed she didnt know what to say she was taken aback she was at a loss she had expected a cubist masterpiece and here was a picture of a man and a horse not only recognisable as such but even aggressively in drawing trompeloeilthere was no other word to describe the delineation of that foreshortened figure under the trampling feet of the horse what was she to think what was she to say her orientations were gone one could admire representationalism in the old masters obviously but in a modern at eighteen she might have done so but now after five years of schooling among the best judges her instinctive reaction to a contemporary piece of representation was contemptan outburst of laughing disparagement what could gombauld be up to she had felt so safe in admiring his work before but nowshe didnt know what to think it was very difficult very difficult  theres rather a lot of chiaroscuro isnt there she ventured at last and inwardly congratulated herself on having found a critical formula so gentle and at the same time so penetrating  there is gombauld agreed  mary was pleased he accepted her criticism it was a serious discussion she put her head on one side and screwed up her eyes i think its awfully fine she said but of course its a little tootootrompeloeil for my taste she looked at gombauld who made no response but continued to smoke gazing meditatively all the time at his picture mary went on gaspingly when i was in paris this spring i saw a lot of tschuplitski i admire his work so tremendously of course its frightfully abstract nowfrightfully abstract and frightfully intellectual he just throws a few oblongs on to his canvasquite flat you know and painted in pure primary colours but his design is wonderful hes getting more and more abstract every day hed given up the third dimension when i was there and was just thinking of giving up the second soon he says therell be just the blank canvas thats the logical conclusion complete abstraction paintings finished hes finishing it when hes reached pure abstraction hes going to take up architecture he says its more intellectual than painting do you agree she asked with a final gasp  gombauld dropped his cigarette end and trod on it tschuplitskis finished painting he said ive finished my cigarette but im going on painting and advancing towards her he put his arm round her shoulders and turned her round away from the picture  mary looked up at him her hair swung back a soundless bell of gold her eyes were serene she smiled so the moment had come his arm was round her he moved slowly almost imperceptibly and she moved with him it was a peripatetic embracement do you agree with him she repeated the moment might have come but she would not cease to be intellectual serious  i dont know i shall have to think about it gombauld loosened his embrace his hand dropped from her shoulder be careful going down the ladder he added solicitously  mary looked round startled they were in front of the open door she remained standing there for a moment in bewilderment the hand that had rested on her shoulder made itself felt lower down her back it administered three or four kindly little smacks replying automatically to its stimulus she moved forward  be careful going down the ladder said gombauld once more  she was careful the door closed behind her and she was alone in the little green close she walked slowly back through the farmyard she was pensive    chapter xiii  henry wimbush brought down with him to dinner a budget of printed sheets loosely bound together in a cardboard portfolio  today he said exhibiting it with a certain solemnity today i have finished the printing of my history of crome i helped to set up the type of the last page this evening  the famous history cried anne the writing and the printing of this magnum opus had been going on as long as she could remember all her childhood long uncle henrys history had been a vague and fabulous thing often heard of and never seen  it has taken me nearly thirty years said mr wimbush twentyfive years of writing and nearly four of printing and now its finishedthe whole chronicle from sir ferdinando lapiths birth to the death of my father william wimbushmore than three centuries and a half a history of crome written at crome and printed at crome by my own press  shall we be allowed to read it now its finished asked denis  mr wimbush nodded certainly he said and i hope you will not find it uninteresting he added modestly our muniment room is particularly rich in ancient records and i have some genuinely new light to throw on the introduction of the threepronged fork  and the people asked gombauld sir ferdinando and the rest of themwere they amusing were there any crimes or tragedies in the family  let me see henry wimbush rubbed his chin thoughtfully i can only think of two suicides one violent death four or perhaps five broken hearts and half a dozen little blots on the scutcheon in the way of misalliances seductions natural children and the like no on the whole its a placid and uneventful record  the wimbushes and the lapiths were always an unadventurous respectable crew said priscilla with a note of scorn in her voice if i were to write my family history now why it would be one long continuous blot from beginning to end she laughed jovially and helped herself to another glass of wine  if i were to write mine mr scogan remarked it wouldnt exist after the second generation we scogans are lost in the mists of antiquity  after dinner said henry wimbush a little piqued by his wifes disparaging comment on the masters of crome ill read you an episode from my history that will make you admit that even the lapiths in their own respectable way had their tragedies and strange adventures  im glad to hear it said priscilla  glad to hear what asked jenny emerging suddenly from her private interior world like a cuckoo from a clock she received an explanation smiled nodded cuckooed at last i see and popped back clapping shut the door behind her  dinner was eaten the party had adjourned to the drawingroom  now said henry wimbush pulling up a chair to the lamp he put on his round pincenez rimmed with tortoiseshell and began cautiously to turn over the pages of his loose and still fragmentary book he found his place at last shall i begin he asked looking up  do said priscilla yawning  in the midst of an attentive silence mr wimbush gave a little preliminary cough and started to read  the infant who was destined to become the fourth baronet of the name of lapith was born in the year 1740 he was a very small baby weighing not more than three pounds at birth but from the first he was sturdy and healthy in honour of his maternal grandfather sir hercules occam of bishops occam he was christened hercules his mother like many other mothers kept a notebook in which his progress from month to month was recorded he walked at ten months and before his second year was out he had learnt to speak a number of words at three years he weighed but twentyfour pounds and at six though he could read and write perfectly and showed a remarkable aptitude for music he was no larger and heavier than a wellgrown child of two meanwhile his mother had borne two other children a boy and a girl one of whom died of croup during infancy while the other was carried off by smallpox before it reached the age of five hercules remained the only surviving child  on his twelfth birthday hercules was still only three feet and two inches in height his head which was very handsome and nobly shaped was too big for his body but otherwise he was exquisitely proportioned and for his size of great strength and agility his parents in the hope of making him grow consulted all the most eminent physicians of the time their various prescriptions were followed to the letter but in vain one ordered a very plentiful meat diet another exercise a third constructed a little rack modelled on those employed by the holy inquisition on which young hercules was stretched with excruciating torments for half an hour every morning and evening in the course of the next three years hercules gained perhaps two inches after that his growth stopped completely and he remained for the rest of his life a pigmy of three feet and four inches his father who had built the most extravagant hopes upon his son planning for him in his imagination a military career equal to that of marlborough found himself a disappointed man i have brought an abortion into the world he would say and he took so violent a dislike to his son that the boy dared scarcely come into his presence his temper which had been serene was turned by disappointment to moroseness and savagery he avoided all company being as he said ashamed to show himself the father of a lusus naturae among normal healthy human beings and took to solitary drinking which carried him very rapidly to his grave for the year before hercules came of age his father was taken off by an apoplexy his mother whose love for him had increased with the growth of his fathers unkindness did not long survive but little more than a year after her husbands death succumbed after eating two dozen of oysters to an attack of typhoid fever  hercules thus found himself at the age of twentyone alone in the world and master of a considerable fortune including the estate and mansion of crome the beauty and intelligence of his childhood had survived into his manly age and but for his dwarfish stature he would have taken his place among the handsomest and most accomplished young men of his time he was well read in the greek and latin authors as well as in all the moderns of any merit who had written in english french or italian he had a good ear for music and was no indifferent performer on the violin which he used to play like a bass viol seated on a chair with the instrument between his legs to the music of the harpsichord and clavichord he was extremely partial but the smallness of his hands made it impossible for him ever to perform upon these instruments he had a small ivory flute made for him on which whenever he was melancholy he used to play a simple country air or jig affirming that this rustic music had more power to clear and raise the spirits than the most artificial productions of the masters from an early age he practised the composition of poetry but though conscious of his great powers in this art he would never publish any specimen of his writing my stature he would say is reflected in my verses if the public were to read them it would not be because i am a poet but because i am a dwarf several ms books of sir herculess poems survive a single specimen will suffice to illustrate his qualities as a poet  in ancient days while yet the world was young ere abram fed his flocks or homer sung when blacksmith tubal tamed creative fire and jabal dwelt in tents and jubal struck the lyre flesh grown corrupt brought forth a monstrous birth and obscene giants trod the shrinking earth till god impatient of their sinful brood gave rein to wrath and drownd them in the flood teeming again repeopled tellus bore the lubber hero and the man of war huge towers of brawn toppd with an empty skull witlessly bold heroically dull long ages passd and man grown more refind slighter in muscle but of vaster mind smiled at his grandsires broadsword bow and bill and learnd to wield the pencil and the quill the glowing canvas and the written page immortalizd his name from age to age his name emblazond on fames temple wall for art grew great as humankind grew small thus mans long progress step by step we trace the giant dies the hero takes his place the giant vile the dull heroic block at one we shudder and at one we mock man last appears in him the souls pure flame burns brightlier in a not inordnate frame of old when heroes fought and giants swarmed men were huge mounds of matter scarce informd wearied by leavening so vast a mass the spirit slept and all the mind was crass the smaller carcase of these later days is soon informd the soul unwearied plays and like a pharos darts abroad her mental rays but can we think that providence will stay mans footsteps here upon the upward way mankind in understanding and in grace advancd so far beyond the giants race hence impious thought still led by gods own hand mankind proceeds towards the promised land a time will come prophetic i descry remoter dawns along the gloomy sky when happy mortals of a golden age will backward turn the dark historic page and in our vaunted race of men behold a form as gross a mind as dead and cold as we in giants see in warriors of old a time will come wherein the soul shall be from all superfluous matter wholly free when the light body agile as a fawns shall sport with grace along the velvet lawns natures most delicate and final birth mankind perfected shall possess the earth but ah not yet for still the giants race huge though diminishd tramps the earths fair face gross and repulsive yet perversely proud men of their imperfections boast aloud vain of their bulk of all they still retain of giant ugliness absurdly vain at all thats small they point their stupid scorn and monsters think themselves divinely born sad is the fate of those ah sad indeed the rare precursors of the nobler breed who come mans golden glory to foretell but pointing heavnwards live themselves in hell  as soon as he came into the estate sir hercules set about remodelling his household for though by no means ashamed of his deformityindeed if we may judge from the poem quoted above he regarded himself as being in many ways superior to the ordinary race of manhe found the presence of fullgrown men and women embarrassing realising too that he must abandon all ambitions in the great world he determined to retire absolutely from it and to create as it were at crome a private world of his own in which all should be proportionable to himself accordingly he discharged all the old servants of the house and replaced them gradually as he was able to find suitable successors by others of dwarfish stature in the course of a few years he had assembled about himself a numerous household no member of which was above four feet high and the smallest among them scarcely two feet and six inches his fathers dogs such as setters mastiffs greyhounds and a pack of beagles he sold or gave away as too large and too boisterous for his house replacing them by pugs and king charles spaniels and whatever other breeds of dog were the smallest his fathers stable was also sold for his own use whether riding or driving he had six black shetland ponies with four very choice piebald animals of new forest breed  having thus settled his household entirely to his own satisfaction it only remained for him to find some suitable companion with whom to share his paradise sir hercules had a susceptible heart and had more than once between the ages of sixteen and twenty felt what it was to love but here his deformity had been a source of the most bitter humiliation for having once dared to declare himself to a young lady of his choice he had been received with laughter on his persisting she had picked him up and shaken him like an importunate child telling him to run away and plague her no more the story soon got aboutindeed the young lady herself used to tell it as a particularly pleasant anecdoteand the taunts and mockery it occasioned were a source of the most acute distress to hercules from the poems written at this period we gather that he meditated taking his own life in course of time however he lived down this humiliation but never again though he often fell in love and that very passionately did he dare to make any advances to those in whom he was interested after coming to the estate and finding that he was in a position to create his own world as he desired it he saw that if he was to have a wifewhich he very much desired being of an affectionate and indeed amorous temperhe must choose her as he had chosen his servantsfrom among the race of dwarfs but to find a suitable wife was he found a matter of some difficulty for he would marry none who was not distinguished by beauty and gentle birth the dwarfish daughter of lord bemboro he refused on the ground that besides being a pigmy she was hunchbacked while another young lady an orphan belonging to a very good family in hampshire was rejected by him because her face like that of so many dwarfs was wizened and repulsive finally when he was almost despairing of success he heard from a reliable source that count titimalo a venetian nobleman possessed a daughter of exquisite beauty and great accomplishments who was by three feet in height setting out at once for venice he went immediately on his arrival to pay his respects to the count whom he found living with his wife and five children in a very mean apartment in one of the poorer quarters of the town indeed the count was so far reduced in his circumstances that he was even then negotiating so it was rumoured with a travelling company of clowns and acrobats who had had the misfortune to lose their performing dwarf for the sale of his diminutive daughter filomena sir hercules arrived in time to save her from this untoward fate for he was so much charmed by filomenas grace and beauty that at the end of three days courtship he made her a formal offer of marriage which was accepted by her no less joyfully than by her father who perceived in an english soninlaw a rich and unfailing source of revenue after an unostentatious marriage at which the english ambassador acted as one of the witnesses sir hercules and his bride returned by sea to england where they settled down as it proved to a life of uneventful happiness  crome and its household of dwarfs delighted filomena who felt herself now for the first time to be a free woman living among her equals in a friendly world she had many tastes in common with her husband especially that of music she had a beautiful voice of a power surprising in one so small and could touch a in alt without effort accompanied by her husband on his fine cremona fiddle which he played as we have noted before as one plays a bass viol she would sing all the liveliest and tenderest airs from the operas and cantatas of her native country seated together at the harpsichord they found that they could with their four hands play all the music written for two hands of ordinary size a circumstance which gave sir hercules unfailing pleasure  when they were not making music or reading together which they often did both in english and italian they spent their time in healthful outdoor exercises sometimes rowing in a little boat on the lake but more often riding or driving occupations in which because they were entirely new to her filomena especially delighted when she had become a perfectly proficient rider filomena and her husband used often to go hunting in the park at that time very much more extensive than it is now they hunted not foxes nor hares but rabbits using a pack of about thirty black and fawncoloured pugs a kind of dog which when not overfed can course a rabbit as well as any of the smaller breeds four dwarf grooms dressed in scarlet liveries and mounted on white exmoor ponies hunted the pack while their master and mistress in green habits followed either on the black shetlands or on the piebald new forest ponies a picture of the whole huntdogs horses grooms and masterswas painted by william stubbs whose work sir hercules admired so much that he invited him though a man of ordinary stature to come and stay at the mansion for the purpose of executing this picture stubbs likewise painted a portrait of sir hercules and his lady driving in their green enamelled calash drawn by four black shetlands sir hercules wears a plumcoloured velvet coat and white breeches filomena is dressed in flowered muslin and a very large hat with pink feathers the two figures in their gay carriage stand out sharply against a dark background of trees but to the left of the picture the trees fall away and disappear so that the four black ponies are seen against a pale and strangely lurid sky that has the goldenbrown colour of thunderclouds lighted up by the sun  in this way four years passed happily by at the end of that time filomena found herself great with child sir hercules was overjoyed if god is good he wrote in his daybook the name of lapith will be preserved and our rarer and more delicate race transmitted through the generations until in the fullness of time the world shall recognise the superiority of those beings whom now it uses to make mock of on his wifes being brought to bed of a son he wrote a poem to the same effect the child was christened ferdinando in memory of the builder of the house  with the passage of the months a certain sense of disquiet began to invade the minds of sir hercules and his lady for the child was growing with an extraordinary rapidity at a year he weighed as much as hercules had weighed when he was three ferdinando goes crescendo wrote filomena in her diary it seems not natural at eighteen months the baby was almost as tall as their smallest jockey who was a man of thirtysix could it be that ferdinando was destined to become a man of the normal gigantic dimensions it was a thought to which neither of his parents dared yet give open utterance but in the secrecy of their respective diaries they brooded over it in terror and dismay  on his third birthday ferdinando was taller than his mother and not more than a couple of inches short of his fathers height today for the first time wrote sir hercules we discussed the situation the hideous truth can be concealed no longer ferdinando is not one of us on this his third birthday a day when we should have been rejoicing at the health the strength and beauty of our child we wept together over the ruin of our happiness god give us strength to bear this cross  at the age of eight ferdinando was so large and so exuberantly healthy that his parents decided though reluctantly to send him to school he was packed off to eton at the beginning of the next half a profound peace settled upon the house ferdinando returned for the summer holidays larger and stronger than ever one day he knocked down the butler and broke his arm he is rough inconsiderate unamenable to persuasion wrote his father the only thing that will teach him manners is corporal chastisement ferdinando who at this age was already seventeen inches taller than his father received no corporal chastisement  one summer holidays about three years later ferdinando returned to crome accompanied by a very large mastiff dog he had bought it from an old man at windsor who had found the beast too expensive to feed it was a savage unreliable animal hardly had it entered the house when it attacked one of sir herculess favourite pugs seizing the creature in its jaws and shaking it till it was nearly dead extremely put out by this occurrence sir hercules ordered that the beast should be chained up in the stableyard ferdinando sullenly answered that the dog was his and he would keep it where he pleased his father growing angry bade him take the animal out of the house at once on pain of his utmost displeasure ferdinando refused to move his mother at this moment coming into the room the dog flew at her knocked her down and in a twinkling had very severely mauled her arm and shoulder in another instant it must infallibly have had her by the throat had not sir hercules drawn his sword and stabbed the animal to the heart turning on his son he ordered him to leave the room immediately as being unfit to remain in the same place with the mother whom he had nearly murdered so aweinspiring was the spectacle of sir hercules standing with one foot on the carcase of the gigantic dog his sword drawn and still bloody so commanding were his voice his gestures and the expression of his face that ferdinando slunk out of the room in terror and behaved himself for all the rest of the vacation in an entirely exemplary fashion his mother soon recovered from the bites of the mastiff but the effect on her mind of this adventure was ineradicable from that time forth she lived always among imaginary terrors  the two years which ferdinando spent on the continent making the grand tour were a period of happy repose for his parents but even now the thought of the future haunted them nor were they able to solace themselves with all the diversions of their younger days the lady filomena had lost her voice and sir hercules was grown too rheumatical to play the violin he it is true still rode after his pugs but his wife felt herself too old and since the episode of the mastiff too nervous for such sports at most to please her husband she would follow the hunt at a distance in a little gig drawn by the safest and oldest of the shetlands  the day fixed for ferdinandos return came round filomena sick with vague dreads and presentiments retired to her chamber and her bed sir hercules received his son alone a giant in a brown travellingsuit entered the room welcome home my son said sir hercules in a voice that trembled a little  i hope i see you well sir ferdinando bent down to shake hands then straightened himself up again the top of his fathers head reached to the level of his hip  ferdinando had not come alone two friends of his own age accompanied him and each of the young men had brought a servant not for thirty years had crome been desecrated by the presence of so many members of the common race of men sir hercules was appalled and indignant but the laws of hospitality had to be obeyed he received the young gentlemen with grave politeness and sent the servants to the kitchen with orders that they should be well cared for  the old family diningtable was dragged out into the light and dusted sir hercules and his lady were accustomed to dine at a small table twenty inches high simon the aged butler who could only just look over the edge of the big table was helped at supper by the three servants brought by ferdinando and his guests  sir hercules presided and with his usual grace supported a conversation on the pleasures of foreign travel the beauties of art and nature to be met with abroad the opera at venice the singing of the orphans in the churches of the same city and on other topics of a similar nature the young men were not particularly attentive to his discourses they were occupied in watching the efforts of the butler to change the plates and replenish the glasses they covered their laughter by violent and repeated fits of coughing or choking sir hercules affected not to notice but changed the subject of the conversation to sport upon this one of the young men asked whether it was true as he had heard that he used to hunt the rabbit with a pack of pug dogs sir hercules replied that it was and proceeded to describe the chase in some detail the young men roared with laughter  when supper was over sir hercules climbed down from his chair and giving as his excuse that he must see how his lady did bade them goodnight the sound of laughter followed him up the stairs filomena was not asleep she had been lying on her bed listening to the sound of enormous laughter and the tread of strangely heavy feet on the stairs and along the corridors sir hercules drew a chair to her bedside and sat there for a long time in silence holding his wifes hand and sometimes gently squeezing it at about ten oclock they were startled by a violent noise there was a breaking of glass a stamping of feet with an outburst of shouts and laughter the uproar continuing for several minutes sir hercules rose to his feet and in spite of his wifes entreaties prepared to go and see what was happening there was no light on the staircase and sir hercules groped his way down cautiously lowering himself from stair to stair and standing for a moment on each tread before adventuring on a new step the noise was louder here the shouting articulated itself into recognisable words and phrases a line of light was visible under the diningroom door sir hercules tiptoed across the hall towards it just as he approached the door there was another terrific crash of breaking glass and jangled metal what could they be doing standing on tiptoe he managed to look through the keyhole in the middle of the ravaged table old simon the butler so primed with drink that he could scarcely keep his balance was dancing a jig his feet crunched and tinkled among the broken glass and his shoes were wet with spilt wine the three young men sat round thumping the table with their hands or with the empty wine bottles shouting and laughing encouragement the three servants leaning against the wall laughed too ferdinando suddenly threw a handful of walnuts at the dancers head which so dazed and surprised the little man that he staggered and fell down on his back upsetting a decanter and several glasses they raised him up gave him some brandy to drink thumped him on the back the old man smiled and hiccoughed tomorrow said ferdinando well have a concerted ballet of the whole household with father hercules wearing his club and lionskin added one of his companions and all three roared with laughter  sir hercules would look and listen no further he crossed the hall once more and began to climb the stairs lifting his knees painfully high at each degree this was the end there was no place for him now in the world no place for him and ferdinando together  his wife was still awake to her questioning glance he answered they are making mock of old simon tomorrow it will be our turn they were silent for a time  at last filomena said i do not want to see tomorrow  it is better not said sir hercules going into his closet he wrote in his daybook a full and particular account of all the events of the evening while he was still engaged in this task he rang for a servant and ordered hot water and a bath to be made ready for him at eleven oclock when he had finished writing he went into his wifes room and preparing a dose of opium twenty times as strong as that which she was accustomed to take when she could not sleep he brought it to her saying here is your sleepingdraught  filomena took the glass and lay for a little time but did not drink immediately the tears came into her eyes do you remember the songs we used to sing sitting out there sulla terrazza in the summertime she began singing softly in her ghost of a cracked voice a few bars from stradellas amor amor non dormir piu and you playing on the violin it seems such a short time ago and yet so long long long addio amore a rivederti she drank off the draught and lying back on the pillow closed her eyes sir hercules kissed her hand and tiptoed away as though he were afraid of waking her he returned to his closet and having recorded his wifes last words to him he poured into his bath the water that had been brought up in accordance with his orders the water being too hot for him to get into the bath at once he took down from the shelf his copy of suetonius he wished to read how seneca had died he opened the book at random but dwarfs he read he held in abhorrence as being lusus naturae and of evil omen he winced as though he had been struck this same augustus he remembered had exhibited in the amphitheatre a young man called lucius of good family who was not quite two feet in height and weighed seventeen pounds but had a stentorian voice he turned over the pages tiberius caligula claudius nero it was a tale of growing horror seneca his preceptor he forced to kill himself and there was petronius who had called his friends about him at the last bidding them talk to him not of the consolations of philosophy but of love and gallantry while the life was ebbing away through his opened veins dipping his pen once more in the ink he wrote on the last page of his diary he died a roman death then putting the toes of one foot into the water and finding that it was not too hot he threw off his dressinggown and taking a razor in his hand sat down in the bath with one deep cut he severed the artery in his left wrist then lay back and composed his mind to meditation the blood oozed out floating through the water in dissolving wreaths and spirals in a little while the whole bath was tinged with pink the colour deepened sir hercules felt himself mastered by an invincible drowsiness he was sinking from vague dream to dream soon he was sound asleep there was not much blood in his small body    chapter xiv  for their afterluncheon coffee the party generally adjourned to the library its windows looked east and at this hour of the day it was the coolest place in the whole house it was a large room fitted during the eighteenth century with white painted shelves of an elegant design in the middle of one wall a door ingeniously upholstered with rows of dummy books gave access to a deep cupboard where among a pile of letterfiles and old newspapers the mummycase of an egyptian lady brought back by the second sir ferdinando on his return from the grand tour mouldered in the darkness from ten yards away and at a first glance one might almost have mistaken this secret door for a section of shelving filled with genuine books coffeecup in hand mr scogan was standing in front of the dummy bookshelf between the sips he discoursed  the bottom shelf he was saying is taken up by an encyclopaedia in fourteen volumes useful but a little dull as is also caprimulges dictionary of the finnish language the biographical dictionary looks more promising biography of men who were born great biography of men who achieved greatness biography of men who had greatness thrust upon them and biography of men who were never great at all then there are ten volumes of thoms works and wanderings while the wild goose chase a novel by an anonymous author fills no less than six but whats this whats this mr scogan stood on tiptoe and peered up seven volumes of the tales of knockespotch the tales of knockespotch he repeated ah my dear henry he said turning round these are your best books i would willingly give all the rest of your library for them  the happy possessor of a multitude of first editions mr wimbush could afford to smile indulgently  is it possible mr scogan went on that they possess nothing more than a back and a title he opened the cupboard door and peeped inside as though he hoped to find the rest of the books behind it phooh he said and shut the door again it smells of dust and mildew how symbolical one comes to the great masterpieces of the past expecting some miraculous illumination and one finds on opening them only darkness and dust and a faint smell of decay after all what is reading but a vice like drink or venery or any other form of excessive selfindulgence one reads to tickle and amuse ones mind one reads above all to prevent oneself thinking stillthe tales of knockespotch  he paused and thoughtfully drummed with his fingers on the backs of the nonexistent unattainable books  but i disagree with you about reading said mary about serious reading i mean  quite right mary quite right mr scogan answered i had forgotten there were any serious people in the room  i like the idea of the biographies said denis theres room for us all within the scheme its comprehensive  yes the biographies are good the biographies are excellent mr scogan agreed i imagine them written in a very elegant regency stylebrighton pavilion in wordsperhaps by the great dr lempriere himself you know his classical dictionary ah mr scogan raised his hand and let it limply fall again in a gesture which implied that words failed him read his biography of helen read how jupiter disguised as a swan was enabled to avail himself of his situation visavis to leda and to think that he may have must have written these biographies of the great what a work henry and owing to the idiotic arrangement of your library it cant be read  i prefer the wild goose chase said anne a novel in six volumesit must be restful  restful mr scogan repeated youve hit on the right word a wild goose chase is sound but a bit oldfashionedpictures of clerical life in the fifties you know specimens of the landed gentry peasants for pathos and comedy and in the background always the picturesque beauties of nature soberly described all very good and solid but like certain puddings just a little dull personally i like much better the notion of thoms works and wanderings the eccentric mr thom of thoms hill old tom thom as his intimates used to call him he spent ten years in thibet organising the clarified butter industry on modern european lines and was able to retire at thirtysix with a handsome fortune the rest of his life he devoted to travel and ratiocination here is the result mr scogan tapped the dummy books and now we come to the tales of knockespotch what a masterpiece and what a great man knockespotch knew how to write fiction ah denis if you could only read knockespotch you wouldnt be writing a novel about the wearisome development of a young mans character you wouldnt be describing in endless fastidious detail cultured life in chelsea and bloomsbury and hampstead you would be trying to write a readable book but then alas owing to the peculiar arrangement of our hosts library you never will read knockespotch  nobody could regret the fact more than i do said denis  it was knockespotch mr scogan continued the great knockespotch who delivered us from the dreary tyranny of the realistic novel my life knockespotch said is not so long that i can afford to spend precious hours writing or reading descriptions of middleclass interiors he said again i am tired of seeing the human mind bogged in a social plenum i prefer to paint it in a vacuum freely and sportively bombinating  i say said gombauld knockespotch was a little obscure sometimes wasnt he  he was mr scogan replied and with intention it made him seem even profounder than he actually was but it was only in his aphorisms that he was so dark and oracular in his tales he was always luminous oh those talesthose tales how shall i describe them fabulous characters shoot across his pages like gaily dressed performers on the trapeze there are extraordinary adventures and still more extraordinary speculations intelligences and emotions relieved of all the imbecile preoccupations of civilised life move in intricate and subtle dances crossing and recrossing advancing retreating impinging an immense erudition and an immense fancy go hand in hand all the ideas of the present and of the past on every possible subject bob up among the tales smile gravely or grimace a caricature of themselves then disappear to make place for something new the verbal surface of his writing is rich and fantastically diversified the wit is incessant the  but couldnt you give us a specimen denis broke ina concrete example  alas mr scogan replied knockespotchs great book is like the sword excalibur it remains struck fast in this door awaiting the coming of a writer with genius enough to draw it forth i am not even a writer i am not so much as qualified to attempt the task the extraction of knockespotch from his wooden prison i leave my dear denis to you  thank you said denis    chapter xv  in the time of the amiable brantome mr scogan was saying every debutante at the french court was invited to dine at the kings table where she was served with wine in a handsome silver cup of italian workmanship it was no ordinary cup this goblet of the debutantes for inside it had been most curiously and ingeniously engraved with a series of very lively amorous scenes with each draught that the young lady swallowed these engravings became increasingly visible and the court looked on with interest every time she put her nose in the cup to see whether she blushed at what the ebbing wine revealed if the debutante blushed they laughed at her for her innocence if she did not she was laughed at for being too knowing  do you propose asked anne that the custom should be revived at buckingham palace  i do not said mr scogan i merely quoted the anecdote as an illustration of the customs so genially frank of the sixteenth century i might have quoted other anecdotes to show that the customs of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries and indeed of every other century from the time of hammurabi onward were equally genial and equally frank the only century in which customs were not characterised by the same cheerful openness was the nineteenth of blessed memory it was the astonishing exception and yet with what one must suppose was a deliberate disregard of history it looked upon its horribly pregnant silences as normal and natural and right the frankness of the previous fifteen or twenty thousand years was considered abnormal and perverse it was a curious phenomenon  i entirely agree mary panted with excitement in her effort to bring out what she had to say havelock ellis says  mr scogan like a policeman arresting the flow of traffic held up his hand he does i know and that brings me to my next point the nature of the reaction  havelock ellis  the reaction when it cameand we may say roughly that it set in a little before the beginning of this centurythe reaction was to openness but not to the same openness as had reigned in the earlier ages it was to a scientific openness not to the jovial frankness of the past that we returned the whole question of amour became a terribly serious one earnest young men wrote in the public prints that from this time forth it would be impossible ever again to make a joke of any sexual matter professors wrote thick books in which sex was sterilised and dissected it has become customary for serious young women like mary to discuss with philosophic calm matters of which the merest hint would have sufficed to throw the youth of the sixties into a delirium of amorous excitement it is all very estimable no doubt but stillmr scogan sighedi for one should like to see mingled with this scientific ardour a little more of the jovial spirit of rabelais and chaucer  i entirely disagree with you said mary sex isnt a laughing matter its serious  perhaps answered mr scogan perhaps im an obscene old man for i must confess that i cannot always regard it as wholly serious  but i tell you began mary furiously her face had flushed with excitement her cheeks were the cheeks of a great ripe peach  indeed mr scogan continued it seems to me one of few permanently and everlastingly amusing subjects that exist amour is the one human activity of any importance in which laughter and pleasure preponderate if ever so slightly over misery and pain  i entirely disagree said mary there was a silence  anne looked at her watch nearly a quarter to eight she said i wonder when ivor will turn up she got up from her deckchair and leaning her elbows on the balustrade of the terrace looked out over the valley and towards the farther hills under the level evening light the architecture of the land revealed itself the deep shadows the bright contrasting lights gave the hills a new solidity irregularities of the surface unsuspected before were picked out with light and shade the grass the corn the foliage of trees were stippled with intricate shadows the surface of things had taken on a marvellous enrichment  look said anne suddenly and pointed on the opposite side of the valley at the crest of the ridge a cloud of dust flushed by the sunlight to rosy gold was moving rapidly along the skyline its ivor one can tell by the speed  the dust cloud descended into the valley and was lost a horn with the voice of a sealion made itself heard approaching a minute later ivor came leaping round the corner of the house his hair waved in the wind of his own speed he laughed as he saw them  anne darling he cried and embraced her embraced mary very nearly embraced mr scogan well here i am ive come with incredulous speed ivors vocabulary was rich but a little erratic im not late for dinner am i he hoisted himself up on to the balustrade and sat there kicking his heels with one arm he embraced a large stone flowerpot leaning his head sideways against its hard and lichenous flanks in an attitude of trustful affection he had brown wavy hair and his eyes were of a very brilliant pale improbable blue his head was narrow his face thin and rather long his nose aquiline in old agethough it was difficult to imagine ivor oldhe might grow to have an iron ducal grimness but now at twentysix it was not the structure of his face that impressed one it was its expression that was charming and vivacious and his smile was an irradiation he was forever moving restlessly and rapidly but with an engaging gracefulness his frail and slender body seemed to be fed by a spring of inexhaustible energy  no youre not late  youre in time to answer a question said mr scogan we were arguing whether amour were a serious matter or no what do you think is it serious  serious echoed ivor most certainly  i told you so cried mary triumphantly  but in what sense serious mr scogan asked  i mean as an occupation one can go on with it without ever getting bored  i see said mr scogan perfectly  one can occupy oneself with it ivor continued always and everywhere women are always wonderfully the same shapes vary a little thats all in spainwith his free hand he described a series of ample curvesone cant pass them on the stairs in englandhe put the tip of his forefinger against the tip of his thumb and lowering his hand drew out this circle into an imaginary cylinderin england theyre tubular but their sentiments are always the same at least ive always found it so  im delighted to hear it said mr scogan    chapter xvi  the ladies had left the room and the port was circulating mr scogan filled his glass passed on the decanter and leaning back in his chair looked about him for a moment in silence the conversation rippled idly round him but he disregarded it he was smiling at some private joke gombauld noticed his smile  whats amusing you he asked  i was just looking at you all sitting round this table said mr scogan  are we as comic as all that  not at all mr scogan answered politely i was merely amused by my own speculations  and what were they  the idlest the most academic of speculations i was looking at you one by one and trying to imagine which of the first six caesars you would each resemble if you were given the opportunity of behaving like a caesar the caesars are one of my touchstones mr scogan explained they are characters functioning so to speak in the void they are human beings developed to their logical conclusions hence their unequalled value as a touchstone a standard when i meet someone for the first time i ask myself this question given the caesarean environment which of the caesars would this person resemblejulius augustus tiberius caligula claudius nero i take each trait of character each mental and emotional bias each little oddity and magnify them a thousand times the resulting image gives me his caesarean formula  and which of the caesars do you resemble asked gombauld  i am potentially all of them mr scogan replied allwith the possible exception of claudius who was much too stupid to be a development of anything in my character the seeds of juliuss courage and compelling energy of augustuss prudence of the libidinousness and cruelty of tiberius of caligulas folly of neros artistic genius and enormous vanity are all within me given the opportunities i might have been something fabulous but circumstances were against me i was born and brought up in a country rectory i passed my youth doing a great deal of utterly senseless hard work for a very little money the result is that now in middle age i am the poor thing that i am but perhaps it is as well perhaps too its as well that denis hasnt been permitted to flower into a little nero and that ivor remains only potentially a caligula yes its better so no doubt but it would have been more amusing as a spectacle if they had had the chance to develop untrammelled the full horror of their potentialities it would have been pleasant and interesting to watch their tics and foibles and little vices swelling and burgeoning and blossoming into enormous and fantastic flowers of cruelty and pride and lewdness and avarice the caesarean environment makes the caesar as the special food and the queenly cell make the queen bee we differ from the bees in so far that given the proper food they can be sure of making a queen every time with us there is no such certainty out of every ten men placed in the caesarean environment one will be temperamentally good or intelligent or great the rest will blossom into caesars he will not seventy and eighty years ago simpleminded people reading of the exploits of the bourbons in south italy cried out in amazement to think that such things should be happening in the nineteenth century and a few years since we too were astonished to find that in our still more astonishing twentieth century unhappy blackamoors on the congo and the amazon were being treated as english serfs were treated in the time of stephen today we are no longer surprised at these things the black and tans harry ireland the poles maltreat the silesians the bold fascisti slaughter their poorer countrymen we take it all for granted since the war we wonder at nothing we have created a caesarean environment and a host of little caesars has sprung up what could be more natural  mr scogan drank off what was left of his port and refilled the glass  at this very moment he went on the most frightful horrors are taking place in every corner of the world people are being crushed slashed disembowelled mangled their dead bodies rot and their eyes decay with the rest screams of pain and fear go pulsing through the air at the rate of eleven hundred feet per second after travelling for three seconds they are perfectly inaudible these are distressing facts but do we enjoy life any the less because of them most certainly we do not we feel sympathy no doubt we represent to ourselves imaginatively the sufferings of nations and individuals and we deplore them but after all what are sympathy and imagination precious little unless the person for whom we feel sympathy happens to be closely involved in our affections and even then they dont go very far and a good thing too for if one had an imagination vivid enough and a sympathy sufficiently sensitive really to comprehend and to feel the sufferings of other people one would never have a moments peace of mind a really sympathetic race would not so much as know the meaning of happiness but luckily as ive already said we arent a sympathetic race at the beginning of the war i used to think i really suffered through imagination and sympathy with those who physically suffered but after a month or two i had to admit that honestly i didnt and yet i think i have a more vivid imagination than most one is always alone in suffering the fact is depressing when one happens to be the sufferer but it makes pleasure possible for the rest of the world  there was a pause henry wimbush pushed back his chair  i think perhaps we ought to go and join the ladies he said  so do i said ivor jumping up with alacrity he turned to mr scogan fortunately he said we can share our pleasures we are not always condemned to be happy alone    chapter xvii  ivor brought his hands down with a bang on to the final chord of his rhapsody there was just a hint in that triumphant harmony that the seventh had been struck along with the octave by the thumb of the left hand but the general effect of splendid noise emerged clearly enough small details matter little so long as the general effect is good and besides that hint of the seventh was decidedly modern he turned round in his seat and tossed the hair back out of his eyes  there he said thats the best i can do for you im afraid  murmurs of applause and gratitude were heard and mary her large china eyes fixed on the performer cried out aloud wonderful and gasped for new breath as though she were suffocating  nature and fortune had vied with one another in heaping on ivor lombard all their choicest gifts he had wealth and he was perfectly independent he was good looking possessed an irresistible charm of manner and was the hero of more amorous successes than he could well remember his accomplishments were extraordinary for their number and variety he had a beautiful untrained tenor voice he could improvise with a startling brilliance rapidly and loudly on the piano he was a good amateur medium and telepathist and had a considerable firsthand knowledge of the next world he could write rhymed verses with an extraordinary rapidity for painting symbolical pictures he had a dashing style and if the drawing was sometimes a little weak the colour was always pyrotechnical he excelled in amateur theatricals and when occasion offered he could cook with genius he resembled shakespeare in knowing little latin and less greek for a mind like his education seemed supererogatory training would only have destroyed his natural aptitudes  lets go out into the garden ivor suggested its a wonderful night  thank you said mr scogan but i for one prefer these still more wonderful armchairs his pipe had begun to bubble oozily every time he pulled at it he was perfectly happy  henry wimbush was also happy he looked for a moment over his pincenez in ivors direction and then without saying anything returned to the grimy little sixteenthcentury account books which were now his favourite reading he knew more about sir ferdinandos household expenses than about his own  the outdoor party enrolled under ivors banner consisted of anne mary denis and rather unexpectedly jenny outside it was warm and dark there was no moon they walked up and down the terrace and ivor sang a neapolitan song stretti stretticlose closewith something about the little spanish girl to follow the atmosphere began to palpitate ivor put his arm round annes waist dropped his head sideways onto her shoulder and in that position walked on singing as he walked it seemed the easiest the most natural thing in the world denis wondered why he had never done it he hated ivor  lets go down to the pool said ivor he disengaged his embrace and turned round to shepherd his little flock they made their way along the side of the house to the entrance of the yewtree walk that led down to the lower garden between the blank precipitous wall of the house and the tall yew trees the path was a chasm of impenetrable gloom somewhere there were steps down to the right a gap in the yew hedge denis who headed the party groped his way cautiously in this darkness one had an irrational fear of yawning precipices of horrible spiked obstructions suddenly from behind him he heard a shrill startled oh and then a sharp dry concussion that might have been the sound of a slap after that jennys voice was heard pronouncing i am going back to the house her tone was decided and even as she pronounced the words she was melting away into the darkness the incident whatever it had been was closed denis resumed his forward groping from somewhere behind ivor began to sing again softly  phillis plus avare que tendre ne gagnant rien a refuser un jour exigea a silvandre trente moutons pour un baiser  the melody drooped and climbed again with a kind of easy languor the warm darkness seemed to pulse like blood about them  le lendemain nouvelle affaire pour le berger le troc fut bon  here are the steps cried denis he guided his companions over the danger and in a moment they had the turf of the yewtree walk under their feet it was lighter here or at least it was just perceptibly less dark for the yew walk was wider than the path that had led them under the lea of the house looking up they could see between the high black hedges a strip of sky and a few stars  car il obtint de la bergere  went on ivor and then interrupted himself to shout im going to run down and he was off full speed down the invisible slope singing unevenly as he went  trente baisers pour un mouton  the others followed denis shambled in the rear vainly exhorting everyone to caution the slope was steep one might break ones neck what was wrong with these people he wondered they had become like young kittens after a dose of catnip he himself felt a certain kittenishness sporting within him but it was like all his emotions rather a theoretical feeling it did not overmasteringly seek to express itself in a practical demonstration of kittenishness  be careful he shouted once more and hardly were the words out of his mouth when thump there was the sound of a heavy fall in front of him followed by the long fffff of a breath indrawn with pain and afterwards by a very sincere ooooh denis was almost pleased he had told them so the idiots and they wouldnt listen he trotted down the slope towards the unseen sufferer  mary came down the hill like a runaway steamengine it was tremendously exciting this blind rush through the dark she felt she would never stop but the ground grew level beneath her feet her speed insensibly slackened and suddenly she was caught by an extended arm and brought to an abrupt halt  well said ivor as he tightened his embrace youre caught now anne  she made an effort to release herself its not anne its mary  ivor burst into a peal of amused laughter so it is he exclaimed i seem to be making nothing but floaters this evening ive already made one with jenny he laughed again and there was something so jolly about his laughter that mary could not help laughing too he did not remove his encircling arm and somehow it was all so amusing and natural that mary made no further attempt to escape from it they walked along by the side of the pool interlaced mary was too short for him to be able with any comfort to lay his head on her shoulder he rubbed his cheek caressed and caressing against the thick sleek mass of her hair in a little while he began to sing again the night trembled amorously to the sound of his voice when he had finished he kissed her anne or mary mary or anne it didnt seem to make much difference which it was there were differences in detail of course but the general effect was the same and after all the general effect was the important thing  denis made his way down the hill  any damage done he called out  is that you denis ive hurt my ankle soand my knee and my hand im all in pieces  my poor anne he said but then he couldnt help adding it was silly to start running downhill in the dark  ass she retorted in a tone of tearful irritation of course it was  he sat down beside on the grass and found himself breathing the faint delicious atmosphere of perfume that she carried always with her  light a match she commanded i want to look at my wounds  he felt in his pockets for the matchbox the light spurted and then grew steady magically a little universe had been created a world of colours and formsannes face the shimmering orange of her dress her white bare arms a patch of green turfand round about a darkness that had become solid and utterly blind anne held out her hands both were green and earthy with her fall and the left exhibited two or three red abrasions  not so bad she said but denis was terribly distressed and his emotion was intensified when looking up at her face he saw that the trace of tears involuntary tears of pain lingered on her eyelashes he pulled out his handkerchief and began to wipe away the dirt from the wounded hand the match went out it was not worth while to light another anne allowed herself to be attended to meekly and gratefully thank you she said when he had finished cleaning and bandaging her hand and there was something in her tone that made him feel that she had lost her superiority over him that she was younger than he had become suddenly almost a child he felt tremendously large and protective the feeling was so strong that instinctively he put his arm about her she drew closer leaned against him and so they sat in silence then from below soft but wonderfully clear through the still darkness they heard the sound of ivors singing he was going on with his halffinished song  le lendemain phillis plus tendre ne voulant deplaire au berger fut trop heureuse de lui rendre trente moutons pour un baiser  there was a rather prolonged pause it was as though time were being allowed for the giving and receiving of a few of those thirty kisses then the voice sang on  le lendemain phillis peu sage aurait donne moutons et chien pour un baiser que le volage a lisette donnait pour rien  the last note died away into an uninterrupted silence  are you better denis whispered are you comfortable like this  she nodded a yes to both questions  trente moutons pour un baiser the sheep the woolly muttonbaa baa baa or the shepherd yes decidedly he felt himself to be the shepherd now he was the master the protector a wave of courage swelled through him warm as wine he turned his head and began to kiss her face at first rather randomly then with more precision on the mouth  anne averted her head he kissed the ear the smooth nape that this movement presented him no she protested no denis  why not  it spoils our friendship and that was so jolly  bosh said denis  she tried to explain cant you see she said it isntit isnt our stunt at all it was true somehow she had never thought of denis in the light of a man who might make love she had never so much as conceived the possibilities of an amorous relationship with him he was so absurdly young sososhe couldnt find the adjective but she knew what she meant  why isnt it our stunt asked denis and by the way thats a horrible and inappropriate expression  because it isnt  but if i say it is  it makes no difference i say it isnt  i shall make you say it is  all right denis but you must do it another time i must go in and get my ankle into hot water its beginning to swell  reasons of health could not be gainsaid denis got up reluctantly and helped his companion to her feet she took a cautious step ooh she halted and leaned heavily on his arm  ill carry you denis offered he had never tried to carry a woman but on the cinema it always looked an easy piece of heroism  you couldnt said anne  of course i can he felt larger and more protective than ever put your arms round my neck he ordered she did so and stooping he picked her up under the knees and lifted her from the ground good heavens what a weight he took five staggering steps up the slope then almost lost his equilibrium and had to deposit his burden suddenly with something of a bump  anne was shaking with laughter i said you couldnt my poor denis  i can said denis without conviction ill try again  its perfectly sweet of you to offer but id rather walk thanks she laid her hand on his shoulder and thus supported began to limp slowly up the hill  my poor denis she repeated and laughed again humiliated he was silent it seemed incredible that only two minutes ago he should have been holding her in his embrace kissing her incredible she was helpless then a child now she had regained all her superiority she was once more the faroff being desired and unassailable why had he been such a fool as to suggest that carrying stunt he reached the house in a state of the profoundest depression  he helped anne upstairs left her in the hands of a maid and came down again to the drawingroom he was surprised to find them all sitting just where he had left them he had expected that somehow everything would be quite differentit seemed such a prodigious time since he went away all silent and all damned he reflected as he looked at them mr scogans pipe still wheezed that was the only sound henry wimbush was still deep in his account books he had just made the discovery that sir ferdinando was in the habit of eating oysters the whole summer through regardless of the absence of the justifying r gombauld in hornrimmed spectacles was reading jenny was mysteriously scribbling in her red notebook and seated in her favourite armchair at the corner of the hearth priscilla was looking through a pile of drawings one by one she held them out at arms length and throwing back her mountainous orange head looked long and attentively through halfclosed eyelids she wore a pale seagreen dress on the slope of her mauvepowdered decolletage diamonds twinkled an immensely long cigaretteholder projected at an angle from her face diamonds were embedded in her highpiled coiffure they glittered every time she moved it was a batch of ivors drawingssketches of spirit life made in the course of tranced tours through the other world on the back of each sheet descriptive titles were written portrait of an angel 15th march 20 astral beings at play 3rd december 19 a party of souls on their way to a higher sphere 21st may 21 before examining the drawing on the obverse of each sheet she turned it over to read the title try as she couldand she tried hardpriscilla had never seen a vision or succeeded in establishing any communication with the spirit world she had to be content with the reported experiences of others  what have you done with the rest of your party she asked looking up as denis entered the room  he explained anne had gone to bed ivor and mary were still in the garden he selected a book and a comfortable chair and tried as far as the disturbed state of his mind would permit him to compose himself for an evenings reading the lamplight was utterly serene there was no movement save the stir of priscilla among her papers all silent and all damned denis repeated to himself all silent and all damned  it was nearly an hour later when ivor and mary made their appearance  we waited to see the moon rise said ivor  it was gibbous you know mary explained very technical and scientific  it was so beautiful down in the garden the trees the scent of the flowers the stars ivor waved his arms and when the moon came up it was really too much it made me burst into tears he sat down at the piano and opened the lid  there were a great many meteorites said mary to anyone who would listen the earth must just be coming into the summer shower of them in july and august  but ivor had already begun to strike the keys he played the garden the stars the scent of flowers the rising moon he even put in a nightingale that was not there mary looked on and listened with parted lips the others pursued their occupations without appearing to be seriously disturbed on this very july day exactly three hundred and fifty years ago sir ferdinando had eaten seven dozen oysters the discovery of this fact gave henry wimbush a peculiar pleasure he had a natural piety which made him delight in the celebration of memorial feasts the three hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the seven dozen oystershe wished he had known before dinner he would have ordered champagne  on her way to bed mary paid a call the light was out in annes room but she was not yet asleep  why didnt you come down to the garden with us mary asked  i fell down and twisted my ankle denis helped me home  mary was full of sympathy inwardly too she was relieved to find annes nonappearance so simply accounted for she had been vaguely suspicious down there in the gardensuspicious of what she hardly knew but there had seemed to be something a little louche in the way she had suddenly found herself alone with ivor not that she minded of course far from it but she didnt like the idea that perhaps she was the victim of a putup job  i do hope youll be better tomorrow she said and she commiserated with anne on all she had missedthe garden the stars the scent of flowers the meteorites through whose summer shower the earth was now passing the rising moon and its gibbosity and then they had had such interesting conversation what about about almost everything nature art science poetry the stars spiritualism the relations of the sexes music religion ivor she thought had an interesting mind  the two young ladies parted affectionately    chapter xviii  the nearest roman catholic church was upwards of twenty miles away ivor who was punctilious in his devotions came down early to breakfast and had his car at the door ready to start by a quarter to ten it was a smart expensivelooking machine enamelled a pure lemon yellow and upholstered in emerald green leather there were two seatsthree if you squeezed tightly enoughand their occupants were protected from wind dust and weather by a glazed sedan that rose an elegant eighteenthcentury hump from the midst of the body of the car  mary had never been to a roman catholic service thought it would be an interesting experience and when the car moved off through the great gates of the courtyard she was occupying the spare seat in the sedan the sealion horn roared faintlier faintlier and they were gone  in the parish church of crome mr bodiham preached on 1 kings vi 18 and the cedar of the house within was carved with knopsa sermon of immediately local interest for the past two years the problem of the war memorial had exercised the minds of all those in crome who had enough leisure or mental energy or party spirit to think of such things henry wimbush was all for a librarya library of local literature stocked with county histories old maps of the district monographs on the local antiquities dialect dictionaries handbooks of the local geology and natural history he liked to think of the villagers inspired by such reading making up parties of a sunday afternoon to look for fossils and flint arrowheads the villagers themselves favoured the idea of a memorial reservoir and water supply but the busiest and most articulate party followed mr bodiham in demanding something religious in charactera second lichgate for example a stainedglass window a monument of marble or if possible all three so far however nothing had been done partly because the memorial committee had never been able to agree partly for the more cogent reason that too little money had been subscribed to carry out any of the proposed schemes every three or four months mr bodiham preached a sermon on the subject his last had been delivered in march it was high time that his congregation had a fresh reminder  and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops  mr bodiham touched lightly on solomons temple from thence he passed to temples and churches in general what were the characteristics of these buildings dedicated to god obviously the fact of their from a human point of view complete uselessness they were unpractical buildings carved with knops solomon might have built a libraryindeed what could be more to the taste of the worlds wisest man he might have dug a reservoirwhat more useful in a parched city like jerusalem he did neither he built a house all carved with knops useless and unpractical why because he was dedicating the work to god there had been much talk in crome about the proposed war memorial a war memorial was in its very nature a work dedicated to god it was a token of thankfulness that the first stage in the culminating worldwar had been crowned by the triumph of righteousness it was at the same time a visibly embodied supplication that god might not long delay the advent which alone could bring the final peace a library a reservoir mr bodiham scornfully and indignantly condemned the idea these were works dedicated to man not to god as a war memorial they were totally unsuitable a lichgate had been suggested this was an object which answered perfectly to the definition of a war memorial a useless work dedicated to god and carved with knops one lichgate it was true already existed but nothing would be easier than to make a second entrance into the churchyard and a second entrance would need a second gate other suggestions had been made stainedglass windows a monument of marble both these were admirable especially the latter it was high time that the war memorial was erected it might soon be too late at any moment like a thief in the night god might come meanwhile a difficulty stood in the way funds were inadequate all should subscribe according to their means those who had lost relations in the war might reasonably be expected to subscribe a sum equal to that which they would have had to pay in funeral expenses if the relative had died while at home further delay was disastrous the war memorial must be built at once he appealed to the patriotism and the christian sentiments of all his hearers  henry wimbush walked home thinking of the books he would present to the war memorial library if ever it came into existence he took the path through the fields it was pleasanter than the road at the first stile a group of village boys loutish young fellows all dressed in the hideous illfitting black which makes a funeral of every english sunday and holiday were assembled drearily guffawing as they smoked their cigarettes they made way for henry wimbush touching their caps as he passed he returned their salute his bowler and face were one in their unruffled gravity  in sir ferdinandos time he reflected in the time of his son sir julius these young men would have had their sunday diversions even at crome remote and rustic crome there would have been archery skittles dancingsocial amusements in which they would have partaken as members of a conscious community now they had nothing nothing except mr bodihams forbidding boys club and the rare dances and concerts organised by himself boredom or the urban pleasures of the county metropolis were the alternatives that presented themselves to these poor youths country pleasures were no more they had been stamped out by the puritans  in manninghams diary for 1600 there was a queer passage he remembered a very queer passage certain magistrates in berkshire puritan magistrates had had wind of a scandal one moonlit summer night they had ridden out with their posse and there among the hills they had come upon a company of men and women dancing stark naked among the sheepcotes the magistrates and their men had ridden their horses into the crowd how selfconscious the poor people must suddenly have felt how helpless without their clothes against armed and booted horsemen the dancers were arrested whipped gaoled set in the stocks the moonlight dance is never danced again what old earthy panic rite came to extinction here he wondered who knowsperhaps their ancestors had danced like this in the moonlight ages before adam and eve were so much as thought of he liked to think so and now it was no more these weary young men if they wanted to dance would have to bicycle six miles to the town the country was desolate without life of its own without indigenous pleasures the pious magistrates had snuffed out for ever a little happy flame that had burned from the beginning of time  and as on tullias tomb one lamp burned clear unchanged for fifteen hundred year  he repeated the lines to himself and was desolated to think of all the murdered past    chapter xix  henry wimbushs long cigar burned aromatically the history of crome lay on his knee slowly he turned over the pages  i cant decide what episode to read you tonight he said thoughtfully sir ferdinandos voyages are not without interest then of course theres his son sir julius it was he who suffered from the delusion that his perspiration engendered flies it drove him finally to suicide or theres sir cyprian he turned the pages more rapidly or sir henry or sir georgeno im inclined to think i wont read about any of these  but you must read something insisted mr scogan taking his pipe out of his mouth  i think i shall read about my grandfather said henry wimbush and the events that led up to his marriage with the eldest daughter of the last sir ferdinando  good said mr scogan we are listening  before i begin reading said henry wimbush looking up from the book and taking off the pincenez which he had just fitted to his nosebefore their begin i must say a few preliminary words about sir ferdinando the last of the lapiths at the death of the virtuous and unfortunate sir hercules ferdinando found himself in possession of the family fortune not a little increased by his fathers temperance and thrift he applied himself forthwith to the task of spending it which he did in an ample and jovial fashion by the time he was forty he had eaten and above all drunk and loved away about half his capital and would infallibly have soon got rid of the rest in the same manner if he had not had the good fortune to become so madly enamoured of the rectors daughter as to make a proposal of marriage the young lady accepted him and in less than a year had become the absolute mistress of crome and her husband an extraordinary reformation made itself apparent in sir ferdinandos character he grew regular and economical in his habits he even became temperate rarely drinking more than a bottle and a half of port at a sitting the waning fortune of the lapiths began once more to wax and that in despite of the hard times for sir ferdinando married in 1809 in the height of the napoleonic wars a prosperous and dignified old age cheered by the spectacle of his childrens growth and happinessfor lady lapith had already borne him three daughters and there seemed no good reason why she should not bear many more of them and sons as wella patriarchal decline into the family vault seemed now to be sir ferdinandos enviable destiny but providence willed otherwise to napoleon cause already of such infinite mischief was due though perhaps indirectly the untimely and violent death which put a period to this reformed existence  sir ferdinando who was above all things a patriot had adopted from the earliest days of the conflict with the french his own peculiar method of celebrating our victories when the happy news reached london it was his custom to purchase immediately a large store of liquor and taking a place on whichever of the outgoing coaches he happened to light on first to drive through the country proclaiming the good news to all he met on the road and dispensing it along with the liquor at every stoppingplace to all who cared to listen or drink thus after the nile he had driven as far as edinburgh and later when the coaches wreathed with laurel for triumph with cypress for mourning were setting out with the news of nelsons victory and death he sat through all a chilly october night on the box of the norwich meteor with a nautical keg of rum on his knees and two cases of old brandy under the seat this genial custom was one of the many habits which he abandoned on his marriage the victories in the peninsula the retreat from moscow leipzig and the abdication of the tyrant all went uncelebrated it so happened however that in the summer of 1815 sir ferdinando was staying for a few weeks in the capital there had been a succession of anxious doubtful days then came the glorious news of waterloo it was too much for sir ferdinando his joyous youth awoke again within him he hurried to his wine merchant and bought a dozen bottles of 1760 brandy the bath coach was on the point of starting he bribed his way on to the box and seated in glory beside the driver proclaimed aloud the downfall of the corsican bandit and passed about the warm liquid joy they clattered through uxbridge slough maidenhead sleeping reading was awakened by the great news at didcot one of the ostlers was so much overcome by patriotic emotions and the 1760 brandy that he found it impossible to do up the buckles of the harness the night began to grow chilly and sir ferdinando found that it was not enough to take a nip at every stage to keep up his vital warmth he was compelled to drink between the stages as well they were approaching swindon the coach was travelling at a dizzy speedsix miles in the last halfhourwhen without having manifested the slightest premonitory symptom of unsteadiness sir ferdinando suddenly toppled sideways off his seat and fell head foremost into the road an unpleasant jolt awakened the slumbering passengers the coach was brought to a standstill the guard ran back with a light he found sir ferdinando still alive but unconscious blood was oozing from his mouth the back wheels of the coach had passed over his body breaking most of his ribs and both arms his skull was fractured in two places they picked him up but he was dead before they reached the next stage so perished sir ferdinando a victim to his own patriotism lady lapith did not marry again but determined to devote the rest of her life to the wellbeing of her three childrengeorgiana now five years old and emmeline and caroline twins of two  henry wimbush paused and once more put on his pincenez so much by way of introduction he said now i can begin to read about my grandfather  one moment said mr scogan till ive refilled my pipe  mr wimbush waited seated apart in a corner of the room ivor was showing mary his sketches of spirit life they spoke together in whispers  mr scogan had lighted his pipe again fire away he said  henry wimbush fired away  it was in the spring of 1833 that my grandfather george wimbush first made the acquaintance of the three lovely lapiths as they were always called he was then a young man of twentytwo with curly yellow hair and a smooth pink face that was the mirror of his youthful and ingenuous mind he had been educated at harrow and christ church he enjoyed hunting and all other field sports and though his circumstances were comfortable to the verge of affluence his pleasures were temperate and innocent his father an east indian merchant had destined him for a political career and had gone to considerable expense in acquiring a pleasant little cornish borough as a twentyfirst birthday gift for his son he was justly indignant when on the very eve of georges majority the reform bill of 1832 swept the borough out of existence the inauguration of georges political career had to be postponed at the time he got to know the lovely lapiths he was waiting he was not at all impatient  the lovely lapiths did not fail to impress him georgiana the eldest with her black ringlets her flashing eyes her noble aquiline profile her swanlike neck and sloping shoulders was orientally dazzling and the twins with their delicately turnedup noses their blue eyes and chestnut hair were an identical pair of ravishingly english charmers  their conversation at this first meeting proved however to be so forbidding that but for the invincible attraction exercised by their beauty george would never have had the courage to follow up the acquaintance the twins looking up their noses at him with an air of languid superiority asked him what he thought of the latest french poetry and whether he liked the indiana of george sand but what was almost worse was the question with which georgiana opened her conversation with him in music she asked leaning forward and fixing him with her large dark eyes are you a classicist or a transcendentalist george did not lose his presence of mind he had enough appreciation of music to know that he hated anything classical and so with a promptitude which did him credit he replied i am a transcendentalist georgiana smiled bewitchingly i am glad she said so am i you went to hear paganini last week of course the prayer of mosesah she closed her eyes do you know anything more transcendental than that no said george i dont he hesitated was about to go on speaking and then decided that after all it would be wiser not to saywhat was in fact truethat he had enjoyed above all paganinis farmyard imitations the man had made his fiddle bray like an ass cluck like a hen grunt squeal bark neigh quack bellow and growl that last item in georges estimation had almost compensated for the tediousness of the rest of the concert he smiled with pleasure at the thought of it yes decidedly he was no classicist in music he was a thoroughgoing transcendentalist  george followed up this first introduction by paying a call on the young ladies and their mother who occupied during the season a small but elegant house in the neighbourhood of berkeley square lady lapith made a few discreet inquiries and having found that georges financial position character and family were all passably good she asked him to dine she hoped and expected that her daughters would all marry into the peerage but being a prudent woman she knew it was advisable to prepare for all contingencies george wimbush she thought would make an excellent second string for one of the twins  at this first dinner georges partner was emmeline they talked of nature emmeline protested that to her high mountains were a feeling and the hum of human cities torture george agreed that the country was very agreeable but held that london during the season also had its charms he noticed with surprise and a certain solicitous distress that miss emmelines appetite was poor that it didnt in fact exist two spoonfuls of soup a morsel of fish no bird no meat and three grapesthat was her whole dinner he looked from time to time at her two sisters georgiana and caroline seemed to be quite as abstemious they waved away whatever was offered them with an expression of delicate disgust shutting their eyes and averting their faces from the proffered dish as though the lemon sole the duck the loin of veal the trifle were objects revolting to the sight and smell george who thought the dinner capital ventured to comment on the sisters lack of appetite  pray dont talk to me of eating said emmeline drooping like a sensitive plant we find it so coarse so unspiritual my sisters and i one cant think of ones soul while one is eating  george agreed one couldnt but one must live he said  alas emmeline sighed one must death is very beautiful dont you think she broke a corner off a piece of toast and began to nibble at it languidly but since as you say one must live she made a little gesture of resignation luckily a very little suffices to keep one alive she put down her corner of toast half eaten  george regarded her with some surprise she was pale but she looked extraordinarily healthy he thought so did her sisters perhaps if you were really spiritual you needed less food he clearly was not spiritual  after this he saw them frequently they all liked him from lady lapith downwards true he was not very romantic or poetical but he was such a pleasant unpretentious kindhearted young man that one couldnt help liking him for his part he thought them wonderful wonderful especially georgiana he enveloped them all in a warm protective affection for they needed protection they were altogether too frail too spiritual for this world they never ate they were always pale they often complained of fever they talked much and lovingly of death they frequently swooned georgiana was the most ethereal of all of the three she ate least swooned most often talked most of death and was the palestwith a pallor that was so startling as to appear positively artificial at any moment it seemed she might loose her precarious hold on this material world and become all spirit to george the thought was a continual agony if she were to die  she contrived however to live through the season and that in spite of the numerous balls routs and other parties of pleasure which in company with the rest of the lovely trio she never failed to attend in the middle of july the whole household moved down to the country george was invited to spend the month of august at crome  the houseparty was distinguished in the list of visitors figured the names of two marriageable young men of title george had hoped that country air repose and natural surroundings might have restored to the three sisters their appetites and the roses of their cheeks he was mistaken for dinner the first evening georgiana ate only an olive two or three salted almonds and half a peach she was as pale as ever during the meal she spoke of love  true love she said being infinite and eternal can only be consummated in eternity indiana and sir rodolphe celebrated the mystic wedding of their souls by jumping into niagara love is incompatible with life the wish of two people who truly love one another is not to live together but to die together  come come my dear said lady lapith stout and practical what would become of the next generation pray if all the world acted on your principles  mamma georgiana protested and dropped her eyes  in my young days lady lapith went on i should have been laughed out of countenance if id said a thing like that but then in my young days souls werent as fashionable as they are now and we didnt think death was at all poetical it was just unpleasant  mamma emmeline and caroline implored in unison  in my young days lady lapith was launched into her subject nothing it seemed could stop her now in my young days if you didnt eat people told you you needed a dose of rhubarb nowadays  there was a cry georgiana had swooned sideways on to lord timpanys shoulder it was a desperate expedient but it was successful lady lapith was stopped  the days passed in an uneventful round of pleasures of all the gay party george alone was unhappy lord timpany was paying his court to georgiana and it was clear that he was not unfavourably received george looked on and his soul was a hell of jealousy and despair the boisterous company of the young men became intolerable to him he shrank from them seeking gloom and solitude one morning having broken away from them on some vague pretext he returned to the house alone the young men were bathing in the pool below their cries and laughter floated up to him making the quiet house seem lonelier and more silent the lovely sisters and their mamma still kept their chambers they did not customarily make their appearance till luncheon so that the male guests had the morning to themselves george sat down in the hall and abandoned himself to thought  at any moment she might die at any moment she might become lady timpany it was terrible terrible if she died then he would die too he would go to seek her beyond the grave if she became lady timpanyah then the solution of the problem would not be so simple if she became lady timpany it was a horrible thought but then suppose she were in love with timpanythough it seemed incredible that anyone could be in love with timpanysuppose her life depended on timpany suppose she couldnt live without him he was fumbling his way along this clueless labyrinth of suppositions when the clock struck twelve on the last stroke like an automaton released by the turning clockwork a little maid holding a large covered tray popped out of the door that led from the kitchen regions into the hall from his deep armchair george watched her himself it was evident unobserved with an idle curiosity she pattered across the room and came to a halt in front of what seemed a blank expense of panelling she reached out her hand and to georges extreme astonishment a little door swung open revealing the foot of a winding staircase turning sideways in order to get her tray through the narrow opening the little maid darted in with a rapid crablike motion the door closed behind her with a click a minute later it opened again and the maid without her tray hurried back across the hall and disappeared in the direction of the kitchen george tried to recompose his thoughts but an invincible curiosity drew his mind towards the hidden door the staircase the little maid it was in vain he told himself that the matter was none of his business that to explore the secrets of that surprising door that mysterious staircase within would be a piece of unforgivable rudeness and indiscretion it was in vain for five minutes he struggled heroically with his curiosity but at the end of that time he found himself standing in front of the innocent sheet of panelling through which the little maid had disappeared a glance sufficed to show him the position of the secret doorsecret he perceived only to those who looked with a careless eye it was just an ordinary door let in flush with the panelling no latch nor handle betrayed its position but an unobtrusive catch sunk in the wood invited the thumb george was astonished that he had not noticed it before now he had seen it it was so obvious almost as obvious as the cupboard door in the library with its lines of imitation shelves and its dummy books he pulled back the catch and peeped inside the staircase of which the degrees were made not of stone but of blocks of ancient oak wound up and out of sight a slitlike window admitted the daylight he was at the foot of the central tower and the little window looked out over the terrace they were still shouting and splashing in the pool below  george closed the door and went back to his seat but his curiosity was not satisfied indeed this partial satisfaction had but whetted its appetite where did the staircase lead what was the errand of the little maid it was no business of his he kept repeatingno business of his he tried to read but his attention wandered a quarterpast twelve sounded on the harmonious clock suddenly determined george rose crossed the room opened the hidden door and began to ascend the stairs he passed the first window corkscrewed round and came to another he paused for a moment to look out his heart beat uncomfortably as though he were affronting some unknown danger what he was doing he told himself was extremely ungentlemanly horribly underbred he tiptoed onward and upward one turn more then half a turn and a door confronted him he halted before it listened he could hear no sound putting his eye to the keyhole he saw nothing but a stretch of white sunlit wall emboldened he turned the handle and stepped across the threshold there he halted petrified by what he saw mutely gaping  in the middle of a pleasantly sunny little roomit is now priscillas boudoir mr wimbush remarked parentheticallystood a small circular table of mahogany crystal porcelain and silverall the shining apparatus of an elegant mealwere mirrored in its polished depths the carcase of a cold chicken a bowl of fruit a great ham deeply gashed to its heart of tenderest white and pink the brown cannon ball of a cold plumpudding a slender hock bottle and a decanter of claret jostled one another for a place on this festive board and round the table sat the three sisters the three lovely lapithseating  at georges sudden entrance they had all looked towards the door and now they sat petrified by the same astonishment which kept george fixed and staring georgiana who sat immediately facing the door gazed at him with dark enormous eyes between the thumb and forefinger of her right hand she was holding a drumstick of the dismembered chicken her little finger elegantly crooked stood apart from the rest of her hand her mouth was open but the drumstick had never reached its destination it remained suspended frozen in midair the other two sisters had turned round to look at the intruder caroline still grasped her knife and fork emmelines fingers were round the stem of her claret glass for what seemed a very long time george and the three sisters stared at one another in silence they were a group of statues then suddenly there was movement georgiana dropped her chicken bone carolines knife and fork clattered on her plate the movement propagated itself grew more decisive emmeline sprang to her feet uttering a cry the wave of panic reached george he turned and mumbling something unintelligible as he went rushed out of the room and down the winding stairs he came to a standstill in the hall and there all by himself in the quiet house he began to laugh  at luncheon it was noticed that the sisters ate a little more than usual georgiana toyed with some french beans and a spoonful of calvesfoot jelly i feel a little stronger today she said to lord timpany when he congratulated her on this increase of appetite a little more material she added with a nervous laugh looking up she caught georges eye a blush suffused her cheeks and she looked hastily away  in the garden that afternoon they found themselves for a moment alone  you wont tell anyone george promise you wont tell anyone she implored it would make us look so ridiculous and besides eating is unspiritual isnt it say you wont tell anyone  i will said george brutally ill tell everyone unless  its blackmail  i dont care said george ill give you twentyfour hours to decide  lady lapith was disappointed of course she had hoped for better thingsfor timpany and a coronet but george after all wasnt so bad they were married at the new year  my poor grandfather mr wimbush added as he closed his book and put away his pincenez whenever i read in the papers about oppressed nationalities i think of him he relighted his cigar it was a maternal government highly centralised and there were no representative institutions  henry wimbush ceased speaking in the silence that ensued ivors whispered commentary on the spirit sketches once more became audible priscilla who had been dozing suddenly woke up  what she said in the startled tones of one newly returned to consciousness what  jenny caught the words she looked up smiled nodded reassuringly its about a ham she said  whats about a ham  what henry has been reading she closed the red notebook lying on her knees and slipped a rubber band round it im going to bed she announced and got up  so am i said anne yawning but she lacked the energy to rise from her armchair  the night was hot and oppressive round the open windows the curtains hung unmoving ivor fanning himself with the portrait of an astral being looked out into the darkness and drew a breath  the airs like wool he declared  it will get cooler after midnight said henry wimbush and cautiously added perhaps  i shant sleep i know  priscilla turned her head in his direction the monumental coiffure nodded exorbitantly at her slightest movement you must make an effort she said when i cant sleep i concentrate my will i say i will sleep i am asleep and pop off i go thats the power of thought  but does it work on stuffy nights ivor inquired i simply cannot sleep on a stuffy night  nor can i said mary except out of doors  out of doors what a wonderful idea in the end they decided to sleep on the towersmary on the western tower ivor on the eastern there was a flat expanse of leads on each of the towers and you could get a mattress through the trap doors that opened on to them under the stars under the gibbous moon assuredly they would sleep the mattresses were hauled up sheets and blankets were spread and an hour later the two insomniasts each on his separate tower were crying their goodnights across the dividing gulf  on mary the sleepcompelling charm of the open air did not work with its expected magic even through the mattress one could not fail to be aware that the leads were extremely hard then there were noises the owls screeched tirelessly and once roused by some unknown terror all the geese of the farmyard burst into a sudden frenzy of cackling the stars and the gibbous moon demanded to be looked at and when one meteorite had streaked across the sky you could not help waiting openeyed and alert for the next time passed the moon climbed higher and higher in the sky mary felt less sleepy than she had when she first came out she sat up and looked over the parapet had ivor been able to sleep she wondered and as though in answer to her mental question from behind the chimneystack at the farther end of the roof a white form noiselessly emergeda form that in the moonlight was recognisably ivors spreading his arms to right and left like a tightrope dancer he began to walk forward along the rooftree of the house he swayed terrifyingly as he advanced mary looked on speechlessly perhaps he was walking in his sleep suppose he were to wake up suddenly now if she spoke or moved it might mean his death she dared look no more but sank back on her pillows she listened intently for what seemed an immensely long time there was no sound then there was a patter of feet on the tiles followed by a scrabbling noise and a whispered damn and suddenly ivors head and shoulders appeared above the parapet one leg followed then the other he was on the leads mary pretended to wake up with a start  oh she said what are you doing here  i couldnt sleep he explained so i came along to see if you couldnt one gets bored by oneself on a tower dont you find it so  it was light before five long narrow clouds barred the east their edges bright with orange fire the sky was pale and watery with the mournful scream of a soul in pain a monstrous peacock flying heavily up from below alighted on the parapet of the tower ivor and mary started broad awake  catch him cried ivor jumping up well have a feather the frightened peacock ran up and down the parapet in an absurd distress curtseying and bobbing and clucking his long tail swung ponderously back and forth as he turned and turned again then with a flap and swish he launched himself upon the air and sailed magnificently earthward with a recovered dignity but he had left a trophy ivor had his feather a longlashed eye of purple and green of blue and gold he handed it to his companion  an angels feather he said  mary looked at it for a moment gravely and intently her purple pyjamas clothed her with an ampleness that hid the lines of her body she looked like some large comfortable unjointed toy a sort of teddybearbut a teddy bear with an angels head pink cheeks and hair like a bell of gold an angels face the feather of an angels wingsomehow the whole atmosphere of this sunrise was rather angelic  its extraordinary to think of sexual selection she said at last looking up from her contemplation of the miraculous feather  extraordinary ivor echoed i select you you select me what luck  he put his arm round her shoulders and they stood looking eastward the first sunlight had begun to warm and colour the pale light of the dawn mauve pyjamas and white pyjamas they were a young and charming couple the rising sun touched their faces it was all extremely symbolic but then if you choose to think so nothing in this world is not symbolical profound and beautiful truth  i must be getting back to my tower said ivor at last  already  im afraid so the varletry will soon be up and about  ivor there was a prolonged and silent farewell  and now said ivor i repeat my tightrope stunt  mary threw her arms round his neck you mustnt ivor its dangerous please  he had to yield at last to her entreaties all right he said ill go down through the house and up at the other end  he vanished through the trap door into the darkness that still lurked within the shuttered house a minute later he had reappeared on the farther tower he waved his hand and then sank down out of sight behind the parapet from below in the house came the thin wasplike buzzing of an alarumclock he had gone back just in time    chapter xx  ivor was gone lounging behind the windscreen in his yellow sedan he was whirling across rural england social and amorous engagements of the most urgent character called him from hall to baronial hall from castle to castle from elizabethan manorhouse to georgian mansion over the whole expanse of the kingdom today in somerset tomorrow in warwickshire on saturday in the west riding by tuesday morning in argyllivor never rested the whole summer through from the beginning of july till the end of september he devoted himself to his engagements he was a martyr to them in the autumn he went back to london for a holiday crome had been a little incident an evanescent bubble on the stream of his life it belonged already to the past by teatime he would be at gobley and there would be zenobias welcoming smile and on thursday morningbut that was a long long way ahead he would think of thursday morning when thursday morning arrived meanwhile there was gobley meanwhile zenobia  in the visitors book at crome ivor had left according to his invariable custom in these cases a poem he had improvised it magisterially in the ten minutes preceding his departure denis and mr scogan strolled back together from the gates of the courtyard whence they had bidden their last farewells on the writingtable in the hall they found the visitors book open and ivors composition scarcely dry mr scogan read it aloud  the magic of those immemorial kings who webbed enchantment on the bowls of night sleeps in the soul of all created things in the blue sea th acroceraunian height in the eyed butterflys auricular wings and orgied visions of the anchorite in all that singing flies and flying sings in rain in pain in delicate delight but much more magic much more cogent spells weave here their wizardries about my soul crome calls me like the voice of vesperal bells haunts like a ghostlypeopled necropole fate tears me hence hard fate since far from crome my soul must weep remembering its home  very nice and tasteful and tactful said mr scogan when he had finished i am only troubled by the butterflys auricular wings you have a firsthand knowledge of the workings of a poets mind denis perhaps you can explain  what could be simpler said denis its a beautiful word and ivor wanted to say that the wings were golden  you make it luminously clear  one suffers so much denis went on from the fact that beautiful words dont always mean what they ought to mean recently for example i had a whole poem ruined just because the word carminative didnt mean what it ought to have meant carminativeits admirable isnt it  admirable mr scogan agreed and what does it mean  its a word ive treasured from my earliest infancy said denis treasured and loved they used to give me cinnamon when i had a coldquite useless but not disagreeable one poured it drop by drop out of narrow bottles a golden liquor fierce and fiery on the label was a list of its virtues and among other things it was described as being in the highest degree carminative i adored the word isnt it carminative i used to say to myself when id taken my dose it seemed so wonderfully to describe that sensation of internal warmth that glow thatwhat shall i call itphysical selfsatisfaction which followed the drinking of cinnamon later when i discovered alcohol carminative described for me that similar but nobler more spiritual glow which wine evokes not only in the body but in the soul as well the carminative virtues of burgundy of rum of old brandy of lacryma christi of marsala of aleatico of stout of gin of champagne of claret of the raw new wine of this years tuscan vintagei compared them i classified them marsala is rosily downily carminative gin pricks and refreshes while it warms i had a whole table of carmination values and nowdenis spread out his hands palms upwards despairinglynow i know what carminative really means  well what does it mean asked mr scogan a little impatiently  carminative said denis lingering lovingly over the syllables carminative i imagined vaguely that it had something to do with carmencarminis still more vaguely with carocarnis and its derivations like carnival and carnation carminativethere was the idea of singing and the idea of flesh rosecoloured and warm with a suggestion of the jollities of micareme and the masked holidays of venice carminativethe warmth the glow the interior ripeness were all in the word instead of which  do come to the point my dear denis protested mr scogan do come to the point  well i wrote a poem the other day said denis i wrote a poem about the effects of love  others have done the same before you said mr scogan there is no need to be ashamed  i was putting forward the notion denis went on that the effects of love were often similar to the effects of wine that eros could intoxicate as well as bacchus love for example is essentially carminative it gives one the sense of warmth the glow       and passion carminative as wine  was what i wrote not only was the line elegantly sonorous it was also i flattered myself very aptly compendiously expressive everything was in the word carminativea detailed exact foreground an immense indefinite hinterland of suggestion       and passion carminative as wine  i was not illpleased and then suddenly it occurred to me that i had never actually looked up the word in a dictionary carminative had grown up with me from the days of the cinnamon bottle it had always been taken for granted carminative for me the word was as rich in content as some tremendous elaborate work of art it was a complete landscape with figures       and passion carminative as wine  it was the first time i had ever committed the word to writing and all at once i felt i would like lexicographical authority for it a small englishgerman dictionary was all i had at hand i turned up c ca car carm there it was carminative windtreibend windtreibend he repeated mr scogan laughed denis shook his head ah he said for me it was no laughing matter for me it marked the end of a chapter the death of something young and precious there were the yearsyears of childhood and innocencewhen i had believed that carminative meantwell carminative and now before me lies the rest of my lifea day perhaps ten years half a century when i shall know that carminative means windtreibend       plus ne suis ce que jai ete et ne le saurai jamais etre  it is a realisation that makes one rather melancholy  carminative said mr scogan thoughtfully  carminative denis repeated and they were silent for a time words said denis at last wordsi wonder if you can realise how much i love them you are too much preoccupied with mere things and ideas and people to understand the full beauty of words your mind is not a literary mind the spectacle of mr gladstone finding thirtyfour rhymes to the name margot seems to you rather pathetic than anything else mallarmes envelopes with their versified addresses leave you cold unless they leave you pitiful you cant see that  apte a ne point te cabrer hue poste et jajouterai dia si tu ne fuis onzebis rue balzac chez cet heredia  is a little miracle  youre right said mr scogan i cant  you dont feel it to be magical  no  thats the test for the literary mind said denis the feeling of magic the sense that words have power the technical verbal part of literature is simply a development of magic words are mans first and most grandiose invention with language he created a whole new universe what wonder if he loved words and attributed power to them with fitted harmonious words the magicians summoned rabbits out of empty hats and spirits from the elements their descendants the literary men still go on with the process morticing their verbal formulas together and before the power of the finished spell trembling with delight and awe rabbits out of empty hats no their spells are more subtly powerful for they evoke emotions out of empty minds formulated by their art the most insipid statements become enormously significant for example i proffer the constatation black ladders lack bladders a selfevident truth one on which it would not have been worth while to insist had i chosen to formulate it in such words as black fireescapes have no bladders or les echelles noires manquent de vessie but since i put it as i do black ladders lack bladders it becomes for all its selfevidence significant unforgettable moving the creation by wordpower of something out of nothingwhat is that but magic and i may add what is that but literature half the worlds greatest poetry is simply les echelles noires manquent de vessie translated into magic significance as black ladders lack bladders and you cant appreciate words im sorry for you  a mental carminative said mr scogan reflectively thats what you need    chapter xxi  perched on its four stone mushrooms the little granary stood two or three feet above the grass of the green close beneath it there was a perpetual shade and a damp growth of long luxuriant grasses here in the shadow in the green dampness a family of white ducks had sought shelter from the afternoon sun some stood preening themselves some reposed with their long bellies pressed to the ground as though the cool grass were water little social noises burst fitfully forth and from time to time some pointed tail would execute a brilliant lisztian tremolo suddenly their jovial repose was shattered a prodigious thump shook the wooden flooring above their heads the whole granary trembled little fragments of dirt and crumbled wood rained down among them with a loud continuous quacking the ducks rushed out from beneath this nameless menace and did not stay their flight till they were safely in the farmyard  dont lose your temper anne was saying listen youve frightened the ducks poor dears no wonder she was sitting sideways in a low wooden chair her right elbow rested on the back of the chair and she supported her cheek on her hand her long slender body drooped into curves of a lazy grace she was smiling and she looked at gombauld through halfclosed eyes  damn you gombauld repeated and stamped his foot again he glared at her round the halffinished portrait on the easel  poor ducks anne repeated the sound of their quacking was faint in the distance it was inaudible  cant you see you make me lose my time he asked i cant work with you dangling about distractingly like this  youd lose less time if you stopped talking and stamping your feet and did a little painting for a change after all what am i dangling about for except to be painted  gombauld made a noise like a growl youre awful he said with conviction why do you ask me to come and stay here why do you tell me youd like me to paint your portrait  for the simple reasons that i like youat least when youre in a good temperand that i think youre a good painter  for the simple reasongombauld mimicked her voicethat you want me to make love to you and when i do to have the amusement of running away  anne threw back her head and laughed so you think it amuses me to have to evade your advances so like a man if you only knew how gross and awful and boring men are when they try to make love and you dont want them to make love if you could only see yourselves through our eyes  gombauld picked up his palette and brushes and attacked his canvas with the ardour of irritation i suppose youll be saying next that you didnt start the game that it was i who made the first advances and that you were the innocent victim who sat still and never did anything that could invite or allure me on  so like a man again said anne its always the same old story about the woman tempting the man the woman lures fascinates invites and mannoble man innocent manfalls a victim my poor gombauld surely youre not going to sing that old song again its so unintelligent and i always thought you were a man of sense  thanks said gombauld  be a little objective anne went on cant you see that youre simply externalising your own emotions thats what you men are always doing its so barbarously naive you feel one of your loose desires for some woman and because you desire her strongly you immediately accuse her of luring you on of deliberately provoking and inviting the desire you have the mentality of savages you might just as well say that a plate of strawberries and cream deliberately lures you on to feel greedy in ninetynine cases out of a hundred women are as passive and innocent as the strawberries and cream  well all i can say is that this must be the hundredth case said gombauld without looking up  anne shrugged her shoulders and gave vent to a sigh im at a loss to know whether youre more silly or more rude  after painting for a little time in silence gombauld began to speak again and then theres denis he said renewing the conversation as though it had only just been broken off youre playing the same game with him why cant you leave that wretched young man in peace  anne flushed with a sudden and uncontrollable anger its perfectly untrue about denis she said indignantly i never dreamt of playing what you beautifully call the same game with him recovering her calm she added in her ordinary cooing voice and with her exacerbating smile youve become very protective towards poor denis all of a sudden  i have gombauld replied with a gravity that was somehow a little too solemn i dont like to see a young man  being whirled along the road to ruin said anne continuing his sentence for him i admire your sentiments and believe me i share them  she was curiously irritated at what gombauld had said about denis it happened to be so completely untrue gombauld might have some slight ground for his reproaches but denisno she had never flirted with denis poor boy he was very sweet she became somewhat pensive  gombauld painted on with fury the restlessness of an unsatisfied desire which before had distracted his mind making work impossible seemed now to have converted itself into a kind of feverish energy when it was finished he told himself the portrait would be diabolic he was painting her in the pose she had naturally adopted at the first sitting seated sideways her elbow on the back of the chair her head and shoulders turned at an angle from the rest of her body towards the front she had fallen into an attitude of indolent abandonment he had emphasised the lazy curves of her body the lines sagged as they crossed the canvas the grace of the painted figure seemed to be melting into a kind of soft decay the hand that lay along the knee was as limp as a glove he was at work on the face now it had begun to emerge on the canvas dolllike in its regularity and listlessness it was annes facebut her face as it would be utterly unillumined by the inward lights of thought and emotion it was the lazy expressionless mask which was sometimes her face the portrait was terribly like and at the same time it was the most malicious of lies yes it would be diabolic when it was finished gombauld decided he wondered what she would think of it    chapter xxii  for the sake of peace and quiet denis had retired earlier on this same afternoon to his bedroom he wanted to work but the hour was a drowsy one and lunch so recently eaten weighed heavily on body and mind the meridian demon was upon him he was possessed by that bored and hopeless postprandial melancholy which the coenobites of old knew and feared under the name of accidie he felt like ernest dowson a little weary he was in the mood to write something rather exquisite and gentle and quietist in tone something a little droopy and at the same timehow should he put ita little infinite he thought of anne of love hopeless and unattainable perhaps that was the ideal kind of love the hopeless kindthe quiet theoretical kind of love in this sad mood of repletion he could well believe it he began to write one elegant quatrain had flowed from beneath his pen  a brooding love which is at most the stealth of moonbeams when they slide evoking colours bloodless ghost oer some scarcebreathing breast or side  when his attention was attracted by a sound from outside he looked down from his window there they were anne and gombauld talking laughing together they crossed the courtyard in front and passed out of sight through the gate in the righthand wall that was the way to the green close and the granary she was going to sit for him again his pleasantly depressing melancholy was dissipated by a puff of violent emotion angrily he threw his quatrain into the wastepaper basket and ran downstairs the stealth of moonbeams indeed  in the hall he saw mr scogan the man seemed to be lying in wait denis tried to escape but in vain mr scogans eye glittered like the eye of the ancient mariner  not so fast he said stretching out a small saurian hand with pointed nailsnot so fast i was just going down to the flower garden to take the sun well go together  denis abandoned himself mr scogan put on his hat and they went out arm in arm on the shaven turf of the terrace henry wimbush and mary were playing a solemn game of bowls they descended by the yewtree walk it was here thought denis here that anne had fallen here that he had kissed her hereand he blushed with retrospective shame at the memoryhere that he had tried to carry her and failed life was awful  sanity said mr scogan suddenly breaking a long silence sanitythats whats wrong with me and thats what will be wrong with you my dear denis when youre old enough to be sane or insane in a sane world i should be a great man as things are in this curious establishment i am nothing at all to all intents and purposes i dont exist i am just vox et praeterea nihil  denis made no response he was thinking of other things after all he said to himselfafter all gombauld is better looking than i more entertaining more confident and besides hes already somebody and im still only potential  everything that ever gets done in this world is done by madmen mr scogan went on denis tried not to listen but the tireless insistence of mr scogans discourse gradually compelled his attention men such as i am such as you may possibly become have never achieved anything were too sane were merely reasonable we lack the human touch the compelling enthusiastic mania people are quite ready to listen to the philosophers for a little amusement just as they would listen to a fiddler or a mountebank but as to acting on the advice of the men of reasonnever wherever the choice has had to be made between the man of reason and the madman the world has unhesitatingly followed the madman for the madman appeals to what is fundamental to passion and the instincts the philosophers to what is superficial and supererogatoryreason  they entered the garden at the head of one of the alleys stood a green wooden bench embayed in the midst of a fragrant continent of lavender bushes it was here though the place was shadeless and one breathed hot dry perfume instead of airit was here that mr scogan elected to sit he thrived on untempered sunlight  consider for example the case of luther and erasmus he took out his pipe and began to fill it as he talked there was erasmus a man of reason if ever there was one people listened to him at firsta new virtuoso performing on that elegant and resourceful instrument the intellect they even admired and venerated him but did he move them to behave as he wanted them to behavereasonably decently or at least a little less porkishly than usual he did not and then luther appears violent passionate a madman insanely convinced about matters in which there can be no conviction he shouted and men rushed to follow him erasmus was no longer listened to he was reviled for his reasonableness luther was serious luther was realitylike the great war erasmus was only reason and decency he lacked the power being a sage to move men to action europe followed luther and embarked on a century and a half of war and bloody persecution its a melancholy story mr scogan lighted a match in the intense light the flame was all but invisible the smell of burning tobacco began to mingle with the sweetly acrid smell of the lavender  if you want to get men to act reasonably you must set about persuading them in a maniacal manner the very sane precepts of the founders of religions are only made infectious by means of enthusiasms which to a sane man must appear deplorable it is humiliating to find how impotent unadulterated sanity is sanity for example informs us that the only way in which we can preserve civilisation is by behaving decently and intelligently sanity appeals and argues our rulers persevere in their customary porkishness while we acquiesce and obey the only hope is a maniacal crusade i am ready when it comes to beat a tambourine with the loudest but at the same time i shall feel a little ashamed of myself howevermr scogan shrugged his shoulders and pipe in hand made a gesture of resignationits futile to complain that things are as they are the fact remains that sanity unassisted is useless what we want then is a sane and reasonable exploitation of the forces of insanity we sane men will have the power yet mr scogans eyes shone with a more than ordinary brightness and taking his pipe out of his mouth he gave vent to his loud dry and somehow rather fiendish laugh  but i dont want power said denis he was sitting in limp discomfort at one end of the bench shading his eyes from the intolerable light mr scogan bolt upright at the other end laughed again  everybody wants power he said power in some form or other the sort of power you hanker for is literary power some people want power to persecute other human beings you expend your lust for power in persecuting words twisting them moulding them torturing them to obey you but i divagate  do you asked denis faintly  yes mr scogan continued unheeding the time will come we men of intelligence will learn to harness the insanities to the service of reason we cant leave the world any longer to the direction of chance we cant allow dangerous maniacs like luther mad about dogma like napoleon mad about himself to go on casually appearing and turning everything upside down in the past it didnt so much matter but our modern machine is too delicate a few more knocks like the great war another luther or two and the whole concern will go to pieces in future the men of reason must see that the madness of the worlds maniacs is canalised into proper channels is made to do useful work like a mountain torrent driving a dynamo  making electricity to light a swiss hotel said denis you ought to complete the simile  mr scogan waved away the interruption theres only one thing to be done he said the men of intelligence must combine must conspire and seize power from the imbeciles and maniacs who now direct us they must found the rational state  the heat that was slowly paralysing all deniss mental and bodily faculties seemed to bring to mr scogan additional vitality he talked with an everincreasing energy his hands moved in sharp quick precise gestures his eyes shone hard dry and continuous his voice went on sounding and sounding in deniss ears with the insistence of a mechanical noise  in the rational state he heard mr scogan saying human beings will be separated out into distinct species not according to the colour of their eyes or the shape of their skulls but according to the qualities of their mind and temperament examining psychologists trained to what would now seem an almost superhuman clairvoyance will test each child that is born and assign it to its proper species duly labelled and docketed the child will be given the education suitable to members of its species and will be set in adult life to perform those functions which human beings of his variety are capable of performing  how many species will there be asked denis  a great many no doubt mr scogan answered the classification will be subtle and elaborate but it is not in the power of a prophet to go into details nor is it his business i will do more than indicate the three main species into which the subjects of the rational state will be divided  he paused cleared his throat and coughed once or twice evoking in deniss mind the vision of a table with a glass and waterbottle and lying across one corner a long white pointer for the lantern pictures  the three main species mr scogan went on will be these the directing intelligences the men of faith and the herd among the intelligences will be found all those capable of thought those who know how to attain a certain degree of freedomand alas how limited even among the most intelligent that freedom isfrom the mental bondage of their time a select body of intelligences drawn from among those who have turned their attention to the problems of practical life will be the governors of the rational state they will employ as their instruments of power the second great species of humanitythe men of faith the madmen as i have been calling them who believe in things unreasonably with passion and are ready to die for their beliefs and their desires these wild men with their fearful potentialities for good or for mischief will no longer be allowed to react casually to a casual environment there will be no more caesar borgias no more luthers and mohammeds no more joanna southcotts no more comstocks the oldfashioned man of faith and desire that haphazard creature of brute circumstance who might drive men to tears and repentance or who might equally well set them on to cutting one anothers throats will be replaced by a new sort of madman still externally the same still bubbling with a seemingly spontaneous enthusiasm but ah how very different from the madman of the past for the new man of faith will be expending his passion his desire and his enthusiasm in the propagation of some reasonable idea he will be all unawares the tool of some superior intelligence  mr scogan chuckled maliciously it was as though he were taking a revenge in the name of reason on enthusiasts from their earliest years as soon that is as the examining psychologists have assigned them their place in the classified scheme the men of faith will have had their special education under the eye of the intelligences moulded by a long process of suggestion they will go out into the world preaching and practising with a generous mania the coldly reasonable projects of the directors from above when these projects are accomplished or when the ideas that were useful a decade ago have ceased to be useful the intelligences will inspire a new generation of madmen with a new eternal truth the principal function of the men of faith will be to move and direct the multitude that third great species consisting of those countless millions who lack intelligence and are without valuable enthusiasm when any particular effort is required of the herd when it is thought necessary for the sake of solidarity that humanity shall be kindled and united by some single enthusiastic desire or idea the men of faith primed with some simple and satisfying creed will be sent out on a mission of evangelisation at ordinary times when the high spiritual temperature of a crusade would be unhealthy the men of faith will be quietly and earnestly busy with the great work of education in the upbringing of the herd humanitys almost boundless suggestibility will be scientifically exploited systematically from earliest infancy its members will be assured that there is no happiness to be found except in work and obedience they will be made to believe that they are happy that they are tremendously important beings and that everything they do is noble and significant for the lower species the earth will be restored to the centre of the universe and man to preeminence on the earth oh i envy the lot of the commonality in the rational state working their eight hours a day obeying their betters convinced of their own grandeur and significance and immortality they will be marvellously happy happier than any race of men has ever been they will go through life in a rosy state of intoxication from which they will never awake the men of faith will play the cupbearers at this lifelong bacchanal filling and ever filling again with the warm liquor that the intelligences in sad and sober privacy behind the scenes will brew for the intoxication of their subjects  and what will be my place in the rational state denis drowsily inquired from under his shading hand  mr scogan looked at him for a moment in silence its difficult to see where you would fit in he said at last you couldnt do manual work youre too independent and unsuggestible to belong to the larger herd you have none of the characteristics required in a man of faith as for the directing intelligences they will have to be marvellously clear and merciless and penetrating he paused and shook his head no i can see no place for you only the lethal chamber  deeply hurt denis emitted the imitation of a loud homeric laugh im getting sunstroke here he said and got up  mr scogan followed his example and they walked slowly away down the narrow path brushing the blue lavender flowers in their passage denis pulled a sprig of lavender and sniffed at it then some dark leaves of rosemary that smelt like incense in a cavernous church they passed a bed of opium poppies dispetaled now the round ripe seedheads were brown and drylike polynesian trophies denis thought severed heads stuck on poles he liked the fancy enough to impart it to mr scogan  like polynesian trophies uttered aloud the fancy seemed less charming and significant than it did when it first occurred to him  there was a silence and in a growing wave of sound the whir of the reaping machines swelled up from the fields beyond the garden and then receded into a remoter hum  it is satisfactory to think said mr scogan as they strolled slowly onward that a multitude of people are toiling in the harvest fields in order that we may talk of polynesia like every other good thing in this world leisure and culture have to be paid for fortunately however it is not the leisured and the cultured who have to pay let us be duly thankful for that my dear denisduly thankful he repeated and knocked the ashes out of his pipe  denis was not listening he had suddenly remembered anne she was with gombauldalone with him in his studio it was an intolerable thought  shall we go and pay a call on gombauld he suggested carelessly it would be amusing to see what hes doing now  he laughed inwardly to think how furious gombauld would be when he saw them arriving    chapter xxiii  gombauld was by no means so furious at their apparition as denis had hoped and expected he would be indeed he was rather pleased than annoyed when the two faces one brown and pointed the other round and pale appeared in the frame of the open door the energy born of his restless irritation was dying within him returning to its emotional elements a moment more and he would have been losing his temper againand anne would be keeping hers infuriatingly yes he was positively glad to see them  come in come in he called out hospitably  followed by mr scogan denis climbed the little ladder and stepped over the threshold he looked suspiciously from gombauld to his sitter and could learn nothing from the expression of their faces except that they both seemed pleased to see the visitors were they really glad or were they cunningly simulating gladness he wondered  mr scogan meanwhile was looking at the portrait  excellent he said approvingly excellent almost too true to character if that is possible yes positively too true but im surprised to find you putting in all this psychology business he pointed to the face and with his extended finger followed the slack curves of the painted figure i thought you were one of the fellows who went in exclusively for balanced masses and impinging planes  gombauld laughed this is a little infidelity he said  im sorry said mr scogan i for one without ever having had the slightest appreciation of painting have always taken particular pleasure in cubismus i like to see pictures from which nature has been completely banished pictures which are exclusively the product of the human mind they give me the same pleasure as i derive from a good piece of reasoning or a mathematical problem or an achievement of engineering nature or anything that reminds me of nature disturbs me it is too large too complicated above all too utterly pointless and incomprehensible i am at home with the works of man if i choose to set my mind to it i can understand anything that any man has made or thought that is why i always travel by tube never by bus if i can possibly help it for travelling by bus one cant avoid seeing even in london a few stray works of godthe sky for example an occasional tree the flowers in the windowboxes but travel by tube and you see nothing but the works of maniron riveted into geometrical forms straight lines of concrete patterned expanses of tiles all is human and the product of friendly and comprehensible minds all philosophies and all religionswhat are they but spiritual tubes bored through the universe through these narrow tunnels where all is recognisably human one travels comfortable and secure contriving to forget that all round and below and above them stretches the blind mass of earth endless and unexplored yes give me the tube and cubismus every time give me ideas so snug and neat and simple and well made and preserve me from nature preserve me from all thats inhumanly large and complicated and obscure i havent the courage and above all i havent the time to start wandering in that labyrinth  while mr scogan was discoursing denis had crossed over to the farther side of the little square chamber where anne was sitting still in her graceful lazy pose on the low chair  well he demanded looking at her almost fiercely what was he asking of her he hardly knew himself  anne looked up at him and for answer echoed his well in another a laughing key  denis had nothing more at the moment to say two or three canvases stood in the corner behind annes chair their faces turned to the wall he pulled them out and began to look at the paintings  may i see too anne requested  he stood them in a row against the wall anne had to turn round in her chair to look at them there was the big canvas of the man fallen from the horse there was a painting of flowers there was a small landscape his hands on the back of the chair denis leaned over her from behind the easel at the other side of the room mr scogan was talking away for a long time they looked at the pictures saying nothing or rather anne looked at the pictures while denis for the most part looked at anne  i like the man and the horse dont you she said at last looking up with an inquiring smile  denis nodded and then in a queer strangled voice as though it had cost him a great effort to utter the words he said i love you  it was a remark which anne had heard a good many times before and mostly heard with equanimity but on this occasionperhaps because they had come so unexpectedly perhaps for some other reasonthe words provoked in her a certain surprised commotion  my poor denis she managed to say with a laugh but she was blushing as she spoke    chapter xxiv  it was noon denis descending from his chamber where he had been making an unsuccessful effort to write something about nothing in particular found the drawingroom deserted he was about to go out into the garden when his eye fell on a familiar but mysterious objectthe large red notebook in which he had so often seen jenny quietly and busily scribbling she had left it lying on the windowseat the temptation was great he picked up the book and slipped off the elastic band that kept it discreetly closed  private not to be opened was written in capital letters on the cover he raised his eyebrows it was the sort of thing one wrote in ones latin grammar while one was still at ones preparatory school       black is the raven black is the rook      but blacker the thief who steals this book  it was curiously childish he thought and he smiled to himself he opened the book what he saw made him wince as though he had been struck  denis was his own severest critic so at least he had always believed he liked to think of himself as a merciless vivisector probing into the palpitating entrails of his own soul he was brown dog to himself his weaknesses his absurditiesno one knew them better than he did indeed in a vague way he imagined that nobody beside himself was aware of them at all it seemed somehow inconceivable that he should appear to other people as they appeared to him inconceivable that they ever spoke of him among themselves in that same freely critical and to be quite honest mildly malicious tone in which he was accustomed to talk of them in his own eyes he had defects but to see them was a privilege reserved to him alone for the rest of the world he was surely an image of flawless crystal it was almost axiomatic  on opening the red notebook that crystal image of himself crashed to the ground and was irreparably shattered he was not his own severest critic after all the discovery was a painful one  the fruit of jennys unobtrusive scribbling lay before him a caricature of himself reading the book was upsidedown in the background a dancing couple recognisable as gombauld and anne beneath the legend fable of the wallflower and the sour grapes fascinated and horrified denis pored over the drawing it was masterful a mute inglorious rouveyre appeared in every one of those cruelly clear lines the expression of the face an assumed aloofness and superiority tempered by a feeble envy the attitude of the body and limbs an attitude of studious and scholarly dignity given away by the fidgety pose of the turnedin feetthese things were terrible and more terrible still was the likeness was the magisterial certainty with which his physical peculiarities were all recorded and subtly exaggerated  denis looked deeper into the book there were caricatures of other people of priscilla and mr barbecuesmith of henry wimbush of anne and gombauld of mr scogan whom jenny had represented in a light that was more than slightly sinister that was indeed diabolic of mary and ivor he scarcely glanced at them a fearful desire to know the worst about himself possessed him he turned over the leaves lingering at nothing that was not his own image seven full pages were devoted to him  private not to be opened he had disobeyed the injunction he had only got what he deserved thoughtfully he closed the book and slid the rubber band once more into its place sadder and wiser he went out on to the terrace and so this he reflected this was how jenny employed the leisure hours in her ivory tower apart and he had thought her a simpleminded uncritical creature it was he it seemed who was the fool he felt no resentment towards jenny no the distressing thing wasnt jenny herself it was what she and the phenomenon of her red book represented what they stood for and concretely symbolised they represented all the vast conscious world of men outside himself they symbolised something that in his studious solitariness he was apt not to believe in he could stand at piccadilly circus could watch the crowds shuffle past and still imagine himself the one fully conscious intelligent individual being among all those thousands it seemed somehow impossible that other people should be in their way as elaborate and complete as he in his impossible and yet periodically he would make some painful discovery about the external world and the horrible reality of its consciousness and its intelligence the red notebook was one of these discoveries a footprint in the sand it put beyond a doubt the fact that the outer world really existed  sitting on the balustrade of the terrace he ruminated this unpleasant truth for some time still chewing on it he strolled pensively down towards the swimmingpool a peacock and his hen trailed their shabby finery across the turf of the lower lawn odious birds their necks thick and greedily fleshy at the roots tapered up to the cruel inanity of their brainless heads their flat eyes and piercing beaks the fabulists were right he reflected when they took beasts to illustrate their tractates of human morality animals resemble men with all the truthfulness of a caricature oh the red notebook he threw a piece of stick at the slowly pacing birds they rushed towards it thinking it was something to eat  he walked on the profound shade of a giant ilex tree engulfed him like a great wooden octopus it spread its long arms abroad  under the spreading ilex tree  he tried to remember who the poem was by but couldnt  the smith a brawny man is he with arms like rubber bands  just like his he would have to try and do his muller exercises more regularly  he emerged once more into the sunshine the pool lay before him reflecting in its bronze mirror the blue and various green of the summer day looking at it he thought of annes bare arms and sealsleek bathingdress her moving knees and feet  and little luce with the white legs and bouncing barbary  oh these rags and tags of other peoples making would he ever be able to call his brain his own was there indeed anything in it that was truly his own or was it simply an education  he walked slowly round the waters edge in an embayed recess among the surrounding yew trees leaning her back against the pedestal of a pleasantly comic version of the medici venus executed by some nameless mason of the seicento he saw mary pensively sitting  hullo he said for he was passing so close to her that he had to say something  mary looked up hullo she answered in a melancholy uninterested tone  in this alcove hewed out of the dark trees the atmosphere seemed to denis agreeably elegiac he sat down beside her under the shadow of the pudic goddess there was a prolonged silence  at breakfast that morning mary had found on her plate a picture postcard of gobley great park a stately georgian pile with a facade sixteen windows wide parterres in the foreground huge smooth lawns receding out of the picture to right and left ten years more of the hard times and gobley with all its peers will be deserted and decaying fifty years and the countryside will know the old landmarks no more they will have vanished as the monasteries vanished before them at the moment however marys mind was not moved by these considerations  on the back of the postcard next to the address was written in ivors bold large hand a single quatrain  hail maid of moonlight bride of the sun farewell like bright plumes moulted in an angels flight there sleep within my hearts most mystic cell memories of morning memories of the night  there followed a postscript of three lines would you mind asking one of the housemaids to forward the packet of safetyrazor blades i left in the drawer of my washstand thanksivor  seated under the venuss immemorial gesture mary considered life and love the abolition of her repressions so far from bringing the expected peace of mind had brought nothing but disquiet a new and hitherto unexperienced misery ivor ivorshe couldnt do without him now it was evident on the other hand from the poem on the back of the picture postcard that ivor could very well do without her he was at gobley now so was zenobia mary knew zenobia she thought of the last verse of the song he had sung that night in the garden  le lendemain phillis peu sage aurait donne moutons et chien pour un baiser que le volage a lisette donnait pour rien  mary shed tears at the memory she had never been so unhappy in all her life before  it was denis who first broke the silence the individual he began in a soft and sadly philosophical tone is not a selfsupporting universe there are times when he comes into contact with other individuals when he is forced to take cognisance of the existence of other universes besides himself  he had contrived this highly abstract generalisation as a preliminary to a personal confidence it was the first gambit in a conversation that was to lead up to jennys caricatures  true said mary and generalising for herself she added when one individual comes into intimate contact with another sheor he of course as the case may bemust almost inevitably receive or inflict suffering  one is apt denis went on to be so spellbound by the spectacle of ones own personality that one forgets that the spectacle presents itself to other people as well as to oneself  mary was not listening the difficulty she said makes itself acutely felt in matters of sex if one individual seeks intimate contact with another individual in the natural way she is certain to receive or inflict suffering if on the other hand she avoids contacts she risks the equally grave sufferings that follow on unnatural repressions as you see its a dilemma  when i think of my own case said denis making a more decided move in the desired direction i am amazed how ignorant i am of other peoples mentality in general and above all and in particular of their opinions about myself our minds are sealed books only occasionally opened to the outside world he made a gesture that was faintly suggestive of the drawing off of a rubber band  its an awful problem said mary thoughtfully one has to have had personal experience to realise quite how awful it is  exactly denis nodded one has to have had firsthand experience he leaned towards her and slightly lowered his voice this very morning for example he began but his confidences were cut short the deep voice of the gong tempered by distance to a pleasant booming floated down from the house it was lunchtime mechanically mary rose to her feet and denis a little hurt that she should exhibit such a desperate anxiety for her food and so slight an interest in his spiritual experiences followed her they made their way up to the house without speaking    chapter xxv  i hope you all realise said henry wimbush during dinner that next monday is bank holiday and that you will all be expected to help in the fair  heavens cried anne the fairi had forgotten all about it what a nightmare couldnt you put a stop to it uncle henry  mr wimbush sighed and shook his head alas he said i fear i cannot i should have liked to put an end to it years ago but the claims of charity are strong  its not charity we want anne murmured rebelliously its justice  besides mr wimbush went on the fair has become an institution let me see it must be twentytwo years since we started it it was a modest affair then now he made a sweeping movement with his hand and was silent  it spoke highly for mr wimbushs public spirit that he still continued to tolerate the fair beginning as a sort of glorified church bazaar cromes yearly charity fair had grown into a noisy thing of merrygorounds cocoanut shies and miscellaneous side showsa real genuine fair on the grand scale it was the local st bartholomew and the people of all the neighbouring villages with even a contingent from the county town flocked into the park for their bank holiday amusement the local hospital profited handsomely and it was this fact alone which prevented mr wimbush to whom the fair was a cause of recurrent and neverdiminishing agony from putting a stop to the nuisance which yearly desecrated his park and garden  ive made all the arrangements already henry wimbush went on some of the larger marquees will be put up tomorrow the swings and the merrygoround arrive on sunday  so theres no escape said anne turning to the rest of the party youll all have to do something as a special favour youre allowed to choose your slavery my job is the tea tent as usual aunt priscilla  my dear said mrs wimbush interrupting her i have more important things to think about than the fair but you need have no doubt that i shall do my best when monday comes to encourage the villagers  thats splendid said anne aunt priscilla will encourage the villagers what will you do mary  i wont do anything where i have to stand by and watch other people eat  then youll look after the childrens sports  all right mary agreed ill look after the childrens sports  and mr scogan  mr scogan reflected may i be allowed to tell fortunes he asked at last i think i should be good at telling fortunes  but you cant tell fortunes in that costume  cant i mr scogan surveyed himself  youll have to be dressed up do you still persist  im ready to suffer all indignities  good said anne and turning to gombauld you must be our lightning artist she said your portrait for a shilling in five minutes  its a pity im not ivor said gombauld with a laugh i could throw in a picture of their auras for an extra sixpence  mary flushed nothing is to be gained she said severely by speaking with levity of serious subjects and after all whatever your personal views may be psychical research is a perfectly serious subject  and what about denis  denis made a deprecating gesture i have no accomplishments he said ill just be one of those men who wear a thing in their buttonholes and go about telling people which is the way to tea and not to walk on the grass  no no said anne that wont do you must do something more than that  but what all the good jobs are taken and i can do nothing but lisp in numbers  well then you must lisp concluded anne you must write a poem for the occasionan ode on bank holiday well print it on uncle henrys press and sell it at twopence a copy  sixpence denis protested itll be worth sixpence  anne shook her head twopence she repeated firmly nobody will pay more than twopence  and now theres jenny said mr wimbush jenny he said raising his voice what will you do  denis thought of suggesting that she might draw caricatures at sixpence an execution but decided it would be wiser to go on feigning ignorance of her talent his mind reverted to the red notebook could it really be true that he looked like that  what will i do jenny echoed what will i do she frowned thoughtfully for a moment then her face brightened and she smiled when i was young she said i learnt to play the drums  the drums  jenny nodded and in proof of her assertion agitated her knife and fork like a pair of drumsticks over her plate if theres any opportunity of playing the drums she began  but of course said anne theres any amount of opportunity well put you down definitely for the drums thats the lot she added  and a very good lot too said gombauld i look forward to my bank holiday it ought to be gay  it ought indeed mr scogan assented but you may rest assured that it wont be no holiday is ever anything but a disappointment  come come protested gombauld my holiday at crome isnt being a disappointment  isnt it anne turned an ingenuous mask towards him  no it isnt he answered  im delighted to hear it  its in the very nature of things mr scogan went on our holidays cant help being disappointments reflect for a moment what is a holiday the ideal the platonic holiday of holidays is surely a complete and absolute change you agree with me in my definition mr scogan glanced from face to face round the table his sharp nose moved in a series of rapid jerks through all the points of the compass there was no sign of dissent he continued a complete and absolute change very well but isnt a complete and absolute change precisely the thing we can never havenever in the very nature of things mr scogan once more looked rapidly about him of course it is as ourselves as specimens of homo sapiens as members of a society how can we hope to have anything like an absolute change we are tied down by the frightful limitation of our human faculties by the notions which society imposes on us through our fatal suggestibility by our own personalities for us a complete holiday is out of the question some of us struggle manfully to take one but we never succeed if i may be allowed to express myself metaphorically we never succeed in getting farther than southend  youre depressing said anne  i mean to be mr scogan replied and expanding the fingers of his right hand he went on look at me for example what sort of a holiday can i take in endowing me with passions and faculties nature has been horribly niggardly the full range of human potentialities is in any case distressingly limited my range is a limitation within a limitation out of the ten octaves that make up the human instrument i can compass perhaps two thus while i may have a certain amount of intelligence i have no aesthetic sense while i possess the mathematical faculty i am wholly without the religious emotions while i am naturally addicted to venery i have little ambition and am not at all avaricious education has further limited my scope having been brought up in society i am impregnated with its laws not only should i be afraid of taking a holiday from them i should also feel it painful to try to do so in a word i have a conscience as well as a fear of gaol yes i know it by experience how often have i tried to take holidays to get away from myself my own boring nature my insufferable mental surroundings mr scogan sighed but always without success he added always without success in my youth i was always strivinghow hardto feel religiously and aesthetically here said i to myself are two tremendously important and exciting emotions life would be richer warmer brighter altogether more amusing if i could feel them i try to feel them i read the works of the mystics they seemed to me nothing but the most deplorable claptrapas indeed they always must to anyone who does not feel the same emotion as the authors felt when they were writing for it is the emotion that matters the written work is simply an attempt to express emotion which is in itself inexpressible in terms of intellect and logic the mystic objectifies a rich feeling in the pit of the stomach into a cosmology for other mystics that cosmology is a symbol of the rich feeling for the unreligious it is a symbol of nothing and so appears merely grotesque a melancholy fact but i divagate mr scogan checked himself so much for the religious emotion as for the aesthetici was at even greater pains to cultivate that i have looked at all the right works of art in every part of europe there was a time when i venture to believe i knew more about taddeo da poggibonsi more about the cryptic amico di taddeo even than henry does today i am happy to say i have forgotten most of the knowledge i then so laboriously acquired but without vanity i can assert that it was prodigious i dont pretend of course to know anything about nigger sculpture or the later seventeenth century in italy but about all the periods that were fashionable before 1900 i am or was omniscient yes i repeat it omniscient but did that fact make me any more appreciative of art in general it did not confronted by a picture of which i could tell you all the known and presumed historythe date when it was painted the character of the painter the influences that had gone to make it what it wasi felt none of that strange excitement and exaltation which is as i am informed by those who do feel it the true aesthetic emotion i felt nothing but a certain interest in the subject of the picture or more often when the subject was hackneyed and religious i felt nothing but a great weariness of spirit nevertheless i must have gone on looking at pictures for ten years before i would honestly admit to myself that they merely bored me since then i have given up all attempts to take a holiday i go on cultivating my old stale daily self in the resigned spirit with which a bank clerk performs from ten till six his daily task a holiday indeed im sorry for you gombauld if you still look forward to having a holiday  gombauld shrugged his shoulders perhaps he said my standards arent as elevated as yours but personally i found the war quite as thorough a holiday from all the ordinary decencies and sanities all the common emotions and preoccupations as i ever want to have  yes mr scogan thoughtfully agreed yes the war was certainly something of a holiday it was a step beyond southend it was westonsupermare it was almost ilfracombe    chapter xxvi  a little canvas village of tents and booths had sprung up just beyond the boundaries of the garden in the green expanse of the park a crowd thronged its streets the men dressed mostly in blackholiday best funeral bestthe women in pale muslins here and there tricolour bunting hung inert in the midst of the canvas town scarlet and gold and crystal the merrygoround glittered in the sun the balloonman walked among the crowd and above his head like a huge inverted bunch of manycoloured grapes the balloons strained upwards with a scythelike motion the boatswings reaped the air and from the funnel of the engine which worked the roundabout rose a thin scarcely wavering column of black smoke  denis had climbed to the top of one of sir ferdinandos towers and there standing on the sunbaked leads his elbows resting on the parapet he surveyed the scene the steamorgan sent up prodigious music the clashing of automatic cymbals beat out with inexorable precision the rhythm of piercingly sounded melodies the harmonies were like a musical shattering of glass and brass far down in the bass the last trump was hugely blowing and with such persistence such resonance that its alternate tonic and dominant detached themselves from the rest of the music and made a tune of their own a loud monotonous seesaw  denis leaned over the gulf of swirling noise if he threw himself over the parapet the noise would surely buoy him up keep him suspended bobbing as a fountain balances a ball on its breaking crest another fancy came to him this time in metrical form  my soul is a thin white sheet of parchment stretched over a bubbling cauldron  bad bad but he liked the idea of something thin and distended being blown up from underneath  my soul is a thin tent of gut  or better  my soul is a pale tenuous membrane  that was pleasing a thin tenuous membrane it had the right anatomical quality tight blown quivering in the blast of noisy life it was time for him to descend from the serene empyrean of words into the actual vortex he went down slowly my soul is a thin tenuous membrane  on the terrace stood a knot of distinguished visitors there was old lord moleyn like a caricature of an english milord in a french comic paper a long man with a long nose and long drooping moustaches and long teeth of old ivory and lower down absurdly a short covert coat and below that long long legs cased in pearlgrey trouserslegs that bent unsteadily at the knee and gave a kind of sideways wobble as he walked beside him short and thickset stood mr callamay the venerable conservative statesman with a face like a roman bust and short white hair young girls didnt much like going for motor drives alone with mr callamay and of old lord moleyn one wondered why he wasnt living in gilded exile on the island of capri among the other distinguished persons who for one reason or another find it impossible to live in england they were talking to anne laughing the one profoundly the other hootingly  a black silk balloon towing a blackandwhite striped parachute proved to be old mrs budge from the big house on the other side of the valley she stood low on the ground and the spikes of her blackandwhite sunshade menaced the eyes of priscilla wimbush who towered over hera massive figure dressed in purple and topped with a queenly toque on which the nodding black plumes recalled the splendours of a firstclass parisian funeral  denis peeped at them discreetly from the window of the morningroom his eyes were suddenly become innocent childlike unprejudiced they seemed these people inconceivably fantastic and yet they really existed they functioned by themselves they were conscious they had minds moreover he was like them could one believe it but the evidence of the red notebook was conclusive  it would have been polite to go and say how dyou do but at the moment denis did not want to talk could not have talked his soul was a tenuous tremulous pale membrane he would keep its sensibility intact and virgin as long as he could cautiously he crept out by a side door and made his way down towards the park his soul fluttered as he approached the noise and movement of the fair he paused for a moment on the brink then stepped in and was engulfed  hundreds of people each with his own private face and all of them real separate alive the thought was disquieting he paid twopence and saw the tatooed woman twopence more the largest rat in the world from the home of the rat he emerged just in time to see a hydrogenfilled balloon break loose for home a child howled up after it but calmly a perfect sphere of flushed opal it mounted mounted denis followed it with his eyes until it became lost in the blinding sunlight if he could but send his soul to follow it  he sighed stuck his stewards rosette in his buttonhole and started to push his way aimlessly but officially through the crowd    chapter xxvii  mr scogan had been accommodated in a little canvas hut dressed in a black skirt and a red bodice with a yellowandred bandana handkerchief tied round his black wig he lookedsharpnosed brown and wrinkledlike the bohemian hag of friths derby day a placard pinned to the curtain of the doorway announced the presence within the tent of sesostris the sorceress of ecbatana seated at a table mr scogan received his clients in mysterious silence indicating with a movement of the finger that they were to sit down opposite him and to extend their hands for his inspection he then examined the palm that was presented him using a magnifying glass and a pair of horn spectacles he had a terrifying way of shaking his head frowning and clicking with his tongue as he looked at the lines sometimes he would whisper as though to himself terrible terrible or god preserve us sketching out the sign of the cross as he uttered the words the clients who came in laughing grew suddenly grave they began to take the witch seriously she was a formidablelooking woman could it be was it possible that there was something in this sort of thing after all after all they thought as the hag shook her head over their hands after alland they waited with an uncomfortably beating heart for the oracle to speak after a long and silent inspection mr scogan would suddenly look up and ask in a hoarse whisper some horrifying question such as have you ever been hit on the head with a hammer by a young man with red hair when the answer was in the negative which it could hardly fail to be mr scogan would nod several times saying i was afraid so everything is still to come still to come though it cant be very far off now sometimes after a long examination he would just whisper where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise and refuse to divulge any details of a future too appalling to be envisaged without despair sesostris had a success of horror people stood in a queue outside the witchs booth waiting for the privilege of hearing sentence pronounced upon them  denis in the course of his round looked with curiosity at this crowd of suppliants before the shrine of the oracle he had a great desire to see how mr scogan played his part the canvas booth was a rickety illmade structure between its walls and its sagging roof were long gaping chinks and crannies denis went to the teatent and borrowed a wooden bench and a small union jack with these he hurried back to the booth of sesostris setting down the bench at the back of the booth he climbed up and with a great air of busy efficiency began to tie the union jack to the top of one of the tentpoles through the crannies in the canvas he could see almost the whole of the interior of the tent mr scogans bandanacovered head was just below him his terrifying whispers came clearly up denis looked and listened while the witch prophesied financial losses death by apoplexy destruction by airraids in the next war  is there going to be another war asked the old lady to whom he had predicted this end  very soon said mr scogan with an air of quiet confidence  the old lady was succeeded by a girl dressed in white muslin garnished with pink ribbons she was wearing a broad hat so that denis could not see her face but from her figure and the roundness of her bare arms he judged her young and pleasing mr scogan looked at her hand then whispered you are still virtuous  the young lady giggled and exclaimed oh lor  but you will not remain so for long added mr scogan sepulchrally the young lady giggled again destiny which interests itself in small things no less than in great has announced the fact upon your hand mr scogan took up the magnifyingglass and began once more to examine the white palm very interesting he said as though to himselfvery interesting its as clear as day he was silent  whats clear asked the girl  i dont think i ought to tell you mr scogan shook his head the pendulous brass earrings which he had screwed on to his ears tinkled  please please she implored  the witch seemed to ignore her remark afterwards its not at all clear the fates dont say whether you will settle down to married life and have four children or whether you will try to go on the cinema and have none they are only specific about this one rather crucial incident  what is it what is it oh do tell me  the white muslin figure leant eagerly forward  mr scogan sighed very well he said if you must know you must know but if anything untoward happens you must blame your own curiosity listen listen he lifted up a sharp clawnailed forefinger this is what the fates have written next sunday afternoon at six oclock you will be sitting on the second stile on the footpath that leads from the church to the lower road at that moment a man will appear walking along the footpath mr scogan looked at her hand again as though to refresh his memory of the details of the scene a man he repeateda small man with a sharp nose not exactly good looking nor precisely young but fascinating he lingered hissingly over the word he will ask you can you tell me the way to paradise and you will answer yes ill show you and walk with him down towards the little hazel copse i cannot read what will happen after that there was a silence  is it really true asked white muslin  the witch gave a shrug of the shoulders i merely tell you what i read in your hand good afternoon that will be sixpence yes i have change thank you good afternoon  denis stepped down from the bench tied insecurely and crookedly to the tentpole the union jack hung limp on the windless air if only i could do things like that he thought as he carried the bench back to the teatent  anne was sitting behind a long table filling thick white cups from an urn a neat pile of printed sheets lay before her on the table denis took one of them and looked at it affectionately it was his poem they had printed five hundred copies and very nice the quarto broadsheets looked  have you sold many he asked in a casual tone  anne put her head on one side deprecatingly only three so far im afraid but im giving a free copy to everyone who spends more than a shilling on his tea so in any case its having a circulation  denis made no reply but walked slowly away he looked at the broadsheet in his hand and read the lines to himself relishingly as he walked along  this day of roundabouts and swings struck weights shied cocoanuts tossed rings switchbacks aunt sallies and all such small high jinksyou call it ferial a holiday but paper noses sniffed the artificial roses of round venetian cheeks through half each carnival year and masks might laugh at things the naked face for shame would blush atlaugh and think no blame a holiday but galba showed elephants on an airy road jumbo trod the tightrope then and in the circus armed men stabbed home for sport and died to break those dull imperatives that make a prison of every working day where all must drudge and all obey sing holiday you do not know how to be free the russian snow flowered with bright blood whose roses spread petals of fading fading red that died into the snow again into the virgin snow and men from all ancient bonds were freed old law old custom and old creed old right and wrong there bled to death the frozen air received their breath a little smoke that died away and round about them where they lay the snow bloomed roses blood was there a red gay flower and only fair sing holiday beneath the tree of innocence and liberty paper nose and red cockade dance within the magic shade that makes them drunken merry and strong to laugh and sing their ferial song free free but echo answers faintly to the laughing dancers freeand faintly laughs and still within the hollows of the hill faintlier laughs and whispers free fadingly diminishingly free and laughter faints away sing holiday sing holiday  he folded the sheet carefully and put it in his pocket the thing had its merits oh decidedly decidedly but how unpleasant the crowd smelt he lit a cigarette the smell of cows was preferable he passed through the gate in the park wall into the garden the swimmingpool was a centre of noise and activity  second heat in the young ladies championship it was the polite voice of henry wimbush a crowd of sleek seallike figures in black bathingdresses surrounded him his grey bowler hat smooth round and motionless in the midst of a moving sea was an island of aristocratic calm  holding his tortoiseshellrimmed pincenez an inch or two in front of his eyes he read out names from a list  miss dolly miles miss rebecca balister miss doris gabell  five young persons ranged themselves on the brink from their seats of honour at the other end of the pool old lord moleyn and mr callamay looked on with eager interest  henry wimbush raised his hand there was an expectant silence when i say go go go he said there was an almost simultaneous splash  denis pushed his way through the spectators somebody plucked him by the sleeve he looked down it was old mrs budge  delighted to see you again mr stone she said in her rich husky voice she panted a little as she spoke like a shortwinded lapdog it was mrs budge who having read in the daily mirror that the government needed peach stoneswhat they needed them for she never knewhad made the collection of peach stones her peculiar bit of war work she had thirtysix peach trees in her walled garden as well as four hothouses in which trees could be forced so that she was able to eat peaches practically the whole year round in 1916 she ate 4200 peaches and sent the stones to the government in 1917 the military authorities called up three of her gardeners and what with this and the fact that it was a bad year for wall fruit she only managed to eat 2900 peaches during that crucial period of the national destinies in 1918 she did rather better for between january 1st and the date of the armistice she ate 3300 peaches since the armistice she had relaxed her efforts now she did not eat more than two or three peaches a day her constitution she complained had suffered but it had suffered for a good cause  denis answered her greeting by a vague and polite noise  so nice to see the young people enjoying themselves mrs budge went on and the old people too for that matter look at old lord moleyn and dear mr callamay isnt it delightful to see the way they enjoy themselves  denis looked he wasnt sure whether it was so very delightful after all why didnt they go and watch the sack races the two old gentlemen were engaged at the moment in congratulating the winner of the race it seemed an act of supererogatory graciousness for after all she had only won a heat  pretty little thing isnt she said mrs budge huskily and panted two or three times  yes denis nodded agreement sixteen slender but nubile he said to himself and laid up the phrase in his memory as a happy one old mr callamay had put on his spectacles to congratulate the victor and lord moleyn leaning forward over his walkingstick showed his long ivory teeth hungrily smiling  capital performance capital mr callamay was saying in his deep voice  the victor wriggled with embarrassment she stood with her hands behind her back rubbing one foot nervously on the other her wet bathingdress shone a torso of black polished marble  very good indeed said lord moleyn his voice seemed to come from just behind his teeth a toothy voice it was as though a dog should suddenly begin to speak he smiled again mr callamay readjusted his spectacles  when i say go go go  splash the third heat had started  do you know i never could learn to swim said mrs budge  really  but i used to be able to float  denis imagined her floatingup and down up and down on a great green swell a blown black bladder no that wasnt good that wasnt good at all a new winner was being congratulated she was atrociously stubby and fat the last one long and harmoniously continuously curved from knee to breast had been an eve by cranach but this this one was a bad rubens  gogogo henry wimbushs polite level voice once more pronounced the formula another batch of young ladies dived in  grown a little weary of sustaining a conversation with mrs budge denis conveniently remembered that his duties as a steward called him elsewhere he pushed out through the lines of spectators and made his way along the path left clear behind them he was thinking again that his soul was a pale tenuous membrane when he was startled by hearing a thin sibilant voice speaking apparently from just above his head pronounce the single word disgusting  he looked up sharply the path along which he was walking passed under the lee of a wall of clipped yew behind the hedge the ground sloped steeply up towards the foot of the terrace and the house for one standing on the higher ground it was easy to look over the dark barrier looking up denis saw two heads overtopping the hedge immediately above him he recognised the iron mask of mr bodiham and the pale colourless face of his wife they were looking over his head over the heads of the spectators at the swimmers in the pond  disgusting mrs bodiham repeated hissing softly  the rector turned up his iron mask towards the solid cobalt of the sky how long he said as though to himself how long he lowered his eyes again and they fell on deniss upturned curious face there was an abrupt movement and mr and mrs bodiham popped out of sight behind the hedge  denis continued his promenade he wandered past the merrygoround through the thronged streets of the canvas village the membrane of his soul flapped tumultuously in the noise and laughter in a ropedoff space beyond mary was directing the childrens sports little creatures seethed round about her making a shrill tinny clamour others clustered about the skirts and trousers of their parents marys face was shining in the heat with an immense output of energy she started a threelegged race denis looked on in admiration  youre wonderful he said coming up behind her and touching her on the arm ive never seen such energy  she turned towards him a face round red and honest as the setting sun the golden bell of her hair swung silently as she moved her head and quivered to rest  do you know denis she said in a low serious voice gasping a little as she spokedo you know that theres a woman here who has had three children in thirtyone months  really said denis making rapid mental calculations  its appalling ive been telling her about the malthusian league one really ought  but a sudden violent renewal of the metallic yelling announced the fact that somebody had won the race mary became once more the centre of a dangerous vortex it was time denis thought to move on he might be asked to do something if he stayed too long  he turned back towards the canvas village the thought of tea was making itself insistent in his mind tea tea tea but the teatent was horribly thronged anne with an unusual expression of grimness on her flushed face was furiously working the handle of the urn the brown liquid spurted incessantly into the proffered cups portentous in the farther corner of the tent priscilla in her royal toque was encouraging the villagers in a momentary lull denis could hear her deep jovial laughter and her manly voice clearly he told himself this was no place for one who wanted tea he stood irresolute at the entrance to the tent a beautiful thought suddenly came to him if he went back to the house went unobtrusively without being observed if he tiptoed into the diningroom and noiselessly opened the little doors of the sideboardah then in the cool recess within he would find bottles and a siphon a bottle of crystal gin and a quart of soda water and then for the cups that inebriate as well as cheer  a minute later he was walking briskly up the shady yewtree walk within the house it was deliciously quiet and cool carrying his wellfilled tumbler with care he went into the library there the glass on the corner of the table beside him he settled into a chair with a volume of saintebeuve there was nothing he found like a causerie du lundi for settling and soothing the troubled spirits that tenuous membrane of his had been too rudely buffeted by the afternoons emotions it required a rest    chapter xxviii  towards sunset the fair itself became quiescent it was the hour for the dancing to begin at one side of the village of tents a space had been roped off acetylene lamps hung round it on posts cast a piercing white light in one corner sat the band and obedient to its scraping and blowing two or three hundred dancers trampled across the dry ground wearing away the grass with their booted feet round this patch of all but daylight alive with motion and noise the night seemed preternaturally dark bars of light reached out into it and every now and then a lonely figure or a couple of lovers interlaced would cross the bright shaft flashing for a moment into visible existence to disappear again as quickly and surprisingly as they had come  denis stood by the entrance of the enclosure watching the swaying shuffling crowd the slow vortex brought the couples round and round again before him as though he were passing them in review there was priscilla still wearing her queenly toque still encouraging the villagersthis time by dancing with one of the tenant farmers there was lord moleyn who had stayed on to the disorganised passoverish meal that took the place of dinner on this festal day he onestepped shamblingly his bent knees more precariously wobbly than ever with a terrified village beauty mr scogan trotted round with another mary was in the embrace of a young farmer of heroic proportions she was looking up at him talking as denis could see very seriously what about he wondered the malthusian league perhaps seated in the corner among the band jenny was performing wonders of virtuosity upon the drums her eyes shone she smiled to herself a whole subterranean life seemed to be expressing itself in those loud rattats those long rolls and flourishes of drumming looking at her denis ruefully remembered the red notebook he wondered what sort of a figure he was cutting now but the sight of anne and gombauld swimming pastanne with her eyes almost shut and sleeping as it were on the sustaining wings of movement and musicdissipated these preoccupations male and female created he themthere they were anne and gombauld and a hundred couples moreall stepping harmoniously together to the old tune of male and female created he them but denis sat apart he alone lacked his complementary opposite they were all coupled but he all but he  somebody touched him on the shoulder and he looked up it was henry wimbush  i never showed you our oaken drainpipes he said some of the ones we dug up are lying quite close to here would you like to come and see them  denis got up and they walked off together into the darkness the music grew fainter behind them some of the higher notes faded out altogether jennys drumming and the steady sawing of the bass throbbed on tuneless and meaningless in their ears henry wimbush halted  here we are he said and taking an electric torch out of his pocket he cast a dim beam over two or three blackened sections of tree trunk scooped out into the semblance of pipes which were lying forlornly in a little depression in the ground  very interesting said denis with a rather tepid enthusiasm  they sat down on the grass a faint white glare rising from behind a belt of trees indicated the position of the dancingfloor the music was nothing but a muffled rhythmic pulse  i shall be glad said henry wimbush when this function comes at last to an end  i can believe it  i do not know how it is mr wimbush continued but the spectacle of numbers of my fellowcreatures in a state of agitation moves in me a certain weariness rather than any gaiety or excitement the fact is they dont very much interest me theyre arent in my line you follow me i could never take much interest for example in a collection of postage stamps primitives or seventeenthcentury booksyes they are my line but stamps no i dont know anything about them theyre not my line they dont interest me they give me no emotion its rather the same with people im afraid im more at home with these pipes he jerked his head sideways towards the hollowed logs the trouble with the people and events of the present is that you never know anything about them what do i know of contemporary politics nothing what do i know of the people i see round about me nothing what they think of me or of anything else in the world what they will do in five minutes time are things i cant guess at for all i know you may suddenly jump up and try to murder me in a moments time  come come said denis  true mr wimbush continued the little i know about your past is certainly reassuring but i know nothing of your present and neither you nor i know anything of your future its appalling in living people one is dealing with unknown and unknowable quantities one can only hope to find out anything about them by a long series of the most disagreeable and boring human contacts involving a terrible expense of time its the same with current events how can i find out anything about them except by devoting years to the most exhausting firsthand study involving once more an endless number of the most unpleasant contacts no give me the past it doesnt change its all there in black and white and you can get to know about it comfortably and decorously and above all privatelyby reading by reading i know a great deal of caesar borgia of st francis of dr johnson a few weeks have made me thoroughly acquainted with these interesting characters and i have been spared the tedious and revolting process of getting to know them by personal contact which i should have to do if they were living now how gay and delightful life would be if one could get rid of all the human contacts perhaps in the future when machines have attained to a state of perfectionfor i confess that i am like godwin and shelley a believer in perfectibility the perfectibility of machinerythen perhaps it will be possible for those who like myself desire it to live in a dignified seclusion surrounded by the delicate attentions of silent and graceful machines and entirely secure from any human intrusion it is a beautiful thought  beautiful denis agreed but what about the desirable human contacts like love and friendship  the black silhouette against the darkness shook its head the pleasures even of these contacts are much exaggerated said the polite level voice it seems to me doubtful whether they are equal to the pleasures of private reading and contemplation human contacts have been so highly valued in the past only because reading was not a common accomplishment and because books were scarce and difficult to reproduce the world you must remember is only just becoming literate as reading becomes more and more habitual and widespread an everincreasing number of people will discover that books will give them all the pleasures of social life and none of its intolerable tedium at present people in search of pleasure naturally tend to congregate in large herds and to make a noise in future their natural tendency will be to seek solitude and quiet the proper study of mankind is books  i sometimes think that it may be said denis he was wondering if anne and gombauld were still dancing together  instead of which said mr wimbush with a sigh i must go and see if all is well on the dancingfloor they got up and began to walk slowly towards the white glare if all these people were dead henry wimbush went on this festivity would be extremely agreeable nothing would be pleasanter than to read in a wellwritten book of an openair ball that took place a century ago how charming one would say how pretty and how amusing but when the ball takes place today when one finds oneself involved in it then one sees the thing in its true light it turns out to be merely this he waved his hand in the direction of the acetylene flares in my youth he went on after a pause i found myself quite fortuitously involved in a series of the most phantasmagorical amorous intrigues a novelist could have made his fortune out of them and even if i were to tell you in my bald style the details of these adventures you would be amazed at the romantic tale but i assure you while they were happeningthese romantic adventuresthey seemed to me no more and no less exciting than any other incident of actual life to climb by night up a ropeladder to a secondfloor window in an old house in toledo seemed to me while i was actually performing this rather dangerous feat an action as obvious as much to be taken for granted ashow shall i put itas quotidian as catching the 852 from surbiton to go to business on a monday morning adventures and romance only take on their adventurous and romantic qualities at secondhand live them and they are just a slice of life like the rest in literature they become as charming as this dismal ball would be if we were celebrating its tercentenary they had come to the entrance of the enclosure and stood there blinking in the dazzling light ah if only we were henry wimbush added  anne and gombauld were still dancing together    chapter xxix  it was after ten oclock the dancers had already dispersed and the last lights were being put out tomorrow the tents would be struck the dismantled merrygoround would be packed into waggons and carted away an expanse of worn grass a shabby brown patch in the wide green of the park would be all that remained crome fair was over  by the edge of the pool two figures lingered  no no no anne was saying in a breathless whisper leaning backwards turning her head from side to side in an effort to escape gombaulds kisses no please no her raised voice had become imperative  gombauld relaxed his embrace a little why not he said i will  with a sudden effort anne freed herself you wont she retorted youve tried to take the most unfair advantage of me  unfair advantage echoed gombauld in genuine surprise  yes unfair advantage you attack me after ive been dancing for two hours while im still reeling drunk with the movement when ive lost my head when ive got no mind left but only a rhythmical body its as bad as making love to someone youve drugged or intoxicated  gombauld laughed angrily call me a white slaver and have done with it  luckily said anne i am now completely sobered and if you try and kiss me again i shall box your ears shall we take a few turns round the pool she added the night is delicious  for answer gombauld made an irritated noise they paced off slowly side by side  what i like about the painting of degas anne began in her most detached and conversational tone  oh damn degas gombauld was almost shouting  from where he stood leaning in an attitude of despair against the parapet of the terrace denis had seen them the two pale figures in a patch of moonlight far down by the pools edge he had seen the beginning of what promised to be an endless passionate embracement and at the sight he had fled it was too much he couldnt stand it in another moment he felt he would have burst into irrepressible tears  dashing blindly into the house he almost ran into mr scogan who was walking up and down the hall smoking a final pipe  hullo said mr scogan catching him by the arm dazed and hardly conscious of what he was doing or where he was denis stood there for a moment like a somnambulist whats the matter mr scogan went on you look disturbed distressed depressed  denis shook his head without replying  worried about the cosmos eh mr scogan patted him on the arm i know the feeling he said its a most distressing symptom whats the point of it all all is vanity whats the good of continuing to function if ones doomed to be snuffed out at last along with everything else yes yes i know exactly how you feel its most distressing if one allows oneself to be distressed but then why allow oneself to be distressed after all we all know that theres no ultimate point but what difference does that make  at this point the somnambulist suddenly woke up what he said blinking and frowning at his interlocutor what then breaking away he dashed up the stairs two steps at a time  mr scogan ran to the foot of the stairs and called up after him it makes no difference none whatever life is gay all the same always under whatever circumstancesunder whatever circumstances he added raising his voice to a shout but denis was already far out of hearing and even if he had not been his mind tonight was proof against all the consolations of philosophy mr scogan replaced his pipe between his teeth and resumed his meditative pacing under any circumstances he repeated to himself it was ungrammatical to begin with was it true and is life really its own reward he wondered when his pipe had burned itself to its stinking conclusion he took a drink of gin and went to bed in ten minutes he was deeply innocently asleep  denis had mechanically undressed and clad in those flowered silk pyjamas of which he was so justly proud was lying face downwards on his bed time passed when at last he looked up the candle which he had left alight at his bedside had burned down almost to the socket he looked at his watch it was nearly halfpast one his head ached his dry sleepless eyes felt as though they had been bruised from behind and the blood was beating within his ears a loud arterial drum he got up opened the door tiptoed noiselessly along the passage and began to mount the stairs towards the higher floors arrived at the servants quarters under the roof he hesitated then turning to the right he opened a little door at the end of the corridor within was a pitchdark cupboardlike boxroom hot stuffy and smelling of dust and old leather he advanced cautiously into the blackness groping with his hands it was from this den that the ladder went up to the leads of the western tower he found the ladder and set his feet on the rungs noiselessly he lifted the trapdoor above his head the moonlit sky was over him he breathed the fresh cool air of the night in a moment he was standing on the leads gazing out over the dim colourless landscape looking perpendicularly down at the terrace seventy feet below  why had he climbed up to this high desolate place was it to look at the moon was it to commit suicide as yet he hardly knew deaththe tears came into his eyes when he thought of it his misery assumed a certain solemnity he was lifted up on the wings of a kind of exaltation it was a mood in which he might have done almost anything however foolish he advanced towards the farther parapet the drop was sheer there and uninterrupted a good leap and perhaps one might clear the narrow terrace and so crash down yet another thirty feet to the sunbaked ground below he paused at the corner of the tower looking now down into the shadowy gulf below now up towards the rare stars and the waning moon he made a gesture with his hand muttered something he could not afterwards remember what but the fact that he had said it aloud gave the utterance a peculiarly terrible significance then he looked down once more into the depths  what are you doing denis questioned a voice from somewhere very close behind him  denis uttered a cry of frightened surprise and very nearly went over the parapet in good earnest his heart was beating terribly and he was pale when recovering himself he turned round in the direction from which the voice had come  are you ill  in the profound shadow that slept under the eastern parapet of the tower he saw something he had not previously noticedan oblong shape it was a mattress and someone was lying on it since that first memorable night on the tower mary had slept out every evening it was a sort of manifestation of fidelity  it gave me a fright she went on to wake up and see you waving your arms and gibbering there what on earth were you doing  denis laughed melodramatically what indeed he said if she hadnt woken up as she did he would be lying in pieces at the bottom of the tower he was certain of that now  you hadnt got designs on me i hope mary inquired jumping too rapidly to conclusions  i didnt know you were here said denis laughing more bitterly and artificially than before  what is the matter denis  he sat down on the edge of the mattress and for all reply went on laughing in the same frightful and improbable tone  an hour later he was reposing with his head on marys knees and she with an affectionate solicitude that was wholly maternal was running her fingers through his tangled hair he had told her everything everything his hopeless love his jealousy his despair his suicideas it were providentially averted by her interposition he had solemnly promised never to think of selfdestruction again and now his soul was floating in a sad serenity it was embalmed in the sympathy that mary so generously poured and it was not only in receiving sympathy that denis found serenity and even a kind of happiness it was also in giving it for if he had told mary everything about his miseries mary reacting to these confidences had told him in return everything or very nearly everything about her own  poor mary he was very sorry for her still she might have guessed that ivor wasnt precisely a monument of constancy  well she concluded one must put a good face on it she wanted to cry but she wouldnt allow herself to be weak there was a silence  do you think asked denis hesitatinglydo you really think that shethat gombauld  im sure of it mary answered decisively there was another long pause  i dont know what to do about it he said at last utterly dejected  youd better go away advised mary its the safest thing and the most sensible  but ive arranged to stay here three weeks more  you must concoct an excuse  i suppose youre right  i know i am said mary who was recovering all her firm selfpossession you cant go on like this can you  no i cant go on like this he echoed  immensely practical mary invented a plan of action startlingly in the darkness the church clock struck three  you must go to bed at once she said id no idea it was so late  denis clambered down the ladder cautiously descended the creaking stairs his room was dark the candle had long ago guttered to extinction he got into bed and fell asleep almost at once    chapter xxx  denis had been called but in spite of the parted curtains he had dropped off again into that drowsy dozy state when sleep becomes a sensual pleasure almost consciously savoured in this condition he might have remained for another hour if he had not been disturbed by a violent rapping at the door  come in he mumbled without opening his eyes the latch clicked a hand seized him by the shoulder and he was rudely shaken  get up get up  his eyelids blinked painfully apart and he saw mary standing over him brightfaced and earnest  get up she repeated you must go and send the telegram dont you remember  o lord he threw off the bedclothes his tormentor retired  denis dressed as quickly as he could and ran up the road to the village post office satisfaction glowed within him as he returned he had sent a long telegram which would in a few hours evoke an answer ordering him back to town at onceon urgent business it was an act performed a decisive step takenand he so rarely took decisive steps he felt pleased with himself it was with a whetted appetite that he came in to breakfast  goodmorning said mr scogan i hope youre better  better  you were rather worried about the cosmos last night  denis tried to laugh away the impeachment was i he lightly asked  i wish said mr scogan that i had nothing worse to prey on my mind i should be a happy man  one is only happy in action denis enunciated thinking of the telegram  he looked out of the window great florid baroque clouds floated high in the blue heaven a wind stirred among the trees and their shaken foliage twinkled and glittered like metal in the sun everything seemed marvellously beautiful at the thought that he would soon be leaving all this beauty he felt a momentary pang but he comforted himself by recollecting how decisively he was acting  action he repeated aloud and going over to the sideboard he helped himself to an agreeable mixture of bacon and fish  breakfast over denis repaired to the terrace and sitting there raised the enormous bulwark of the times against the possible assaults of mr scogan who showed an unappeased desire to go on talking about the universe secure behind the crackling pages he meditated in the light of this brilliant morning the emotions of last night seemed somehow rather remote and what if he had seen them embracing in the moonlight perhaps it didnt mean much after all and even if it did why shouldnt he stay he felt strong enough to stay strong enough to be aloof disinterested a mere friendly acquaintance and even if he werent strong enough  what time do you think the telegram will arrive asked mary suddenly thrusting in upon him over the top of the paper  denis started guiltily i dont know at all he said  i was only wondering said mary because theres a very good train at 327 and it would be nice if you could catch it wouldnt it  awfully nice he agreed weakly he felt as though he were making arrangements for his own funeral train leaves waterloo 327 no flowersmary was gone no he was blowed if hed let himself be hurried down to the necropolis like this he was blowed the sight of mr scogan looking out with a hungry expression from the drawingroom window made him precipitately hoist the times once more for a long while he kept it hoisted lowering it at last to take another cautious peep at his surroundings he found himself with what astonishment confronted by annes faint amused malicious smile she was standing before himthe woman who was a treethe swaying grace of her movement arrested in a pose that seemed itself a movement  how long have you been standing there he asked when he had done gaping at her  oh about half an hour i suppose she said airily you were so very deep in your paperhead over earsi didnt like to disturb you  you look lovely this morning denis exclaimed it was the first time he had ever had the courage to utter a personal remark of the kind  anne held up her hand as though to ward off a blow dont bludgeon me please she sat down on the bench beside him he was a nice boy she thought quite charming and gombaulds violent insistences were really becoming rather tiresome why dont you wear white trousers she asked i like you so much in white trousers  theyre at the wash denis replied rather curtly this whitetrouser business was all in the wrong spirit he was just preparing a scheme to manoeuvre the conversation back to the proper path when mr scogan suddenly darted out of the house crossed the terrace with clockwork rapidity and came to a halt in front of the bench on which they were seated  to go on with our interesting conversation about the cosmos he began i become more and more convinced that the various parts of the concern are fundamentally discretebut would you mind denis moving a shade to your right he wedged himself between them on the bench and if you would shift a few inches to the left my dear annethank you discrete i think was what i was saying  you were said anne denis was speechless  they were taking their after luncheon coffee in the library when the telegram arrived denis blushed guiltily as he took the orange envelope from the salver and tore it open return at once urgent family business it was too ridiculous as if he had any family business wouldnt it be best just to crumple the thing up and put it in his pocket without saying anything about it he looked up marys large blue china eyes were fixed upon him seriously penetratingly he blushed more deeply than ever hesitated in a horrible uncertainty  whats your telegram about mary asked significantly  he lost his head im afraid he mumbled im afraid this means i shall have to go back to town at once he frowned at the telegram ferociously  but thats absurd impossible cried anne she had been standing by the window talking to gombauld but at deniss words she came swaying across the room towards him  its urgent he repeated desperately  but youve only been here such a short time anne protested  i know he said utterly miserable oh if only she could understand women were supposed to have intuition  if he must go he must put in mary firmly  yes i must he looked at the telegram again for inspiration you see its urgent family business he explained  priscilla got up from her chair in some excitement i had a distinct presentiment of this last night she said a distinct presentiment  a mere coincidence no doubt said mary brushing mrs wimbush out of the conversation theres a very good train at 327 she looked at the clock on the mantelpiece youll have nice time to pack  ill order the motor at once henry wimbush rang the bell the funeral was well under way it was awful awful  i am wretched you should be going said anne  denis turned towards her she really did look wretched he abandoned himself hopelessly fatalistically to his destiny this was what came of action of doing something decisive if only hed just let things drift if only  i shall miss your conversation said mr scogan  mary looked at the clock again i think perhaps you ought to go and pack she said  obediently denis left the room never again he said to himself never again would he do anything decisive camlet west bowlby knipswich for timpany spavin delawarr and then all the other stations and then finally london the thought of the journey appalled him and what on earth was he going to do in london when he got there he climbed wearily up the stairs it was time for him to lay himself in his coffin  the car was at the doorthe hearse the whole party had assembled to see him go goodbye goodbye mechanically he tapped the barometer that hung in the porch the needle stirred perceptibly to the left a sudden smile lighted up his lugubrious face  it sinks and i am ready to depart he said quoting landor with an exquisite aptness he looked quickly round from face to face nobody had noticed he climbed into the hearse
