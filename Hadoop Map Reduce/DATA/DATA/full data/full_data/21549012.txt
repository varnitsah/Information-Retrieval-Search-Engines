21549012	love among the chickens   by  p g wodehouse     dedication  to w townend  dear bill  i have never been much of a lad for the                                to                but for whose sympathy and encouragement                              this book                    would never have been written  type of dedication it sounds so weakminded but in the case of love among the chickens it is unavoidable it was not so much that you sympathised and encouragedwhere you really came out strong was that you gave me the stuff i like people who sympathise with me i am grateful to those who encourage me but the man to whom i raise the wodehouse hatowing to the increased cost of living the same old brown one i had last yearit is being complained of on all sides but the public must bear it like men till the straw hat season comes roundi say the man to whom i raise this venerable relic is the man who gives me the material  sixteen years ago my william when we were young and spritely lads when you were a tricky centreforward and i a fast bowler when your head was covered with hair and my list of hobbies in whos who included boxing i received from you one morning about thirty closelywritten foolscap pages giving me the details of your friend s adventures on his devonshire chicken farm round these i wove as funny a plot as i could but the book stands or falls by the stuff you gave me about ukridgethe things that actually happened  you will notice that i have practically rewritten the book there was some pretty bad work in it and it had dated as an instance of the way in which the march of modern civilisation has left the 1906 edition behind i may mention that on page twentyone i was able to make ukridge speak of selling eggs at six for fivepence                                                     yours ever                                                       p g wodehouse  london 1920     contents         i  a letter with a postscript       ii  mr and mrs

 a gentleman called to see you when you were out last night sir said mrs medley my landlady removing the last of the breakfast things  yes i said in my affable way  a gentleman said mrs medley meditatively with a very powerful voice  caruso  sir  i said did he leave a name  yes sir mr ukridge  oh my sainted aunt  sir  nothing nothing  thank you sir said mrs medley withdrawing from the presence  ukridge oh hang it i had not met him for years and glad as i am as a general thing to see the friends of my youth when they drop in for a chat i doubted whether i was quite equal to ukridge at the moment a stout fellow in both the physical and moral sense of the words he was a trifle too jumpy for a man of my cloistered and intellectual life especially as just now i was trying to plan out a new novel a tricky job demanding complete quiet and seclusion it had always been my experience that when ukridge was around things began to happen swiftly and violently rendering meditation impossible ukridge was the sort of man who asks you out to dinner borrows the money from you to pay the bill and winds up the evening by embroiling you in a fight with a cabman i have gone to covent garden balls with ukridge and found myself legging it down henrietta street in the grey dawn pursued by infuriated costermongers  i wondered how he had got my address and on that problem light was immediately cast by mrs medley who returned bearing an envelope  it came by the morning post sir but it was left at number twenty by mistake  oh thank you  thank you sir said mrs medley  i recognised the handwriting the letter which bore a devonshire postmark was from an artist friend of mine one lickford who was at present on a sketching tour in the west i had seen him off at waterloo a week before and i remember that i had walked away from the station wishing that i could summon up the energy to pack and get off to the country somewhere i hate london in july  the letter was a long one but it was the postscript which interested me most    by the way at yeovil i ran into an old friend of ours stanley featherstonehaugh ukridge of all people as large as lifequite six foot two and tremendously filled out i thought he was abroad the last i heard of him was that he had started for buenos ayres in a cattle ship with a borrowed pipe by way of luggage it seems he has been in england for some time i met him in the refreshmentroom at yeovil station i was waiting for a down train he had changed on his way to town as i opened the door i heard a huge voice entreating the lady behind the bar to put it in a pewter and there was s f u in a villainous old suit of grey flannels ill swear it was the one he had on last time i saw him with pincenez tacked on to his ears with gingerbeer wire as usual and a couple of inches of bare neck showing between the bottom of his collar and the top of his coatyou remember how he could never get a stud to do its work he also wore a mackintosh though it was a blazing day  he greeted me with effusive shouts wouldnt hear of my standing the racket insisted on being host when we had finished he fumbled in his pockets looked pained and surprised and drew me aside look here licky old horse he said you know i never borrow money its against my principles but i must have a couple of bob can you my dear good fellow oblige me with a couple of bob till next tuesday ill tell you what ill do in a voice full of emotion ill let you have this producing a beastly little threepenny bit with a hole in it which he had probably picked up in the street until i can pay you back this is of more value to me than i can well express licky my boy a very very dear friend gave it to me when we parted years ago its a wrench stillno no you must take it you must take it licky old man shake hands old horse shake hands my boy he then tottered to the bar deeply moved and paid up out of the five shillings which he had made it as an afterthought he asked after you and said you were one of the noblest men on earth i gave him your address not being able to get out of it but if i were you i should fly while there is yet time   it seemed to me that the advice was good and should be followed i needed a change of air london may have suited doctor johnson but in the summer time it is not for the ordinary man what i wanted to enable me to give the public of my best as the reviewer of a weekly paper dealing with my last work had expressed a polite hope that i would continue to do was a little haven in the country somewhere  i rang the bell  sir said mrs medley  im going away for a bit i said  yes sir  i dont know where ill send you the address so that you can forward letters  yes sir  and if mr ukridge calls again  at this point a thunderous knocking on the front door interrupted me something seemed to tell me who was at the end of that knocker i heard mrs medleys footsteps pass along the hall there was the click of the latch a volume of sound rushed up the stairs  is mr garnet in where is he show me the old horse where is the man of wrath exhibit the son of belial  there followed a violent crashing on the stairs shaking the house  garnet where are you laddie garnet garnet  stanley featherstonehaugh ukridge was in my midst    chapter ii  mr and mrs s f ukridge  i have often thought that whos who though a bulky and wellmeaning volume omits too many of englands greatest men it is not comprehensive enough i am in it nestling among the gs  garnet jeremy os of late henry garnet vicar of much middlefold salop author publications the outsider the manoeuvres of arthur hobbies cricket football swimming golf clubs arts  but if you search among the us for ukridge stanley featherstonehaugh details of whose tempestuous career would make really interesting reading you find no mention of him it seems unfair though i imagine ukridge bears it with fortitude that muchenduring man has had a lifetimes training in bearing things with fortitude  he seemed in his customary jovial spirits now as he dashed into the room clinging on to the pincenez which even gingerbeer wire rarely kept stable for two minutes together  my dear old man he shouted springing at me and seizing my hand in the grip like the bite of a horse how are you old buck this is good by jove this is fine what  he dashed to the door and looked out  come on millie pick up the waukeesis heres old garnet looking just the same as ever devilish handsome fellow youll be glad you came when you see him beats the zoo hollow  there appeared round the corner of ukridge a young woman she paused in the doorway and smiled pleasantly  garny old horse said ukridge with some pride this is her the pride of the home companion of joys and sorrows and all the rest of it in fact in a burst of confidence my wife  i bowed awkwardly the idea of ukridge married was something too overpowering to be readily assimilated  buck up old horse said ukridge encouragingly he had a painful habit of addressing all and sundry by that title in his schoolmaster daysat one period of his vivid career he and i had been colleagues on the staff of a private schoolhe had made use of it interviewing the parents of new pupils and the latter had gone away as a rule with a feeling that this must be either the easy manner of genius or due to alcohol and hoping for the best he also used it to perfect strangers in the streets and on one occasion had been heard to address a bishop by that title rendering that dignitary as mr baboo jaberjee would put it sotto voce with gratification surprised to find me married what garny old boysinking his voice to a whisper almost inaudible on the other side of the streettake my tip go and jump off the dock yourself youll feel another man give up this bachelor business its a mugs game i look on you bachelors as excrescences on the social system i regard you old man purely and simply as a wart go and get married laddie go and get married by gad ive forgotten to pay the cabby lend me a couple of bob garny old chap  he was out of the door and on his way downstairs before the echoes of his last remark had ceased to shake the window i was left to entertain mrs ukridge  so far her share in the conversation had been confined to the pleasant smile which was apparently her chief form of expression nobody talked very much when ukridge was present she sat on the edge of the armchair looking very small and quiet i was conscious of feeling a benevolent pity for her if i had been a girl i would have preferred to marry a volcano a little of ukridge as his former head master had once said in a moody reflective voice went a very long way you and stanley have known each other a long time havent you said the object of my commiseration breaking the silence  yes oh yes several years we were masters at the same school  mrs ukridge leaned forward with round shining eyes  really oh how nice she said ecstatically  not yet to judge from her expression and the tone of her voice had she found any disadvantages attached to the arduous position of being mrs stanley ukridge  hes a wonderfully versatile man i said  i believe he could do anything  hed have a jolly good try  have you ever kept fowls asked mrs ukridge with apparent irrelevance  i had not she looked disappointed  i was hoping you might have had some experience stanley of course can turn his hand to anything but i think experience is rather a good thing dont you  yes but   i have bought a shilling book called fowls and all about them and this weeks copy of cac  cac  chiefly about chickens its a paper you know but its all rather hard to understand you see we  but here is stanley he will explain the whole thing  well garny old horse said ukridge reentering the room after another energetic passage of the stairs years since i saw you still buzzing along  still so to speak buzzing i assented  i was reading your last book the other day  yes i said gratified how did you like it  well as a matter of fact laddie i didnt get beyond the third page because the scurvy knave at the bookstall said he wasnt running a free library and in one way and another there was a certain amount of unpleasantness still it seemed bright and interesting up to page three but lets settle down and talk business ive got a scheme for you garny old man yessir the idea of a thousand years now listen to me for a moment let me get a word in edgeways  he sat down on the table and dragged up a chair as a legrest then he took off his pincenez wiped them readjusted the gingerbeer wire behind his ears and having hit a brown patch on the knee of his grey flannel trousers several times in the apparent hope of removing it resumed  about fowls  the subject was beginning to interest me it showed a curious tendency to creep into the conversation of the ukridge family  i want you to give me your undivided attention for a moment i was saying to my wife as we came here garnets the man clever devil garnet full of ideas didnt i millie  yes dear  laddie said ukridge impressively we are going to keep fowls  he shifted himself farther on to the table and upset the inkpot  never mind he said itll soak in its good for the texture or am i thinking of tobaccoash on the carpet well never mind listen to me when i said that we were going to keep fowls i didnt mean in a small piffling sort of waytwo cocks and a couple of hens and a golfball for a nestegg we are going to do it on a large scale we are going to run a chicken farm  a chicken farm echoed mrs ukridge with an affectionate and admiring glance at her husband  ah i said feeling my responsibilities as chorus a chicken farm  ive thought it all over laddie and its as clear as mud no expenses large profits quick returns chickens eggs and the money streaming in faster than you can bank it winter and summer underclothing my bonny boy lined with crackling bradburys its the idea of a lifetime now listen to me for a moment you get your hen  one hen  call it one for the sake of argument it makes my calculations clearer very well then harriet the henyou get her do you follow me so far  yes you get a hen  i told you garnet was a dashed bright fellow said ukridge approvingly to his attentive wife notice the way he keeps right after ones ideas like a bloodhound well where was i  youd just got a hen  exactly the hen pricilla the pullet well it lays an egg every day of the week you sell the eggs six for half a crown keep of hen costs nothing profitat least a couple of bob on every dozen eggs what do you think of that  i think id like to overhaul the figures in case of error  error shouted ukridge pounding the table till it groaned error not a bit of it cant you follow a simple calculation like that oh i forgot to say that you getand here is the nub of the thingyou get your first hen on tick anybody will be glad to let you have the hen on tick well then you let this henthis first original hen this ontickhenyou let it set and hatch chickens now follow me closely suppose you have a dozen hens very well then when each of the dozen has a dozen chickens you send the old hens back to the chappies you borrowed them from with thanks for kind loan and there you are starting business with a hundred and fortyfour free chickens to your name and after a bit when the chickens grow up and begin to lay all you have to do is to sit back in your chair and endorse the big cheques isnt that so millie  yes dear  weve fixed it all up do you know combe regis in dorsetshire on the borders of devon bathing seaair splendid scenery just the place for a chicken farm a friend of milliesgirl she knew at schoolhas lent us a topping old house with large grounds all weve got to do is to get in the fowls ive ordered the first lot we shall find them waiting for us when we arrive  well i said im sure i wish you luck mind you let me know how you get on  let you know roared ukridge why my dear old horse youre coming with us  am i i said blankly  certainly you are we shall take no refusal will we millie  no dear  of course not no refusal of any sort pack up tonight and meet us at waterloo tomorrow  its awfully good of you   not a bit of itnot a bit of it this is pure business i was saying to millie as we came along that you were the very man for us a man with your flow of ideas will be invaluable on a chicken farm absolutely invaluable you see proceeded ukridge im one of those practical fellows the hardheaded type i go straight ahead following my nose what you want in a business of this sort is a touch of the dreamer to help out the practical mind we look to you for suggestions laddie flashes of inspiration and all that sort of thing of course you take your share of the profits thats understood yes yes i must insist strict business between friends now taking it that at a conservative estimate the net profits for the first fiscal year amount tofive thousand no better be on the safe sidesay four thousand five hundred pounds  but well arrange all that end of it when we get down there millie will look after that shes the secretary of the concern shes been writing letters to people asking for hens so you see its a thoroughly organised business how many henletters did you write last week old girl  ten dear  ukridge turned triumphantly to me  you hear ten ten letters asking for hens thats the way to succeed push and enterprise  six of them havent answered stanley dear and the rest refused  immaterial said ukridge with a grand gesture that doesnt matter the point is that the letters were written it shows we are solid and practical well now can you get your things ready by tomorrow garny old horse  strange how one reaches an epochmaking moment in ones life without recognising it if i had refused that invitation i would not haveat any rate i would have missed a remarkable experience it is not given to everyone to see stanley featherstonehaugh ukridge manage a chicken farm  i was thinking of going somewhere where i could get some golf i said undecidedly  combe regis is just the place for you then perfect hotbed of golf full of the finest players cant throw a brick without hitting an amateur champion grand links at the top of the hill not half a mile from the farm bring your clubs youll be able to play in the afternoons get through serious work by lunch time  you know i said i am absolutely inexperienced as regards fowls i just know enough to help myself to bread sauce when i see one but no more  excellent youre just the man you will bring to the work a mind unclouded by theories you will act solely by the light of your intelligence and youve got lots of that that novel of yours showed the most extraordinary intelligenceat least as far as that blighter at the bookstall would let me read i wouldnt have a professional chicken farmer about the place if he paid to come if he applied to me i should simply send him away natural intelligence is what we want then we can rely on you  very well i said slowly its very kind of you to ask me  business laddie pure business very well then we shall catch the eleventwenty at waterloo dont miss it look out for me on the platform if i see you first ill shout    chapter iii  waterloo station some fellowtravellers and a girl with brown hair  the austerity of waterloo station was lightened on the following morning at ten minutes to eleven when i arrived to catch the train to combe regis by several gleams of sunshine and a great deal of bustle and activity on the various platforms a porter took my suitcase and golfclubs and arranged an assignation on number 6 platform i bought my ticket and made my way to the bookstall where in the interests of trade i inquired in a loud and penetrating voice if they had got jeremy garnets manoeuvres of arthur being informed that they had not i clicked my tongue reproachfully advised them to order in a supply as the demand was likely to be large and spent a couple of shillings on a magazine and some weekly papers then with ten minutes to spare i went off in search of ukridge  i found him on platform six the eleventwenty was already alongside and presently i observed my porter cleaving a path towards me with the suitcase and golfbag  here you are shouted ukridge vigorously good for you thought you were going to miss it  i shook hands with the smiling mrs ukridge  ive got a carriage and collared two corner seats millie goes down in another she doesnt like the smell of smoke when shes travelling hope we get the carriage to ourselves devil of a lot of people here this morning still the more people there are in the world the more eggs we shall sell i can see with half an eye that all these blighters are confirmed eggeaters get in sonnie ill just see the missis into her carriage and come back to you  i entered the compartment and stood at the door looking out in the faint hope of thwarting an invasion of fellowtravellers then i withdrew my head suddenly and sat down an elderly gentleman accompanied by a pretty girl was coming towards me it was not this type of fellow traveller whom i had hoped to keep out i had noticed the girl at the booking office she had waited by the side of the queue while the elderly gentleman struggled gamely for the tickets and i had had plenty of opportunity of observing her appearance i had debated with myself whether her hair should rightly be described as brown or golden i had finally decided on brown once only had i met her eyes and then only for an instant they might be blue they might be grey i could not be certain life is full of these problems  this seems to be tolerably empty my dear phyllis said the elderly gentleman coming to the door of the compartment and looking in youre sure you dont object to a smokingcarriage  oh no father not a bit  then i think  said the elderly gentleman getting in  the inflection of his voice suggested the irishman it was not a brogue there were no strange words but the general effect was irish  thats good he said settling himself and pulling out a cigar case  the bustle of the platform had increased momentarily until now when from the snorting of the engine it seemed likely that the train might start at any minute the crowds excitement was extreme shrill cries echoed down the platform lost sheep singly and in companies rushed to and fro peering eagerly into carriages in search of seats piercing voices ordered unknown tommies and ernies to keep by aunty now just as ukridge returned that sauve qui peut of the railway crowd the dreaded get in anywhere began to be heard and the next moment an avalanche of warm humanity poured into the carriage  the newcomers consisted of a middleaged lady addressed as aunty very stout and clad in a grey alpaca dress skintight a youth called albert not it was to appear a sunny child a niece of some twenty years stolid and seemingly without interest in life and one or two other campfollowers and retainers  ukridge slipped into his corner adroitly foiling albert who had made a dive in that direction albert regarded him fixedly and reproachfully for a space then sank into the seat beside me and began to chew something that smelt of aniseed  aunty meanwhile was distributing her substantial weight evenly between the feet of the irish gentleman and those of his daughter as she leaned out of the window to converse with a lady friend in a straw hat and hair curlers accompanied by three dirty and frivolous boys it was she stated lucky that she had caught the train i could not agree with her the girl with the brown hair and the eyes that were neither blue or grey was bearing the infliction i noticed with angelic calm she even smiled this was when the train suddenly moved off with a jerk and aunty staggering back sat down on the bag of food which albert had placed on the seat beside him  clumsy observed albert tersely  albert you mustnt speak to aunty so  wodyer want to sit on my bag for then said albert disagreeably  they argued the point argument in no wise interfered with alberts power of mastication the odour of aniseed became more and more painful ukridge had lighted a cigar and i understood why mrs ukridge preferred to travel in another compartment for    in his hand he bore the brand    which none but he might smoke  i looked across the carriage stealthily to see how the girl was enduring this combination of evils and noticed that she had begun to read and as she put the book down to look out of the window i saw with a thrill that trickled like warm water down my spine that her book was the manoeuvres of arthur i gasped that a girl should look as pretty as that and at the same time have the rare intelligence to read me  well it seemed an almost superhuman combination of the excellencies and more devoutly than ever i cursed in my heart these intrusive outsiders who had charged in at the last moment and destroyed for ever my chance of making this wonderful girls acquaintance but for them we might have become intimate in the first half hour as it was what were we ships that pass in the night she would get out at some beastly wayside station and vanish from my life without my ever having even spoken to her  aunty meanwhile having retired badly worsted from her encounter with albert who showed a skill in logomachy that marked him out as a future labour member was consoling herself with meat sandwiches the niece was demolishing sausage rolls the atmosphere of the carriage was charged with a blend of odours topping all ukridges cigar now in full blast  the train raced on towards the sea it was a warm day and a torpid peace began to settle down upon the carriage ukridge had thrown away the stump of his cigar and was now leaning back with his mouth open and his eyes shut aunty still clutching a muchbitten section of a beef sandwich was breathing heavily and swaying from side to side albert and the niece were dozing alberts jaws working automatically even in sleep  whats your book my dear asked the irishman  the manoeuvres of arthur father by jeremy garnet  i would not have believed without the evidence of my ears that my name could possibly have sounded so musical  molly mceachern gave it to me when i left the abbey she keeps a shelf of books for her guests when they are going away books that she considers rubbish and doesnt want you know  i hated miss mceachern without further evidence  and what do you think of it  i like it said the girl decidedly the carriage swam before my eyes i think it is very clever  what did it matter after that that the ass in charge of the waterloo bookstall had never heard of the manoeuvres of arthur and that my publishers whenever i slunk in to ask how it was selling looked at me with a sort of grave paternal pity and said that it had not really begun to move anybody can write one of those rotten popular novels which appeal to the unthinking public but it takes a man of intellect and refinement and taste and all that sort of thing to turn out something that will be approved of by a girl like this  i wonder who jeremy garnet is she said ive never heard of him before i imagine him rather an old young man probably with an eyeglass and conceited and i should think he didnt know many girls at least if he thinks pamela an ordinary sort of girl shes a crreature said phyllis emphatically  this was a blow to me i had always looked on pamela as a welldrawn character and a very attractive kittenish little thing at that that scene between her and the curate in the conservatory  and when she talks to arthur at the meet of the blankshires  i was sorry she did not like pamela somehow it lowered pamela in my estimation  but i like arthur said the girl  this was better a good chap arthura very complete and thoughtful study of myself if she liked arthur why then it followed  but what was the use i should never get a chance of speaking to her we were divided by a great gulf of aunties and alberts and meat sandwiches  the train was beginning to slow down signs of returning animation began to be noticeable among the sleepers auntys eyes opened stared vacantly round closed and reopened the niece woke and started instantly to attack a sausage roll albert and ukridge slumbered on  a whistle from the engine and the train drew up at a station looking out i saw that it was yeovil there was a general exodus aunty became instantly a thing of dash and electricity collected parcels shook albert replied to his thrusts with repartee and finally heading a stampede out of the door  the irishman and his daughter also rose and got out i watched them leave stoically it would have been too much to expect that they should be going any further  where are we said ukridge sleepily yeovil not far now i tell you what it is old horse i could do with a drink  with that remark he closed his eyes again and returned to his slumbers and as he did so my eye roving discontentedly over the carriage was caught by something lying in the far corner it was the manoeuvres of arthur the girl had left it behind  i suppose what follows shows the vanity that obsesses young authors it did not even present itself to me as a tenable theory that the book might have been left behind on purpose as being of no further use to the owner it only occurred to me that if i did not act swiftly the poor girl would suffer a loss beside which the loss of a purse or vanitycase were trivial  five seconds later i was on the platform  excuse me i said i think  oh thank you so much said the girl  i made my way back to the carriage and lit my pipe in a glow of emotion  they are blue i said to my immortal soul a wonderful deep soft heavenly blue like the sea at noonday    chapter iv  the arrival  from axminster to combe regis the line runs through country as attractive as any that can be found in the island and the train as if in appreciation of this fact does not hurry over the journey it was late afternoon by the time we reached our destination  the arrangements for the carrying of luggage at combe regis border on the primitive boxes are left on the platform and later when he thinks of it a carrier looks in and conveys them into the valley and up the hill on the opposite side to the address written on the labels the owner walks combe regis is not a place for the halt and maimed  ukridge led us in the direction of the farm which lay across the valley looking through woods to the sea the place was visible from the station from which indeed standing as it did on the top of a hill the view was extensive  halfway up the slope on the other side of the valley we left the road and made our way across a spongy field ukridge explaining that this was a short cut we climbed through a hedge crossed a stream and another field and after negotiating a difficult bank topped with barbed wire found ourselves in a garden  ukridge mopped his forehead and restored his pincenez to their original position from which the passage of the barbed wire had dislodged them  this is the place he said weve come in by the back way saves time tired millie  a little dear i should like some tea  same here i agreed  thatll be all right said ukridge a most competent man of the name of beale and his wife are in charge at present i wrote to them telling them that we were coming today they will be ready for us thats the way to do things garny old horse quiet efficiency perfect organisation  we were at the front door by this time ukridge rang the bell the noise echoed through the house but there was no answering footsteps he rang again there is no mistaking the note of a bell in an empty house it was plain that the competent man and his wife were out  now what i said  mrs ukridge looked at her husband with calm confidence  this said ukridge leaning against the door and endeavouring to button his collar at the back reminds me of an afternoon in the argentine two other cheery sportsmen and myself tried for threequarters of an hour to get into an empty house where there looked as if there might be something to drink and wed just got the door open when the owner turned up from behind a tree with a shotgun it was a little difficult to explain as a matter of fact we never did what you might call really thresh the matter out thoroughly in all its aspects and youd be surprised what a devil of a time it takes to pick buckshot out of a fellow there was a dog too  he broke off musing dreamily on the happy past and at this moment history partially repeated itself from the other side of the door came a dissatisfied whine followed by a short bark  hullo said ukridge beale has a dog he frowned annoyed what right he added in an aggrieved tone has a beastly mongrel belonging to a man i employ to keep me out of my own house its a little hard here am i slaving day and night to support beale and when i try to get into my own house his infernal dog barks at me upon my sam its hard he brooded for a moment on the injustice of things here let me get to the keyhole ill reason with the brute  he put his mouth to the keyhole and roared goo dog through it instantly the door shook as some heavy object hurled itself against it the barking rang through the house  come round to the back said ukridge giving up the idea of conciliation well get in through the kitchen window  the kitchen window proved to be insecurely latched ukridge threw it open and we climbed in the dog hearing the noise raced back along the passage and flung himself at the door scratching at the panels ukridge listened with growing indignation  millie you know how to light a fire garnet and i will be collecting cups and things when that scoundrel beale arrives i shall tear him limb from limb deserting us like this the man must be a thorough fraud he told me he was an old soldier if thats the sort of discipline they used to keep in his regiment thank god weve got a navy damn ive broken a plate hows the fire getting on millie ill chop beale into little bits whats that youve got there garny old horse tea good wheres the bread there goes another plate wheres mrs beale too by jove that woman wants killing as much as her blackguard of a husband whoever heard of a cook deliberately leaving her post on the day when her master and mistress were expected back the abandoned woman look here ill give that dog three minutes and if it doesnt stop scratching that door by then ill take a rolling pin and go out and have a hearttoheart talk with it its a little hard my own house and the first thing i find when i arrive is somebody elses beastly dog scratching holes in the doors and ruining the expensive paint stop it you brute  the dogs reply was to continue his operations with immense vigour  ukridges eyes gleamed behind their glasses  give me a good large jug laddie he said with ominous calm  he took the largest of the jugs from the dresser and strode with it into the scullery whence came a sound of running water he returned carrying the jug with both hands his mien that of a general who sees his way to a masterstroke of strategy  garny old horse he said freeze onto the handle of the door and when i give the word fling wide the gates then watch that animal get the surprise of a lifetime  i attached myself to the handle as directed ukridge gave the word we had a momentary vision of an excited dog of the mongrel class framed in the open doorway all eyes and teeth then the passage was occupied by a spreading pool and indignant barks from the distance told that the enemy was thinking the thing over in some safe retreat  settled his hash said ukridge complacently nothing like resource garny my boy some men would have gone on letting a good door be ruined  and spoiled the dog for a haporth of water i said  at this moment mrs ukridge announced that the kettle was boiling over a cup of tea ukridge became the man of business  i wonder when those fowls are going to arrive they should have been here today its a little hard here am i all eagerness and anxiety waiting to start an uptodate chicken farm and no fowls i cant run a chicken farm without fowls if they dont come tomorrow i shall get after those people with a hatchet there must be no slackness they must bustle about after tea ill show you the garden and well choose a place for a fowlrun tomorrow we must buckle to serious work will begin immediately after breakfast  suppose i said the fowls arrive before were ready for them  why then they must wait  but you cant keep fowls cooped up indefinitely in a crate  oh thatll be all right theres a basement to this house well let em run about there till were ready for them theres always a way of doing things if you look for it organisation my boy thats the watchword quiet efficiency  i hope you are going to let the hens hatch some of the eggs dear said mrs ukridge i should love to have some little chickens  of course by all means my idea said ukridge was this these people will send us fifty fowls of sorts that meanscall it fortyfive eggs a day let em  well im hanged theres that dog again wheres the jug  but this time an unforeseen interruption prevented the manoeuvre being the success it had been before i had turned the handle and was about to pull the door open while ukridge looking like some modern and dilapidated version of the discobolus stood beside me with his jug poised when a voice spoke from the window  stand still said the voice or ill corpse you  i dropped the handle ukridge dropped the jug mrs ukridge dropped her teacup at the window with a doublebarrelled gun in his hands stood a short square redheaded man the muzzle of his gun which rested on the sill was pointing in a straight line at the third button of my waistcoat  ukridge emitted a roar like that of a hungry lion  beale you scoundrelly unprincipled demon what the devil are you doing with that gun why were you out what have you been doing why did you shout like that look what youve made me do  he pointed to the floor the very old pair of tennis shoes which he wore were by this time generously soaked with the spilled water  lor mr ukridge sir is that you said the redheaded man calmly i thought you was burglars  a short bark from the other side of the kitchen door followed by a renewal of the scratching drew mr beales attention to his faithful hound  thats bob he said  i dont know what you call the brute said ukridge come in and tie him up and mind what youre doing with that gun after youve finished with the dog i should like a brief chat with you laddie if you can spare the time and have no other engagements  mr beale having carefully deposited the gun against the wall and dropped a pair of very limp rabbits on the floor proceeded to climb in through the window this operation concluded he stood to one side while the besieged garrison passed out by the same route  you will find me in the garden said ukridge coldly ive one or two little things to say to you  mr beale grinned affably he seemed to be a man of equable temperament  the cool air of the garden was grateful after the warmth of the kitchen it was a pretty garden or would have been if it had not been so neglected i seemed to see myself sitting in a deckchair on the lawn smoking and looking through the trees at the harbour below it was a spot i felt in which it would be an easy and a pleasant task to shape the plot of my novel i was glad i had come about now outside my lodgings in town a particularly foul barrelorgan would be settling down to work  oh there you are beale said ukridge as the servitor appeared now then what have you to say  the hired man looked thoughtful for a moment then said that it was a fine evening  fine evening shouted ukridge what on earth has that got to do with it i want to know why you and mrs beale were out when we arrived  the missus went to axminster mr ukridge sir  she had no right to go to axminster it isnt part of her duties to go gadding about to axminster i dont pay her enormous sums to go to axminster you knew i was coming this evening  no sir  what  no sir  beale said ukridge with studied calm the strong man repressing himself one of us two is a fool  yes sir  let us sift this matter to the bottom you got my letter  no sir  my letter saying that i should arrive today you didnt get it  no sir  now look here beale this is absurd i am certain that that letter was posted i remember placing it in my pocket for that purpose it is not there now see these are all the contents of mywell im hanged  he stood looking at the envelope which he had produced from his breastpocket a soft smile played over mr beales wooden face he coughed  beale said ukridge youerthere seems to have been a mistake  yes sir  you are not so much to blame as i thought  no sir  there was a silence  anyhow said ukridge in inspired tones ill go and slay that infernal dog ill teach him to tear my door to pieces wheres your gun beale  but better counsels prevailed and the proceedings closed with a cold but pleasant little dinner at which the spared mongrel came out unexpectedly strong with ingenious and diverting tricks    chapter v  buckling to  sunshine streaming into my bedroom through the open window woke me next day as distant clocks were striking eight it was a lovely morning cool and fresh the grass of the lawn wet with dew sparkled in the sun a thrush who knew all about early birds and their perquisites was filling in the time before the arrival of the worm with a song or two as he sat in the bushes in the ivy a colony of sparrows were opening the day with brisk scuffling on the gravel in front of the house lay the mongrel bob blinking lazily  the gleam of the sea through the trees turned my thoughts to bathing i dressed quickly and went out bob rose to meet me waving an absurdly long tail the hatchet was definitely buried now that little matter of the jug of water was forgotten  a walk of five minutes down the hill brought me accompanied by bob to the sleepy little town i passed through the narrow street and turned on to the beach walking in the direction of the combination of pier and breakwater which loomed up through the faint mist  the tide was high and leaving my clothes to the care of bob who treated them as a handy bed i dived into twelve feet of clear cold water as i swam i compared it with the morning tub of london and felt that i had done well to come with ukridge to this pleasant spot not that i could rely on unbroken calm during the whole of my visit i knew nothing of chickenfarming but i was certain that ukridge knew less there would be some strenuous moments before that farm became a profitable commercial speculation at the thought of ukridge toiling on a hot afternoon to manage an undisciplined mob of fowls i laughed and swallowed a generous mouthful of salt water and turning swam back to bob and my clothes  on my return i found ukridge in his shirt sleeves and minus a collar assailing a large ham mrs ukridge looking younger and more childlike than ever in brown holland smiled at me over the teapot  hullo old horse bellowed ukridge where have you been bathing hope its made you feel fit for work because weve got to buckle to this morning  the fowls have arrived mr garnet said mrs ukridge opening her eyes till she looked like an astonished kitten such a lot of them theyre making such a noise  to support her statement there floated in through the window a cackling which for volume and variety beat anything i had ever heard judging from the noise it seemed as if england had been drained of fowls and the entire tribe of them dumped into the yard of ukridges farm  there seems to have been no stint i said  quite a goodish few arent there said ukridge complacently but thats what we want no good starting on a small scale the more you have the bigger the profits  what sorts have you got mostly i asked showing a professional interest  oh all sorts my theory laddie is this it doesnt matter a bit what kind we get because theyll all lay and if we sell settings of eggs which we will well merely say its an unfortunate accident if they turn out mixed when hatched bless you people dont mind what breed a fowl is so long as its got two legs and a beak these dealer chaps were so infernally particular any dorkings they said all right i said bring on your dorkings or perhaps you will require a few minorcas very well i said unleash the minorcas they were going ontheyd have gone on for hoursbut i stopped em look here my dear old college chum i said kindly but firmly to the manager johnnydecent old buck with the manners of a marquesslook here i said life is short and were neither of us as young as we used to be dont let us waste the golden hours playing guessing games i want fowls you sell fowls so give me some of all sorts mix em up laddie i said mix em up and he has by jove you go into the yard and look at em beale has turned them out of their crates there must be one of every breed ever invented  where are you going to put them  that spot we chose by the paddock thats the place plenty of mud for them to scratch about in and they can go into the field when they feel like it and pick up worms or whatever they feed on we must rig them up some sort of shanty i suppose this morning well go and tell em to send up some wirenetting and stuff from the town  then we shall want hencoops we shall have to make those  of course so we shall millie didnt i tell you that old garnet was the man to think of things i forgot the coops we cant buy some i suppose on tick of course  cheaper to make them suppose we get a lot of boxes sugar boxes are as good as any it wont take long to knock up a few coops  ukridge thumped the table with enthusiasm upsetting his cup  garny old horse youre a marvel you think of everything well buckle to right away and get the whole place fixed up the same as mother makes it what an infernal noise those birds are making i suppose they dont feel at home in the yard wait till they see the a1 compact residential mansions were going to put up for them finished breakfast then lets go out come along millie  the redheaded beale discovered leaning in an attitude of thought on the yard gate and observing the feathered mob below with much interest was roused from his reflections and despatched to the town for the wire and sugar boxes ukridge taking his place at the gate gazed at the fowls with the affectionate air of a proprietor  well they have certainly taken you at your word i said as far as variety is concerned  the man with the manners of a marquess seemed to have been at great pains to send a really representative selection of fowls there were blue ones black ones white grey yellow brown big little dorkings minorcas cochin chinas bantams wyandottes it was an imposing spectacle  the hired man returned towards the end of the morning preceded by a cart containing the necessary wire and boxes and ukridge whose enthusiasm brooked no delay started immediately the task of fashioning the coops while i assisted by beale draped the wirenetting about the chosen spot next to the paddock there were little unpleasantnessesonce a roar of anguish told that ukridges hammer had found the wrong billet and on another occasion my flannel trousers suffered on the wirebut the work proceeded steadily by the middle of the afternoon things were in a sufficiently advanced state to suggest to ukridge the advisability of a halt for refreshments  thats the way to do it he said beaming through misty pincenez over a long glass that is the stuff to administer to em at this rate we shall have the place in corking condition before bedtime quiet efficiencythats the wheeze what do you think of those for coops beale  the hired man examined them woodenly  ive seen worse sir  he continued his examination  but not many he added beales passion for the truth had made him unpopular in three regiments  they arent so bad i said but im glad im not a fowl  so you ought to be said ukridge considering the way youve put up that wire youll have them strangling themselves  in spite of earnest labour the housing arrangements of the fowls were still in an incomplete state at the end of the day the details of the evenings work are preserved in a letter which i wrote that night to my friend lickford    have you ever played a game called pigs in clover we have just finished a merry bout of it with hens instead of marbles which has lasted for an hour and a half we are all dead tired except the hired man who seems to be made of indiarubber he has just gone for a stroll on the beach wants some exercise i suppose personally i feel as if i should never move again you have no conception of the difficulty of rounding up fowls and getting them safely to bed having no proper place to put them we were obliged to stow some of them in the cube sugarboxes and the rest in the basement it has only just occurred to me that they ought to have had perches to roost on it didnt strike me before i shant mention it to ukridge or that indomitable man will start making some and drag me into it too after all a hen can rough it for one night and if i did a stroke more work i should collapse  my idea was to do the thing on the slow but sure principle that is to say take each bird singly and carry it to bed it would have taken some time but there would have been no confusion but you can imagine that that sort of thing would not appeal to stanley featherstonehaugh he likes his manoeuvres to be on a large dashing napoleonic scale he said open the yard gate and let the blighters come out into the open then sail in and drive them in mass formation through the back door into the basement it was a great idea but there was one fatal flaw in it it didnt allow for the hens scattering we opened the gate and out they all came like an audience coming out of a theatre then we closed in on them to bring off the big drive for about thirty seconds it looked as if we might do it then bob the hired mans dog an animal who likes to be in whatevers going on rushed out of the house into the middle of them barking there was a perfect stampede and heaven only knows where some of those fowls are now there was one in particular a large yellow bird which i should imagine is nearing london by this time the last i saw of it it was navigating at the rate of knots in that direction with bob after it barking his hardest the fowl was showing a rare turn of speed and gaining rapidly presently bob came back panting having evidently given the thing up we in the meantime were chasing the rest of the birds all over the garden the affair had now resolved itself into the course of action i had suggested originally except that instead of collecting them quietly and at our leisure we had to run miles for each one we captured after a time we introduced some sort of system into it mrs ukridge stood at the door we chased the hens and brought them in then as we put each through into the basement she shut the door on it we also arranged ukridges sugarbox coops in a row and when we caught a fowl we put it in the coop and stuck a board in front of it by these strenuous means we gathered in about twothirds of the lot the rest are all over england a few may be still in dorsetshire but i should not like to bet on it  so you see things are being managed on the uptodate chicken farm on good sound ukridge principles it is only the beginning i look with confidence for further interesting events i believe if ukridge kept white mice he would manage to get feverish excitement out of it he is at present lying on the sofa smoking one of his infernal brand of cigars drinking whisky and soda and complaining with some bitterness because the whisky isnt as good as some he once tasted in belfast from the basement i can hear faintly the murmur of innumerable fowls    chapter vi  mr garnets narrativehas to do with a reunion  the day was thursday the date july the twentysecond we had been chickenfarmers for a whole week and things were beginning to settle down to a certain extent the coops were finished they were not masterpieces and i have seen chickens pause before them in deep thought as who should say now what but they were coops within the meaning of the act and we induced hens to become tenants  the hardest work had been the fixing of the wirenetting this was the department of the hired man and myself ukridge holding himself proudly aloof while beale and i worked ourselves to a fever in the sun the senior partner of the firm sat on a deckchair in the shade offering not unkindly criticism and advice and from time to time abusing his creditors who were numerous for we had hardly been in residence a day before he began to order in a vast supply of necessary and unnecessary things all on credit some he got from the village others from neighbouring towns axminster he laid heavily under contribution he even went as far afield as dorchester he had a persuasive way with him and the tradesmen seemed to treat him like a favourite son the things began to pour in from all sidesgroceries whisky a piano a gramophone pictures also cigars in great profusion he was not one of those men who want but little here below  as regards the financial side of these transactions his method was simple and masterly if a tradesman suggested that a small cheque on account would not be taken amiss as one or two sordid fellows did he became pathetic  confound it sir he would say with tears in his voice laying a hand on the mans shoulders in a wounded way its a trifle hard when a gentleman comes to settle in your neighbourhood that you should dun him for money before he has got the preliminary expenses about the house off his back this sounded well and suggested the disbursement of huge sums for rent the fact that the house had been lent him rent free was kept with some care in the background having weakened the man with pathos he would strike a sterner note a little more of this he would go on and ill close my account why damme in all my experience ive never heard anything like it upon which the man would apologise and go away forgiven with a large order for more goods  by these statesmanlike methods he had certainly made the place very comfortable i suppose we all realised that the things would have to be paid for some day but the thought did not worry us  pay bellowed ukridge on the only occasion when i ventured to bring up the unpleasant topic of course we shall pay why not i dont like to see this fainthearted spirit in you old horse the money isnt coming in yet i admit but we must give it time soon we shall be turning over hundreds a week hundreds im in touch with all the big placeswhiteleys harrods all the nibs here i am i said to them with a large chicken farm with all the modern improvements you want eggs old horses i said i supply them i will let you have so many hundred eggs a week i said what will you give for them well ill admit their terms did not come up to my expectations altogether but we must not sneer at small prices at first  when we get a connection we shall be able to name our terms it stands to reason laddie have you ever seen a man woman or child who wasnt eating an egg or just going to eat an egg or just coming away from eating an egg i tell you the good old egg is the foundation of daily life stop the first man you meet in the street and ask him which hed sooner lose his egg or his wife and see what he says were on to a good thing garny my boy pass the whisky  the upshot of it was that the firms mentioned supplied us with a quantity of goods agreeing to receive phantom eggs in exchange this satisfied ukridge he had a faith in the laying power of his hens which would have flattered them if they could have known it it might also have stimulated their efforts in that direction which up to date were feeble  it was now as i have said thursday the twentysecond of julya glorious sunny morning of the kind which providence sends occasionally simply in order to allow the honest smoker to take his afterbreakfast pipe under ideal conditions these are the pipes to which a man looks back in after years with a feeling of wistful reverence pipes smoked in perfect tranquillity mind and body alike at rest it is over pipes like these that we dream our dreams and fashion our masterpieces  my pipe was behaving like the ideal pipe and as i strolled spaciously about the lawn my novel was growing nobly i had neglected my literary work for the past week owing to the insistent claims of the fowls i am not one of those men whose minds work in placid independence of the conditions of life but i was making up for lost time now with each blue cloud that left my lips and hung in the still air above me striking scenes and freshets of sparkling dialogue rushed through my brain another uninterrupted half hour and i have no doubt that i should have completed the framework of a novel which would have placed me in that select band of authors who have no christian names another half hour and posterity would have known me as garnet  but it was not to be  stop her catch her garny old horse  i had wandered into the paddock at the moment i looked up coming towards me at her best pace was a small hen i recognised her immediately it was the disagreeable sardoniclooking bird which ukridge on the strength of an alleged similarity of profile to his wifes nearest relative had christened aunt elizabeth a bolshevist hen always at the bottom of any disturbance in the fowlrun a bird which ate its head off daily at our expense and bit the hands which fed it by resolutely declining to lay a single egg behind this fowl ran bob doing as usual the thing that he ought not to have done bobs wrongheadedness in the matter of our hens was a constant source of inconvenience from the first he had seemed to regard the layingin of our stock purely in the nature of a tribute to his sporting tastes he had a fixed idea that he was a hunting dog and that recognising this we had very decently provided him with the material for the chase  behind bob came ukridge but a glance was enough to tell me that he was a negligible factor in the pursuit he was not built for speed already the pace had proved too much for him and he had appointed me his deputy with full powers to act  after her garny old horse valuable bird mustnt be lost  when not in a catalepsy of literary composition i am essentially the man of action i laid aside my novel for future reference and we passed out of the paddock in the following order first aunt elizabeth as fresh as paint going well next bob panting and obviously doubtful of his powers of staying the distance lastly myself determined but wishing i were five years younger  after the first field bob like the dilettante and unstable dog he was gave it up and sauntered off to scratch at a rabbithole with an insufferable air of suggesting that that was what he had come out for all the time i continued to pound along doggedly i was grimly resolute i had caught aunt elizabeths eye as she passed me and the contempt in it had cut me to the quick this bird despised me i am not a violent or a quicktempered man but i have my selfrespect i will not be sneered at by hens all the abstract desire for fame which had filled my mind five minutes before was concentrated now on the task of capturing this supercilious bird  we had been travelling down hill all this time but at this point we crossed a road and the ground began to rise i was in that painful condition which occurs when one has lost ones first wind and has not yet got ones second i was hotter than i had ever been in my life  whether aunt elizabeth too was beginning to feel the effects of her run or whether she did it out of the pure effrontery of her warped and unpleasant nature i do not know but she now slowed down to walk and even began to peck in a tentative manner at the grass her behaviour infuriated me i felt that i was being treated as a cipher i vowed that this bird should realise yet even if as seemed probable i burst in the process that it was no light matter to be pursued by j garnet author of the manoeuvres of arthur etc a man of whose work so capable a judge as the peebles advertiser had said shows promise  a judicious increase of pace brought me within a yard or two of my quarry but aunt elizabeth apparently distrait had the situation well in hand she darted from me with an amused chuckle and moved off rapidly again up the hill  i followed but there was that within me that told me i had shot my bolt the sun blazed down concentrating its rays on my back to the exclusion of the surrounding scenery it seemed to follow me about like a limelight  we had reached level ground aunt elizabeth had again slowed to a walk and i was capable of no better pace very gradually i closed in there was a high boxwood hedge in front of us and just as i came close enough once more to stake my all on a single grab aunt elizabeth with another of her sardonic chuckles dived in headforemost and struggled through in the mysterious way in which birds do get through hedges the sound of her faint spinsterlike snigger came to me as i stood panting and roused me like a bugle the next moment i too had plunged into the hedge  i was in the middle of it very hot tired and dirty when from the other side i heard a sudden shout of mark over bird to the right and the next moment i found myself emerging with a black face and tottering knees on the gravel path of a private garden beyond the path was a croquet lawn and on this lawn i perceived as through a glass darkly three figures the mist cleared from my eyes and i recognised two of them  one was the middleaged irishman who had travelled down with us in the train the other was his blueeyed daughter  the third member of the party was a man a stranger to me by some miracle of adroitness he had captured aunt elizabeth and was holding her in spite of her protests in a workmanlike manner behind the wings    chapter vii  the entente cordiale is sealed  there are moments and moments the present one belonged to the more painful variety  even to my exhausted mind it was plain that there was a need here for explanations an irishmans croquetlawn is his castle and strangers cannot plunge in through hedges without inviting comment  unfortunately speech was beyond me i could have emptied a waterbutt laid down and gone to sleep or melted ice with a touch of the finger but i could not speak the conversation was opened by the other man in whose restraining hand aunt elizabeth now lay outwardly resigned but inwardly as i who knew her haughty spirit could guess boiling with baffled resentment i could see her looking out of the corner of her eye trying to estimate the chances of getting in one good hard peck with her aquiline beak  come right in said the man pleasantly dont knock  i stood there gasping i was only too well aware that i presented a quaint appearance i had removed my hat before entering the hedge and my hair was full of twigs and other foreign substances my face was moist and grimy my mouth hung open my legs felt as if they had ceased to belong to me  i must apol  i began and ended the sentence with gulps  the elderly gentleman looked at me with what seemed to be indignant surprise his daughter appeared to my guilty conscience to be looking through me aunt elizabeth sneered the only friendly face was the mans he regarded me with a kindly smile as if i were some old friend who had dropped in unexpectedly  take a long breath he advised  i took several and felt better  i must apologise for this intrusion i said successfully unwarrantable would have rounded off the sentence neatly but i would not risk it it would have been mere bravado to attempt unnecessary words of five syllables i took in more breath the fact is i diddidnt know there was a private garden beyond the hedge if you will give me my hen   i stopped aunt elizabeth was looking away as if endeavouring to create an impression of having nothing to do with me i am told by one who knows that hens cannot raise their eyebrows not having any but i am prepared to swear that at this moment aunt elizabeth raised hers i will go further she sniffed  here you are said the man though its hard to say goodbye  he held out the hen to me and at this point a hitch occurred he did his part the letting go all right it was in my department the taking hold that the thing was bungled aunt elizabeth slipped from my grasp like an eel stood for a moment eyeing me satirically with her head on one side then fled and entrenched herself in some bushes at the end of the lawn  there are times when the most resolute man feels that he can battle no longer with fate when everything seems against him and the only course is a dignified retreat but there is one thing essential to a dignified retreat you must know the way out it was the lack of that knowledge that kept me standing there looking more foolish than anyone has ever looked since the world began i could not retire by way of the hedge if i could have leaped the hedge with a single debonair bound that would have been satisfactory but the hedge was high and i did not feel capable at the moment of achieving a debonair bound over a footstool  the man saved the situation he seemed to possess that magnetic power over his fellows which marks the born leader under his command we became an organised army the common object the pursuit of the elusive aunt elizabeth made us friends in the first minute of the proceedings the irishman was addressing me as me dear boy and the man who had introduced himself as mr chasea lieutenant i learned later in his majestys navywas shouting directions to me by name i have never assisted at any ceremony at which formality was so completely dispensed with the ice was not merely broken it was shivered into a million fragments  go in and drive her out garnet shouted mr chase in my direction if you can look out on the left phyllis  even in that disturbing moment i could not help noticing his use of the christian name it seemed to me more than sinister i did not like the idea of dashing young lieutenants in the senior service calling a girl phyllis whose eyes had haunted me since i had first seen them  nevertheless i crawled into the bushes and administered to aunt elizabeth a prod in the lower ribsif hens have lower ribs the more i study hens the more things they seem able to get along withoutwhich abruptly disturbed her calm detachment she shot out at the spot where mr chase was waiting with his coat off and was promptly enveloped in that garment and captured  the essence of strategy observed mr chase approvingly is surprise a neat piece of work  i thanked him he deprecated my thanks he had he said only done his duty as expected to by england he then introduced me to the elderly irishman who was it seemed a professor at dublin university by name derrick whatever it was that he professed it was something that did not keep him for a great deal of his time at the university he informed me that he always spent his summers at combe regis  i was surprised to see you at combe regis i said when you got out at yeovil i thought i had seen the last of you  i think i am gifted beyond other men as regards the unfortunate turning of sentences  i meant i added i was afraid i had  ah of course he said you were in our carriage coming down i was confident i had seen you before i never forget a face  it would be a kindness said mr chase if you would forget garnets as now exhibited you seem to have collected a good deal of the scenery coming through that hedge  i was wondering i said a washif i might  of course me boy of course said the professor tom take mr garnet off to your room and then well have lunch youll stay to lunch mr garnet  i thanked him commented on possible inconvenience to his arrangements was overruled and went off with my friend the lieutenant to the house we imprisoned aunt elizabeth in the stables to her profound indignation gave directions for lunch to be served to her and made our way to mr chases room  so youve met the professor before he said hospitably laying out a change of raiment for mewe were fortunately much of a height and build  i have never spoken to him i said we travelled down from london in the same carriage  hes a dear old boy if you rub him the right way butim telling you this for your good and guidance a man wants a chart in a strange seahe can cut up rough and when he does he goes off like a fourpointseven and the population for miles round climbs trees i think if i were you i shouldnt mention sir edward carson at lunch  i promised that i would try to avoid the temptation  in fact youd better keep off ireland altogether its the safest plan any other subject you like chatty remarks on bimetallism would meet with his earnest attention a lecture on what to do with the cold mutton would be welcomed but not ireland shall we do down  we got to know each other at lunch  do you hunt hens asked tom chase who was mixing the saladhe was one of those men who seemed to do everything a shade better than anyone elsefor amusement or by your doctors orders many doctors i believe insist on it  neither i said and especially not for amusement the fact is ive been lured down here by a friend of mine who has started a chicken farm  i was interrupted all three of them burst out laughing tom chase allowed the vinegar to trickle on to the cloth missing the saladbowl by a clear two inches  you dont mean to tell us he said that you really come from the one and only chicken farm why youre the man weve all been praying to meet for days past youre the talk of the town if you can call combe regis a town everybody is discussing you your methods are new and original arent they  probably ukridge knows nothing about fowls i know less he considers it an advantage he says our minds ought to be unbiassed  ukridge said the professor that was the name old dawlish the grocer said i never forget a name he is the gentleman who lectures on the management of poultry you do not  i hastened to disclaim any such feat i had never really approved of these infernal talks on the art of chickenfarming which ukridge had dropped into the habit of delivering when anybody visited our farm i admit that it was a pleasing spectacle to see my managing director in a pink shirt without a collar and very dirty flannel trousers lecturing the intelligent native but i had a feeling that the thing tended to expose our ignorance to men who had probably had to do with fowls from their cradle up  his lectures are very popular said phyllis derrick with a little splutter of mirth  he enjoys them i said  look here garnet said tom chase i hope you wont consider all these questions impertinent but youve no notion of the thrilling interest we all takeat a distancein your farm we have been talking of nothing else for a week i have dreamed of it three nights running is mr ukridge doing this as a commercial speculation or is he an eccentric millionaire  hes not a millionaire yet but i believe he intends to be one shortly with the assistance of the fowls but you mustnt look on me as in any way responsible for the arrangements at the farm i am merely a labourer the brainwork of the business lies in ukridges department as a matter of fact i came down here principally in search of golf  golf said professor derrick with the benevolent approval of the enthusiast towards a brother im glad you play golf we must have a round together  as soon as ever my professional duties will permit i said gratefully         there was croquet after luncha game of which i am a poor performer phyllis derrick and i played the professor and tom chase chase was a little better than myself the professor by dint of extreme earnestness and care managed to play a fair game and phyllis was an expert  i was reading a book she said as we stood together watching the professor shaping at his ball at the other end of the lawn by an author of the same surname as you mr garnet is he a relation of yours  my name is jeremy miss derrick  oh you wrote it she turned a little pink then you must haveoh nothing  i couldnt help it im afraid  did you know what i was going to say  i guessed you were going to say that i must have heard your criticisms in the train you were very lenient i thought  i didnt like your heroine  no what is a creature miss derrick  pamela in your book is a creature she replied unsatisfactorily  shortly after this the game came somehow to an end i do not understand the intricacies of croquet but phyllis did something brilliant and remarkable with the balls and we adjourned for tea the sun was setting as i left to return to the farm with aunt elizabeth stored neatly in a basket in my hand the air was deliciously cool and full of that strange quiet which follows soothingly on the skirts of a broiling midsummer afternoon far away seeming to come from another world a sheepbell tinkled deepening the silence alone in a sky of the palest blue there gleamed a small bright star  i addressed this star  she was certainly very nice to me very nice indeed the star said nothing  on the other hand i take it that having had a decent upbringing she would have been equally polite to any other man whom she had happened to meet at her fathers house moreover i dont feel altogether easy in my mind about that naval chap i fear the worst  the star winked  he calls her phyllis i said  charawk chuckled aunt elizabeth from her basket in that beastly cynical satirical way which has made her so disliked by all rightthinking people    chapter viii  a little dinner at ukridges  edwin comes today said mrs ukridge  and the derricks said ukridge sawing at the bread in his energetic way dont forget the derricks millie  no dear mrs beale is going to give us a very nice dinner we talked it over yesterday  who is edwin i asked  we were finishing breakfast on the second morning after my visit to the derricks i had related my adventures to the staff of the farm on my return laying stress on the merits of our neighbours and their interest in our doings and the hired retainer had been sent off next morning with a note from mrs ukridge inviting them to look over the farm and stay to dinner  edwin said ukridge oh beast of a cat  oh stanley said mrs ukridge plaintively hes not hes such a dear mr garnet a beautiful purebred persian he has taken prizes  hes always taking something thats why he didnt come down with us  a great horrid beast of a dog bit him mr garnet and poor edwin had to go to a cats hospital  and i hope said ukridge the experience will do him good sneaked a dogs dinner garnet under his very nose if you please naturally the dog lodged a protest  im so afraid that he will be frightened of bob he will be very timid and bobs so boisterous isnt he mr garnet  thats all right said ukridge bob wont hurt him unless he tries to steal his dinner in that case we will have edwin made into a rug  stanley doesnt like edwin said mrs ukridge sadly  edwin arrived early in the afternoon and was shut into the kitchen he struck me as a handsome cat but nervous  the derricks followed two hours later mr chase was not of the party  tom had to go to london explained the professor or he would have been delighted to come it was a disappointment to the boy for he wanted to see the farm  he must come some other time said ukridge we invite inspection look here he broke off suddenlywe were nearing the fowlrun now mrs ukridge walking in front with phyllis derrickwere you ever at bristol  never sir said the professor  because i knew just such another fat little buffer there a few years ago gay old bird he was he  this is the fowlrun professor i broke in with a moist tingling feeling across my forehead and up my spine i saw the professor stiffen as he walked while his face deepened in colour ukridges breezy way of expressing himself is apt to electrify the stranger  you will notice the able wayha hain which the wirenetting is arranged i continued feverishly took some doing that by jove yes it was hot work nice lot of fowls arent they rather a mixed lot of course ha ha thats the dealers fault though we are getting quite a number of eggs now hens wouldnt lay at first couldnt make them  i babbled on till from the corner of my eye i saw the flush fade from the professors face and his back gradually relax its pokerlike attitude the situation was saved for the moment but there was no knowing what further excesses ukridge might indulge in i managed to draw him aside as we went through the fowlrun and expostulated  for goodness sake be careful i whispered youve no notion how touchy he is  but i said nothing he replied amazed  hang it you know nobody likes to be called a fat little buffer to his face  what my dear old man nobody minds a little thing like that we cant be stilted and formal its ever so much more friendly to relax and be chummy  here we rejoined the others and i was left with a leaden foreboding of gruesome things in store i knew what manner of man ukridge was when he relaxed and became chummy friendships of years standing had failed to survive the test  for the time being however all went well in his role of lecturer he offended no one and phyllis and her father behaved admirably they received his strangest theories without a twitch of the mouth  ah the professor would say now is that really so very interesting indeed  only once when ukridge was describing some more than usually original device for the furthering of the interests of his fowls did a slight spasm disturb phylliss look of attentive reverence  and you have really had no previous experience in chickenfarming she said  none said ukridge beaming through his glasses not an atom but i can turn my hand to anything you know things seem to come naturally to me somehow  i see said phyllis  it was while matters were progressing with this beautiful smoothness that i observed the square form of the hired retainer approaching us somehowi cannot say whyi had a feeling that he came with bad news perhaps it was his air of quiet satisfaction which struck me as ominous  beg pardon mr ukridge sir  ukridge was in the middle of a very eloquent excursus on the feeding of fowls a subject on which he held views of his own as ingenious as they were novel the interruption annoyed him  well beale he said what is it  that there cat sir what came today  oh beale cried mrs ukridge in agitation what has happened  having something to say to the missis  what has happened oh beale dont say that edwin has been hurt where is he oh poor edwin  having something to say to the missis  if bob has bitten him i hope he had his nose well scratched said mrs ukridge vindictively  having something to say to the missis resumed the hired retainer tranquilly i went into the kitchen ten minutes back the cat was sitting on the mat  beales narrative style closely resembled that of a certain book i had read in my infancy i wish i could remember its title it was a wellwritten book  yes beale yes said mrs ukridge oh do go on  hullo puss i says to him and ow are you sir be careful says the missis es that timid she says you wouldnt believe she says es only just settled down as you may say she says ho dont you fret i says to her im and me understands each other im and me i says is old friends es my dear old pal corporal banks she grinned at that maam corporal banks being a man wed ad many a earty laugh at in the old days e was in a manner of speaking a joke between us  oh dogoon beale what has happened to edwin  the hired retainer proceeded in calm even tones  we was talking there maam when bob what had followed me unknown trotted in when the cat ketched sight of im sniffing about there was such a spitting and swearing as you never eard and blowed said mr beale amusedly blowed if the old cat didnt give one jump and move in quick time up the chimney where e now remains paying no eed to the missis attempts to get him down again  sensation as they say in the reports  but hell be cooked cried phyllis openeyed  no he wont nor will our dinner mrs beale always lets the kitchen fire out during the afternoon and how shes going to light it with that  there was a pause while one might count three it was plain that the speaker was struggling with himself  that cat he concluded safely up the chimney its a cold dinner well get tonight if that cat doesnt come down  the professors face fell i had remarked on the occasion when i had lunched with him his evident fondness for the pleasures of the table cold impromptu dinners were plainly not to his taste  we went to the kitchen in a body mrs beale was standing in front of the empty grate making seductive catnoises up the chimney  whats all this mrs beale said ukridge  he wont come down sir not while he thinks bobs about and how im to cook dinner for five with him up the chimney i dont see sir  prod at him with a broom handle mrs beale said ukridge  oh dont hurt poor edwin said mrs ukridge  i ave tried that sir but i cant reach him and im only bin and drove im further up what must be added mrs beale philosophically must be he may come down of his own accord in the night bein ungry  then what we must do said ukridge in a jovial manner which to me at least seemed out of place is to have a regular jolly picnicdinner what whack up whatever we have in the larder and eat that  a regular jolly picnicdinner repeated the professor gloomily i could read what was passing in his mindremorse for having come at all and a faint hope that it might not be too late to back out of it  that will be splendid said phyllis  er i think my dear sir said her father it would be hardly fair for us to give any further trouble to mrs ukridge and yourself if you will allow me therefore i will  ukridge became gushingly hospitable he refused to think of allowing his guests to go empty away he would be able to whack up something he said there was quite a good deal of the ham left he was sure he appealed to me to endorse his view that there was a tin of sardines and part of a cold fowl and plenty of bread and cheese  and after all he said speaking for the whole company in the generous comprehensive way enthusiasts have what more do we want in weather like this a nice light cold dinner is ever so much better for us than a lot of hot things  we strolled out again into the garden but somehow things seemed to drag conversation was fitful except on the part of ukridge who continued to talk easily on all subjects unconscious of the fact that the party was depressed and at least one of his guests rapidly becoming irritable i watched the professor furtively as ukridge talked on and that ominous phrase of mr chases concerning fourpointseven guns kept coming into my mind if ukridge were to tread on any of his pet corns as he might at any minute there would be an explosion the snatching of the dinner from his very mouth as it were and the substitution of a breadandcheese and sardines menu had brought him to the frame of mind when men turn and rend their nearest and dearest  the sight of the table when at length we filed into the dining room sent a chill through me it was a meal for the very young or the very hungry the uncompromising coldness and solidity of the viands was enough to appall a man conscious that his digestion needed humouring a huge cheese faced us in almost a swashbuckling way i do not know how else to describe it it wore a blatant rakish nemomeimpunelacessit air and i noticed that the professor shivered slightly as he saw it sardines looking more oily and uninviting than anything i had ever seen appeared in their native tin beyond the loaf of bread there was a ham in its third quarter and a chicken which had suffered heavily during a previous visit to the table finally a black bottle of whisky stood grimly beside ukridges plate the professor looked the sort of man who drank claret of a special year or nothing  we got through the meal somehow and did our best to delude ourselves into the idea that it was all great fun but it was a shallow pretence the professor was very silent by the time we had finished ukridge had been terrible the professor had forced himself to be genial he had tried to talk he had told stories and when he began onehis stories would have been the better for a little more briskness and condensationukridge almost invariably interrupted him before he had got half way through without a word of apology and started on some anecdote of his own he furthermore disagreed with nearly every opinion the professor expressed it is true that he did it all in such a perfectly friendly way and was obviously so innocent of any intention of giving offence that another manor the same man at a better mealmight have overlooked the matter but the professor robbed of his good dinner was at the stage when he had to attack somebody every moment i had been expecting the storm to burst  it burst after dinner  we were strolling in the garden when some demon urged ukridge apropos of the professors mention of dublin to start upon the irish question i had been expecting it momentarily but my heart seemed to stand still when it actually arrived  ukridge probably knew less about the irish question than any male adult in the kingdom but he had boomed forth some very positive opinions of his own on the subject before i could get near enough to him to whisper a warning when i did i suppose i must have whispered louder than i had intended for the professor heard me and my words acted as the match to the powder  hes touchy about ireland is he he thundered drop it is it and why why sir im one of the best tempered men that ever came from dublin let me tell you and i will not stay here to be insulted by the insinuation that i cannot discuss ireland as calmly as any one in this company or out of it touchy about ireland is it touchy  but professor  take your hand off my arm mr garnet i will not be treated like a child i am as competent to discuss the affairs of ireland without heat as any man let me tell you  father  and let me tell you mr ukridge that i consider your opinions poisonous poisonous sir and you know nothing whatever about the subject sir every word you say betrays your profound ignorance i dont wish to see you or to speak to you again understand that sir our acquaintance began today and it will cease today goodnight to you sir come phyllis me dear mrs ukridge goodnight    chapter ix  dies irae  why is it i wonder that stories of retribution calling at the wrong address strike us as funny instead of pathetic i myself had been amused by them many a time in a book which i had read only a few days before our colddinner party a shopwoman annoyed with an omnibus conductor had thrown a superannuated orange at him it had found its billet not on him but on a perfectly inoffensive spectator the missile said the writer it a young copper full in the hyeball i had enjoyed this when i read it but now that fate had arranged a precisely similar situation with myself in the role of the young copper the fun of the thing appealed to me not at all  it was ukridge who was to blame for the professors regrettable explosion and departure and he ought by all laws of justice to have suffered for it as it was i was the only person materially affected it did not matter to ukridge he did not care twopence one way or the other if the professor were friendly he was willing to talk to him by the hour on any subject pleasant or unpleasant if on the other hand he wished to have nothing more to do with us it did not worry him he was content to let him go ukridge was a selfsufficing person  but to me it was a serious matter more than serious if i have done my work as historian with an adequate degree of skill the reader should have gathered by this time the state of my feelings    i did not love as others do      none ever did that ive heard tell of    my passion was a byword through      the town she was of course the belle of  at least it wasfortunatelynot quite that but it was certainly genuine and most disturbing and it grew with the days somebody with a taste for juggling with figures might write a very readable page or so of statistics in connection with the growth of love in some cases it is i believe slow in my own i can only say that jacks beanstalk was a backward plant in comparison it is true that we had not seen a great deal of one another and that when we had met our interview had been brief and our conversation conventional but it is the intervals between the meeting that do the real damage absencei do not claim the thought as my ownmakes the heart grow fonder and now thanks to ukridges amazing idiocy a barrier had been thrust between us lord knows the business of fishing for a girls heart is sufficiently difficult and delicate without the addition of needless obstacles to cut out the naval miscreant under equal conditions would have been a task ample enough for my modest needs it was terrible to have to reestablish myself in the good graces of the professor before i could so much as begin to dream of phyllis ukridge gave me no balm  well after all he said when i pointed out to him quietly but plainly my opinion of his tactlessness what does it matter old derrick isnt the only person in the world if he doesnt want to know us laddie we just jolly well pull ourselves together and stagger along without him its quite possible to be happy without knowing old derrick millions of people are going about the world at this moment singing like larks out of pure lightheartedness who dont even know of his existence and as a matter of fact old horse we havent time to waste making friends and being the social pets too much to do on the farm strict business is the watchword my boy we must be the keen tense men of affairs or before we know where we are we shall find ourselves right in the gumbo  ive noticed garny old horse that you havent been the whale for work lately that you might be you must buckle to laddie there must be no slackness we are at a critical stage on our work now depends the success of the speculation look at those damned cocks theyre always fighting heave a stone at them laddie while youre up whats the matter with you you seem pipped cant get the novel off your chest or what you take my tip and give your brain a rest nothing like manual labour for clearing the brain all the doctors say so those coops ought to be painted today or tomorrow mind you i think old derrick would be all right if one persevered  and didnt call him a fat little buffer and contradict everything he said and spoil all his stories by breaking in with chestnuts of your own in the middle i interrupted with bitterness  my dear old son he didnt mind being called a fat little buffer you keep harping on that its no discredit to a man to be a fat little buffer some of the noblest men i have met have been fat little buffers what was the matter with old derrick was a touch of liver i said to myself when i saw him eating cheese that fellows going to have a nasty shooting pain sooner or later i say laddie just heave another rock or two at those cocks will you theyll slay each other  i had hoped fearing the while that there was not much chance of such a thing happening that the professor might get over his feeling of injury during the night and be as friendly as ever next day but he was evidently a man who had no objection whatever to letting the sun go down upon his wrath for when i met him on the following morning on the beach he cut me in the most uncompromising manner  phyllis was with him at the time and also another girl who was i supposed from the strong likeness between them her sister she had the same mass of soft brown hair but to me she appeared almost commonplace in comparison  it is never pleasant to be cut dead even when you have done something to deserve it it is like treading on nothing where one imagined a stair to be in the present instance the pang was mitigated to a certain extentnot largelyby the fact that phyllis looked at me she did not move her head and i could not have declared positively that she moved her eyes but nevertheless she certainly looked at me it was something she seemed to say that duty compelled her to follow her fathers lead and that the act must not be taken as evidence of any personal animus  that at least was how i read off the message  two days later i met mr chase in the village  hullo so youre back i said  youve discovered my secret he admitted will you have a cigar or a cocoanut  there was a pause  trouble i hear while i was away he said  i nodded  the man i live with ukridge did what you warned me against touched on the irish question  home rule  he mentioned it among other things  and the professor went off  like a bomb  he would so now you have parted brass rags its a pity  i agreed i am glad to say that i suppressed the desire to ask him to use his influence if any with mr derrick to effect a reconciliation i felt that i must play the game to request ones rival to give one assistance in the struggle to the end that he may be the more readily cut out can hardly be considered cricket  i ought not to be speaking to you you know said mr chase youre under arrest  hes still i stopped for a word  very much so ill do what i can  its very good of you  but the time is not yet ripe he may be said at present to be simmering down  i see thanks goodbye  so long  and mr chase walked on with long strides to the cob  the days passed slowly i saw nothing more of phyllis or her sister the professor i met once or twice on the links i had taken earnestly to golf in this time of stress golf is the game of disappointed lovers on the other hand it does not follow that because a man is a failure as a lover he will be any good at all on the links my game was distinctly poor at first but a round or two put me back into my proper form which is fair  the professors demeanour at these accidental meetings on the links was a faithful reproduction of his attitude on the beach only by a studied imitation of the absolute stranger did he show that he had observed my presence  once or twice after dinner when ukridge was smoking one of his special cigars while mrs ukridge nursed edwin now moving in society once more and in his right mind i lit my pipe and walked out across the fields through the cool summer night till i came to the hedge that shut off the derricks grounds not the hedge through which i had made my first entrance but another lower and nearer the house standing there under the shade of a tree i could see the lighted windows of the drawingroom generally there was music inside and the windows being opened on account of the warmth of the night i was able to make myself a little more miserable by hearing phyllis sing it deepened the feeling of banishment  i shall never forget those furtive visits the intense stillness of the night broken by an occasional rustling in the grass or the hedge the smell of the flowers in the garden beyond the distant drone of the sea    god makes sech nights all white and still      furz you to look and listen  another day had generally begun before i moved from my hidingplace and started for home surprised to find my limbs stiff and my clothes bathed with dew    chapter x  i enlist the services of a minion  it would be interesting to know to what extent the work of authors is influenced by their private affairs if life is flowing smoothly are the novels they write in that period of content coloured with optimism and if things are running crosswise do they work off the resultant gloom on their faithful public if for instance mr w w jacobs had toothache would he write like hugh walpole if maxim gorky were invited to lunch by trotsky to meet lenin would he sit down and dash off a trifle in the vein of stephen leacock probably the eminent have the power of detaching their writing self from their living workaday self but for my own part the frame of mind in which i now found myself had a disastrous effect on my novel that was to be i had designed it as a light comedy effort here and there a page or two to steady the reader and show him what i could do in the way of pathos if i cared to try but in the main a thing of sunshine and laughter but now great slabs of gloom began to work themselves into the scheme of it a magnificent despondency became its keynote it would not do i felt that i must make a resolute effort to shake off my depression more than ever the need of conciliating the professor was borne in upon me day and night i spurred my brain to think of some suitable means of engineering a reconciliation  in the meantime i worked hard among the fowls drove furiously on the links and swam about the harbour when the affairs of the farm did not require my attention  things were not going well on our model chicken farm little accidents marred the harmony of life in the fowlrun on one occasion a hennot aunt elizabeth i am sorry to sayfell into a pot of tar and came out an unspeakable object ukridge put his spare pair of tennis shoes in the incubator to dry them and permanently spoiled the future of halfadozen eggs which happened to have got there first chickens kept straying into the wrong coops where they got badly pecked by the residents edwin slew a couple of wyandottes and was only saved from execution by the tears of mrs ukridge  in spite of these occurrences however his buoyant optimism never deserted ukridge  after all he said whats one bird more or less yes i know i made a fuss when that beast of a cat lunched off those two but that was simply the principle of the thing im not going to pay large sums for chickens purely in order that a cat which ive never liked can lunch well still weve plenty left and the eggs are coming in better now though weve still a deal of leeway to make up yet in that line i got a letter from whiteleys this morning asking when my first consignment was going to arrive you know these people make a mistake in hurrying a man it annoys him it irritates him when we really get going garny my boy i shall drop whiteleys i shall cut them out of my list and send my eggs to their trade rivals they shall have a sharp lesson its a little hard here am i worked to death looking after things down here and these men have the impertinence to bother me about their wretched business come in and have a drink laddie and lets talk it over  it was on the morning after this that i heard him calling me in a voice in which i detected agitation i was strolling about the paddock as was my habit after breakfast thinking about phyllis and trying to get my novel into shape i had just framed a more than usually murky scene for use in the earlier part of the book when ukridge shouted to me from the fowlrun  garny come here i want you to see the most astounding thing  whats the matter i asked  blast if i know look at those chickens theyve been doing that for the last halfhour  i inspected the chickens there was certainly something the matter with them they were yawningbroadly as if we bored them they stood about singly and in groups opening and shutting their beaks it was an uncanny spectacle  whats the matter with them  can a chicken get a fit of the blues i asked because if so thats what theyve got i never saw a more boredlooking lot of birds  oh do look at that poor little brown one by the coop said mrs ukridge sympathetically im sure its not well see its lying down what can be the matter with it  i tell you what well do said ukridge well ask beale he once lived with an aunt who kept fowls hell know all about it beale  no answer  beale  a sturdy form in shirtsleeves appeared through the bushes carrying a boot we seemed to have interrupted him in the act of cleaning it  beale you know all about fowls whats the matter with these chickens  the hired retainer examined the blase birds with a wooden expression on his face  well said ukridge  the ole thing ere said the hired retainer is these ere fowls have been and got the roop  i had never heard of the disease before but it sounded bad  is that what makes them yawn like that said mrs ukridge  yes maam  poor things  yes maam  and have they all got it  yes maam  what ought we to do asked ukridge  well my aunt sir when er fowls ad the roop she gave them snuff  give them snuff she did he repeated with relish every morning  snuff said mrs ukridge  yes maam she give em snuff till their eyes bubbled  mrs ukridge uttered a faint squeak at this vivid piece of wordpainting  and did it cure them asked ukridge  no sir responded the expert soothingly  oh go away beale and clean your beastly boots said ukridge youre no use wait a minute who would know about this infernal roop thing one of those farmer chaps would i suppose beale go off to the nearest farmer and give him my compliments and ask him what he does when his fowls get the roop  yes sir  no ill go ukridge i said i want some exercise  i whistled to bob who was investigating a moleheap in the paddock and set off in the direction of the village of up lyme to consult farmer leigh on the matter he had sold us some fowls shortly after our arrival so might be expected to feel a kindly interest in their ailing families  the path to up lyme lies across deepgrassed meadows at intervals it passes over a stream by means of a footbridge the stream curls through the meadows like a snake  and at the first of these bridges i met phyllis  i came upon her quite suddenly the other end of the bridge was hidden from my view i could hear somebody coming through the grass but not till i was on the bridge did i see who it was we reached the bridge simultaneously she was alone she carried a sketchingblock all nice girls sketch a little  there was room for one alone on the footbridge and i drew back to let her pass  it being the privilege of woman to make the first sign of recognition i said nothing i merely lifted my hat in a noncommitting fashion  are you going to cut me i wonder i said to myself she answered the unspoken question as i hoped it would be answered  mr garnet she said stopping at the end of the bridge a pause  i couldnt tell you so before but i am so sorry this has happened  oh thanks awfully i said realising as i said it the miserable inadequacy of the english language at a crisis when i would have given a months income to have said something neat epigrammatic suggestive yet withal courteous and respectful i could only find a hackneyed unenthusiastic phrase which i should have used in accepting an invitation from a bore to lunch with him at his club  of course you understand my friendsmust be my fathers friends  yes i said gloomily i suppose so  so you must not think me rude if ii  cut me said i with masculine coarseness  dont seem to see you said she with feminine delicacy when i am with my father you will understand  i shall understand  you seeshe smiledyou are under arrest as tom says  tom  i see i said  goodbye  goodbye  i watched her out of sight and went on to interview mr leigh  we had a long and intensely uninteresting conversation about the maladies to which chickens are subject he was verbose and reminiscent he took me over his farm pointing out as we went dorkings with pasts and cochin chinas which he had cured of diseases generally fatal on as far as i could gather christian science principles  i left at last with instructions to paint the throats of the stricken birds with turpentinea task imagination boggled at and one which i proposed to leave exclusively to ukridge and the hired retainerand also a slight headache a visit to the cob would i thought do me good i had missed my bathe that morning and was in need of a breath of seaair  it was hightide and there was deep water on three sides of the cob  in a small boat in the offing professor derrick appeared fishing i had seen him engaged in this pursuit once or twice before his only companion was a gigantic boatman by name harry hawk possibly a descendant of the gentleman of that name who went to widdicombe fair with bill brewer and old uncle tom cobley and all on a certain memorable occasion and assisted at the fatal accident to tom pearses grey mare  i sat on the seat at the end of the cob and watched the professor it was an instructive sight an objectlesson to those who hold that optimism has died out of the race i had never seen him catch a fish he never looked to me as if he were at all likely to catch a fish yet he persevered  there are few things more restful than to watch some one else busy under a warm sun as i sat there my pipe drawing nicely as the result of certain explorations conducted that morning with a straw my mind ranged idly over large subjects and small i thought of love and chickenfarming i mused on the immortality of the soul and the deplorable speed at which two ounces of tobacco disappeared in the end i always returned to the professor sitting as i did with my back to the beach i could see nothing but his boat it had the ocean to itself  i began to ponder over the professor i wondered dreamily if he were very hot i tried to picture his boyhood i speculated on his future and the pleasure he extracted from life  it was only when i heard him call out to hawk to be careful when a movement on the part of that oarsman set the boat rocking that i began to weave romances round him in which i myself figured  but once started i progressed rapidly i imagined a sudden upset professor struggling in water myself heroically courage im coming a few rapid strokes saved sequel a subdued professor dripping salt water and tears of gratitude urging me to become his soninlaw that sort of thing happened in fiction it was a shame that it should not happen in real life in my hot youth i once had seven stories in seven weekly penny papers in the same month all dealing with a situation of the kind only the details differed in not really a coward vincent devereux had rescued the earls daughter from a fire whereas in hildas hero it was the peppery old father whom tom slingsby saved singularly enough from drowning in other words i a very mediocre scribbler had effected seven times in a single month what the powers of the universe could not manage once even on the smallest scale         it was precisely three minutes to twelvei had just consulted my watchthat the great idea surged into my brain at four minutes to twelve i had been grumbling impotently at providence by two minutes to twelve i had determined upon a manly and independent course of action  briefly it was this providence had failed to give satisfaction i would therefore cease any connection with it and start a rival business on my own account after all if you want a thing done well you must do it yourself  in other words since a dramatic accident and rescue would not happen of its own accord i would arrange one for myself hawk looked to me the sort of man who would do anything in a friendly way for a few shillings  i had now to fight it out with conscience i quote the brief report which subsequently appeared in the recording angel         threeround contest conscience celestial bc v j garnet unattached  round oneconscience came to the scratch smiling and confident led off lightly with a statement that it would be bad for a man of the professors age to get wet garnet countered heavily alluding to the warmth of the weather and the fact that the professor habitually enjoyed a bathe every day much sparring conscience not quite so confident and apparently afraid to come to close quarters with this man time called with little damage done  round twoconscience much freshened by the half minutes rest feinted with the charge of deceitfulness and nearly got home heavily with what would phyllis say if she knew garnet however sidestepped cleverly with but she wont know and followed up the advantage with a damaging besides its all for the best the round ended with a brisk rally on general principles garnet crowding in a lot of work conscience down twice and only saved by the call of time  round three and lastconscience came up very weak and with garnet as strong as ever it was plain that the round would be a brief one this proved to be the case early in the second minute garnet crosscountered with alls fair in love and war conscience down and out the winner left the ring without a mark         i rose feeling much refreshed  that afternoon i interviewed mr hawk in the barparlour of the net and mackerel  hawk i said to him darkly over a mystic and conspiratorlike pot of ale i want you next time you take professor derrick out fishinghere i glanced round to make sure that we were not overheardto upset him  his astonished face rose slowly from the pot of ale like a full moon  what ud i do that for he gasped  five shillings i hope said i but i am prepared to go to ten  he gurgled  i encored his pot of ale  he kept on gurgling  i argued with the man  i spoke splendidly i was eloquent but at the same time concise my choice of words was superb i crystallised my ideas into pithy sentences which a child could have understood  and at the end of halfanhour he had grasped the salient points of the scheme also he imagined that i wished the professor upset by way of a practical joke he gave me to understand that this was the type of humour which was to be expected from a gentleman from london i am afraid he must at one period in his career have lived at one of those wateringplaces at which trippers congregate he did not seem to think highly of the londoner  i let it rest at that i could not give my true reason and this served as well as any         at the last moment he recollected that he too would get wet when the accident took place and he raised the price to a sovereign  a mercenary man it is painful to see how rapidly the old simple spirit is dying out of our rural districts twenty years ago a fisherman would have been charmed to do a little job like that for a screw of tobacco    chapter xi  the brave preserver  i could have wished during the next few days that mr harry hawks attitude towards myself had not been so unctuously confidential and mysterious it was unnecessary in my opinion for him to grin meaningly when he met me in the street his sly wink when we passed each other on the cob struck me as in indifferent taste the thing had been definitely arranged ten shillings down and ten when it was over and there was no need for any cloak and darklantern effects i objected strongly to being treated as the villain of a melodrama i was merely an ordinary wellmeaning man forced by circumstances into doing the work of providence mr hawks demeanour seemed to say we are two reckless scoundrels but bless you i wont give away your guilty secret the climax came one morning as i was going along the street towards the beach i was passing a dark doorway when out shimmered mr hawk as if he had been a spectre instead of the most substantial man within a radius of ten miles  st he whispered  now look here hawk i said wrathfully for the start he had given me had made me bite my tongue this has got to stop i refuse to be haunted in this way what is it now  mr derrick goes out this morning zur  thank goodness for that i said get it over this morning then without fail i couldnt stand another day of it  i went on to the cob where i sat down i was excited deeds of great import must shortly be done i felt a little nervous it would never do to bungle the thing suppose by some accident i were to drown the professor or suppose that after all he contented himself with a mere formal expression of thanks and refused to let bygones be bygones these things did not bear thinking of  i got up and began to pace restlessly to and fro  presently from the farther end of the harbour there put off mr hawks boat bearing its precious cargo my mouth became dry with excitement  very slowly mr hawk pulled round the end of the cob coming to a standstill some dozen yards from where i was performing my beat it was evidently here that the scene of the gallant rescue had been fixed  my eyes were glued upon mr hawks broad back only when going in to bat at cricket have i experienced a similar feeling of suspense the boat lay almost motionless on the water i had never seen the sea smoother little ripples plashed against the side of the cob  it seemed as if this perfect calm might continue for ever mr hawk made no movement then suddenly the whole scene changed to one of vast activity i heard mr hawk utter a hoarse cry and saw him plunge violently in his seat the professor turned half round and i caught sight of his indignant face pink with emotion then the scene changed again with the rapidity of a dissolving view i saw mr hawk give another plunge and the next moment the boat was upside down in the water and i was shooting headforemost to the bottom oppressed with the indescribably clammy sensation which comes when ones clothes are thoroughly wet  i rose to the surface close to the upturned boat the first sight i saw was the spluttering face of mr hawk i ignored him and swam to where the professors head bobbed on the waters  keep cool i said a silly remark in the circumstances  he was swimming energetically but unskilfully he appeared to be one of those men who can look after themselves in the water only when they are in bathing costume in his shore clothes it would have taken him a week to struggle to land if he had got there at all which was unlikely  i know all about saving people from drowning we used to practise it with a dummy in the swimmingbath at school i attacked him from the rear and got a good grip of him by the shoulders i then swam on my back in the direction of land and beached him with much eclat at the feet of an admiring crowd i had thought of putting him under once or twice just to show him he was being rescued but decided against such a course as needlessly realistic as it was i fancy he had swallowed of seawater two or three hearty draughts  the crowd was enthusiastic  brave young feller said somebody  i blushed this was fame  jumped in he did sure enough an saved the gentleman  be the old soul drownded  that girt fule arry awk  i was sorry for mr hawk popular opinion was against him what the professor said of him when he recovered his breath i cannot repeatnot because i do not remember it but because there is a line and one must draw it let it be sufficient to say that on the subject of mr hawk he saw eye to eye with the citizen who had described him as a girt fule i could not help thinking that my fellow conspirator did well to keep out of it all he was now sitting in the boat which he had restored to its normal position baling pensively with an old tin can to satire from the shore he paid no attention  the professor stood up and stretched out his hand i grasped it  mr garnet he said for all the world as if he had been the father of the heroine of hildas hero we parted recently in anger let me thank you for your gallant conduct and hope that bygones will be bygones  i came out strong i continued to hold his hand the crowd raised a sympathetic cheer  i said professor the fault was mine show that you have forgiven me by coming up to the farm and putting on something dry  an excellent idea me boy i am a little wet  a little i agreed  we walked briskly up the hill to the farm  ukridge met us at the gate  he diagnosed the situation rapidly  youre all wet he said i admitted it  professor derrick has had an unfortunate boating accident i explained  and mr garnet heroically dived in in all his clothes and saved me life broke in the professor a hero sir achoo  youre catching cold old horse said ukridge all friendliness and concern his little differences with the professor having vanished like thawed snow thisll never do come upstairs and get into something of garnets my own toggery wouldnt fit what come along come along ill get you some hot water mrs bealemrs beale we want a large can of hot water at once what yes immediately what very well then as soon as you can now then garny my boy out with the duds what do you think of this now professor a sweetly pretty thing in grey flannel heres a shirt get out of that wet toggery and mrs beale shall dry it dont attempt to tell me about it till youre changed socks socks forward show socks here you are coat try this blazer thats rightthats right  he bustled about till the professor was clothed then marched him downstairs and gave him a cigar  now whats all this what happened  the professor explained he was severe in his narration upon the unlucky mr hawk  i was fishing mr ukridge with me back turned when i felt the boat rock violently from one side to the other to such an extent that i nearly lost me equilibrium and then the boat upset the mans a fool sir i could not see what had happened my back being turned as i say  garnet must have seen what happened old horse  it was very sudden i said it seemed to me as if the man had got an attack of cramp that would account for it he has the reputation of being a most sober and trustworthy fellow  never trust that sort of man said ukridge they are always the worst its plain to me that this man was beastly drunk and upset the boat while trying to do a dance  a great curse drink said the professor why yes mr ukridge i think i will thank you thank you that will be enough not all the soda if you please ah this tastes pleasanter than salt water mr garnet eh eh haha  he was in the best of tempers and i worked strenuously to keep him so my scheme had been so successful that its iniquity did not worry me i have noticed that this is usually the case in matters of this kind it is the bungled crime that brings remorse  we must go round the links together one of these days mr garnet said the professor i have noticed you there on several occasions playing a strong game i have lately taken to using a wooden putter it is wonderful what a difference it makes  golf is a great bond of union we wandered about the grounds discussing the game the entente cordiale growing more firmly established every moment  we must certainly arrange a meeting concluded the professor i shall be interested to see how we stand with regard to one another i have improved my game considerably since i have been down here considerably  my only feat worthy of mention since i started the game i said has been to halve a round with angus mlurkin at st andrews  the mlurkin asked the professor impressed  yes but it was one of his very off days i fancy he must have had gout or something and i have certainly never played so well since  still said the professor yes we must really arrange to meet  with ukridge who was in one of his less tactless moods he became very friendly  ukridges ready agreement with his strictures on the erring hawk had a great deal to do with this when a man has a grievance he feels drawn to those who will hear him patiently and sympathise ukridge was all sympathy  the man is an unprincipled scoundrel he said and should be torn limb from limb take my advice and dont go out with him again show him that you are not a man to be trifled with the spilt child dreads the water what human life isnt safe with such men as hawk roaming about  you are perfectly right sir the man can have no defence i shall not employ him again  i felt more than a little guilty while listening to this duet on the subject of the man whom i had lured from the straight and narrow path but the professor would listen to no defence my attempts at excusing him were ill received indeed the professor shewed such signs of becoming heated that i abandoned my fellowconspirator to his fate with extreme promptness after all an addition to the stipulated rewardone of these dayswould compensate him for any loss which he might sustain from the withdrawal of the professors custom mr harry hawk was in good enough case i would see that he did not suffer  filled with these philanthropic feelings i turned once more to talk with the professor of niblicks and approach shots and holes done in three without a brassy we were a merry party at luncha lunch fortunately in mrs beales best vein consisting of a roast chicken and sweets chicken had figured somewhat frequently of late on our daily bill of fare  we saw the professor off the premises in his dried clothes and i turned back to put the fowls to bed in a happier frame of mind than i had known for a long time i whistled ragtime airs as i worked  rum old buffer said ukridge meditatively pouring himself out another whisky and soda my goodness i should have liked to have seen him in the water why do i miss these good things    chapter xii  some emotions and yellow lupin  the fame which came to me through that gallant rescue was a little embarrassing i was a marked man did i walk through the village heads emerged from windows and eyes followed me out of sight did i sit on the beach groups formed behind me and watched in silent admiration i was the man of the moment  if wed wanted an advertisement for the farm said ukridge on one of these occasions we couldnt have had a better one than you garny my boy you have brought us three distinct orders for eggs during the last week and ill tell you what it is we need all the orders we can get thatll bring us in ready money the farm is in a critical condition the coffers are low deuced low and ill tell you another thing im getting precious tired of living on nothing but chicken and eggs sos millie though she doesnt say so  so am i i said and i dont feel like imitating your wifes proud reserve i never want to see a chicken again as for eggs they are far too much for us  for the last week monotony had been the keynote of our commissariat we had had cold chicken and eggs for breakfast boiled chicken and eggs for lunch and roast chicken and eggs for dinner meals became a nuisance and mrs beale complained bitterly that we did not give her a chance she was a cook who would have graced an aldermans house and served up noble dinners for gourmets and here she was in this remote corner of the world ringing the changes on boiled chicken and roast chicken and boiled eggs and poached eggs mr whistler set to paint signboards for publichouses might have felt the same restless discontent as for her husband the hired retainer he took life as tranquilly as ever and seemed to regard the whole thing as the most exhilarating farce he had ever been in i think he looked on ukridge as an amiable lunatic and was content to rough it a little in order to enjoy the privilege of observing his movements he made no complaints of the food when a man has supported life for a number of years on incessant army beef the monotony of daily chicken and eggs scarcely strikes him  the fact is said ukridge these tradesmen round here seem to be a sordid suspicious lot they clamour for money  he mentioned a few examples vickers the butcher had been the first to strike with the remark that he would like to see the colour of mr ukridges money before supplying further joints dawlish the grocer had expressed almost exactly similar sentiments two days later and the ranks of these passive resisters had been receiving fresh recruits ever since to a man the tradesmen of combe regis seemed as deficient in simple faith as they were in norman blood  cant you pay some of them a little on account i suggested it would set them going again  my dear old man said ukridge impressively we need every penny of ready money we can raise for the farm the place simply eats money that infernal roop let us in for i dont know what  that insidious epidemic had indeed proved costly we had painted the throats of the chickens with the best turpentineat least ukridge and beale hadbut in spite of their efforts dozens had died and we had been obliged to sink much more money than was pleasant in restocking the run the battle which took place on the first day after the election of the new members was a sight to remember the results of it were still noticeable in the depressed aspect of certain of the recently enrolled  no said ukridge summing up these men must wait we cant help their troubles why good gracious it isnt as if theyd been waiting for the money long weve not been down here much over a month i never heard of such a scandalous thing pon my word ive a good mind to go round and have a straight talk with one or two of them i come and settle down here and stimulate trade and give them large orders and they worry me with bills when they know im up to my eyes in work looking after the fowls one cant attend to everything the business is just now at its most crucial point it would be fatal to pay any attention to anything else with things as they are these scoundrels will get paid all in good time  it is a peculiarity of situations of this kind that the ideas of debtor and creditor as to what constitutes a good time never coincide         i am afraid that despite the urgent need for strict attention to business i was inclined to neglect my duties about this time i had got into the habit of wandering off either to the links where i generally found the professor sometimes phyllis or on long walks by myself there was one particular walk along the cliffs through some of the most beautiful scenery i have ever set eyes on which more than any other suited my mood i would work my way through the woods till i came to a small clearing on the very edge of the cliff there i would sit and smoke by the hour if ever i am stricken with smokers heart or staggers or tobacco amblyopia or any other of the cheery things which doctors predict for the devotee of the weed i shall feel that i sowed the seeds of it that summer in that little clearing overlooking the sea a man in love needs much tobacco a man thinking out a novel needs much tobacco i was in the grip of both maladies somehow i found that my ideas flowed more readily in that spot than in any other  i had not been inside the professors grounds since the occasion when i had gone in through the boxwood hedge but on the afternoon following my financial conversation with ukridge i made my way thither after a toilet which from its length should have produced better results than it did not for four whole days had i caught so much as a glimpse of phyllis i had been to the links three times and had met the professor twice but on both occasions she had been absent i had not had the courage to ask after her i had an absurd idea that my voice or my manner would betray me in some way i felt that i should have put the question with such an exaggerated show of indifference that all would have been discovered  the professor was not at home nor was mr chase nor was miss norah derrick the lady i had met on the beach with the professor miss phyllis said the maid was in the garden  i went into the garden she was sitting under the cedar by the tennislawn reading she looked up as i approached  i said it was a lovely afternoon after which there was a lull in the conversation i was filled with a horrid fear that i was boring her i had probably arrived at the very moment when she was most interested in her book she must i thought even now be regarding me as a nuisance and was probably rehearsing bitter things to say to the maid for not having had the sense to explain that she was out  iercalled in the hope of seeing professor derrick i said  you would find him on the links she replied it seemed to me that she spoke wistfully  oh itit doesnt matter i said it wasnt anything important  this was true if the professor had appeared then and there i should have found it difficult to think of anything to say to him which would have accounted to any extent for my anxiety to see him  how are the chickens mr garnet said she  the situation was saved conversationally i am like a clockwork toy i have to be set going on the affairs of the farm i could speak fluently i sketched for her the progress we had made since her visit i was humorous concerning roop epigrammatic on the subject of the hired retainer and edwin  then the cat did come down from the chimney said phyllis  we both laughed andi can answer for myselfi felt the better for it  he came down next day i said and made an excellent lunch of one of our best fowls he also killed another and only just escaped death himself at the hands of ukridge  mr ukridge doesnt like him does he  if he does he dissembles his love edwin is mrs ukridges pet he is the only subject on which they disagree edwin is certainly in the way on a chicken farm he has got over his fear of bob and is now perfectly lawless we have to keep a steady eye on him  and have you had any success with the incubator i love incubators i have always wanted to have one of my own but we have never kept fowls  the incubator has not done all that it should have done i said ukridge looks after it and i fancy his methods are not the right methods i dont know if i have got the figures absolutely correct but ukridge reasons on these lines he says you are supposed to keep the temperature up to a hundred and five degrees i think he said a hundred and five then the eggs are supposed to hatch out in a week or so he argues that you may just as well keep the temperature at seventytwo and wait a fortnight for your chickens i am certain theres a fallacy in the system somewhere because we never seem to get as far as the chickens but ukridge says his theory is mathematically sound and he sticks to it  are you quite sure that the way you are doing it is the best way to manage a chicken farm  i should very much doubt it i am a child in these matters i had only seen a chicken in its wild state once or twice before we came down here i had never dreamed of being an active assistant on a real farm the whole thing began like mr george ades fable of the author an authormyselfwas sitting at his desk trying to turn out any old thing that could be converted into breakfastfood when a friend came in and sat down on the table and told him to go right on and not mind him  did mr ukridge do that  very nearly that he called at my rooms one beautiful morning when i was feeling desperately tired of london and overworked and dying for a holiday and suggested that i should come to combe regis with him and help him farm chickens i have not regretted it  it is a lovely place isnt it  the loveliest i have ever seen how charming your garden is  shall we go and look at it you have not seen the whole of it  as she rose i saw her book which she had laid face downwards on the grass beside her it was the same muchenduring copy of the manoeuvres of arthur i was thrilled this patient perseverance must surely mean something she saw me looking at it  did you draw pamela from anybody she asked suddenly  i was glad now that i had not done so the wretched pamela once my pride was for some reason unpopular with the only critic about whose opinion i cared and had fallen accordingly from her pedestal  as we wandered down from the garden paths she gave me her opinion of the book in the main it was appreciative i shall always associate the scent of yellow lupin with the higher criticism  of course i dont know anything about writing books she said  yes my tone implied or i hope it did that she was an expert on books and that if she was not it didnt matter  but i dont think you do your heroines well i have just got the outsider my other novel bastable  kirby 6s satirical all about societyof which i know less than i know about chickenfarming slated by times and spectator well received by london mail and winning postand continued phyllis lady maud is exactly the same as pamela in the manoeuvres of arthur i thought you must have drawn both characters from some one you knew  no i said no purely imaginary  i am so glad said phyllis  and then neither of us seemed to have anything to say my knees began to tremble i realised that the moment had arrived when my fate must be put to the touch and i feared that the moment was premature we cannot arrange these things to suit ourselves i knew that the time was not yet ripe but the magic scent of the yellow lupin was too much for me  miss derrick i said hoarsely  phyllis was looking with more intentness than the attractions of the flower justified at a rose she held in her hand the bee hummed in the lupin  miss derrick i said and stopped again  i say you people said a cheerful voice tea is ready hullo garnet how are you that medal arrived yet from the humane society  i spun round mr tom chase was standing at the end of the path the only word that could deal adequately with the situation slapped against my front teeth i grinned a sickly grin  well tom said phyllis  and there was i thought just the faintest tinkle of annoyance in her voice         ive been bathing said mr chase a propos des bottes  oh i replied and i wish i added that youd drowned yourself  but i added it silently to myself    chapter xiii  tea and tennis  met the professors late boatman on the cob said mr chase dissecting a chocolate cake  clumsy man said phyllis i hope he was ashamed of himself i shall never forgive him for trying to drown papa  my heart bled for mr henry hawk that modern martyr  when i met him said tom chase he looked as if he had been trying to drown his sorrow as well  i knew he drank said phyllis severely the very first time i saw him  you might have warned the professor murmured mr chase  he couldnt have upset the boat if he had been sober  you never know he may have done it on purpose  tom how absurd  rather rough on the man arent you i said  merely a suggestion continued mr chase airily ive been reading sensational novels lately and it seems to me that mr hawks cut out to be a minion probably some secret foe of the professors bribed him  my heart stood still did he know i wondered and was this all a roundabout way of telling me he knew  the professor may be a member of an anarchist league or something and this is his punishment for refusing to assassinate some sportsman  have another cup of tea tom and stop talking nonsense  mr chase handed in his cup  what gave me the idea that the upset was done on purpose was this i saw the whole thing from the ware cliff the spill looked to me just like dozens i had seen at malta  why do they upset themselves on purpose at malta particularly inquired phyllis  listen carefully my dear and youll know more about the ways of the navy that guards your coasts than you did before when men are allowed on shore at malta the owner has a fancy to see them snugly on board again at a certain reasonable hour after that hour any maltese policeman who brings them aboard gets one sovereign cash but he has to do all the bringing part of it on his own consequence is you see boats rowing out to the ship carrying men who have overstayed their leave and when they get near enough the ablebodied gentleman in custody jumps to his feet upsets the boat and swims for the gangway the policemen if they arent drownedthey sometimes arerace him and whichever gets there first wins if its the policeman he gets his sovereign if its the sailor he is considered to have arrived not in a state of custody and gets off easier what a judicious remark that was of the governor of north carolina to the governor of south carolina respecting the length of time between drinks just one more cup please phyllis  but how does all that apply i asked drymouthed  mr hawk upset the professor just as those maltese were upset theres a patent way of doing it furthermore by judicious questioning i found that hawk was once in the navy and stationed at malta now whos going to drag in sherlock holmes  you dont really think i said feeling like a criminal in the dock when the case is going against him  i think friend hawk has been reenacting the joys of his vanished youth so to speak  he ought to be prosecuted said phyllis blazing with indignation  alas poor hawk  nobodys safe with a man of that sort hiring out a boat oh miserable hawk  but why on earth should he play a trick like that on professor derrick chase  pure animal spirits probably or he may as i say be a minion  i was hot all over  i shall tell father that said phyllis in her most decided voice and see what he says i dont wonder at the man taking to drink after doing such a thing  ii think youre making a mistake i said  i never make mistakes mr chase replied i am called archibald the allright for i am infallible i propose to keep a reflective eye upon the jovial hawk  he helped himself to another section of the chocolate cake  havent you finished yet tom inquired phyllis im sure mr garnets getting tired of sitting talking here she said  i shot out a polite negative mr chase explained with his mouth full that he had by no means finished chocolate cake it appeared was the dream of his life when at sea he was accustomed to lie awake o nights thinking of it  you dont seem to realise he said that i have just come from a cruise on a torpedoboat there was such a sea on as a rule that cooking operations were entirely suspended and we lived on ham and sardineswithout bread  how horrible  on the other hand added mr chase philosophically it didnt matter much because we were all ill most of the time  dont be nasty tom  i was merely defending myself i hope mr hawk will be able to do as well when his turn comes my aim my dear phyllis is to show you in a series of impressionist pictures the sort of thing i have to go through when im not here then perhaps you wont rend me so savagely over a matter of five minutes lateness for breakfast  five minutes it was threequarters of an hour and everything was simply frozen  quite right too in weather like this youre a slave to convention phyllis you think breakfast ought to be hot so you always have it hot on occasion i prefer mine cold mine is the truer wisdom you can give the cook my compliments phyllis and tell hergently for i dont wish the glad news to overwhelm herthat i enjoyed that cake say that i shall be glad to hear from her again care for a game of tennis garnet  what a pity norah isnt here said phyllis we could have had a four  but she is at present wasting her sweetness on the desert air of yeovil you had better sit down and watch us phyllis tennis in this sort of weather is no job for the delicatelynurtured feminine i will explain the finer points of my play as we go on look out particularly for the tilden backhanded slosh a winner every time  we proceeded to the tennis court i played with the sun in my eyes i might if i chose emphasise that fact and attribute my subsequent rout to it adding by way of solidifying the excuse that i was playing in a strange court with a borrowed racquet and that my mind was preoccupiedfirstly with laffaire hawk secondly and chiefly with the gloomy thought that phyllis and my opponent seemed to be on friendly terms with each other their manner at tea had been almost that of an engaged couple there was a thorough understanding between them i will not however take refuge behind excuses i admit without qualifying the statement that mr chase was too good for me i had always been under the impression that lieutenants in the royal navy were not brilliant at tennis i had met them at various houses but they had never shone conspicuously they had played an earnest unobtrusive game and generally seemed glad when it was over mr chase was not of this sort his service was bottled lightning his returns behaved like jumping crackers he won the first game in precisely six strokes he served only once did i take the service with the full face of the racquet and then i seemed to be stopping a bullet i returned it into the net the last of the series struck the wooden edge of my racquet and soared over the back net into the shrubbery after the manner of a snick to long slip off a fast bowler  game said mr chase well look for that afterwards  i felt a worm and no man phyllis i thought would probably judge my entire character from this exhibition a man she would reflect who could be so feeble and miserable a failure at tennis could not be good for much in any department of life she would compare me instinctively with my opponent and contrast his dash and brilliance with my own inefficiency somehow the massacre was beginning to have a bad effect on my character all my selfrespect was ebbing a little more of this and i should become crusheda mere human jelly it was my turn to serve service is my strong point at tennis i am inaccurate but vigorous and occasionally send in a quite unplayable shot one or two of these even at the expense of a fault or so and i might be permitted to retain at least a portion of my selfrespect  i opened with a couple of faults the sight of phyllis sitting calm and cool in her chair under the cedar unnerved me i served another fault and yet another  here i say garnet observed mr chase plaintively do put me out of this hideous suspense im becoming a mere bundle of quivering ganglions  i loathe facetiousness in moments of stress  i frowned austerely made no reply and served another fault my fifth  matters had reached a crisis even if i had to lob it underhand i must send the ball over the net with the next stroke  i restrained myself this time eschewing the careless vigour which had marked my previous efforts the ball flew in a slow semicircle and pitched inside the correct court at least i told myself i had not served a fault  what happened then i cannot exactly say i saw my opponent spring forward like a panther and whirl his racquet the next moment the back net was shaking violently and the ball was rolling swiftly along the ground on a return journey to the other court  loveforty said mr chase phyllis  yes  that was the tilden slosh  i thought it must be said phyllis  in the third game i managed to score fifteen by the merest chance i returned one of his redhot serves andprobably through surprisehe failed to send it back again  in the fourth and fifth games i omitted to score phyllis had left the cedar now and was picking flowers from the beds behind the court  we began the sixth game and now for some reason i played really well i struck a little vein of brilliance i was serving and this time a proportion of my serves went over the net instead of trying to get through the score went from fifteen all to fortyfifteen hope began to surge through my veins if i could keep this up i might win yet  the tilden slosh diminished my lead by fifteen then i got in a really fine serve which beat him vantage in another slosh deuce another slam vantage out it was an awesome moment there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken by the floodi served fault i served againa beauty he returned it like a flash into the corner of the court with a supreme effort i got to it we rallied i was playing like a professor then whizz  the slosh had beaten me on the post  game and said mr chase tossing his racquet into the air and catching it by the handle good game that last one  i turned to see what phyllis thought of it  at the eleventh hour i had shown her of what stuff i was made  she had disappeared  looking for miss derrick said chase jumping the net and joining me in my court shes gone into the house  when did she go  at the end of the fifth game said chase  gone to dress for dinner i suppose he continued it must be getting late i think i ought to be going too if you dont mind the professor gets a little restive if i keep him waiting for his daily bread great scott that watch cant be right what do you make of it yes so do i i really think i must run you wont mind goodnight then see you tomorrow i hope  i walked slowly out across the fields that same star in which i had confided on a former occasion was at its post it looked placid and cheerful it never got beaten by six games to love under the very eyes of a ladystar it was never cut out ignominiously by infernally capable lieutenants in his majestys navy no wonder it was cheerful    chapter xiv  a council of war  the fact is said ukridge if things go on as they are now my lad we shall be in the cart this business wants bucking up we dont seem to be making headway why it is i dont know but we are not making headway of course what we want is time if only these scoundrels of tradesmen would leave us alone for a spell we could get things going properly but were hampered and rattled and worried all the time arent we millie  yes dear  you dont let me see the financial side of the thing enough i complained why dont you keep me thoroughly posted i didnt know we were in such a bad way the fowls look fit enough and edwin hasnt had one for a week  edwin knows as well as possible when hes done wrong mr garnet said mrs ukridge he was so sorry after he had killed those other two  yes said ukridge i saw to that  as far as i can see i continued were going strong chicken for breakfast lunch and dinner is a shade monotonous perhaps but look at the business were doing we sold a whole heap of eggs last week  but not enough garny old man we arent making our presence felt england isnt ringing with our name we sell a dozen eggs where we ought to be selling them by the hundred carting them off in trucks for the london market and congesting the traffic harrods and whiteleys and the rest of them are beginning to get on their hind legs and talk thats what theyre doing devilish unpleasant theyre making themselves you see laddie theres no denying itwe did touch them for the deuce of a lot of things on account and they agreed to take it out in eggs all theyve done so far is to take it out in apologetic letters from millie now i dont suppose theres a woman alive who can write a better apologetic letter than her nibs but if youre broadminded and can face facts you cant help seeing that the juiciest apologetic letter is not an egg i meant to say look at it from their point of view harrodor whiteleycomes into his store in the morning rubbing his hands expectantly well he says how many eggs from combe regis today and instead of leading him off to a corner piled up with bursting crates they show him a fourpage letter telling him itll all come right in the future ive never run a store myself but i should think that would jar a chap anyhow the blighters seem to be getting tired of waiting  the last letter from harrods was quite pathetic said mrs ukridge sadly  i had a vision of an eggless london i seemed to see homes rendered desolate and lives embittered by the slump and millionaires bidding against one another for the few rare specimens which ukridge had actually managed to despatch to brompton and bayswater  ukridge having induced himself to be broadminded for five minutes now began to slip back to his own personal point of view and became once more the man with a grievance his fleeting sympathy with the wrongs of mr harrod and mr whiteley disappeared  what it all amounts to he said complainingly is that theyre infernally unreasonable ive done everything possible to meet them nothing could have been more manly and straightforward than my attitude i told them in my last letter but three that i proposed to let them have the eggs on the times instalment system and they said i was frivolous they said that to send thirteen eggs as payment for goods supplied to the value of 25 pounds 1s 8 12 d was mere trifling trifling ill trouble you thats the spirit in which they meet my suggestions it was harrod who did that ive never met harrod personally but id like to just to ask him if thats his idea of cementing amiable business relations he knows just as well as anyone else that without credit commerce has no elasticity its an elementary rule ill bet hed have been sick if chappies had refused to let him have tick when he was starting his store do you suppose harrod when he started in business paid cash down on the nail for everything not a bit of it he went about taking people by the coatbutton and asking them to be good chaps and wait till wednesday week trifling why those thirteen eggs were absolutely all we had over after mrs beale had taken what she wanted for the kitchen as a matter of fact if its anybodys fault its mrs beales that woman literally eats eggs  the habit is not confined to her i said  well what i mean to say is she seems to bathe in them  she says she needs so many for puddings dear said mrs ukridge i spoke to her about it yesterday and of course we often have omelettes  she cant make omelettes without breaking eggs i urged  she cant make them without breaking us dammit said ukridge one or two more omelettes and were done for no fortune on earth could stand it we mustnt have any more omelettes millie we must economise millions of people get on all right without omelettes i suppose there are families where if you suddenly produced an omelette the whole strength of the company would get up and cheer led by father cancel the omelettes old girl from now onward  yes dear but  well  i dont think mrs beale would like that very much dear she has been complaining a good deal about chicken at every meal she says that the omelettes are the only things that give her a chance she says there are always possibilities in an omelette  in short i said what you propose to do is deliberately to remove from this excellent ladys life the one remaining element of poetry you mustnt do it give mrs beale her omelettes and lets hope for a larger supply of eggs  another thing said ukridge it isnt only that theres a shortage of eggs that wouldnt matter so much if only we kept hatching out fresh squads of chickens im not saying the hens arent doing their best i take off my hat to the hens as nice a hardworking lot as i ever want to meet full of vigour and earnestness its that damned incubator thats letting us down all the time the rotten thing wont work i dont know whats the matter with it the long and the short of it is that it simply declines to incubate  perhaps its your dodge of letting down the temperature you remember you were telling me i forget the details  my dear old boy he said earnestly theres nothing wrong with my figures its a mathematical certainty whats the good of mathematics if not to help you work out that sort of thing no theres something deuced wrong with the machine itself and i shall probably make a complaint to the people i got it from where did we get the incubator old girl  harrods i think dearyes it was harrods it came down with the first lot of things  then said ukridge banging the table with his fist while his glasses flashed triumph weve got em the lord has delivered harrods into our hand write and answer that letter of theirs tonight millie sit on them  yes dear  tell em that wed have sent them their confounded eggs long ago if only their rotten twopennyhapenny incubator had worked with any approach to decency he paused or would you be sarcastic garny old horse no better put it so that theyll understand say that i consider that the manufacturer of the thing ought to be in colney hatchif he isnt there alreadyand that they are scoundrels for palming off a groggy machine of that sort on me  the ceremony of opening the mornings letters at harrods ought to be full of interest and excitement tomorrow i said  this dashing counterstroke seemed to relieve ukridge his pessimism vanished he seldom looked on the dark side of things for long at a time he began now to speak hopefully of the future he planned out ingenious improvements our fowls were to multiply so rapidly and consistently that within a short space of time dorsetshire would be paved with them our eggs were to increase in size till they broke records and got threeline notices in the items of interest column in the daily mail briefly each hen was to become a happy combination of rabbit and ostrich  there is certainly a good time coming i said may it be soon meanwhile what of the local tradesmen  ukridge relapsed once more into gloom  they are the worst of the lot i dont mind the london people so much they only write and a letter or two hurts nobody but when it comes to butchers and bakers and grocers and fishmongers and fruiterers and what not coming up to ones house and dunning one in ones own gardenwell its a little hard what  oh then those fellows i found you talking to yesterday were duns i thought they were farmers come to hear your views on the rearing of poultry  which were they little chap with black whiskers and long thin man with beard that was dawlish the grocer and curtis the fishmonger the others had gone before you came  it may be wondered why before things came to such a crisis i had not placed my balance at the bank at the disposal of the senior partner for use on behalf of the farm the fact was that my balance was at the moment small i have not yet in the course of this narrative gone into my pecuniary position but i may state here that it was an inconvenient one it was big with possibilities but of ready cash there was but a meagre supply my parents had been poor but i had a wealthy uncle uncles are notoriously careless of the comfort of their nephews mine was no exception he had views he was a great believer in matrimony as having married three wivesnot simultaneouslyhe had every right to be he was also of opinion that the less money the young bachelor possessed the better the consequence was that he announced his intention of giving me a handsome allowance from the day that i married but not an instant before till that glad day i would have to shift for myself and i am bound to admit thatfor an uncleit was a remarkably sensible idea i am also of the opinion that it is greatly to my credit and a proof of my pure and unmercenary nature that i did not instantly put myself up to be raffled for or rush out into the streets and propose marriage to the first lady i met but i was making quite enough with my pen to support myself and be it never so humble there is something pleasant in a bachelor existence or so i had thought until very recently  i had thus no great stake in ukridges chicken farm i had contributed a modest five pounds to the preliminary expenses and another five after the roop incident but further i could not go with safety when his income is dependent on the whims of editors and publishers the prudent man keeps something up his sleeve against a sudden slump in his particular wares i did not wish to have to make a hurried choice between matrimony and the workhouse  having exhausted the subject of financeor rather when i began to feel that it was exhausting mei took my clubs and strolled up the hill to the links to play off a match with a sportsman from the village i had entered some days previously for a competition for a trophy i quote the printed notice presented by a local supporter of the game in which up to the present i was getting on nicely i had survived two rounds and expected to beat my present opponent which would bring me into the semifinal unless i had bad luck i felt that i ought to get into the final and win it as far as i could gather from watching the play of my rivals the professor was the best of them and i was convinced that i should have no difficulty with him but he had the most extraordinary luck at golf though he never admitted it he also exercised quite an uncanny influence on his opponent i have seen men put completely off their stroke by his good fortune  i disposed of my man without difficulty we parted a little coldly he had decapitated his brassy on the occasion of his striking dorsetshire instead of his ball and he was slow in recovering from the complex emotions which such an episode induces  in the clubhouse i met the professor whose demeanour was a welcome contrast to that of my late opponent the professor had just routed his opponent and so won through to the semifinal he was warm but jubilant  i congratulated him and left the place  phyllis was waiting outside she often went round the course with him  good afternoon i said have you been round with the professor  yes we must have been in front of you father won his match  so he was telling me i was very glad to hear it  did you win mr garnet  yes pretty easily my opponent had bad luck all through bunkers seemed to have a magnetic attraction for him  so you and father are both in the semifinal i hope you will play very badly  thank you i said  yes it does sound rude doesnt it but father has set his heart on winning this year do you know that he has played in the final round two years running now  really  both times he was beaten by the same man  who was that mr derrick plays a much better game than anybody i have seen on these links  it was nobody who is here now it was a colonel jervis he has not come to combe regis this year thats why father is hopeful  logically i said he ought to be certain to win  yes but you see you were not playing last year mr garnet  oh the professor can make rings round me i said  what did you go round in today  we were playing matchplay and only did the first dozen holes but my average round is somewhere in the late eighties  the best father has ever done is ninety and that was only once so you see mr garnet theres going to be another tragedy this year  you make me feel a perfect brute but its more than likely you must remember that i shall fail miserably if i ever do play your father in the final there are days when i play golf as badly as i play tennis youll hardly believe me  she smiled reminiscently  tom is much too good at tennis his service is perfectly dreadful  its a little terrifying on first acquaintance  but youre better at golf than at tennis mr garnet i wish you were not  this is special pleading i said it isnt fair to appeal to my better feelings miss derrick  i didnt know golfers had any where golf was concerned do you really have your offdays  nearly always there are days when i slice with my driver as if it were a breadknife  really  and when i couldnt putt to hit a haystack  then i hope it will be on one of those days that you play father  i hope so too i said  you hope so  yes  but dont you want to win  i should prefer to please you  really how very unselfish of you mr garnet she replied with a laugh i had no idea that such chivalry existed i thought a golfer would sacrifice anything to win a game  most things  and trample on the feelings of anybody  not everybody i said  at this point the professor joined us    chapter xv  the arrival of nemesis  some people do not believe in presentiments they attribute that curious feeling that something unpleasant is going to happen to such mundane causes as liver or a chill or the weather for my own part i think there is more in the matter than the casual observer might imagine  i awoke three days after my meeting with the professor at the clubhouse filled with a dull foreboding somehow i seemed to know that that day was going to turn out badly for me it may have been liver or a chill but it was certainly not the weather the morning was perfectthe most glorious of a glorious summer there was a haze over the valley and out to sea which suggested a warm noon when the sun should have begun the serious duties of the day the birds were singing in the trees and breakfasting on the lawn while edwin seated on one of the flowerbeds watched them with the eye of a connoisseur occasionally when a sparrow hopped in his direction he would make a sudden spring and the bird would fly away to the other side of the lawn i had never seen edwin catch a sparrow i believe they looked on him as a bit of a crank and humoured him by coming within springing distance just to keep him amused dashing young cocksparrows would show off before their particular hensparrows and earn a cheap reputation for daredevilry by going within so many years of edwins lair and then darting away bob was in his favourite place on the gravel i took him with me down to the cob to watch me bathe  whats the matter with me today robert old son i asked him as i dried myself  he blinked lazily but contributed no suggestion  its no good looking bored i went on because im going to talk about myself however much it bores you here am i as fit as a prizefighter living in the open air for i dont know how long eating good plain foodbathing every morningseabathing mind youand yet whats the result i feel beastly  bob yawned and gave a little whine  yes i said i know im in love but that cant be it because i was in love just as much a week ago and i felt all right then but isnt she an angel bob eh isnt she and didnt you feel bucked when she patted you of course you did anybody would but how about tom chase dont you think hes a dangerous man he calls her by her christian name you know and behaves generally as if she belonged to him and then he sees her every day while i have to trust to meeting her at odd times and then i generally feel such a fool i cant think of anything to talk about except golf and the weather he probably sings duets with her after dinner and you know what comes of duets after dinner  here bob who had been trying for some time to find a decent excuse for getting away pretended to see something of importance at the other end of the cob and trotted off to investigate it leaving me to finish dressing by myself  of course i said to myself it may be merely hunger i may be all right after breakfast but at present i seem to be working up for a really fine fit of the blues i feel bad  i whistled to bob and started for home on the beach i saw the professor some little distance away and waved my towel in a friendly manner he made no reply  of course it was possible that he had not seen me but for some reason his attitude struck me as ominous as far as i could see he was looking straight at me and he was not a shortsighted man i could think of no reason why he should cut me we had met on the links on the previous morning and he had been friendliness itself he had called me me dear boy supplied me with a gin and gingerbeer at the clubhouse and generally behaved as if he had been david and i jonathan yet in certain moods we are inclined to make mountains out of molehills and i went on my way puzzled and uneasy with a distinct impression that i had received the cut direct  i felt hurt what had i done that providence should make things so unpleasant for me it would be a little hard as ukridge would have said if after all my trouble the professor had discovered some fresh grievance against me perhaps ukridge had been irritating him again i wished he would not identify me so completely with ukridge i could not be expected to control the man then i reflected that they could hardly have met in the few hours between my parting from the professor at the clubhouse and my meeting with him on the beach ukridge rarely left the farm when he was not working among the fowls he was lying on his back in the paddock resting his massive mind  i came to the conclusion that after all the professor had not seen me  im an idiot bob i said as we turned in at the farm gate and i let my imagination run away with me  bob wagged his tail in approval of the sentiment  breakfast was ready when i got in there was a cold chicken on the sideboard devilled chicken on the table a trio of boiled eggs and a dish of scrambled eggs as regarded quantity mrs beale never failed us  ukridge was sorting the letters  morning garny he said one for you millie  its from aunt elizabeth said mrs ukridge looking at the envelope  i had only heard casual mention of this relative hitherto but i had built up a mental picture of her partly from remarks which ukridge had let fall but principally from the fact that he had named the most malignant hen in our fowlrun after her a severe lady i imagined with a cold eye  wish shed enclose a cheque said ukridge she could spare it youve no idea garny old man how disgustingly and indecently rich that woman is she lives in kensington on an income which would do her well in park lane but as a touching proposition she had proved almost negligible she steadfastly refuses to part  i think she would dear if she knew how much we needed it but i dont like to ask her shes so curious and says such horrid things  she does agreed ukridge gloomily he spoke as one who had had experience two for you garny all the rest for me ten of them and all bills  he spread the envelopes out on the table and drew one at a venture  whiteleys he said getting jumpy are in receipt of my favour of the 7th inst and are at a loss to understand its rummy about these blighters but they never seem able to understand a damn thing its hard you put things in words of one syllable for them and they just goggle and wonder what it all means they want something on account upon my sam im disappointed with whiteleys id been thinking in rather a kindly spirit of them and feeling that they were a more intelligent lot than harrods id had half a mind to give harrods the missinbaulk and hand my whole trade over to these fellows but not now dash it whiteleys have disappointed me from the way they write youd think they thought i was doing it for fun how can i let them have their infernal money when there isnt any heres one from dorchester smith the chap we got the gramophone from wants to know when im going to settle up for sixteen records  sordid brute  i wanted to get on with my own correspondence but ukridge held me with a glittering eye  the chickenmen the dealer people you know want me to pay for the first lot of hens considering that they all died of roop and that i was going to send them back anyhow after id got them to hatch out a few chickens i call that cool i mean to say business is business thats what these fellows dont seem to understand i cant afford to pay enormous sums for birds which die off quicker than i can get them in  i shall never speak to aunt elizabeth again said mrs ukridge suddenly  she had dropped the letter she had been reading and was staring indignantly in front of her there were two little red spots on her cheeks  whats the matter old chap inquired ukridge affectionately glancing up from his pile of bills and forgetting his own troubles in an instant buck up aunt elizabeth been getting on your nerves again whats she been saying this time  mrs ukridge left the room with a sob ukridge sprang at the letter  if that demon doesnt stop writing her infernal letters and upsetting millie i shall strangle her with my bare hands regardless of her age and sex he turned over the pages of the letter till he came to the passage which had caused the trouble well upon my sam listen to this garny old horse you tell me nothing regarding the success of this chicken farm of yours and i confess that i find your silence ominous you know my opinion of your husband he is perfectly helpless in any matter requiring the exercise of a little commonsense and business capability he stared at me amazed i like that pon my soul that is really rich i could have believed almost anything of that blighted female but i did think she had a reasonable amount of intelligence why you know that its just in matters requiring commonsense and business capability that i come out really strong  of course old man i replied dutifully the womans a fool  thats what she calls me two lines further on no wonder millie was upset why cant these cats leave people alone  oh woman woman i threw in helpfully  always interfering  rotten  and backbiting  awful  i shant stand it  i shouldnt  look here on the next page she calls me a gaby  its time you took a strong line  and in the very next sentence refers to me as a perfect guffin whats a guffin garny old boy  i considered the point  broadly speaking i should say one who guffs  i believe its actionable  i shouldnt wonder  ukridge rushed to the door  millie  he slammed the door and i heard him dashing upstairs  i turned to my letters one was from lickford with a cornish postmark i glanced through it and laid it aside for a more exhaustive perusal  the other was in a strange handwriting i looked at the signature patrick derrick this was queer what had the professor to say to me  the next moment my heart seemed to spring to my throat  sir the letter began  a pleasant cheery opening  then it got off the mark so to speak like lightning there was no sparring for an opening no dignified parade of set phrases leading up to the main point it was the letter of a man who was almost too furious to write it gave me the impression that if he had not written it he would have been obliged to have taken some very violent form of exercise by way of relief to his soul   you will be good enough to look on our acquaintance as closed i have no wish to associate with persons of your stamp if we should happen to meet you will be good enough to treat me as a total stranger as i shall treat you and if i may be allowed to give you a word of advice i should recommend you in future when you wish to exercise your humour to do so in some less practical manner than by bribing boatmen to upset yourfriends crossed out thickly and acquaintances substituted if you require further enlightenment in this matter the enclosed letter may be of service to you   with which he remained mine faithfully patrick derrick  the enclosed letter was from one jane muspratt it was bright and interesting   dear sirmy harry mr hawk sas to me how it was him upsetting the boat and you not because he is not steady in a boat which he is no man more so in combe regis but because one of the gentlemen what keeps chikkens up the hill the little one mr garnick his name is says to him hawk ill give you a sovrin to upset mr derick in your boat and my harry being esily led was took in and did but hes sory now and wishes he hadnt and he sas hell niver do a prackticle joke again for anyone even for a banknoteyours obedly                                              jane muspratt   oh woman woman  at the bottom of everything history is full of tragedies caused by the lethal sex who lost mark antony the world a woman who let samson in so atrociously woman again why did bill bailey leave home once more because of a woman and here was i jerry garnet harmless wellmeaning writer of minor novels going through the same old mill  i cursed jane muspratt what chance had i with phyllis now could i hope to win over the professor again i cursed jane muspratt for the second time  my thoughts wandered to mr harry hawk the villain the scoundrel what business had he to betray me  well i could settle with him the man who lays a hand upon a woman save in the way of kindness is justly disliked by society so the woman muspratt culpable as she was was safe from me but what of the man hawk there no such considerations swayed me i would interview the man hawk i would give him the most hectic ten minutes of his career i would say things to him the recollection of which would make him start up shrieking in his bed in the small hours of the night i would arise and be a man and slay him take him grossly full of bread with all his crimes broadblown as flush as may at gaming swearing or about some act that had no relish of salvation in it  the demon  my liferuined my futuregrey and black my heartshattered and why because of the scoundrel hawk  phyllis would meet me in the village on the cob on the links and pass by as if i were the invisible man and why because of the reptile hawk the worm hawk the dastard and varlet hawk  i crammed my hat on and hurried out of the house towards the village    chapter xvi  a chance meeting  i roamed the place in search of the varlet for the space of halfanhour and after having drawn all his familiar haunts found him at length leaning over the seawall near the church gazing thoughtfully into the waters below  i confronted him  well i said youre a beauty arent you  he eyed me owlishly even at this early hour i was grieved to see he showed signs of having looked on the bitter while it was brown his eyes were filmy and his manner aggressively solemn  beauty he echoed  what have you got to say for yourself  say fself  it was plain that he was engaged in pulling his faculties together by some laborious process known only to himself at present my words conveyed no meaning to him he was trying to identify me he had seen me before somewhere he was certain but he could not say where or who i was  i want to know i said what induced you to be such an abject idiot as to let our arrangement get known  i spoke quietly i was not going to waste the choicer flowers of speech on a man who was incapable of understanding them later on when he had awakened to a sense of his position i would begin really to talk to him  he continued to stare at me then a sudden flash of intelligence lit up his features  mr garnick he said at last  from chchicken farm he continued with the triumphant air of a crossexamining kings counsel who has at last got on the track  yes i said  up top the hill he proceeded clinchingly he stretched out a huge hand  how you he inquired with a friendly grin  i want to know i said distinctly what youve got to say for yourself after letting our affair with the professor become public property  he paused awhile in thought  dear sir he said at last as if he were dictating a letter dear sir i owe youexexp  he waved his hand as who should say its a stiff job but im going to do it  explashion he said  you do said i grimly i should like to hear it  dear sir listen me  go on then  you came me you said hawk hawk ol fren listen me you tip this ol bufflehead into watter you said an gormed if i dont give ee a poond note thats what you said me isnt that what you said me  i did not deny it  ve well i said you right i said i tipped the ol soul into watter and i got the poond note  yes you took care of that all this is quite true but its beside the point we are not disputing about what happened what i want to knowfor the third timeis what made you let the cat out of the bag why couldnt you keep quiet about it  he waved his hand  dear sir he replied this way listen me  it was a tragic story that he unfolded my wrath ebbed as i listened after all the fellow was not so greatly to blame i felt that in his place i should have acted as he had done it was fates fault and fates alone  it appeared that he had not come well out of the matter of the accident i had not looked at it hitherto from his point of view while the rescue had left me the popular hero it had had quite the opposite result for him he had upset his boat and would have drowned his passenger said public opinion if the young hero from londonmyselfhad not plunged in and at the risk of his life brought the professor ashore consequently he was despised by all as an inefficient boatman he became a laughingstock the local wags made laborious jests when he passed they offered him fabulous sums to take their worst enemies out for a row with him they wanted to know when he was going to school to learn his business in fact they behaved as wags do and always have done at all times all the world over  now all this it seemed mr hawk would have borne cheerfully and patiently for my sake or at any rate for the sake of the crisp pound note i had given him but a fresh factor appeared in the problem complicating it grievously to wit miss jane muspratt  she said to me explained mr hawk with pathos harry awk she said yeoum a girt fule an i dont marry noone as is aint to be trusted in a boat by hisself and what has jokes made about him by that tom leigh  i punched tom leigh observed mr hawk parenthetically so she said me you can go away an i dont want to see yeou again  this heartless conduct on the part of miss muspratt had had the natural result of making him confess in selfdefence and she had written to the professor the same night  i forgave mr hawk i think he was hardly sober enough to understand for he betrayed no emotion it is fate hawk i said simply fate there is a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will and its no good grumbling  yiss said mr hawk after chewing this sentiment for a while in silence so she said me hawk she saidlike thatyoure a girt fule  thats all right i replied i quite understand as i say its simply fate goodbye and i left him  as i was going back i met the professor and phyllis they passed me without a look  i wandered on in quite a fervour of selfpity i was in one of those moods when life suddenly seems to become irksome when the future stretches black and grey in front of one i should have liked to have faded almost imperceptibly from the world like mr bardell even if as in his case it had involved being knocked on the head with a pint pot in a publichouse cellar  in such a mood it is imperative that one should seek distraction the shining example of mr harry hawk did not lure me taking to drink would be a nuisance work was what i wanted i would toil like a navvy all day among the fowls separating them when they fought gathering in the eggs when they laid chasing them across country when they got away and even if necessity arose painting their throats with turpentine when they were stricken with roop then after dinner when the lamps were lit and mrs ukridge nursed edwin and sewed and ukridge smoked cigars and incited the gramophone to murder mumbling mose i would steal away to my bedroom and writeand writeand write and go on writing till my fingers were numb and my eyes refused to do their duty and when time had passed i might come to feel that it was all for the best a man must go through the fire before he can write his masterpiece we learn in suffering what we teach in song what we lose on the swings we make up on the roundabouts jerry garnet the man might become a depressed hopeless wreck with the iron planted immovably in his soul but jeremy garnet the author should turn out such a novel of gloom that strong critics would weep and the public jostle for copies till mudies doorway became a shambles  thus might i some day feel that all this anguish was really a blessingeffectively disguised         but i doubted it         we were none of us very cheerful now at the farm even ukridges spirit was a little daunted by the bills which poured in by every post it was as if the tradesmen of the neighbourhood had formed a league and were working in concert or it may have been due to thoughtwaves little accounts came not in single spies but in battalions the popular demand for the sight of the colour of his money grew daily every morning at breakfast he would give us fresh bulletins of the state of mind of each of our creditors and thrill us with the announcement that whiteleys were getting cross and harrods jumpy or that the bearings of dawlish the grocer were becoming overheated we lived in a continual atmosphere of worry chicken and nothing but chicken at meals and chicken and nothing but chicken between meals had frayed our nerves an air of defeat hung over the place we were a beaten side and we realised it we had been playing an uphill game for nearly two months and the strain was beginning to tell ukridge became uncannily silent mrs ukridge though she did not understand i fancy the details of the matter was worried because ukridge was mrs beale had long since been turned into a soured cynic by the lack of chances vouchsafed her for the exercise of her art and as for me i have never since spent so profoundly miserably a week i was not even permitted the anodyne of work there seemed to be nothing to do on the farm the chickens were quite happy and only asked to be let alone and allowed to have their meals at regular intervals and every day one or more of their number would vanish into the kitchen mrs beale would serve up the corpse in some cunning disguise and we would try to delude ourselves into the idea that it was something altogether different  there was one solitary gleam of variety in our menu an editor sent me a cheque for a set of verses we cashed that cheque and trooped round the town in a body laying out the money we bought a leg of mutton and a tongue and sardines and pineapple chunks and potted meat and many other noble things and had a perfect banquet mrs beale with the scenario of a smile on her face the first that she had worn in these days of stress brought in the joint and uncovered it with an air  thank god said ukridge as he began to carve  it was the first time i had ever heard him say a grace and if ever an occasion merited such a deviation from habit this occasion did  after that we relapsed into routine again  deprived of physical labour with the exception of golf and bathingtrivial sports compared with work in the fowlrun at its hardesti tried to make up for it by working at my novel  it refused to materialise  the only progress i achieved was with my villain  i drew him from the professor and made him a blackmailer he had several other social defects but that was his profession that was the thing he did really well  it was on one of the many occasions on which i had sat in my room pen in hand through the whole of a lovely afternoon with no better result than a slight headache that i bethought me of that little paradise on the ware cliff hung over the sea and backed by green woods i had not been there for some time owing principally to an entirely erroneous idea that i could do more solid work sitting in a straight hard chair at a table than lying on soft turf with the sea wind in my eyes  but now the desire to visit that little clearing again drove me from my room in the drawingroom below the gramophone was dealing brassily with mister blackman outside the sun was just thinking of setting the ware cliff was the best medicine for me what does kipling say    and soon you will find that the sun and the wind      and the djinn of the garden too    have lightened the hump cameelious hump      the hump that is black and blue  his instructions include digging with a hoe and a shovel also but i could omit that the sun and the wind were what i needed  i took the upper road in certain moods i preferred it to the path along the cliff i walked fast the exercise was soothing  to reach my favourite clearing i had to take to the fields on the left and strike down hill in the direction of the sea i hurried down the narrow path  i broke into the clearing at a jog trot and stood panting and at the same moment looking cool and beautiful in her white dress phyllis entered in from the other side phylliswithout the professor    chapter xvii  of a sentimental nature  she was wearing a panama and she carried a sketchingblock and campstool  good evening i said  good evening said she  it is curious how different the same words can sound when spoken by different people my good evening might have been that of a man with a particularly guilty conscience caught in the act of doing something more than usually ignoble she spoke like a rather offended angel  its a lovely evening i went on pluckily  very  the sunset  yes  er  she raised a pair of blue eyes devoid of all expression save a faint suggestion of surprise and gazed through me for a moment at some object a couple of thousand miles away and lowered them again leaving me with a vague feeling that there was something wrong with my personal appearance  very calmly she moved to the edge of the cliff arranged her campstool and sat down neither of us spoke a word i watched her while she filled a little mug with water from a little bottle opened her paintbox selected a brush and placed her sketchingblock in position  she began to paint  now by all the laws of good taste i should before this have made a dignified exit it was plain that i was not to be regarded as an essential ornament of this portion of the ware cliff by now if i had been the perfect gentleman i ought to have been a quarter of a mile away  but there is a definite limit to what a man can do i remained  the sinking sun flung a carpet of gold across the sea phyllis hair was tinged with it little waves tumbled lazily on the beach below except for the song of a distant blackbird running through its repertoire before retiring for the night everything was silent  she sat there dipping and painting and dipping again with never a word for mestanding patiently and humbly behind her  miss derrick i said  she half turned her head  yes  why wont you speak to me i said  i dont understand you  why wont you speak to me  i think you know mr garnet  it is because of that boat accident  accident  episode i amended  she went on painting in silence from where i stood i could see her profile her chin was tilted her expression was determined  is it i said  need we discuss it  not if you do not wish it  i paused  but i added i should have liked a chance to defend myself what glorious sunsets there have been these last few days i believe we shall have this sort of weather for another month  i should not have thought that possible  the glass is going up i said  i was not talking about the weather  it was dull of me to introduce such a wornout topic  you said you could defend yourself  i said i should like the chance to do so  you have it  thats very kind of you thank you  is there any reason for gratitude  every reason  go on mr garnet i can listen while i paint but please sit down i dont like being talked to from a height  i sat down on the grass in front of her feeling as i did so that the change of position in a manner clipped my wings it is difficult to speak movingly while sitting on the ground instinctively i avoided eloquence standing up i might have been pathetic and pleading sitting down i was compelled to be matteroffact  you remember of course the night you and professor derrick dined with us when i say dined i use the word in a loose sense  for a moment i thought she was going to smile we were both thinking of edwin but it was only for a moment and then her face grew cold once more and the chin resumed its angle of determination  yes she said  you remember the unfortunate ending of the festivities  well  if you recall that at all clearly you will also remember that the fault was not mine but ukridges  well  it was his behaviour that annoyed professor derrick the position then was this that i was to be cut off from the pleasantest friendship i had ever formed  i stopped for a moment she bent a little lower over her easel but remained silent  simply through the tactlessness of a prize idiot  i like mr ukridge  i like him too but i cant pretend that he is anything but an idiot at times  well  i naturally wished to mend matters it occurred to me that an excellent way would be by doing your father a service it was seeing him fishing that put the idea of a boataccident into my head i hoped for a genuine boataccident but those things only happen when one does not want them so i determined to engineer one  you didnt think of the shock to my father  i did it worried me very much  but you upset him all the same  reluctantly  she looked up and our eyes met i could detect no trace of forgiveness in hers  you behaved abominably she said  i played a risky game and i lost and i shall now take the consequences with luck i should have won i did not have luck and i am not going to grumble about it but i am grateful to you for letting me explain i should not have liked you to have gone on thinking that i played practical jokes on my friends that is all i have to say i think it was kind of you to listen goodbye miss derrick  i got up  are you going  why not  please sit down again  but you wish to be alone  please sit down  there was a flush on the cheek turned towards me and the chin was tilted higher  i sat down  to westward the sky had changed to the hue of a bruised cherry the sun had sunk below the horizon and the sea looked cold and leaden the blackbird had long since flown  i am glad you told me mr garnet  she dipped her brush in the water  because i dont like to think badly ofpeople  she bent her head over her painting  though i still think you behaved very wrongly and i am afraid my father will never forgive you for what you did  her father as if he counted  but you do i said eagerly  i think you are less to blame than i thought you were at first  no more than that  you cant expect to escape all consequences you did a very stupid thing  i was tempted  the sky was a dull grey now it was growing dusk the grass on which i sat was wet with dew  i stood up  isnt it getting a little dark for painting i said are you sure you wont catch cold its very damp  perhaps it is and it is late too  she shut her paintbox and emptied the little mug on to the grass  may i carry your things i said  i think she hesitated but only for a moment  i possessed myself of the campstool and we started on our homeward journey  we were both silent the spell of the quiet summer evening was on us  and all the air a solemn stillness holds she said softly i love this cliff mr garnet its the most soothing place in the world  i found it so this evening  she glanced at me quickly  youre not looking well she said are you sure you are not overworking yourself  no its not that  somehow we had stopped as if by agreement and were facing each other there was a look in her eyes i had never seen there before the twilight hung like a curtain between us and the world we were alone together in a world of our own  it is because i had offended you i said  she laughed a high unnatural laugh  i have loved you ever since i first saw you i said doggedly    chapter xviii  ukridge gives me advice  hours afteror so it seemed to mewe reached the spot at which our ways divided we stopped and i felt as if i had been suddenly cast back into the workaday world from some distant and pleasanter planet i think phyllis must have felt much the same sensation for we both became on the instant intensely practical and businesslike  but about your father i said  thats the difficulty  he wont give us his consent  im afraid he wouldnt dream of it  you cant persuade him  i can in most things but not in this you see even if nothing had happened he wouldnt like to lose me just yet because of norah  norah  my sister shes going to be married in october i wonder if we shall ever be as happy as they will  happy they will be miserable compared with us not that i know who the man is  why tom of course do you mean to say you really didnt know  tom tom chase  of course  i gasped  well im hanged i said when i think of the torments ive been through because of that wretched man and all for nothing i dont know what to say  dont you like tom  very much i always did but i was awfully jealous of him  you werent how silly of you  of course i was he was always about with you and called you phyllis and generally behaved as if you and he were the heroine and hero of a musical comedy so what else could i think i heard you singing duets after dinner once i drew the worst conclusions  when was that what were you doing there  it was shortly after ukridge had got on your fathers nerves and nipped our acquaintance in the bud i used to come every night to the hedge opposite your drawingroom window and brood there by the hour  poor old boy  hoping to hear you sing and when you did sing and he joined in all flat i used to swear youll probably find most of the bark scorched off the tree i leaned against  poor old man still its all over now isnt it  and when i was doing my very best to show off before you at tennis you went away just as i got into form  im very sorry but i couldnt know could i i though you always played like that  i know i knew you would it nearly turned my hair white i didnt see how a girl could ever care for a man who was so bad at tennis  one doesnt love a man because hes good at tennis  what does a girl see to love in a man i inquired abruptly and paused on the verge of a great discovery  oh i dont know she replied most unsatisfactorily  and i could draw no views from her  but about father said she what are we to do  he objects to me  hes perfectly furious with you  blow blow i said thou winter wind thou are not so unkind  hell never forgive you  as mans ingratitude i saved his life at the risk of my own why i believe ive got a legal claim on him who ever heard of a man having his life saved and not being delighted when his preserver wanted to marry his daughter your father is striking at the very root of the shortstory writers little earnings he mustnt be allowed to do it  jerry  i started  again i said  what  say it again do please now  very well jerry  it was the first time you had called me by my christian name i dont suppose youve the remotest notion how splendid it sounds when you say it there is something poetical almost holy about it  jerry please  say on  do be sensible dont you see how serious this is we must think how we can make father consent  all right i said well tackle the point im sorry to be frivolous but im so happy i cant keep it all in ive got you and i cant think of anything else  try  ill pull myself together now say on once more  we cant marry without his consent  why not i said not having a marked respect for the professors whims gretna green is out of date but there are registrars  i hate the very idea of a registrar she said with decision besides  well  poor father would never get over it weve always been such friends if i married against his wishes he wouldoh you know not let me near him again and not write to me and he would hate it all the time he was doing it he would be bored to death without me  who wouldnt i said  because you see norah has never been quite the same she has spent such a lot of her time on visits to people that she and father dont understand each other so well as he and i do she would try and be nice to him but she wouldnt know him as i do and besides she will be with him such a little now shes going to be married  but look here i said this is absurd you say your father would never see you again and so on if you married me why its nonsense it isnt as if i were a sort of social outcast we were the best of friends till that man hawk gave me away like that  i know but hes very obstinate about some things you see he thinks the whole thing has made him look ridiculous and it will take him a long time to forgive you for that  i realised the truth of this one can pardon any injury to oneself unless it hurts ones vanity moreover even in a genuine case of rescue the rescued man must always feel a little aggrieved with his rescuer when he thinks the matter over in cold blood he must regard him unconsciously as the super regards the actormanager indebted to him for the means of supporting existence but grudging him the limelight and the centre of the stage and the applause besides every one instinctively dislikes being under an obligation which they can never wholly repay and when a man discovers that he has experienced all these mixed sensations for nothing as the professor had done his wrath is likely to be no slight thing  taking everything into consideration i could not but feel that it would require more than a little persuasion to make the professor bestow his blessing with that genial warmth which we like to see in our fathersinlaws elect  you dont think i said that time the great healer and so on he wont feel kindlier disposed towards mesay in a months time  of course he might said phyllis but she spoke doubtfully  he strikes me from what i have seen of him as a man of moods i might do something one of these days which would completely alter his views we will hope for the best  about telling father  need we do you think i said  yes we must i couldnt bear to think that i was keeping it from him i dont think ive ever kept anything from him in my life nothing bad i mean  you count this among your darker crimes then  i was looking at it from fathers point of view he will be awfully angry i dont know how i shall begin telling him  good heavens i cried you surely dont think im going to let you do that keep safely out of the way while you tell him not much im coming back with you now and well break the bad news together  no not tonight he may be tired and rather cross we had better wait till tomorrow you might speak to him in the morning  where shall i find him  he is certain to go to the beach before breakfast for a swim  good ill be there         ukridge i said when i got back i want your advice  it stirred him like a trumpet blast i suppose when a man is in the habit of giving unsolicited counsel to everyone he meets it is as invigorating as an electric shock to him to be asked for it spontaneously  bring it out laddie he replied cordially im with you here come along into the garden and state your case  this suited me it is always easier to talk intimately in the dark and i did not wish to be interrupted by the sudden entrance of the hired man or mrs beale of which there was always a danger indoors we walked down to the paddock ukridge lit a cigar  ukridge i said im engaged  what a huge hand whistled through the darkness and smote me heavily between the shoulderblades by jove old boy i wish you luck pon my sam i do best thing in the world for you bachelors are mere excrescences never knew what happiness was till i married whens the wedding to be  thats where i want your advice what you might call a difficulty has arisen about the wedding its like this im engaged to phyllis derrick  derrick derrick  you cant have forgotten her good lord what eyes some men have why if id only seen her once i should have remembered her all my life  i know now rather a pretty girl with blue eyes  i stared at him blankly it was not much good as he could not see my face but it relieved me rather a pretty girl what a description  of course yes continued ukridge she came to dinner here one night with her father that fat little buffer  as you were careful to call him to his face at the time confound you it was that that started all the trouble  trouble what trouble  why her father  by jove i remember now so worried lately old boy that my memorys gone groggy of course her father fell into the sea and you fished him out why damme its like the stories you read  its also very like the stories i used to write but they had one point about them which this story hasnt they invariably ended happily with the father joining the heros and heroines hands and giving his blessing unfortunately in the present case that doesnt seem likely to happen  the old man wont give his consent  im afraid not i havent asked him yet but the chances are against it  but why whats the matter with you youre an excellent chap sound in wind and limb and didnt you once tell me that if you married you came into a pretty sizeable bit of money  yes i do that part of it is all right  ukridges voice betrayed perplexity  i dont understand this thing old horse he said i should have thought the old boy would have been all over you why damme i never heard of anything like it you saved his life you fished him out of the water  after chucking him in thats the trouble  you chucked him in  by proxy  i explained ukridge i regret to say laughed in a way that must have been heard miles away in distant villages in devonshire  you devil he bellowed pon my sam old horse to look at you one would never have thought youd have had it in you  i cant help looking respectable  what are you going to do about it  thats where i wanted your advice youre a man of resource what would you do in my place  ukridge tapped me impressively on the shoulder  laddie he said theres one thing thatll carry you through any mess  and that is  cheek my boy cheek gall nerve why take my case i never told you how i came to marry did i i thought not well it was this way itll do you a bit of good perhaps to hear the story for mark you blessings werent going cheap in my case either you know millies aunt elizabeth the female who wrote that letter well when i tell you that she was millies nearest relative and that it was her consent i had to snaffle youll see that i was faced with a bit of a problem  lets have it i said  well the first time i ever saw millie was in a firstclass carriage on the underground id got a thirdclass ticket by the way the carriage was full and i got up and gave her my seat and as i hung suspended over her by a strap damme i fell in love with her then and there youve no conception laddie how indescribably ripping she looked in a sort of blue dress with a bit of red in it and a hat with thingummies well we both got out at south kensington by that time i was gasping for air and saw that the thing wanted looking into id never had much time to bother about women but i realised that this must not be missed i was in love old horse it comes over you quite suddenly like a tidal wave  i know i know good heavens you cant tell me anything about that  well i followed her she went to a house in thurloe square i waited outside and thought it over i had got to get into that shanty and make her acquaintance if they threw me out on my ear so i rang the bell is lady lichenhall at home i asked you spot the devilish cunning of the ruse what my asking for a female with a title was to make em think i was one of the upper ten  how were you dressed i could not help asking  oh it was one of my frockcoat days id been to see a man about tutoring his son and by a merciful dispensation of providence there was a fellow living in the same boardinghouse with me who was about my build and had a frockcoat and he had lent it to me at least he hadnt exactly lent it to me but i knew where he kept it and he was out at the time there was nothing the matter with my appearance quite the young duke i assure you laddie down to the last button is lady lichenhall at home i asked no said the maid nobody of that name here this is lady lakenheaths house so you see i had a bit of luck at the start because the names were a bit alike well i got the maid to show me in somehow and once in you can bet i talked for all i was worth kept up a flow of conversation about being misdirected and coming to the wrong house went away and called a few days later gradually wormed my way in called regularly spied on their movements met em at every theatre they went to and bowed and finally got away with millie before her aunt knew what was happening or who i was or what i was doing or anything  and whats the moral  why go in like a mighty rushing wind bustle em dont give em a moments rest or time to think or anything why if id given millies aunt elizabeth time to think where should we have been not at combe regis together ill bet you heard that letter and know what she thinks of me now on reflection if id gone slow and played a timid waitinggame shed have thought that before i married millie instead of afterwards i give you my honest word laddie that there was a time towards the middle of our acquaintanceafter she had stopped mixing me up with the man who came to wind the clockswhen that woman ate out of my hand twiceon two separate occasionsshe actually asked my advice about feeding her toy pomeranian well that shows you bustle em laddie bustle em  ukridge i said you inspire me you would inspire a caterpillar i will go to the professori was going anyhow but now i shall go aggressively i will prise a fathers blessing out of him if i have to do it with a crowbar  thats the way to talk old horse dont beat about the bush tell him exactly what you want and stand no nonsense if you dont see what you want in the window ask for it where did you think of tackling him  phyllis tells me that he always goes for a swim before breakfast i thought of going down tomorrow and waylaying him  you couldnt do better by jove said ukridge suddenly ill tell you what ill do laddie i wouldnt do it for everybody but i look on you as a favourite son ill come with you and help break the ice  what  dont you be under any delusion old horse said ukridge paternally you havent got an easy job in front of you and what youll need more than anything else when you really get down to brasstacks is a wise kindly man of the world at your elbow to whoop you on when your nerve fails you and generally stand in your corner and see that you get a fair show  but its rather an intimate business  never mind take my tip and have me at your side i can say things about you that you would be too modest to say for yourself i can plead your case laddie i can point out in detail all that the old boy will be missing if he gives you the missinbaulk well thats settled then about eight tomorrow morning what ill be there my boy a swim will do me good    chapter xix  asking papa  reviewing the matter later i could see that i made one or two blunders in my conduct of the campaign to win over professor derrick in the first place i made a bad choice of time and place at the moment this did not strike me it is a simple matter i reflected for a man to pass another by haughtily and without recognition when they meet on dry land but when the said man being it should be remembered an indifferent swimmer is accosted in the water and out of his depth the feat becomes a hard one it seemed to me that i should have a better chance with the professor in the water than out of it  my second mistakeand this was brought home to me almost immediatelywas in bringing ukridge along not that i really brought him along it was rather a case of being unable to shake him off when he met me on the gravel outside the house at a quarter to eight on the following morning clad in a dingy mackintosh which swinging open revealed a purple bathingsuit i confess that my heart sank unfortunately all my efforts to dissuade him from accompanying me were attributed by him to a pardonable nervousnessor as he put it to the needle  buck up laddie he roared encouragingly i had anticipated this something seemed to tell me that your nerve would go when it came to the point youre deuced lucky old horse to have a man like me at your side why if you were alone you wouldnt have a word to say for yourself youd just gape at the man and yammer but im with you laddie im with you if your flow of conversation dries up count on me to keep the thing going  and so it came about that having reached the cob and spying in the distance the grey head of the professor bobbing about on the face of the waters we dived in and swam rapidly towards him  his face was turned in the opposite direction when we came up with him he was floating peacefully on his back and it was plain that he had not observed our approach for when treading water easily in his rear i wished him good morning in my most conciliatory tone he stood not upon the order of his sinking but went under like so much pigiron  i waited courteously until he rose to the surface again when i repeated my remark  he expelled the last remnant of water from his mouth with a wrathful splutter and cleared his eyes with the back of his hand i confess to a slight feeling of apprehension as i met his gaze nor was my uneasiness diminished by the spectacle of ukridge splashing tactfully in the background like a large seal ukridge so far had made no remarks he had dived in very flat and i imagine that his breath had not yet returned to him he had the air of one who intends to get used to his surroundings before trusting himself to speech  the water is delightfully warm i said  oh its you said the professor and i could not cheat myself into the belief that he spoke cordially ukridge snorted loudly in the offing the professor turned sharply as if anxious to observe this marine phenomenon and the annoyed gurgle which he gave showed that he was not approving of ukridge either i did not approve of ukridge myself i wished he had not come ukridge in the water lacks dignity i felt that he prejudiced my case  you are swimming splendidly this morning i went on perseveringly feeling that an ounce of flattery is worth a pound of rhetoric if i added you will allow me to say so  i will not he snapped i here a small wave noticing that his mouth was open stepped in i wish he resumed warmly as i said in me letter to have nothing to do with you i consider that yeve behaved in a manner that can only be described as abominable and i will thank you to leave me alone  but allow me  i will not allow ye sir i will allow ye nothing is it not enough to make me the laughingstock the butt sir of this town without pursuing me in this way when i wish to enjoy a quiet swim  now laddie laddie said ukridge placing a large hand on his shoulder these are harsh words be reasonable think before you speak you little know   go to the devil said the professor i wish to have nothing to do with either of you i should be glad if you would cease this persecution persecution sir  his remarks which i have placed on paper as if they were continuous and uninterrupted were punctuated in reality by a series of gasps and puffings as he received and rejected the successors of the wave he had swallowed at the beginning of our little chat the art of conducting conversation while in the water is not given to every swimmer this he seemed to realise for as if to close the interview he proceeded to make his way as quickly as he could to the shore unfortunately his first dash brought him squarely up against ukridge who not having expected the collision clutched wildly at him and took him below the surface again they came up a moment later on the worst terms  are you trying to drown me sir barked the professor  my dear old horse said ukridge complainingly its a little hard you might look where youre going  you grappled with me  you took me by surprise laddie rid yourself of the impression that youre playing waterpolo  but professor i said joining the group and treading water one moment  i was growing annoyed with the man i could have ducked him but for the reflection that my prospects of obtaining his consent to my engagement would scarcely have been enhanced thereby  but professor i said one moment  go away sir i have nothing to say to you  but he has lots to say to you said ukridge nows the time old horse he added encouragingly to me spill the news  without preamble i gave out the text of my address  i love your daughter phyllis mr derrick she loves me in fact we are engaged  devilish well put laddie said ukridge approvingly  the professor went under as if he had been seized with cramp it was a little trying having to argue with a man of whom one could not predict with certainty that at any given moment he would not be under water it tended to spoil the flow of ones eloquence the best of arguments is useless if the listener suddenly disappears in the middle of it  stick to it old horse said ukridge i think youre going to bring it off  i stuck to it  mr derrick i said as his head emerged you are naturally surprised  you would be said ukridge we dont blame you he added handsomely  youyouyou so far from cooling the professor liberal doses of water seemed to make him more heated you impudent scoundrel  my reply was more gentlemanly more courteous on a higher plane altogether  i said winningly cannot we let bygones be bygones  from his remarks i gathered that we could not i continued i was under the unfortunate necessity of having to condense my speech i was not able to let myself go as i could have wished for time was an important consideration ere long swallowing water at his present rate the professor must inevitably become waterlogged  i have loved your daughter i said rapidly ever since i first saw her   and hes a capital chap interjected ukridge one of the best known him for years youll like him  i learned last night that she loved me but she will not marry me without your consent stretch your arms out straight from the shoulders and fill your lungs well and you cant sink so i have come this morning to ask for your consent  give it advised ukridge couldnt do better a very sound fellow pots of money too at least he will have when he marries  i know we have not been on the best of terms lately for heavens sake dont try to talk or youll sink the fault i said generously was mine   well put said ukridge  but when you have heard my explanation i am sure you will forgive me there i told you so  he reappeared some few feet to the left i swam up and resumed  when you left us so abruptly after our little dinnerparty  come again some night said ukridge cordially any time youre passing  you put me in a very awkward position i was desperately in love with your daughter and as long as you were in the frame of mind in which you left i could not hope to find an opportunity of revealing my feelings to her  revealing feelings is good said ukridge approvingly neat  you see what a fix i was in dont you keep your arms well out i thought for hours and hours to try and find some means of bringing about a reconciliation you wouldnt believe how hard i thought  got as thin as a corkscrew said ukridge  at last seeing you fishing one morning when i was on the cob it struck me all of a sudden   you know how it is said ukridge  all of a sudden that the very best way would be to arrange a little boating accident i was confident that i could rescue you all right  here i paused and he seized the opportunity to curse mebriefly with a wary eye on an incoming wavelet  if it hadnt been for the inscrutable workings of providence which has a mania for upsetting everything all would have been well in fact all was well till you found out  always the way said ukridge sadly always the way  you young blackguard  he managed to slip past me and made for the shore  look at the thing from the standpoint of a philosopher old horse urged ukridge splashing after him the fact that the rescue was arranged oughtnt to matter i mean to say you didnt know it at the time so relatively it was not and you were genuinely saved from a watery grave and all that sort of thing  i had not imagined ukridge capable of such an excursion into metaphysics i saw the truth of his line of argument so clearly that it seemed to me impossible for anyone else to get confused over it i had certainly pulled the professor out of the water and the fact that i had first caused him to be pushed in had nothing to do with the case either a man is a gallant rescuer or he is not a gallant rescuer there is no middle course i had saved his lifefor he would certainly have drowned if left to himselfand i was entitled to his gratitude that was all there was to be said about it  these things both ukridge and i tried to make plain as we swam along but whether it was that the salt water he had swallowed had dulled the professors normally keen intelligence or that our power of stating a case was too weak the fact remains that he reached the beach an unconvinced man  then may i consider i said that your objections are removed i have your consent  he stamped angrily and his bare foot came down on a small sharp pebble with a brief exclamation he seized his foot in one hand and hopped up the beach while hopping he delivered his ultimatum probably the only instance on record of a father adopting this attitude in dismissing a suitor  you may not he cried you may consider no such thing my objections were never more absolute you detain me in the water sir till i am blue sir blue with cold in order to listen to the most preposterous and impudent nonsense i ever heard  this was unjust if he had listened attentively from the first and avoided interruptions and had not behaved like a submarine we should have got through the business in half the time  i said so  dont talk to me sir he replied hobbling off to his dressingtent i will not listen to you i will have nothing to do with you i consider you impudent sir  i assure you it was unintentional  isch he saidbeing the first occasion and the last on which i have ever heard that remarkable monosyllable proceed from the mouth of a man and he vanished into his tent  laddie said ukridge solemnly do you know what i think  well  you havent clicked old horse said ukridge    chapter xx  scientific golf  people are continually writing to the papersor it may be one solitary enthusiast who writes under a number of pseudonymson the subject of sport and the overdoing of the same by the modern young man i recall one letter in which efficiency gave it as his opinion that if the young man played less golf and did more drill he would be all the better for it i propose to report my doings with the professor on the links at some length in order to refute this absurd view everybody ought to play golf and nobody can begin it too soon there ought not to be a single ablebodied infant in the british isles who has not foozled a drive to take my case suppose i had employed in drilling the hours i had spent in learning to handle my clubs i might have drilled before the professor by the week without softening his heart i might have ported arms and grounded arms and presented arms and generally behaved in the manner advocated by efficiency and what would have been the result indifference on his part orand if i overdid the thingirritation whereas by devoting a reasonable portion of my youth to learning the intricacies of golf i was enabled  it happened in this way  to me as i stood with ukridge in the fowlrun in the morning following my maritime conversation with the professor regarding a hen that had posed before us obviously with a view to inspection there appeared a man carrying an envelope ukridge who by this time saw as calverley almost said under every hat a dun and imagined that no envelope could contain anything but a small account softly and silently vanished away leaving me to interview the enemy  mr garnet sir said the foe  i recognised him he was professor derricks gardener  i opened the envelope no fathers blessings were absent the letter was in the third person professor derrick begged to inform mr garnet that by defeating mr saul potter he had qualified for the final round of the combe regis golf tournament in which he understood mr garnet was to be his opponent if it would be convenient for mr garnet to play off the match on the present afternoon professor derrick would be obliged if he would be at the club house at halfpast two if this hour and day were unsuitable would he kindly arrange others the bearer would wait  the bearer did wait he waited for halfanhour as i found it impossible to shift him not caring to use violence on a man well stricken in years without first plying him with drink he absorbed more of our diminishing cask of beer than we could conveniently spare and then trudged off with a note beautifully written in the third person in which mr garnet after numerous compliments and thanks begged to inform professor derrick that he would be at the club house at the hour mentioned  and i addedto myself not in the notei will give him such a licking that hell brain himself with a cleek  for i was not pleased with the professor i was conscious of a malicious joy at the prospect of snatching the prize from him i knew he had set his heart on winning the tournament this year to be runnerup two years in succession stimulates the desire for first place it would be doubly bitter to him to be beaten by a newcomer after the absence of his rival the colonel had awakened hope in him and i knew i could do it even allowing for bad luckand i am never a very unlucky golferi could rely almost with certainty on crushing the man  and ill do it i said to bob who had trotted up i often make bob the recipient of my confidences he listens appreciatively and never interrupts and he never has grievances of his own if there is one person i dislike it is the man who tries to air his grievances when i wish to air mine  bob i said running his tail through my fingers listen to me my old university chum for i have matured a dark scheme dont run away you know you dont really want to go and look at that chicken listen to me if i am in form this afternoon and i feel in my bones that i shall be i shall nurse the professor i shall play with him do you understand the principles of match play at golf robert you score by holes not strokes there are eighteen holes all right how was i to know that you knew that without my telling you well if you understand so much about the game you will appreciate my dark scheme i shall toy with the professor bob i shall let him get ahead and then catch him up i shall go ahead myself and let him catch me up i shall race him neck and neck till the very end then when his hair has turned white with the strain and hes lost a couple of stone in weight and his eyes are starting out of his head and hes prayingif he ever does prayto the gods of golf that he may be allowed to win i shall go ahead and beat him by a hole ill teach him robert he shall taste of my despair and learn by proof in some wild hour how much the wretched dare and when its all over and hes torn all his hair out and smashed all his clubs i shall go and commit suicide off the cob because you see if i cant marry phyllis i shant have any use for life  bob wagged his tail cheerfully  i mean it i said rolling him on his back and punching him on the chest till his breathing became stertorous you dont see the sense of it i know but then youve got none of the finer feelings youre a jolly good dog robert but youre a rank materialist bones and cheese and potatoes with gravy over them make you happy you dont know what it is to be in love youd better get right side up now or youll have apoplexy  it has been my aim in the course of this narrative to extenuate nothing nor set down aught in malice like the gentleman who played euchre with the heathen chinee i state but facts i do not therefore slur over my scheme for disturbing the professors peace of mind i am not always good and noble i am the hero of this story but i have my off moments  i felt ruthless towards the professor i cannot plead ignorance of the golfers point of view as an excuse for my plottings i knew that to one whose soul is in the game as the professors was the agony of being just beaten in an important match exceeds in bitterness all other agonies i knew that if i scraped through by the smallest possible margin his appetite would be destroyed his sleep o nights broken he would wake from fitful slumber moaning that if he had only used his iron instead of his mashie at the tenth all would have been well that if he had putted more carefully on the seventh green life would not be drear and blank that a more judicious manipulation of his brassey throughout might have given him something to live for all these things i knew  and they did not touch me i was adamant the professor was waiting for me at the club house and greeted me with a cold and stately inclination of the head  beautiful day for golf i observed in my gay chatty manner he bowed in silence  very well i thought wait just wait  miss derrick is well i hope i added aloud  that drew him he started his aspect became doubly forbidding  miss derrick is perfectly well sir i thank you  and you no bad effect i hope from your dip yesterday  mr garnet i came here for golf not conversation he said  we made it so i drove off from the first tee it was a splendid drive i should not say so if there were any one else to say so for me modesty would forbid but as there is no one i must repeat the statement it was one of the best drives of my experience the ball flashed through the air took the bunker with a dozen feet to spare and rolled on to the green i had felt all along that i should be in form unless my opponent was equally above himself he was a lost man i could toy with him  the excellence of my drive had not been without its effect on the professor i could see that he was not confident he addressed his ball more strangely and at greater length than any one i had ever seen he waggled his club over it as if he were going to perform a conjuring trick then he struck and topped it  the ball rolled two yards  he looked at it in silence then he looked at mealso in silence  i was gazing seawards  when i looked round he was getting to work with a brassey  this time he hit the bunker and rolled back he repeated this manoeuvre twice  hard luck i murmured sympathetically on the third occasion thereby going as near to being slain with a niblick as it has ever been my lot to go your true golfer is easily roused in times of misfortune and there was a red gleam in the eye of the professor turned to me  i shall pick my ball up he growled  we walked on in silence to the second tee he did the second hole in four which was good i did it in three whichunfortunately for himywas better  i won the third hole  i won the fourth hole  i won the fifth hole  i glanced at my opponent out of the corner of my eyes the man was suffering beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead  his play had become wilder and wilder at each hole in arithmetical progression if he had been a plough he could hardly have turned up more soil the imagination recoiled from the thought of what he could be doing in another halfhour if he deteriorated at his present speed  a feeling of calm and content stole over me i was not sorry for him all the viciousness of my nature was uppermost in me once when he missed the ball clean at the fifth tee his eye met mine and we stood staring at each other for a full halfminute without moving i believe if i had smiled then he would have attacked me without hesitation there is a type of golfer who really almost ceases to be human under stress of the wild agony of a series of foozles  the sixth hole involves the player in a somewhat tricky piece of crosscountry work owing to the fact that there is a nasty ditch to be negotiated some fifty yards from the green it is a beast of a ditch which if you are out of luck just catches your second shot all hope abandon ye who enter here might be written on a notice board over it  the professor entered there the unhappy man sent his second as nice and clean a brassey shot as he had made all day into its very jaws and then madness seized him a merciful local rule framed by kindly men who have been in that ditch themselves enacts that in such a case the player may take his ball and throw it over his shoulder losing a stroke but once so the legend runs a scratch man who found himself trapped scorning to avail himself of this rule at the expense of its accompanying penalty wrought so shrewdly with his niblick that he not only got out but actually laid his ball dead and now optimists sometimes imitate his gallantry though no one yet has been able to imitate his success  the professor decided to take a chance and he failed miserably as i was on the green with my third and unless i putted extremely poorly was morally certain to be down in five which is bogey for the hole there was not much practical use in his continuing to struggle but he did in a spirit of pure vindictiveness as if he were trying to take it out of the ball it was a grisly sight to see him head and shoulders above the ditch hewing at his obstinate colonel it was a similar spectacle that once induced a lay spectator of a golf match to observe that he considered hockey a silly game  sixteen said the professor between his teeth then he picked up his ball  i won the seventh hole  i won the eighth hole  the ninth we halved for in the black depths of my soul i had formed a plan of fiendish subtlety i intended to allow him to winwith extreme laboureight holes in succession  then when hope was once more strong in him i would win the last and he would go mad  i watched him carefully as we trudged on emotions chased one another across his face when he won the tenth hole he merely refrained from oaths when he won the eleventh a sort of sullen pleasure showed in his face it was at the thirteenth that i detected the first dawning of hope from then onward it grew  when with a sequence of shocking shots he took the seventeenth hole in seven he was in a parlous condition his run of success had engendered within him a desire for conversation he wanted as it were to flap his wings and crow i could see dignity wrestling with talkativeness i gave him the lead  you have got your form now i said  talkativeness had it dignity retired hurt speech came from him in a rush when he brought off an excellent drive from the eighteenth tee he seemed to forget everything  me dear boyhe began and stopped abruptly in some confusion silence once more brooded over us as we played ourselves up the fairway and on to the green  he was on the green in four i reached it in three his sixth stroke took him out  i putted carefully to the very mouth of the hole  i walked up to my ball and paused i looked at the professor he looked at me  go on he said hoarsely  suddenly a wave of compassion flooded over me what right had i to torture the man like this  professor i said  go on he repeated  that looks a simple shot i said eyeing him steadily but i might miss it  he started  and then you would win the championship  he dabbed at his forehead with a wet ball of a handkerchief  it would be very pleasant for you after getting so near it the last two years  go on he said for the third time but there was a note of hesitation in his voice  sudden joy i said would almost certainly make me miss it  we looked at each other he had the golf fever in his eyes  if i said slowly lifting my putter you were to give your consent to my marriage with phyllis  he looked from me to the ball from the ball to me and back to the ball it was very very near the hole  why not i said  he looked up and burst into a roar of laughter  you young devil said he smiting his thigh you young devil youve beaten me  on the contrary i said you have beaten me         i left the professor at the club house and raced back to the farm i wanted to pour my joys into a sympathetic ear ukridge i knew would offer that same sympathetic ear a good fellow ukridge always interested in what you had to tell him never bored  ukridge i shouted  no answer  i flung open the diningroom door nobody  i went into the drawingroom it was empty i drew the garden and his bedroom he was not in either  he must have gone for a stroll i said  i rang the bell  the hired retainer appeared calm and imperturbable as ever  sir  oh where is mr ukridge beale  mr ukridge sir said the hired retainer nonchalantly has gone  gone  yes sir mr ukridge and mrs ukridge went away together by the three oclock train    chapter xxi  the calm before the storm  beale i said are you drunk  wish i was sir said the hired man  then what on earth do you mean gone where have they gone to  dont know sir london i expect  london why  dont know sir  when did they go oh you told me that didnt they say why they were going  no sir  didnt you ask when you saw them packing up and going to the station didnt you do anything  no sir  why on earth not  i didnt see them sir i only found out as theyd gone after theyd been and went sir walking down by the net and mackerel met one of them coastguards oh says he so youre moving whos amoving i says to him well he says to me i seen your mr ukridge and his missus get into the three oclock train for axminster i thought as you was all amoving ho i says ho wondering and i goes on when i gets back i asks the missus did she see them packing their boxes and she says no she says they didnt pack no boxes as she knowed of and blowed if they had mr garnet sir  what they didnt pack  no sir  we looked at one another  beale i said  sir  do you know what i think  yes sir  theyve bolted  so i says to the missus sir it struck me right off in a manner of speaking  this is awful i said  yes sir  his face betrayed no emotion but he was one of those men whose expression never varies its a way they have in the army  this wants thinking out beale i said  yes sir  youd better ask mrs beale to give me some dinner and then ill think it over  yes sir  i was in an unpleasant position ukridge by his defection had left me in charge of the farm i could dissolve the concern i supposed if i wished and return to london but i particularly desired to remain in combe regis to complete the victory i had won on the links it was necessary for me to continue as i had begun i was in the position of a general who has conquered a hostile country and is obliged to soothe the feelings of the conquered people before his labours can be considered at an end i had rushed the professor it must now be my aim to keep him from regretting that he had been rushed i must therefore stick to my post with the tenacity of an ablebodied leech there would be trouble of that i was certain as soon as the news got about that ukridge had gone the deluge would begin his creditors would abandon their passive tactics and take active steps there was a chance that aggressive measures would be confined to the enemy at our gates the tradesmen of combe regis but the probability was that the news would spread and the injured merchants of dorchester and axminster rush to the scene of hostilities  i summoned beale after dinner and held a council of war it was no time for airy persiflage i said beale were in the cart  sir  mr ukridge going away like this has left me in a most unpleasant position i would like to talk it over with you i daresay you know that wethat mr ukridge owes a considerable amount of money round about here to tradesmen  yes sir  well when they find out that he haser  shot the moon sir suggested the hired retainer helpfully  gone up to town i amended when they find out that he has gone up to town they are likely to come bothering us a good deal  yes sir  i fancy that we shall have them all round here tomorrow news of this sort always spreads quickly the point is then what are we to do  he propounded no scheme but stood in an easy attitude of attention waiting for me to continue  i continued  lets see exactly how we stand i said my point is that i particularly wish to go on living down here for at least another fortnight of course my position is simple i am mr ukridges guest i shall go on living as i have been doing up to the present he asked me down here to help him look after the fowls so i shall go on looking after them complications set in when we come to consider you and mrs beale i suppose you wont care to stop on after this  the hired retainer scratched his chin and glanced out of the window the moon was up and the garden looked cool and mysterious in the dim light  its a pretty place mr garnet sir he said  it is i said but about other considerations theres the matter of wages are yours in arrears  yes sir a month  and mrs beales the same i suppose  yes sir a month  hm well it seems to me beale you cant lose anything by stopping on  i cant be paid any less than i have bin sir he agreed  exactly and as you say its a pretty place you might just as well stop on and help me in the fowlrun what do you think  very well sir  and mrs beale will do the same  yes sir  thats excellent youre a hero beale i shant forget you theres a cheque coming to me from a magazine in another week for a short story when it arrives ill look into that matter of back wages tell mrs beale im much obliged to her will you  yes sir  having concluded that delicate business i lit my pipe and strolled out into the garden with bob i cursed ukridge as i walked it was abominable of him to desert me in this way even if i had not been his friend it would have been bad the fact that we had known each other for years made it doubly discreditable he might at least have warned me and given me the option of leaving the sinking ship with him  but i reflected i ought not to be surprised his whole career as long as i had known him had been dotted with little eccentricities of a type which an unfeeling world generally stigmatises as shady they were small things it was true but they ought to have warned me we are most of us wise after the event when the wind has blown we can generally discover a multitude of straws which should have shown us which way it was blowing  once i remembered in our schoolmaster days when guineas though regular were few he had had occasion to increase his wardrobe if i recollect rightly he thought he had a chance of a good position in the tutoring line and only needed good clothes to make it his he took four pounds of his salary in advancehe was in the habit of doing this he never had any salary left by the end of term it having vanished in advance loans beforehand with this he was to buy two suits a hat new boots and collars when it came to making the purchases he found what he had overlooked previously in his optimistic way that four pounds did not go very far at the time i remember i thought his method of grappling with the situation humorous he bought a hat for threeandsixpence and got the suits and the boots on the instalment system paying a small sum in advance as earnest of more to come he then pawned one suit to pay for the first few instalments and finally departed to be known no more his address he had givenwith a false nameat an empty house and when the tailor arrived with his minions of the law all he found was an annoyed caretaker and a pile of letters written by himself containing his bill in its various stages of evolution  or again there was a bicycle and photograph shop near the school he went into this one day and his roving eye fell on a tandem bicycle he did not want a tandem bicycle but that influenced him not at all he ordered it provisionally he also ordered an enlarging camera a kodak and a magic lantern the order was booked and the goods were to be delivered when he had made up his mind concerning them after a week the shopman sent round to ask if there were any further particulars which mr ukridge would like to learn before definitely ordering them mr ukridge sent back word that he was considering the matter and that in the meantime would he be so good as to let him have that little clockwork man in his window which walked when wound up having got this and not paid for it ukridge thought that he had done handsomely by the bicycle and photograph man and that things were square between them the latter met him a few days afterwards and expostulated plaintively ukridge explained my good man he said you know i really think we need say no more about the matter really youre come out of it very well now look here which would you rather be owed for a clockwork manwhich is broken and you can have it backor a tandem bicycle an enlarging camera a kodak and a magiclantern what his reasoning was too subtle for the uneducated mind the man retired puzzled and unpaid and ukridge kept the clockwork toy    chapter xxii  the storm breaks  rather to my surprise the next morning passed off uneventfully our knocker advertised no dun our lawn remained untrodden by hobnailed boots by lunchtime i had come to the conclusion that the expected trouble would not occur that day and i felt that i might well leave my post for the afternoon while i went to the professors to pay my respects the professor was out when i arrived phyllis was in and it was not till the evening that i started for the farm again  as i approached the sound of voices smote my ears  i stopped i could hear beale speaking then came the rich notes of vickers the butcher then beale again then dawlish the grocer then a chorus  the storm had burst and in my absence  i blushed for myself i was in command and i had deserted the fort in time of need what must the faithful hired man be thinking of me probably he placed me as he had placed ukridge in the ragged ranks of those who have shot the moon  fortunately having just come from the professors i was in the costume which of all my wardrobe was most calculated to impress to a casual observer i should probably suggest wealth and respectability i stopped for a moment to cool myself for as is my habit when pleased with life i had been walking fast then opened the gate and strode in trying to look as opulent as possible  it was an animated scene that met my eyes in the middle of the lawn stood the devoted beale a little more flushed than i had seen him hitherto parleying with a burly and excited young man without a coat grouped round the pair were some dozen men young middleaged and old all talking their hardest i could distinguish nothing of what they were saying i noticed that beales left cheekbone was a little discoloured and there was a hard dogged expression on his face he too was in his shirtsleeves  my entry created no sensation nobody apparently had heard the latch click and nobody had caught sight of me their eyes were fixed on the young man and beale i stood at the gate and watched them  there seemed to have been trouble already looking more closely i perceived sitting on the grass apart a second young man his face was obscured by a dirty pocket handkerchief with which he dabbed tenderly at his features every now and then the shirtsleeved young man flung his hand towards him with an indignant gesture talking hard the while it did not need a preternaturally keen observer to deduce what had happened beale must have fallen out with the young man who was sitting on the grass and smitten him and now his friend had taken up the quarrel  now this i said to myself is rather interesting here in this one farm we have the only three known methods of dealing with duns beale is evidently an exponent of the violent method ukridge is an apostle of evasion i shall try conciliation i wonder which of us will be the most successful  meanwhile not to spoil beales efforts by allowing him too little scope for experiment i refrained from making my presence known and continued to stand by the gate an interested spectator  things were evidently moving now the young mans gestures became more vigorous the dogged look on beales face deepened the comments of the ring increased in point and pungency  what did you hit him for then  the question was put always the same words and with the same air of quiet triumph at intervals of thirty seconds by a little man in a snuffcoloured suit with a purple tie nobody ever answered him or appeared to listen to him but he seemed each time to think that he had clinched the matter and cornered his opponent  other voices chimed in  you hit him charlie go on you hit him  well have the law  go on charlie  flushed with the favour of the manyheaded charlie now proceeded from threats to action his right fist swung round suddenly but beale was on the alert he ducked sharply and the next moment charlie was sitting on the ground beside his fallen friend a hush fell on the ring and the little man in the purple tie was left repeating his formula without support  i advanced it seemed to me that the time had come to be conciliatory charlie was struggling to his feet obviously anxious for a second round and beale was getting into position once more in another five minutes conciliation would be out of the question  whats all this i said  i may mention here that i do not propose to inflict dialect upon the reader if he had borne with my narrative thus far i look on him as a friend and feel that he deserves consideration i may not have brought out the fact with sufficient emphasis in the foregoing pages but nevertheless i protest that i have a conscience not so much as a thiccy shall he find  my advent caused a stir excited men left beale and rallied round me charlie rising to his feet found himself dethroned from his position of man of the moment and stood blinking at the setting sun and opening and shutting his mouth there was a buzz of conversation  dont all speak at once please i said i cant possibly follow what you say perhaps you will tell me what you want  i singled out a short stout man in grey he wore the largest whiskers ever seen on human face  its like this sir we all of us want to know where we are  i can tell you that i said youre on our lawn and i should be much obliged if you would stop digging your heels into it  this was not i suppose conciliation in the strictest and best sense of the word but the thing had to be said it is the duty of every good citizen to do his best to score off men with whiskers  you dont understand me sir he said excitedly when i said we didnt know where we were it was a manner of speaking we want to know how we stand  on your heels i replied gently as i pointed out before  i am brass sir of axminster my account with mr ukridge is ten pounds eight shillings and fourpence i want to know  the whole strength of the company now joined in  you know me mr garnet appleby in the high voice lost in the general roar  and eightpence  my account with mr uk  settle  i represent bodger   a diversion occurred at this point charlie who had long been eyeing beale sourly dashed at him with swinging fists and was knocked down again the whole trend of the meeting altered once more conciliation became a drug violence was what the public wanted beale had three fights in rapid succession i was helpless instinct prompted me to join the fray but prudence told me that such a course would be fatal  at last in a lull i managed to catch the hired retainer by the arm as he drew back from the prostrate form of his latest victim drop it beale i whispered hotly drop it we shall never manage these people if you knock them about go indoors and stay there while i talk to them  mr garnet sir said he the light of battle dying out of his eyes its ard its cruel ard i aint ad a turnup not to call a turnup since ive been a timeexpired man i aint hitting of em mr garnet sir not hard i aint that there first one of em he played me dirty hittin at me when i wasnt looking they cant say as i started it  thats all right beale i said soothingly i know it wasnt your fault and i know its hard on you to have to stop but i wish you would go indoors i must talk to these men and we shant have a moments peace while youre here cut along  very well sir but its ard maynt i ave just one go at that charlie mr garnet he asked wistfully  no no go in  and if they goes for you sir and tries to wipe the face off you  they wont they wont if they do ill shout for you  he went reluctantly into the house and i turned again to my audience  if you will kindly be quiet for a moment i said  i am appleby mr garnet in the high street mr ukridge  eighteen pounds fourteen shillings  kindly glance  i waved my hands wildly above my head  stop stop stop i shouted  the babble continued but diminished gradually in volume through the trees as i waited i caught a glimpse of the sea i wished i was out on the cob where beyond these voices there was peace my head was beginning to ache and i felt faint for want of food  gentlemen i cried as the noise died away  the latch of the gate clicked i looked up and saw a tall thin young man in a frock coat and silk hat enter the garden it was the first time i had seen the costume in the country  he approached me  mr ukridge sir he said  my name is garnet mr ukridge is away at the moment  i come from whiteleys mr garnet our mr blenkinsop having written on several occasions to mr ukridge calling his attention to the fact that his account has been allowed to mount to a considerable figure and having received no satisfactory reply desired me to visit him i am sorry that he is not at home  so am i i said with feeling  do you expect him to return shortly  no i said i do not  he was looking curiously at the expectant band of duns i forestalled his question  those are some of mr ukridges creditors i said i am just about to address them perhaps you will take a seat the grass is quite dry my remarks will embrace you as well as them  comprehension came into his eyes and the natural man in him peeped through the polish  great scott has he done a bunk he cried  to the best of my knowledge yes i said  he whistled  i turned again to the local talent  gentlemen i shouted  hear hear said some idiot  gentlemen i intend to be quite frank with you we must decide just how matters stand between us a voice wheres ukridge mr ukridge left for london suddenly bitter laughter yesterday afternoon personally i think he will come back very shortly  hoots of derision greeted this prophecy i resumed  i fail to see your object in coming here i have nothing for you i couldnt pay your bills if i wanted to  it began to be borne upon me that i was becoming unpopular  i am here simply as mr ukridges guest i proceeded after all why should i spare the man i have nothing whatever to do with his business affairs i refuse absolutely to be regarded as in any way indebted to you i am sorry for you you have my sympathy that is all i can give you sympathyand good advice  dissatisfaction i was getting myself disliked and i had meant to be so conciliatory to speak to these unfortunates words of cheer which should be as olive oil poured into a wound for i really did sympathise with them i considered that ukridge had used them disgracefully but i was irritated my head ached abominably  then am i to tell our mr blenkinsop asked the frockcoated one that the money is not and will not be forthcoming  when next you smoke a quiet cigar with your mr blenkinsop i replied courteously and find conversation flagging i rather think i should say something of the sort  we shall of course instruct our solicitors at once to institute legal proceedings against your mr ukridge  dont call him my mr ukridge you can do whatever you please  that is your last word on the subject  i hope so but i fear not  wheres our money demanded a discontented voice from the crowd  an idea struck me  beale i shouted  out came the hired retainer at the double i fancy he thought that his help was needed to save me from my friends  he slowed down seeing me as yet unassaulted  sir he said  isnt there a case of that whisky left somewhere beale  i had struck the right note there was a hush of pleased anticipation among the audience  yes sir one  then bring it out here and open it  beale looked pained  for them sir he ejaculated  yes hurry up  he hesitated then without a word went into the house a hearty cheer went up as he reappeared with the case i proceeded indoors in search of glasses and water  coming out i realised my folly in having left beale alone with our visitors even for a minute a brisk battle was raging between him and a man whom i did not remember to have seen before the frockcoated young man was looking on with pale fear stamped upon his face but the rest of the crowd were shouting advice and encouragement was being given to beale how i wondered had he pacified the mob  i soon discovered as i ran up as quickly as i could hampered as i was by the jugs and glasses beale knocked his man out with the clean precision of the experienced boxer and the crowd explained in chorus that it was the potboy from the net and mackerel like everything else the whisky had not been paid for and the potboy arriving just as the case was being opened had made a gallant effort to save it from being distributed free to his fellowcitizens by the time he came to the glasses were circulating merrily and on observing this he accepted the situation philosophically enough and took his turn and turn about with the others  everybody was now in excellent fettle the only malcontents were beale whose heart plainly bled at the waste of good scotch whisky and the frockcoated young man who was still pallid  i was just congratulating myself as i eyed the revellers on having achieved a masterstroke of strategy when that demon charlie his defeat i suppose still rankling made a suggestion from his point of view a timely and ingenious suggestion  we cant see the colour of our money he said pithily but we can have our own back  that settled it the battle was over the most skilful general must sometime recognise defeat i recognised it then and threw up my hand i could do nothing further with them i had done my best for the farm i could do no more  i lit my pipe and strolled into the paddock  chaos followed indoors and outofdoors they raged without check even beale gave the thing up he knocked charlie into a flowerbed and then disappeared in the direction of the kitchen  it was growing dusk from inside the house came faint sounds of bibulous mirth as the sacking party emptied the rooms of their contents in the fowlrun a hen was crooning sleepily in its coop it was a very soft liquid soothing sound  presently out came the invaders with their loot one with a picture another with a vase another bearing the gramophone upside down they were singing in many keys and times  then i heard somebodycharlie again it seemed to mepropose a raid on the fowlrun  the fowls had had their moments of unrest since they had been our property but what they had gone through with us was peace compared with what befell them then not even on the second evening of our visit when we had run unmeasured miles in pursuit of them had there been such confusion roused abruptly from their beautysleep they fled in all directions their pursuers roaring with laughter staggered after them they tumbled over one another the summer evening was made hideous with the noise of them  disgraceful sir is it not disgraceful said a voice in my ear  the young man from whiteleys stood beside me he did not look happy his forehead was damp somebody seemed to have stepped on his hat and his coat was smeared with mould  i was turning to answer him when from the dusk in the direction of the house came a sudden roar a passionate appeal to the world in general to tell the speaker what all this meant  there was only one man of my acquaintance with a voice like that  i walked without hurry towards him  good evening ukridge i said    chapter xxiii  after the storm  a yell of welcome drowned the tumult of the looters  is that you garny old horse whats up whats the matter has everyone gone mad who are those infernal scoundrels in the fowlrun what are they doing whats been happening  i have been entertaining a little meeting of your creditors i said and now they are entertaining themselves  but what did you let them do it for  what is one amongst so many  well pon my sam moaned ukridge as her sardonic calm laid aside that sinister hen which we called aunt elizabeth flashed past us pursued by the whiskered criminal its a little hard i cant go away for a day  you certainly cant youre right there you cant go away without a word  without a word what do you mean garny old boy pull yourself together youre overexcited do you mean to tell me you didnt get my note  what note  the one i left on the diningroom table  there was no note there  what  i was reminded of the scene that had taken place on the first day of our visit  feel in your pockets i said  why damme here it is he said in amazement  of course where did you expect it would be was it important  why it explained the whole thing  then i said i wish you would let me read it a note like that ought to be worth reading  it was telling you to sit tight and not worry about us going away  thats good about worrying youre a thoughtful chap ukridge  because we should be back immediately  and what sent you up to town  why we went to touch millies aunt elizabeth  oh i said a light shining on the darkness of my understanding  you remember aunt elizabeth the old girl who wrote that letter  i know she called you a gaby  and a guffin  yes i remember thinking her a shrewd and discriminating old lady with a great gift for character delineation so you went to touch her  thats it we had to have more money so i naturally thought of her aunt elizabeth isnt what you might call an admirer of mine  bless her for that  but shes very fond of millie and would do anything if shes allowed to chuck about a few hometruths before doing it so we went off together looked her up at her house stated our case and collected the stuff millie and i shared the work she did the asking while i inquired after the rheumatism she mentioned the figure that would clear us i patted the dog little beast got after me when i wasnt looking and chewed my ankle  thank heaven  in the end millie got the money and i got the hometruths  did she call you a gaby  twice and a guffin three times  your aunt elizabeth is beginning to fascinate me she seems just the sort of woman i would like well you got the money  rather and ill tell you another thing old horse i scored heavily at the end of the visit shed got to the quotingproverbs stage by that time ah my dear she said to millie marry in haste repent at leisure millie stood up to her like a little brick im afraid that proverb doesnt apply to me aunt elizabeth she said because i havent repented what do you think of that laddie  of course she hasnt had much leisure lately i agreed  ukridges jaw dropped slightly but he rallied swiftly  idiot that wasnt what she meant millies an angel  of course she is i said cordially shes a precious sight too good for you you old rotter you bear that fact steadily in mind and well make something of you yet  at this point mrs ukridge joined us she had been exploring the house and noting the damage done her eyes were open to their fullest extent  oh mr garnet couldnt you have stopped them  i felt a worm had i done as much as i might have done to stem the tide  im awfully sorry mrs ukridge i said humbly i really dont think i could have done much more we tried every method beale had seven fights and i made a speech on the lawn but it was all no good directly they had finished the whisky  ukridges cry was like that of a lost spirit  they didnt get hold of the whisky  they did it seemed to me that it would smooth things down a little if i served it out the mob had begun to get a trifle out of hand  i thought those horrid men were making a lot of noise said mrs ukridge  ukridge preserved a gloomy silence of all the disasters of that stricken field i think the one that came home most poignantly to him was the loss of the whisky it seemed to strike him like a blow  isnt it about time to collect these men and explain things i suggested i dont believe any of them know youve come back  they will said ukridge grimly coming out of his trance they soon will wheres beale beale  the hired retainer came running out at the sound of the wellremembered voice  lumme mr ukridge sir he gasped  it was the first time beale had ever betrayed any real emotion in my presence to him i suppose the return of ukridge was as sensational and astonishing an event as a reappearance from the tomb he was not accustomed to find those who had shot the moon revisiting their ancient haunts  beale go round the place and tell those scoundrels that ive come back and would like a word with them on the lawn and if you find any of them stealing the fowls knock them down  i ave knocked down one or two said beale with approval that charlie  beale said ukridge much moved youre an excellent fellow one of the very best i will pay you your back wages before i go to bed  these fellars sir said beale having expressed his gratification theyve bin and scattered most of them birds already sir theyve bin chasin of them this halfhour back  ukridge groaned  scoundrels demons  beale went off  millie old girl said ukridge adjusting the gingerbeer wire behind his ears and hoisting up his grey flanneltrousers which showed an inclination to sag youd better go indoors i propose to speak pretty chattily to these blighters and in the heat of the moment one or two expressions might occur to me which you would not like it would hamper me your being here  mrs ukridge went into the house and the vanguard of the audience began to come on to the lawn several of them looked flushed and dishevelled i have a suspicion that beale had shaken sobriety into them charlie i noticed had a black eye  they assembled on the lawn in the moonlight and ukridge with his cap well over his eyes and his mackintosh hanging round him like a roman toga surveyed them sternly and began his speech  youyouyouyou scoundrels you blighters you worms you weeds  i always like to think of stanley featherstonehaugh ukridge as i saw him at that moment there have been times during a friendship of many years when his conduct did not recommend itself to me it has sometimes happened that i have seen flaws in him but on this occasion he was at his best he was eloquent he dominated his audience long before he had finished i was feeling relieved that he had thought of sending mrs ukridge indoors when he did and beale was hanging on his words with a look in his eyes which i had never seen there beforea look of reverence almost of awe the look of a disciple who listens to a master  he poured scorn upon his hearers and they quailed he flung invective at them and they wilted strange oaths learned among strange men on cattleships or gleaned on the waterfronts of buenos ayres and san francisco slid into the stream of his speech it was hard he said in part it was upon his sam a little hard that a gentlemana gentleman moreover who had done so much to stimulate local trade with large orders and what notcould not run up to london for five minutes on business without having his private grounds turned upside down by a gang of cattleship adjectived san francisco substantives who behaved as if the whole of the buenos ayres phrased place belonged to them he had intended to do well by them he had meant to continue putting business in their way expanding their trade but would he after what had occurred not by a jugful as soon as ever the sun had risen and another day begun their miserable accounts should be paid in full and their connection with him cut off afterwards it was probable that he would institute legal proceedings against them in the matter of trespass and wholesale damage to property and if they didnt all end their infernal days in some dashed prison they might consider themselves uncommonly lucky and if they didnt make themselves scarce in considerably under two ticks he proposed to see what could be done with beales shotgun beale here withdrew with a pleased expression to fetch the weapon he was sick of them they were blighters creatures that it would be fulsome flattery to describe as human beings he would call them skunks only he did not see what the skunks had done to be compared with them and now they might goquick         we were quiet at the farm that night ukridge sat like marius among the ruins of carthage and refused to speak eventually he took bob with him and went for a walk  half an hour later i too wearied of the scene of desolation my errant steps took me in the direction of the sea as i approached i was aware of a figure standing in the moonlight gazing silently out over the waters beside the figure was a dog  the dark moments of optimistic minds are sacred and i would no more have ventured to break in on ukridges thoughts at that moment than if i had been a general in the grand army i would have opened conversation with napoleon during the retreat from moscow i was withdrawing as softly as i could when my foot grated on the shingle ukridge turned  hullo garny  hullo old man i murmured in a deathbedside voice  he came towards me bob trotting at his heels and as he came i saw with astonishment that his mien was calm even cheerful i should have known my ukridge better than to be astonished you cannot keep a good man down and already stanley featherstonehaugh ukridge was himself again his eyes sparkled buoyantly behind their pincenez  garny old horse ive been thinking laddie ive got an idea the idea of a lifetime the best ever pon my sam im going to start a duck farm  a duck farm  a duck farm laddie and run it without water my theory is you see that ducks get thin by taking exercise and swimming about all over the place so that if you kept them always on land theyd get jolly fat in about half the timeand no trouble and expense see what not a flaw in it old horse ive thought the whole thing out he took my arm affectionately now listen well say that the profits of the first year at a conservative estimate    the end
