de levis enters clad in pyjamas and flowered dressinggown  he is      a dark goodlooking rather eastern young man  his face is long      and disturbed  hallo  de levis  anything i can do for you  de levis  in a voice whose faint exoticism is broken by a vexed excitement  i say im awfully sorry winsor but i thought id better tell you at once  ive just haderrather a lot of money stolen  winsor  what  there is something of outrage in his tone and glance as who should say in my house  how do you mean stolen  de levis  i put it under my pillow and went to have a bath when i came back it was gone  winsor  good lord  how much  de levis  nearly a thousandnine hundred and seventy i think  winsor  phew  again the faint tone of outrage that a man should have so much money about him  de levis  i sold my rosemary filly today on the course to bentman the bookie and he paid me in notes  winsor  what  that weed dancy gave you in the spring  de levis  yes  but i tried her pretty high the other day and shes in the cambridgeshire  i was only out of my room a quarter of an hour and i locked my door  winsor  again outraged  you locked  de levis  not seeing the fine shade  yes and had the key here  he taps his pocket  look here  he holds out a pocketbook  its been stuffed with my shaving papers  winsor  between feeling that such things dont happen and a sense that he will have to clear it up  this is damned awkward de levis  de levis  with steel in his voice  yes  i should like it back  winsor  have you got the numbers of the notes  de levis  no  winsor  what were they  de levis  one hundred three fifties and the rest tens and fives  winsor  what dyou want me to do  de levis  unless theres anybody you think  winsor  eyeing him  is it likely  de levis  then i think the police ought to see my room  its a lot of money  winsor  good lord  were not in town therell be nobody nearer than newmarket at this time of nightfour miles       the door from the bedroom is suddenly opened and lady adela appears      she has on a lace cap over her finished hair and the wrapper  lady a  closing the door  what is it  are you ill mr de levis  winsor  worse hes had a lot of money stolen  nearly a thousand pounds  lady a  gracious  where  de levis  from under my pillow lady adelamy door was lockedi was in the bathroom  lady a  but how fearfully thrilling  winsor  thrilling  whats to be done  he wants it back  lady a  of course  with sudden realisation  oh  but  oh  its quite too unpleasant  winsor  yes  what am i to do  fetch the servants out of their rooms search the grounds  itll make the devil of a scandal  de levis  whos next to me  lady a  coldly  oh  mr de levis  winsor  next to you  the dancys on this side and miss orme on the other  whats that to do with it  de levis  they may have heard something  winsor  lets get them  but dancy was down stairs when i came up  get morison adela  no  look here  when was this exactly  lets have as many alibis as we can  de levis  within the last twenty minutes certainly  winsor  how long has morison been up with you  lady a  i came up at eleven and rang for her at once  winsor  looking at his watch  half an hour  then shes all right send her for margaret and the dancystheres nobody else in this wing no send her to bed  we dont want gossip  dyou mind going yourself adela  lady a  consult general canynge charlie  winsor  right  could you get him too  dyou really want the police de levis  de levis  stung by the faint contempt in his tone of voice  yes i do  winsor  then look here dear  slip into my study and telephone to the police at newmarket  therell be somebody there theyre sure to have drunks  ill have treisure up and speak to him  he rings the bell       lady adela goes out into her room and closes the door  winsor  look here de levis  this isnt an hotel  its the sort of thing that doesnt happen in a decent house  are you sure youre not mistaken and didnt have them stolen on the course  de levis  absolutely  i counted them just before putting them under my pillow then i locked the door and had the key here  theres only one door you know  winsor  how was your window  de levis  open  winsor  drawing back the curtains of his own window  youve got a balcony like this  any sign of a ladder or anything  de levis  no  winsor  it must have been done from the window unless someone had a skeleton key  who knew youd got that money  where did kentman pay you  de levis  just round the corner in the further paddock  winsor  anybody about  de levis  oh yes  winsor  suspicious  de levis  i didnt notice anything  winsor  you must have been marked down and followed here  de levis  how would they know my room  winsor  might have got it somehow  a knock from the corridor come in       treisure the butler appears a silent grave man of almost      supernatural conformity  de levis gives him a quick hard look      noted and resented by winsor  treisure  to winsor  yes sir  winsor  who valets mr de levis  treisure  robert sir  winsor  when was he up last  treisure  in the ordinary course of things about ten oclock sir  winsor  when did he go to bed  treisure  i dismissed at eleven  winsor  but did he go  treisure  to the best of my knowledge  is there anything i can do sir  winsor  disregarding a sign from de levis  look here treisure mr de levis has had a large sum of money taken from his bedroom within the last half hour  treisure  indeed sir  winsor  roberts quite all right isnt he  treisure  he is sir  de levis  how do you know       treisures eyes rest on de levis  treisure  i am a pretty good judge of character sir if youll excuse me  winsor  look here de levis eighty or ninety notes must have been pretty bulky  you didnt have them on you at dinner  de levis  no  winsor  where did you put them  de levis  in a boot and the boot in my suitcase and locked it       treisure smiles faintly  winsor  again slightly outraged by such precautions in his house  and you found it lockedand took them from there to put under your pillow  de levis  yes  winsor  run your mind over things treisurehas any stranger been about  treisure  no sir  winsor  this seems to have happened between 1115 and 1130  is that right  de levis nods  any noiseanything outsideanything suspicious anywhere  treisure  running his mindvery still  no sir  winsor  what time did you shut up  treisure  i should say about elevenfifteen sir  as soon as major colford and captain dancy had finished billiards  what was mr de levis doing out of his room if i may ask sir  winsor  having a bath with his room locked and the key in his pocket  treisure  thank you sir  de levis  conscious of indefinable suspicion  damn it  what do you mean  i was  treisure  i beg your pardon sir  winsor  concealing a smile  look here treisure its infernally awkward for everybody  treisure  it is sir  winsor  what do you suggest  treisure  the proper thing sir i suppose would be a cordon and a complete searchin our interests  winsor  i entirely refuse to suspect anybody  treisure  but if mr de levis feels otherwise sir  de levis  stammering  i  all i know isthe money was there and its gone  winsor  compunctious  quite  its pretty sickening for you  but so it is for anybody else  however we must do our best to get it back for you       a knock on the door  winsor  hallo       treisure opens the door and general canynge enters  oh its you general  come in  adelas told you       general canynge nods  he is a slim man of about sixty very well      preserved intensely neat and selfcontained and still in evening      dress  his eyelids droop slightly but his eyes are keen and his      expression astute  winsor  well general whats the first move  canynge  lifting his eyebrows  mr de levis presses the matter  de levis  flicked again  unless you think its too plebeian of me general canyngea thousand pounds  canynge  drily  just so  then we must wait for the police winsor lady adela has got through to them  what height are these rooms from the ground treisure  treisure  twentythree feet from the terrace sir  canynge  any ladders near  treisure  one in the stables sir very heavy  no others within three hundred yards  canynge  just slip down and see whether thats been moved  treisure  very good general  he goes out  de levis  uneasily  of course hei suppose you  winsor  we do  canynge  you had better leave this in our hands de levis  de levis  certainly only the way he  winsor  curtly treisure has been here since he was a boy  i should as soon suspect myself  de levis  looking from one to the otherwith sudden anger  you seem to think  what was i to do  take it lying down and let whoever it is get clear off  i suppose its natural to want my money back       canynge looks at his nails winsor out of the window  winsor  turning  of course de levis  de levis  sullenly  well ill go to my room  when the police come perhaps youll let me know  he goes out  winsor  phew  did you ever see such a dressinggown       the door is opened  lady adela and margaret orme come in  the      latter is a vivid young lady of about twentyfive in a vivid      wrapper she is smoking a cigarette  lady a  ive told the dancysshe was in bed  and i got through to newmarket charles and inspector dede is coming like the wind on a motor cycle  margaret  did he say like the wind adela  he must have imagination isnt this gorgeous  poor little ferdy  winsor  vexed  you might take it seriously margaret its pretty beastly for us all  what time did you come up  margaret  i came up with adela  am i suspected charles  how thrilling  winsor  did you hear anything  margaret  only little ferdy splashing  winsor  and saw nothing  margaret  not even that alas  lady a  with a finger held up leste  un peu leste  oh  here are the dancys  come in you two       mabel and ronald dancy enter  she is a pretty young woman with      bobbed hair fortunately for she has just got out of bed and is in      her nightgown and a wrapper  dancy is in his smoking jacket  he      has a pale determined face with high cheekbones small deepset      dark eyes reddish crisp hair and looks like a horseman  winsor  awfully sorry to disturb you mrs dancy but i suppose you and ronny havent heard anything  de leviss room is just beyond ronnys dressingroom you know  mabel  ive been asleep nearly half an hour and ronnys only just come up  canynge  did you happen to look out of your window mrs dancy  mabel  yes  i stood there quite five minutes  canynge  when  mabel  just about eleven i should think  it was raining hard then  canynge  yes its just stopped  you saw nothing  mabel  no  dancy  what time does he say the money was taken  winsor  between the quarter and half past  hed locked his door and had the key with him  margaret  how quaint  just like an hotel  does he put his boots out  lady a  dont be so naughty meg  canynge  when exactly did you come up dance  dancy  about ten minutes ago  id only just got into my dressingroom before lady adela came  ive been writing letters in the hall since colford and i finished billiards  canynge  you werent up for anything in between  dancy  no  margaret  the mystery of the grey room  dancy  oughtnt the grounds to be searched for footmarks  canynge  thats for the police  dancy  the deuce  are they coming  canynge  directly  a knock  yes       treisure enters  well  treisure  the ladder has not been moved general  there isnt a sign  winsor  all right  get robert up but dont say anything to him  by the way were expecting the police  treisure  i trust they will not find a mares nest sir if i may say so       he goes  winsor  de levis has got wrong with treisure  suddenly  but i say what would any of us have done if wed been in his shoes  margaret  a thousand pounds  i cant even conceive having it  dancy  we probably shouldnt have found it out  lady a  nobut if we had  dancy  come to youas he did  winsor  yes but theres a way of doing things  canynge  we shouldnt have wanted the police  margaret  no  thats it  the hotel touch  lady a  poor young man i think were rather hard on him  winsor  he sold that weed you gave him dancy to kentman the bookie and these were the proceeds  dancy  oh  winsor  hed tried her high he said  dancy  grimly  he would  mabel  oh ronny what bad luck  winsor  he must have been followed here  at the window  after rain like that there ought to be footmarks       the splutter of a motor cycle is heard  margaret  heres the wind  winsor  whats the move now general  canynge  you and i had better see the inspector in de leviss room winsor  to the others  if youll all be handy in case he wants to put questions for himself  margaret  i hope hell want me its just too thrilling  dancy  i hope he wont want me im dogtired  come on mabel  he puts his arm in his wifes  canynge  just a minute charles       he draws dose to winsor as the others are departing to their rooms  winsor  yes general  canynge  we must be careful with this inspector fellow  if he pitches hastily on somebody in the house itll be very disagreeable  winsor  by jove  it will  canynge  we dont want to rouse any ridiculous suspicion  winsor  quite  a knock  come in  treisure enters  treisure  inspector dede sir  winsor  show him in  treisure  robert is in readiness sir but i could swear he knows nothing about it  winsor  all right       treisure reopens the door and says come in please  the      inspector enters blue formal moustachioed with a peaked cap in      his hand  winsor  good evening inspector  sorry to have brought you out at this time of night  inspector  good  evenin  sir  mr winsor  youre the owner here i think  winsor  yes  general canynge  inspector  good evenin general  i understand a large sum of money  winsor  yes  shall we go straight to the room it was taken from  one of my guests mr de levis  its the third room on the left  canynge  weve not been in there yet inspector in fact weve done nothing except to find out that the stable ladder has not been moved we havent even searched the grounds  inspector  right sir ive brought a man with me       they go out                  curtain  and interval of a minute    scene ii       the same set is used for this scene with the different arrangement      of furniture as specified       the bedroom of de levis is the same in shape as winsors      dressingroom except that there is only one doorto the      corridor  the furniture however is differently arranged a      small fourposter bedstead stands against the wall right back      jutting into the room a chair on which de leviss clothes are      thrown stands at its foot there is a dressingtable against the      wall to the left of the open windows where the curtains are      drawn back and a stone balcony is seen  against the wall to the      right of the window is a chest of drawers and a washstand is      against the wall left  on a small table to the right of the bed      an electric reading lamp is turned up and there is a light over      the dressingtable  the inspector is standing plumb centre      looking at the bed and de levis by the back of the chair at the      foot of the bed  winsor and canynge are close to the door right      forward  inspector  finishing a note  now sir if this is the room as you left it for your bath just show us exactly what you did after takin the pocketbook from the suit case  where was that by the way  de levis  pointing  where it is nowunder the dressingtable       he comes forward to the front of the chair opens the pocketbook      goes through the pretence of counting his shaving papers closes the      pocketbook takes it to the head of the bed and slips it under the      pillow  makes the motion of taking up his pyjamas crosses below      the inspector to the washstand takes up a bath sponge crosses to      the door takes out the key opens the door  inspector  writing  we now have the room as it was when the theft was committed  reconstruct accordin to uman nature gentlemenassumin the thief to be in the room what would he try firstthe clothes the dressintable the suit case the chest of drawers and last the bed       he moves accordingly examining the glass on the dressingtable the      surface of the suit cases and the handles of the drawers with a      spyglass for fingermarks  canynge  sotto voce to winsor  the order would have been just the other way       the inspector goes on hands and knees and examines the carpet      between the window and the bed  de levis  can i come in again  inspector  standing up  did you open the window sir or was it open when you first came in  de levis  i opened it  inspector  drawin the curtains back first  de levis  yes  inspector  sharply  are you sure there was nobody in the room already  de levis  taken aback  i dont know  i never thought  i didnt look under the bed if you mean that  inspector  jotting  did not look under bed  did you look under it after the theft  de levis  no  i didnt  inspector  ah  now what did you do after you came back from your bath just give us that precisely  de levis  locked the door and left the key in  put back my sponge and took off my dressinggown and put it there  he points to the footrails of the bed  then i drew the curtains again  inspector  shutting the window  de levis  no  i got into bed felt for my watch to see the time  my hand struck the pocketbook and somehow it felt thinner  i took it out looked into it and found the notes gone and these shaving papers instead  inspector  let me have a look at those sir  he applies the spyglasses  and then  de levis  i think i just sat on the bed  inspector  thinkin and cursin a bit i suppose  yees  de levis  then i put on my dressinggown and went straight to mr winsor  inspector  not lockin the door  de levis  no  inspector  exactly  with a certain finality  now sir what time did you come up  de levis  about eleven  inspector  precise if you can give it me  de levis  well i know it was elevenfifteen when i put my watch under my pillow before i went to the bath and i suppose id been about a quarter of an hour undressing  i should say after eleven if anything  inspector  just undressin  didnt look over your bettin book  de levis  no  inspector  no prayers or anything  de levis  no  inspector  pretty slippy with your undressin as a rule  de levis  yes  say five past eleven  inspector  mr winsor what time did the gentleman come to you  winsor  halfpast eleven  inspector  how do you fix that sir  winsor  id just looked at the time and told my wife to send her maid off  inspector  then weve got it fixed between 1115 and 1130 jots  now sir before we go further id like to see your butler and the footman that valets this gentleman  winsor  with distaste  very well inspector onlymy butler has been with us from a boy  inspector  quite so  this is just clearing the ground sir  winsor  general dyou mind touching that bell  canynge rings a bell by the bed  inspector  well gentlemen there are four possibilities  either the thief was here all the time waiting under the bed and slipped out after this gentleman had gone to mr winsor  or he came in with a key that fits the lock and ill want to see all the keys in the house  or he came in with a skeleton key and out by the window probably droppin from the balcony  or he came in by the window with a rope or ladder and out the same way  pointing  theres a footmark here from a big boot which has been out of doors since it rained  canynge  inspectoryou erwalked up to the window when you first came into the room  inspector  stiffly  i had not overlooked that general  canynge  of course       a knock on the door relieves a certain tension  winsor  come in       the footman robert a freshfaced young man enters followed by      treisure  inspector  you valet mrmr de levis i think  robert  yes sir  inspector  at what time did you take his clothes and boots  robert  ten oclock sir  inspector  with a pounce  did you happen to look under his bed  robert  no sir  inspector  did you come up again to bring the clothes back  robert  no sir theyre still downstairs  inspector  did you come up again for anything  robert  no sir  inspector  what time did you go to bed  robert  just after eleven sir  inspector  scrutinising him  now be careful  did you go to bed at all  robert  no sir  inspector  then why did you say you did  theres been a theft here and anything you say may be used against you  robert  yes sir  i meant i went to my room  inspector  where is your room  robert  on the ground floor at the other end of the right wing sir  winsor  its the extreme end of the house from this inspector  hes with the other two footmen  inspector  were you there alone  robert  no sir  thomas and frederick was there too  treisure  thats right ive seen them  inspector  holding up his hand for silence  were you out of the room again after you went in  robert  no sir  inspector  what were you doing if you didnt go to bed  robert  to winsor  beggin your pardon sir we were playin bridge  inspector  very good  you can go  ill see them later on  robert  yes sir  theyll say the same as me  he goes out leaving a smile on the face of all except the inspector and de levis  inspector  sharply  call him back       treisure calls robert and the footman reenters  robert  yes sir  inspector  did you notice anything particular about mr de leviss clothes  robert  only that they were very good sir  inspector  i meananything peculiar  robert  after reflection  yes sir  inspector  well  robert  a pair of his boots this evenin was reduced to one sir  inspector  what did you make of that  robert  i thought he might have thrown the other at a cat or something  inspector  did you look for it  robert  no sir i meant to draw his attention to it in the morning  inspector  very good  robert  yes sir  he goes again  inspector  looking at de levis  well sir theres your story corroborated  de levis  stiffly i dont know why it should need corroboration inspector  inspector  in my experience you can never have too much of that  to winsor i understand theres a lady in the room on this side pointing left and a gentleman on this pointing right  were they in their rooms  winsor  miss orme was captain dancy not  inspector  do they know of the affair  winsor  yes  inspector  well id just like the keys of their doors for a minute  my man will get them       he goes to the door opens it and speaks to a constable in the      corridor  to treisure  you can go with him       treisure goes out  in the meantime ill just examine the balcony       he goes out on the balcony followed by de levis  winsor  to canynge  damn de levis and his money  its deuced invidious all this general  canynge  the inspectors no earthly       there is a simultaneous reentry of the inspector from the balcony      and of treisure and the constable from the corridor  constable  handing key  room on the left sir  handing key  room on the right sir       the inspector tries the keys in the door watched with tension by      the others  the keys fail  inspector  put them back       hands keys to constable who goes out followed by treisure  ill have to try every key in the house sir  winsor  inspector do you really think it necessary to disturb the whole house and knock up all my guests  its most disagreeable all this you know  the loss of the money is not such a great matter  mr de levis has a very large income  canynge  you could get the numbers of the notes from kentman the bookmaker inspector hell probably have the big ones anyway  inspector  shaking his head  a bookie  i dont suppose he will sir its come and go with them all the time  winsor  we dont want a meldon court scandal inspector  inspector  well mr winsor ive formed my theory       as he speaks de levis comes in from the balcony  and i dont say to try the keys is necessary to it but strictly i ought to exhaust the possibilities  winsor  what do you say de levis  dyou want everybody in the house knocked up so that their keys can be tried  de levis  whose face since his return expresses a curious excitement no i dont  inspector  very well gentlemen  in my opinion the thief walked in before the door was locked probably during dinner and was under the bed  he escaped by dropping from the balconythe creeper at that corner he points stage left has been violently wrenched  ill go down now and examine the grounds and ill see you again sir  he makes another entry in his notebook  goodnight then gentlemen  canynge  goodnight  winsor  with relief  ill come with you inspector       he escorts him to the door and they go out  de levis  suddenly general i know who took them  canynge  the deuce you do  are you following the inspectors theory  de levis  contemptuously  that ass  pulling the shaving papers out of the case  no  the man who put those there was clever and cool enough to wrench that creeper off the balcony as a blind  come and look here general  he goes to the window the general follows  de levis points stage right  see the rail of my balcony and the rail of the next  he holds up the cord of his dressinggown stretching his arms out  ive measured it with this  just over seven feet thats all  if a man can take a standing jump on to a narrow bookcase four feet high and balance there hed make nothing of that  and look here  he goes out on the balcony and returns with a bit of broken creeper in his hand and holds it out into the light  someones stood on thatthe stalks crushedthe inner corner too where hed naturally stand when he took his jump back  canynge  after examining itstiffly  that other balcony is young dancys mr de levis a soldier and a gentleman  this is an extraordinary insinuation  de levis  accusation  canynge  what  de levis  i have intuitions general its in my blood  i see the whole thing  dancy came up watched me into the bathroom tried my door slipped back into his dressingroom saw my window was open took that jump sneaked the notes filled the case up with these wrenched the creeper there he points stage left for a blind jumped back and slipped downstairs again  it didnt take him four minutes altogether  canynge  very gravely  this is outrageous de levis  dancy says he was downstairs all the time  you must either withdraw unreservedly or i must confront you with him  de levis  if hell return the notes and apologise ill do nothing except cut him in future  he gave me that filly you know as a hopeless weed and hes been pretty sick ever since that he was such a flat as not to see how good she was  besides hes hard up i know  canynge  after a vexed turn up and down the room  its mad sir to jump to conclusions like this  de levis  not so mad as the conclusion dancy jumped to when he lighted on my balcony  canynge  nobody could have taken this money who did not know you had it  de levis  how do you know that he didnt  canynge  do you know that he did  de levis  i havent the least doubt of it  canynge  without any proof  this is very ugly de levis  i must tell winsor  de levis  angrily  tell the whole blooming lot  you think ive no feelers but ive felt the atmosphere here i can tell you general  if i were in dancys shoes and he in mine your tone to me would be very different  canynge  suavely frigid  im not aware of using any tone as you call it  but this is a private house mr de levis and something is due to our host and to the esprit de corps that exists among gentlemen  de levis  since when is a thief a gentleman  thick as thievesa good motto isnt it  canynge  thats enough  he goes to the door but stops before opening it  now look here  i have some knowledge of the world  once an accusation like this passes beyond these walls no one can foresee the consequences  captain dancy is a gallant fellow with a fine record as a soldier and only just married  if hes as innocent aschristmud will stick to him unless the real thief is found  in the old days of swords either you or he would not have gone out of this room alive  it you persist in this absurd accusation you will both of you go out of this room dead in the eyes of society  you for bringing it he for being the object of it  de levis  society  do you think i dont know that im only tolerated for my money  society cant add injury to insult and have my money as well thats all  if the notes are restored ill keep my mouth shut if theyre not i shant  im certain im right  i ask nothing better than to be confronted with dancy but if you prefer it deal with him in your own wayfor the sake of your esprit de corps  canynge  pon my soul mr de levis you go too far  de levis  not so far as i shall go general canynge if those notes arent given back  winsor comes in  winsor  well de levis im afraid thats all we can do for the present so very sorry this should have happened in my house  canynge  alter a silence  theres a development winsor  mr de levis accuses one of your guests  winsor  what  canynge  of jumping from his balcony to this taking the notes and jumping back  ive done my best to dissuade him from indulging the fancywithout success  dancy must be told  de levis  you can deal with dancy in your own way  all i want is the money back  canynge  drily  mr de levis feels that he is only valued for his money so that it is essential for him to have it back  winsor  damn it  this is monstrous de levis  ive known ronald dancy since he was a boy  canynge  you talk about adding injury to insult de levis  what do you call such treatment of a man who gave you the mare out of which you made this thousand pounds  de levis  i didnt want the mare i took her as a favour  canynge  with an eye to possibilities i venture to thinkthe principle guides a good many transactions  de levis  as if flicked on a raw spot  in my race do you mean  canynge  coldly  i said nothing of the sort  de levis  no you dont say these things any of you  canynge  nor did i think it  de levis  dancy does  winsor  really de levis if this is the way you repay hospitality  de levis  hospitality that skins my feelings and costs me a thousand pounds  canynge  go and get dancy winsor but dont say anything to him       winsor goes out  canynge  perhaps you will kindly control yourself and leave this to me       de levis turns to the window and lights a cigarette  winsor comes      back followed by dancy  canynge  for winsors sake dancy we dont want any scandal or fuss about this affair  weve tried to make the police understand that  to my mind the whole thing turns on our finding who knew that de levis had this money  its about that we want to consult you  winsor  kentman paid de levis round the corner in the further paddock he says       de levis turns round from the window so that he and dancy are      staring at each other  canynge  did you hear anything that throws light dancy  as it was your filly originally we thought perhaps you might  dancy  i  no  canynge  didnt hear of the sale on the course at all  dancy  no  canynge  then you cant suggest any one who could have known  nothing else was taken you see  dancy  de levis is known to be rolling as i am known to be stony  canynge  there are a good many people still rolling besides mr de levis but not many people with so large a sum in their pocketbooks  dancy  he won two races  de levis  do you suggest that i bet in ready money  dancy  i dont know how you bet and i dont care  canynge  you cant help us then  dancy  no  i cant  anything else  he looks fixedly at de levis  canynge  putting his hand on dancys arm  nothing else thank you dancy       dancy goes  canynge puts his hand up to his face  a moments      silence  winsor  you see de levis  he didnt even know youd got the money  de levis  very conclusive  winsor  well  you are       there is a knock on the door and the inspector enters  inspector  im just going gentlemen  the grounds im sorry to say have yielded nothing  its a bit of a puzzle  canynge  youve searched thoroughly  inspector  we have general  i can pick up nothing near the terrace  winsor  after a look at de levis whose face expresses too much  hm youll take it up from the other end then inspector  inspector  well well see what we can do with the bookmakers about the numbers sir  before i go gentlemenyouve had time to think it over theres no one you suspect in the house i suppose       de leviss face is alive and uncertain  canynge is staring at him      very fixedly  winsor  emphatically no       de levis turns and goes out on to the balcony  inspector  if youre coming in to the racing tomorrow sir you might give us a call  ill have seen kentman by then  winsor  right you are inspector  good night and many thanks  inspector  youre welcome sir  he goes out  winsor  gosh  i thought that chap  with a nod towards the balcony was going to  look here general we must stop his tongue  imagine it going the rounds  they may never find the real thief you know  its the very devil for dancy  canynge  winsor  dancys sleeve was damp  winsor  how dyou mean  canynge  quite damp  its been raining       the two look at each other  winsor  ii dont follow  his voice is hesitative and lower showing that he does  canynge  it was coming down hard a minute out in it would have been enoughhe motions with his chin towards the balcony  winsor  hastily  he must have been out on his balcony since  canynge  it stopped before i came up half an hour ago  winsor  hes been leaning on the wet stone then  canynge  with the outside of the upper part of the arm  winsor  against the wall perhaps  there may be a dozen explanations very low and with great concentration  i entirely and absolutely refuse to believe anything of the sort against ronald dancy in my house  dash it general we must do as wed be done by  it hits us allit hits us all  the things intolerable  canynge  i agree  intolerable  raising his voice  mr de levis  de levis returns into view in the centre of the open window  canynge  with cold decision  young dancy was an officer and is a gentleman this insinuation is pure supposition and you must not make it  do you understand me  de levis  my tongue is still mine general if my money isnt  canynge  unmoved  must not  youre a member of three clubs you want to be member of a fourth  no one who makes such an insinuation against a fellowguest in a country house except on absolute proof can do so without complete ostracism  have we your word to say nothing  de levis  social blackmail  hm  canynge  not at allsimple warning  if you consider it necessary in your interests to start this scandalno matter how we shall consider it necessary in ours to dissociate ourselves completely from one who so recklessly disregards the unwritten code  de levis  do you think your code applies to me  do you general  canynge  to anyone who aspires to be a gentleman sir  de levis  ah  but you havent known me since i was a boy  canynge  make up your mind       a pause  de levis  im not a fool general  i know perfectly well that you can get me outed  canynge  icily  well  de levis  sullenly  ill say nothing about it unless i get more proof  canynge  good  we have implicit faith in dancy       there is a moments encounter of eyes the generals steady shrewd      impassive winsors angry and defiant de leviss mocking a little      triumphant malicious  then canynge and winsor go to the door and      pass out  de levis  to himself  rats                              curtain     act ii  scene i       afternoon three weeks later in the card room of a london club  a      fire is burning left  a door right leads to the billiardroom      rather left of centre at a card table lord st erth an old john      bull sits facing the audience to his right is general canynge to      his left augustus borring an essential clubman about thirtyfive      years old with a very slight and rather becoming stammer or click      in his speech  the fourth bridge player charles winsor stands      with his back to the fire  borring  and the rrub  winsor  by george  you do hold cards borring  st erth  who has lost  not a patch on the old whistthis game  dont know why i play itnever did  canynge  st erth shall we raise the flag for whist again  winsor  no go general  you cant go back on pace  no getting a man to walk when he knows he can fly  the young men wont look at it  borring  better develop it so that ttwo can sit out general  st erth  we ought to have stuck to the old game  wish id gone to newmarket canynge in spite of the weather  canynge  looking at his watch  lets hear whats won the cambridgeshire  ring wont you winsor winsor rings  st erth  by the way canynge young de levis was blackballed  canynge  what  st erth  i looked in on my way down       canynge sits very still and winsor utters a disturbed sound  borring  but of ccourse he was general  what did you expect       a footman enters  footman  yes my lord  st erth  what won the cambridgeshire  footman  rosemary my lord  sherbet second barbizon third  nine to one the winner  winsor  thank you  thats all       footman goes  borring  rosemary  and de levis sold her  but he got a good pprice i suppose       the other three look at him  st erth  many a slip between price and pocket young man  canynge  cut  they cut  borring  i say is that the yarn thats going round about his having had a lot of mmoney stolen in a country house  by jove  hell be pretty ssick  winsor  you and i borring       he sits down in canynges chair and the general takes his place by      the fire  borring  phew  wont dancy be mad  he gave that filly away to save her keep  he was rather pleased to find somebody whod take her  bentman must have won a ppot  she was at thirtythrees a fortnight ago  st erth  all the money goes to fellows who dont know a horse from a haystack  canynge  profoundly  and care less  yes  we want men racing to whom a horse means something  borring  i thought the horse mmeant the same to everyone general chance to get the bbetter of ones neighbour  canynge  with feeling  the horse is a noble animal sir as youd know if youd owed your life to them as often as i have  borring  they always try to take mine general  i shall never belong to the noble ffellowship of the horse  st erth  drily  evidently  deal       as borring begins to deal the door is opened and major colford      appearsa lean and moustached cavalryman  borring  hallo ccolford  colford  general       something in the tone of his voice brings them all to a standstill  colford  i want your advice  young de levis in there  he points to the billiardroom from which he has just come  has started a blasphemous story  canynge  one moment  mr borring dyou mind  colford  it makes no odds general  four of us in there heard him hes saying it was ronald dancy robbed him down at winsors  the fellows mad over losing the price of that filly now shes won the cambridgeshire  borring  all ears  dancy  great sscott  colford  dancys in the club  if he hadnt been id have taken it on myself to wring the bounders neck       winsor and borring have risen  st erth alone remains seated  canynge  after consulting st erth with a look  ask de levis to be good enough to come in here  borring you might see that dancy doesnt leave the club  we shall want him  dont say anything to him and use your tact to keep people off       borring goes out followed by colford  winsor  result of hearing      he was blackballedpretty slippy  canynge  st erth i told you there was good reason when i asked you to back young de levis  winsor and i knew of this insinuation i wanted to keep his tongue quiet  its just wild assertion to have it bandied about was unfair to dancy  the duel used to keep peoples tongues in order  st erth  hm  it  never  settled  anything except who could shoot straightest  colford  reappearing  de levis says hes nothing to add to what he said to you before on the subject  canynge  kindly tell him that if he wishes to remain a member of this club he must account to the committee for such a charge against a fellowmember  four of us are here and form a quorum       colford goes out again  st erth  did kentman ever give the police the numbers of those notes winsor  winsor  he only had the numbers of twothe hundred and one of the fifties  st erth  and they havent traced em  winsor  not yet       as he speaks de levis comes in  he is in a highlycoloured not to      say excited state  colford follows him  de levis  well general canynge  its a little too strong all this a little too strong  under emotion his voice is slightly more exotic  canynge  calmly  it is obvious mr de levis that you and captain dancy cant both remain members of this club  we ask you for an explanation before requesting one resignation or the other  de levis  youve let me down  canynge  what  de levis  well i shall tell people that you and lord st erth backed me up for one club and asked me to resign from another  canynge  its a matter of indifference to me sir what you tell people  st erth  drily  you seem a venomous young man  de levis  ill tell you what seems to me venomous my lordchasing a man like a pack of hounds because he isnt your breed  canynge  you appear to have your breed on the brain sir  nobody else does so far as i know  de levis  suppose i had robbed dancy would you chase him out for complaining of it  colford  my god  if you repeat that  canynge  steady colford  winsor  you make this accusation that dancy stole your money in my house on no proofno proof and you expect dancys friends to treat you as if you were a gentleman  thats too strong if you like  de levis  no proof  bentman told me at newmarket yesterday that dancy did know of the sale  he told goole and goole says that he himself spoke of it to dancy  winsor  wellif he did  de levis  dancy told you he didnt know of it in general canynges presence and mine  to canynge you cant deny that if you want to  canynge  choose your expressions more nicely please  de levis  proof  did they find any footmarks in the grounds below that torn creeper  not a sign  you saw how he can jump he won ten pounds from me that same evening betting on what he knew was a certainty thats your dancya common sharper  canynge  nodding towards the billiardroom  are those fellows still in there colford  colford  yes  canynge  then bring dancy up will you  but dont say anything to him  colford  to de levis you may think yourself damned lucky if he doesnt break your neck       he goes out  the three who are left with de levis avert their eyes      from him  de levis  smouldering  i have a memory and a sting too  yes my lordsince you are good enough to call me venomous  to canynge  i quite understandim marked for coventry now whatever happens  well ill take dancy with me  st erth  to himself  this club has always had a decent quiet name  winsor  are you going to retract and apologise in front of dancy and the members who heard you  de levis  no fear  st erth  you must be a very rich man sir  a jury is likely to take the view that money can hardly compensate for an accusation of that sort       de levis stands silent  canynge  courts of law require proof  st erth  he can make it a criminal action  winsor  unless you stop this at once you may find yourself in prison if you can stop it that is  st erth  if i were young dancy nothing should induce me  de levis  but you didnt steal my money lord st erth  st erth  youre deuced positive sir  so far as i could understand it there were a dozen ways you could have been robbed  it seems to me you value other mens reputations very lightly  de levis  confront me with dancy and give me fair play  winsor  aside to canynge  is it fair to dancy not to let him know  canynge  our duty is to the club now winsor  we must have this cleared up       colford comes in followed by borring and dancy  st erth  captain dancy a serious accusation has been made against you by this gentleman in the presence of several members of the club  dancy  what is it  st erth  that you robbed him of that money at winsors  dancy  hard and tense  indeed  on what grounds is he good enough to say that  de levis  tense too  you gave me that filly to save yourself her keep and youve been mad about it ever since you knew from goole that i had sold her to kentman and been paid in cash yet i heard you myself deny that you knew it  you had the next room to me and you can jump like a cat as we saw that evening i found some creepers crushed by a weight on my balcony on that side  when i went to the bath your door was open and when i came back it was shut  canynge  thats the first we have heard about the door  de levis  i remembered it afterwards  st erth  well dancy  dancy  with intense deliberation  ill settle this matter with any weapons when and where he likes  st erth  drily  it cant be settled that wayyou know very well you must take it to the courts unless he retracts  dancy  will you retract  de levis  why did you tell general canynge you didnt know kentman had paid me in cash  dancy  because i didnt  de levis  then kentman and goole liedfor no reason  dancy  thats nothing to do with me  de levis  if you were downstairs all the time as you say why was your door first open and then shut  dancy  being downstairs how should i know  the wind probably  de levis  i should like to hear what your wife says about it  dancy  leave my wife alone you damned jew  st erth  captain dancy  de levis  white with rage thief  dancy  will you fight  de levis  youre very smartdead men tell no tales  no  bring your action and we shall see       dancy takes a step towards him but canynge and winsor interpose  st erth  thatll do mr de levis we wont keep you  he looks round kindly consider your membership suspended till this matter has been threshed out  de levis  tremulous with anger  dont trouble yourselves about my membership  i resign it  to dancy  you called me a damned jew  my race was old when you were all savages  i am proud to be a jew  au revoir in the courts       he goes out and silence follows his departure  st erth  well captain dancy  dancy  if the brute wont fight what am i to do sir  st erth  weve told youtake action to clear your name  dancy  colford you saw me in the hall writing letters after our game  colford  certainly i did you were there when i went to the smokingroom  canynge  how long after you left the billiardroom  colford  about five minutes  dancy  its impossible for me to prove that i was there all the time  canynge  its for de levis to prove what he asserts  you heard what he said about goole  dancy  if he told me i didnt take it in  st erth  this concerns the honour of the club  are you going to take action  dancy  slowly  that is a very expensive business lord st erth and im hard up  i must think it over  he looks round from face to face am i to take it that there is a doubt in your minds gentlemen  colford  emphatically  no  canynge  thats not the question dancy  this accusation was overheard by various members and we represent the club  if you dont take action judgment will naturally go by default  dancy  i might prefer to look on the whole thing as beneath contempt       he turns and goes out  when he is gone there is an even longer      silence than after de leviss departure  st erth  abruptly i dont like it  winsor  ive known him all his life  colford  you may have my head if he did it lord st erth  he and i have been in too many holes together  by gad  my toe itches for that fellows butt end  borring  im sorry but has he ttaken it in quite the right way  i should have thoughthearing it ssuddenly  colford  bosh  winsor  its perfectly damnable for him  st erth  more damnable if he did it winsor  borring  the courts are bbeastly distrustful dont you know  colford  his words good enough for me  canynge  were as anxious to believe dancy as you colford for the honour of the army and the club  winsor  of course hell bring a case when hes thought it over  st erth  what are we to do in the meantime  colford  if dancys asked to resign you may take my resignation too  borring  i thought his wanting to ffight him a bit screeny  colford  wouldnt you have wanted a shot at the brute  a law court pah  winsor  yes  whatll be his position even if he wins  borring  damages and a stain on his ccharacter  winsor  quite so unless they find the real thief  people always believe the worst  colford  glaring at borring  they do  canynge  there is no decent way out of a thing of this sort  st erth  no  rising  it leaves a bad taste  im sorry for young mrs dancypoor woman  borring  are you going to play any more  st erth  abruptly  no sir  good night to you  canynge can i give you a lift       he goes out followed by canynge  borring  after a slight pause  well i shall go and take the ttemperature of the club       he goes out  colford  damn that effeminate stammering chap  what can we do for dancy winsor  winsor  colford  a slight pause  the general felt his coat sleeve that night and it was wet  colford  well  what proofs that  no by george  an old schoolfellow a brother officer and a pal  winsor  if he did do it  colford  he didnt  but if he did id stick to him and see him through it if i could       winsor walks over to the fire stares into it turns round and      stares at colford who is standing motionless  colford  yes by god                                 curtain    scene ii      notethis should be a small set capable of being set quickly      within that of the previous scene       morning of the following day  the dancys flat  in the      sittingroom of this small abode mabel dancy and margaret orme      are sitting full face to the audience on a couch in the centre      of the room in front of the imaginary window  there is a      fireplace left with fire burning a door below it left and a      door on the right facing the audience leads to a corridor and      the outer door of the flat which is visible  their voices are      heard in rapid exchange then as the curtain rises so does      mabel  mabel  but its monstrous  margaret  of course  she lights a cigarette and hands the case to mabel who however sees nothing but her own thoughts  de levis might just as well have pitched on me except that i cant jump more than six inches in these skirts  mabel  its wicked  yesterday afternoon at the club did you say ronny hasnt said a word to me  why  margaret  with a long puff of smoke  doesnt want you bothered  mabel  butgood heavensme  margaret  havent you found out mabel that he isnt exactly communicative  no desperate character is

its for him they ought  margaret  again handing the cigarette case  do smoke old thing       mabel takes a cigarette this time but does not light it  it isnt altogether simple  general canynge was there last night  you dont mind my being beastly frank do you  mabel  no  i want it  margaret  well hes all for esprit de corps and that  but he was awfully silent  mabel  i hate halfhearted friends

rather not       mabel goes out by the door left  poor kid       she curls herself into a corner of the sofa as if trying to get      away from life  the bell rings  margaret stirs gets up and goes      out into the corridor where she opens the door to lady adela      winsor whom she precedes into the sittingroom  enter the second murderer  dyou know that child knew nothing  lady a  where is she

her a slight bow and as he does so dancy comes      quickly in left  the two men stand with the length of the sofa      between them  mabel behind the sofa turns her eyes on her      husband who has a paper in his right hand  de levis  you came to see me  dancy  yes  i want you to sign this  de levis  i will sign nothing  dancy  let me read it i apologise to captain dancy for the reckless and

mabel  no no  de levis  quite right mrs dancy  black and tan swashbuckling will only make things worse for him  dancy  so you shelter behind a woman do you you skulking cur       de levis takes a step with fists clenched and eyes blazing  dancy      too stands ready to springthe moment is cut short by mabel going      quickly to her husband  mabel  dont ronny  its undignified  he isnt worth it       dancy suddenly tears the paper in two and flings it into the fire  dancy  get out of here you swine       de levis stands a moment irresolute then turning to the door he      opens it stands again for a moment with a smile on his face then      goes  mabel crosses swiftly to the door and shuts it as the outer      door closes  then she stands quite still looking at her husband      her face expressing a sort of startled suspense  dancy  turning and looking at her  well  do you agree with him  mabel  what do you mean  dancy  that i wouldnt be playing this game unless  mabel  dont  you

above her head is contorted for a moment then hardens into a mask well what shall we do  lets go to that lawyerlets go  mabel  oh at once  dancy  all right  get your hat on       mabel passes him and goes into the bedroom left  dancy left      alone stands quite still staring before him  with a sudden shrug      of his shoulders he moves quickly to his hat and takes it up just as      mabel returns ready to go out  he opens the door and crossing      him she stops in the doorway looking up with a clear and trustful      gaze as                               the curtain falls     act iii  scene i       three months later  old mr jacob twisdens room at the offices of      twisden  graviter in lincolns inn fields is spacious with two      large windows at back a fine old fireplace right a door below it      and two doors left  between the windows is a large table sideways      to the window wall with a chair in the middle on the righthand      side a chair against the wall and a clients chair on the      lefthand side       graviter twisdens much younger partner is standing in front of      the righthand window looking out on to the fields where the lamps      are being lighted and a taxis engine is running down below  he      turns his sanguine shrewd face from the window towards a      grandfather dock between the doors left which is striking four      the door left forward is opened  young clerk  entering  a mr gilman sir to see mr twisden  graviter  by appointment  young clerk  no sir  but important he says  graviter  ill see him       the clerk goes  graviter sits right of table  the clerk returns      ushering in an oldish man who looks what he is the proprietor of a      large modern grocery store  he wears a dark overcoat and carries a      pot hat  his gingerygrey moustache and muttonchop whiskers give      him the expression of a cat  graviter  sizing up his social standing  mr gilman  yes  gilman  doubtfully  mr jacob twisden  graviter  smiling his partner  graviter my name is  gilman  mr twisdens not in then  graviter  no  hes at the courts  theyre just up he should be in directly  but hell be busy  gilman  old mr jacob twisdenive

head  no  astonishin the interest taken in it  graviter  as you say  gilman  the smart set  eh  this captain dancy got the dso didnt he       graviter nods  sad to have a thing like that said about you  i thought he gave his evidence well and his wife too  looks as if this de levis had got some private spite  searchy la femme i said to mrs gilman only this morning before i  graviter  by the way sir what is your business  gilman  well my business hereno if youll excuse me id rather wait and see old mr jacob twisden  its delicate and id like his experience  graviter with a shrug  very well then perhaps youll go in there he moves towards the door left back  gilman  thank you  following  you see ive never been mixed up with the law  graviter  opening the door no  gilman  and i dont want to begin  when you do you dont know where youll stop do you  you see ive only come from a sense of duty and other reasons  graviter  not uncommon  gilman  producing card this is my card  gilmansseveral branches but this is the ead  graviter  scrutinising card  exactly  gilman  groceryi daresay you know me or your wife does  they say old mr jacob twisden refused a knighthood  if its not a rude question why was that  graviter  ask him sir ask him  gilman  i said to my wife at the time hes holdin out for a baronetcy       graviter closes the door with an exasperated smile  young clerk  opening the door left forward  mr winsor sir and miss orme       they enter and the clerk withdraws  graviter  how dyou do miss orme  how do you do winsor  winsor  twisden not back graviter  graviter  not yet  winsor  well theyve got through de leviss witnesses  sir frederick was at the very top of his form  its looking quite well  but i hear theyve just subpoenaed canynge after all  his evidence is to be taken tomorrow  graviter  oho  winsor  i said dancy ought to have called him  graviter  we considered it  sir frederic decided that he could use him better in crossexamination  winsor  well  i dont know that  can i go and see him before he gives evidence tomorrow  graviter  i should like to hear mr jacob on that winsor  hell be in directly  winsor  they had kentman and goole the inspector the other bobby my footman dancys banker and his tailor  graviter  did we shake kentman or goole  winsor  very little  oh by the way the numbers of those two notes were given and i see theyre published in the evening papers  i suppose the police wanted that  i tell you what i find gravitera general feeling that theres something behind it all that doesnt come out  graviter  the public wants its moneys worthalways does in these society cases they brew so long beforehand you see  winsor  theyre looking for something lurid  margaret  when i was in the bog i thought they were looking for me taking out her cigarette case i suppose i mustnt smoke mr graviter  graviter  do  margaret  wont mr jacob have a fit  graviter  yes but not till youve gone  margaret  just a whiff  she lights a cigarette  winsor  suddenly  its becoming a sort of dreyfus casepeople taking sides quite outside the evidence  margaret  there are more of the chosen in court every day  mr graviter have you noticed the two on the jury  graviter  with a smile no i cant say  margaret  oh but quite distinctly  dont you think they ought to have been challenged  graviter  de levis might have challenged the other ten miss orme  margaret  dear me now  i never thought of that       as she speaks the door left forward is opened and old mr jacob      twisden comes in  he is tallish and narrow sixtyeight years old      grey with narrow little whiskers curling round his narrow ears and      a narrow bowribbon curling round his collar  he wears a long      narrowtailed coat and strapped trousers on his narrow legs  his      nose and face are narrow shrewd and kindly  he has a way of      narrowing his shrewd and kindly eyes  his nose is seen to twitch      and snig  twisden  ah  how are you charles  how do you do my dear  margaret  dear mr jacob im smoking  isnt it disgusting  but they dont allow it in court you know  such a pity  the judge might have a hookah  oh wouldnt he look sweetthe darling  twisden  with a little oldfashioned bow it does not become everybody as it becomes you margaret  margaret  mr jacob how charming  with a slight grimace she puts out her cigarette  graviter  man called gilman waiting in there to see you specially  twisden  directly  turn up the light would you graviter  graviter  turning up the light  excuse me       he goes  winsor  look here mr twisden  twisden  sit down sit down my dear       and he himself sits behind the table as a cup of tea is brought in      to him by the young clerk with two marie biscuits in the saucer  will you have some margaret  margaret  no dear mr jacob  twisden  charles  winsor  no thanks  the door is closed  twisden  dipping a biscuit in the tea now then  winsor  the general knows something which on the face of it looks rather queer  now that hes going to be called oughtnt dancy to be told of it so that he may be ready with his explanation in case it comes out  twisden  pouring some tea into the saucer  without knowing i cant tell you       winsor and margaret exchange looks and twisden drinks from the      saucer  margaret  tell him charles  winsor  well  it rained that evening at meldon  the general happened to put his hand on dancys shoulder and it was damp       twisden puts the saucer down and replaces the cup in it  they both      look intently at him  twisden  i take it that general canynge wont say anything hes not compelled to say  margaret  no of course but mr jacob they might ask they know it rained  and he is such a george washington  twisden  toying with a pair of tortoiseshell glasses  they didnt ask either of you  stillno harm in your telling dancy  winsor  id rather you did it margaret  margaret  i daresay  she mechanically takes out her cigarettecase catches the lift of twisdens eyebrows and puts it back  winsor  well well go together  i dont want mrs dancy to hear  margaret  do tell me mr jacob is he going to win  twisden  i think so margaret i think so  margaret  itll be toofrightful if he doesnt get a verdict after all this  but i dont know what we shall do when its over  ive been sitting in that court all these three days watching and its made me feel theres nothing we like better than seeing people skinned  well byebye bless you       twisden rises and pats her hand  winsor  half a second margaret  wait for me  she nods and goes out mr twisden what do you really think  twisden  i am dancys lawyer my dear charles as well as yours  winsor  well can i go and see canynge  twisden  better not  winsor  if they get that out of him and recall me am i to say he told me of it at the time  twisden  you didnt feel the coat yourself  and dancy wasnt present then what canynge told you is not evidencehell stop your being asked  winsor  thank goodness  goodbye       winsor goes out       twisden behind his table motionless taps his teeth with the      eyeglasses in his narrow wellkept hand  after a long shake of his      head and a shrug of his rather high shoulders he snips goes to the      window and opens it  then crossing to the door left back he      throws it open and says  twisden  at your service sir       gilman comes forth nursing his pot hat  be seated       twisden closes the window behind him and takes his seat  gilman  taking the clients chair to the left of the table mr twisden i believe  my names gilman head of gilmans department stores  you have my card  twisden  looking at the card yes  what can we do for you  gilman  well ive come to you from a sense of duty sir and also a feelin of embarrassment  he takes from his breast pocket an evening paper you see ive been followin this dancy caseits a good deal talked of in putneyand i read this at halfpast two this afternoon  to be precise at 225  he rises and hands the paper to twisden and with a thick gloved forefinger indicates a passage when i read these numbers i appened to remember givin change for a fiftypound notedont often ave one in you knowso i went to the cashbox out of curiosity to see that i adnt got it  well i ad and here it is  he draws out from his breast pocket and lays before twisden a fiftypound banknote  it was brought in to

they tell me there that hes at his business shop in the city so off i go in the cab again and there i find him  well sir i showed this paper to him and i produced the note  here i said you brought this to me and you got value for it  well that man was taken aback if im a judge mr twisden he was taken aback not to speak in a guilty way but he was as you might say flummoxed  now i said to him where did you get itthats the point  he took his time to answer and then he said well mr gilman he said you know me i am an honourable man  i cant tell you offhand but i am above the board hes foreign you know in his expressions  yes i said thats all very well i said but here ive got a stolen note and youve got the value for it  now i tell you i said what im going to do im going straight with this

youand ive got him in the cab below i want to tell you everything before he comes up  on the way i tried to get something out of him but i couldnti could not  this is very awkward i said at last  it is mr gilman was his reply and he began to talk about his sicilian clareta very good wine mind you but under the circumstances it seemed to me uncalled for  have i made it clear to you  twisden  who has listened with extreme attention perfectly mr gilman ill send down for him  he touches a handbell       the young clerk appears at the door left forward  a gentleman in a taxiwaiting  ask him to be so good as to step up  oh and send mr graviter here again       the young clerk goes out  gilman  as i told you sir ive been followin this case  its what you might call piquant  and i should be very glad if it came about that this helped captain dancy  i take an interest because to tell you the truth confidentially i dont likewell not to put too fine a point upon it ebrews  they work harder theyre more sober theyre honest and theyre everywhere  ive nothing against them but the fact isthey get on so  twisden  cocking an eye  a thorn in the flesh mr gilman  gilman  well i prefer my own countrymen and thats the truth of it       as he speaks graviter comes in by the door left forward  twisden  pointing to the newspaper and the note  mr gilman has brought this of which he is holder for value  his customer who changed it three days ago is coming up  graviter  the fiftypounder  i see  his face is long and reflective  young clerk  entering  mr ricardos sir       he goes out  ricardos is a personable italianlooking man in a      frock coat with a dark moustachioed face and dark hair a little      grizzled  he looks anxious and bows  twisden  mr ricardos  my name is jacob twisden  my partner  holding up a finger as ricardos would speak  mr gilman has told us about this note  you took it to him he says three days ago that is on monday and received cash for it  ricardos  yes sare  twisden  you were not aware that it was stolen  ricardos  with his hand to his breast  oh no sare  twisden  you received it from  ricardos  a minute sare  i would weesh to explainwith an expressive shrug in private  twisden  nodding mr gilman your conduct has been most prompt  you may safely leave the matter in our hands now  kindly let us retain this note and ask for my cashier as you go out and give him he writes this  he will reimburse you  we will take any necessary steps ourselves  gilman  in slight surprise with modest pride  well sir im in your ands  i must be guided by you with your experience  im glad you think i acted rightly  twisden  very rightly mr gilmanvery rightly  rising good afternoon  gilman  good afternoon sir  good afternoon gentlemen to twisden im sure im very appy to have made your acquaintance sir  its a wellknown name  twisden  thank you       gilman retreats glances at ricardos and turns again  gilman  i suppose theres nothing else i ought to do in the interests of the law  im a careful man  twisden  if there is mr gilman we will let you know  we have your address  you may make your mind easy but dont speak of this  it might interfere with justice  gilman  oh i shouldnt dream of it  ive no wish to be mixed up in anything conspicuous  thats not my principle at all  goodday gentlemen       he goes  twisden  seating himself now sir will you sit down       but ricardos does not sit he stands looking uneasily across the      table at graviter  you may speak out  ricardos  well mr tweesden and sare this matter is very serious for me and very delicateit concairns my honour  i am in a great difficulty  twisden  when in difficultycomplete frankness sir  ricardos  it is a family matter sare i  twisden  let me be frank with you  telling his points off on his fingers  we have your admission that you changed this stopped note for value  it will be our duty to inform the bank of england that it has been traced to you  you will have to account to them for your possession of it  i suggest to you that it will be far better to account frankly to us  ricardos  taking out a handkerchief and quite openly wiping his hands and forehead  i received this note sare with others from a gentleman sare in settlement of a debt of honour and i know nothing of where he got them  twisden  hm that is very vague  if that is all you can tell us im afraid  ricardos  gentlemen this is very painful for me  it is my daughters good namehe again wipes his brow  twisden  come sir speak out  ricardos  desperately  the notes were a settlement to her from this gentleman of whom she was a great friend  twisden  suddenly  i am afraid we must press you for the name of the gentleman  ricardos  sare if i give it to you and it does im arm what will my daughter say  this is a bad matter for me  he behaved well to her and she is attached to him still sometimes she is crying yet because she lost him  and now we betray him perhaps who knows  this is very unpleasant for me  taking up the paper  here it gives the number of another notea undredpound note  i ave that too  he takes a note from his breast pocket  graviter  how much did he give you in all  ricardos  for my daughters settlement one thousand pounds  i understand he did not wish to give a cheque because of his marriage so i did not think anything about it being in notes you see  twisden  when did he give you this money  ricardos  the middle of octobare last  twisden  suddenly looking up mr ricardos was it captain dancy  ricardos  again wiping his forehead gentlemen i am so fond of my daughter  i have only the one and no wife  twisden  with an effort yes yes but i must know  ricardos  sare if i tell you will you give me your good word that my daughter shall not hear of it  twisden  so far as we are able to prevent itcertainly  ricardos  sare i trust youit was captain dancy       a long pause  graviter suddenly were you blackmailing him  twisden  holding up his hand  my partner means did you press him for this settlement  ricardos  i did think it my duty to my daughter to ask that he make compensation to her  twisden  with threats that you would tell his wife  ricardos  with a shrug  captain dancy was a man of honour  he said of course i will do this  i trusted him  and a month later i did remind him and he gave me this money for her  i do not know where he got iti do not know  gentlemen i have invested it all on herevery pennyexcept this note for which i had the purpose to buy her a necklace  that is the sweared truth  twisden  i must keep this note  he touches the hundredpound note you will not speak of this to anyone  i may recognise that you were a holder for value receivedothers might take a different view  goodday sir  graviter see mr ricardos out and take his address  ricardos  pressing his hands over the breast of his frock coatwith a sigh  gentlemen i beg youremember what i said  with a roll of his eyes my daughteri am not happee  goodday       he turns and goes out slowly left forward followed by graviter  twisden  to himself  young dancy  he pins the two notes together and places them in an envelope then stands motionless except for his eyes and hands which restlessly express the disturbance within him       graviter returns carefully shuts the door and going up to him      hands him ricardos card  looking at the card villa benvenuto  this will have to be verified but im afraid its true  that man was not acting  graviter  whats to be done about dancy  twisden  can you understand a gentleman  graviter  i dont know sir  the war loosened form all over the place  i saw plenty of that myself  and some men have no moral sense from the first ive had doubts  twisden  we cant go on with the case  graviter  phew  a

what time is that train  he bends over the abc                                curtain    scene ii       the same room on the following morning at tentwentyfive by the      grandfather clock       the young clerk is ushering in dancy whose face is perceptibly      harder than it was three months ago like that of a man who has      lived under great restraint  dancy  he wanted to see me before the court sat  young clerk  yes sir  mr twisden will see you in one minute  he had to go out of town last night  he prepares to open the waitingroom door  dancy  were you in the war  young clerk  yes  dancy  how can you stick this  young clerk  with a smile  my trouble was to stick that sir  dancy  but you get no excitement from years end to years end  itd drive me mad  young clerk  shyly  a case like this is pretty exciting  id give a lot to see us win it  dancy  staring at him  why  what is it to you  young clerk  i dont know sir  itsits like footballyou want your side to win  he opens the waitingroom door  expanding  you see some rum starts too in a lawyers office in a quiet way       dancy enters the waitingroom and the young clerk shutting the      door meets twisden as he comes in left forward and takes from him      overcoat top hat and a small bag  young clerk  captain dancys waiting sir  he indicates the waitingroom  twisden  narrowing his lips very well  mr graviter gone to the courts  young clerk  yes sir  twisden  did he leave anything for me  young clerk  on the table sir  twisden  taking up an envelope  thank you       the clerk goes   twisden  opening the envelope and reading all corroborates  hm he puts it in his pocket and takes out of an envelope the two notes lays them on the table and covers them with a sheet of blottingpaper stands a moment preparing himself then goes to the door of the waitingroom opens it and says  now captain dancy  sorry to have kept you waiting  dancy  entering winsor came to me yesterday about general canynges evidence  is that what you wanted to speak to me about  twisden  no  it isnt that  dancy  looking at his wrist watch  by me its just on the halfhour sir  twisden  yes  i dont want you to go to the court  dancy  not  twisden  i have very serious news for you  dancy  wincing and collecting himself  oh  twisden  these two notes  he uncovers the notes  after the court rose yesterday we had a man called ricardos here  a pause is there any need for me to say more  dancy  unflinching no  what now  twisden  our duty was plain we could not go on with the case  i have consulted sir frederic  he felthe felt that he must throw up his brief and he will do that the moment the court sits  now i want to talk to you about what youre going to do  dancy  thats very good of you considering  twisden  i dont pretend to understand but i imagine you may have done this in a moment of reckless bravado feeling perhaps that as you gave the mare to de levis the money was by rights as much yours as his       stopping dancy who is about to speak with a gesture  to satisfy a debt of honour to thislady and no doubt to save your wife from hearing of it from the man ricardos  is that so  dancy  to the life  twisden  it was mad captain dancy mad  but the question now is  what do you owe to your wife  she doesnt dreami suppose  dancy  with a twitching face  no  twisden  we cant tell what the result of this collapse will be  the police have the theft in hand  they may issue a warrant  the money could be refunded and the costs paidsomehow that can all be managed but it may not help  in any case what end is served by your staying in the country  you cant save your honourthats gone  you cant save your wifes peace of mind  if she sticks to youdo you think she will  dancy  not if shes wise  twisden  better go  theres a war in morocco  dancy  with a bitter smile  good old morocco  twisden  will you go then at once and leave me to break it to your wife  dancy  i dont know yet  twisden  you must decide quickly to catch a boat train  many a man has made good  youre a fine soldier  dancy  there are alternatives  twisden  now go straight from this office  youve a passport i suppose you wont need a visa for france and from there you can find means to slip over  have you got money on you  dancy nods  we will see what we can do to stop or delay proceedings  dancy  its all damned kind of you  with difficulty  but i must think of my wife  give me a few minutes  twisden  yes yes go in there and think it out       he goes to the door right and opens it  dancy passes him and goes      out  twisden rings a bell and stands waiting  clerk  entering  yes sir  twisden  tell them to call a taxi  clerk  who has a startled look yes sir  mr graviter has come in air with general canynge  are you disengaged  twisden  yes       the clerk goes out and almost immediately graviter and canynge      enter  goodmorning general  to graviter  well  graviter  sir frederic got up at once and said that since the publication of the numbers of those notes information had reached him which forced him to withdraw from the case  great sensation of course i left bromley in charge  therell be a formal verdict for the defendant with

couldnt feel it more  butdamn it  what right had that fellow to chuck up the casewithout letting him know too  i came down with dancy this morning and he knew nothing about it  twisden  coldly  that was unfortunately unavoidable  colford  guilty or not you ought to have stuck to himits not playing the game mr twisden  twisden  you must allow me to judge where my duty lay in a very hard case  colford  i thought a man was safe with his solicitor  canynge  colford you dont understand professional etiquette  colford  no thank god  twisden  when you have been as long in your profession as i

cant stand commiseration and let me have some air       twisden motions to colford and margaret to go and as he turns to      dancy they go out  graviter also moves towards the door  the      general sits motionless  graviter goes out  twisden  well  dancy  im going home to clear up things with my wife  general canynge i dont quite know why i did the damned thing  but i did and theres an end of it  canynge  dancy for the honour of the army avoid further scandal if you can  ive written a letter to a friend of mine in the spanish war office  it will get you a job in their war  canynge closes the envelope  dancy  very good of you  i dont know if i can make use of it       canynge stretches out the letter which twisden hands to dancy who      takes it  graviter reopens the door  twisden  what is it  graviter  de levis is here  twisden  de levis  cant see him  dancy  let him in       after a moments hesitation twisden nods and graviter goes out      the three wait in silence with their eyes fixed on the door the      general sitting at the table twisden by his chair dancy between      him and the door right  de levis comes in and shuts the door  he      is advancing towards twisden when his eyes fall on dancy and he      stops  twisden  you wanted to see me  de levis  moistening his lips  yes  i came to say thatthat i overheardi am afraid a warrant is to be issued  i wanted you to realiseits not my doing  ill give it no support  im content  i dont want my money  i dont even want costs  dancy do you understand       dancy does not answer but looks at him with nothing alive in his      face but his eyes  twisden  we are obliged to you sir  it was good of you to come  de levis  with a sort of darting pride dont mistake me  i didnt come because i feel christian i am a jew  i will take no moneynot even that which was stolen  give it to a charity  im proved right and now im done with the damned thing  goodmorning       he makes a little bow to canynge and twisden and turns to face      dancy who has never moved  the two stand motionless looking at      each other then de levis shrugs his shoulders and walks out  when      he is gone there is a silence  canynge  suddenly  you heard what he said dancy  you have no time to lose       but dancy does not stir  twisden  captain dancy       slowly without turning his head rather like a man in a dream      dancy walks across the room and goes out                              curtain    scene iii       the dancys sittingroom a few minutes later  mabel dancy is      sitting alone on the sofa with a newspaper on her lap  she is only      just up and has a bottle of smellingsalts in her hand  two or      three other newspapers are dumped on the arm of the sofa  she      topples the one off her lap and takes up another as if she couldnt      keep away from them drops it in turn and sits staring before her      sniffing at the salts  the door right is opened and dancy comes      in  mabel  utterly  surprised  ronny  do

to the hearth       mabel too gets up  she presses her hands to her forehead then      walks blindly round to behind the sofa and stands looking straight      in front of her  mabel  coldly  what has

and puts it to his lips  the bell rings  mabel  in terror  whos that       the bell rings again  dancy moves towards the door  no  let me       she passes him and steals out to the outer door of the flat where      she stands listening  the bell rings again  she looks through the      slit of the letterbox  while she is gone dancy stands quite still      till she comes back  mabel  through the

bedroom door left and stands waiting for her to go      summoning up her courage she goes to open the outer door  a sudden      change comes over dancys face from being stony it grows almost      maniacal  dancy  under his breath  no  no  by god  no  he goes out into the bedroom closing the door behind him       mabel has now opened the outer door and disclosed inspector dede      and the young constable who were summoned to meldon court on the      night of the theft and have been witnesses in the case  their      voices are heard  mabel  yes  inspector  captain dancy in madam  mabel

the      door tears it open and disappears within followed by the      inspector just as margaret orme and colford come in from the      passage pursued by the constable  they too all hurry to the      bedroom door and disappear for a moment then colford and margaret      reappear supporting mabel who faints as they lay her on the sofa      colford takes from her hand an envelope and tears it open  colford  its addressed to me  he reads it aloud to margaret in a low voice  dear colfordthis is the only decent thing i can do  its too damned unfair to her  its only another jump  a pistol keeps

margaret remains kneeling beside mabel       colford comes quickly back  margaret looks up at him  he stands      very still  colford  neatlythrough the heart  margaret wildly  keeps faith  weve all
