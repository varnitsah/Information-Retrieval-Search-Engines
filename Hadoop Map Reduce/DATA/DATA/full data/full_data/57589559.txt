stories called the working upward series  the tale is complete in itself and tells of the adventures of a homeless although not a penniless youth who strikes up an acquaintanceship with another young fellow experienced as an auctioneer the two purchase a horse and wagon stock up with goods and take to the road the partners pass through a number of more or less trying experiences and the younger lad is continually on the lookout for his father who has broken out of an asylum while partly deranged in mind over the loss of his wife and his fortune  i have endeavored in this tale to give a faithful picture of life among a certain class of traveling salesmen who are but little known to the world at large especially to those who inhabit our large cities in country places the traveling auctioneer is looked for as a matter of course and he is treated according to the humor of the inhabitants or rather according to the merits or demerits of the bargains offered on a previous trip  i sincerely trust that my numerous boy readers will find the tale to their liking and that the moralto lead an upright honest life under any and all circumstanceswill not escape them  edward stratemeyer     the young auctioneer     chapter i  matt attends a sale   now ladies and gentlemen what am i offered for this elegant vase imported direct from italy a most marvelous piece of workmanship worth every cent of twentyfive dollars who will start it at five dollars start it at four start it at three at two at one dollar what is thatfifty cents rather low lady but as i said before these goods must

is life one dollarone dollar  one and a quarter  one and a half  one and a half is offered oh what a shame ladies and gentlemen a paltry dollar and a half for an article worth at the very lowest estimate twentyfive dollars who makes it two dollars  two  two and a half  three  three and a quarter  three and a quar ah four dollars four dollars who says five going at fourat fourat four four and a halffour and a quarterthis is your last chance remember did you say five sir no well four it is then goinggoingthe last chance ladies and gentlemen goinggoinggone to the lady in the brown dress andrew for four dollars  the scene was a small store on nassau street near fulton street in new york city outside of the open doorway hung a red flag indicative of an auction sale the single window of the place was crowded with vases imitation marble statues plated tableware and gorgeous lamps of highlypolished metal  among these articles was a sign in black letters on white cardboard bearing these words    royal consignment auction co   sales daily from 10 am to 3 pm  inside toward the rear there was a small raised platform and upon this stood the auctioneer a tall thinfaced man with sharp black eyes and rather a squeaky voice to one side was his assistant a much younger and much more pleasantlooking individual who wrapped up the articles sold and collected for them  it was between twelve and one oclock in the day and the auction store was crowded with business people who during their lunchtime had dropped in to see what was going on and possibly make a purchase there were middleaged business men young clerks and several young ladies and all appeared interested in the mild excitement attending the disposal of the goods  among the young people present was a boy of fifteen whose clothing although not of a fashionable cut was nevertheless neat and clean he had dark curly hair and his face was as honest in appearance as it was fearless and handsome  the youth was as much interested in the sale as though he was buying half the articles auctioned off although he had not enough in his trousers pocket to even start bidding for no bid of less than twentyfive cents was recognized by the auctioneer in beginning a sale  the vase disposed of the auctioneers assistant brought forth from a side shelf a piece of imitation marble statuary representing three doves bearing a wreath of flowers between them the bit of bricabrac looked quite nice but as it was but imitation marble it was not worth more than two dollars if as much  now here we have as fine a piece of italian marble as was ever brought to new york began the auctioneer holding up the piece in question and the work upon it cannot today be excelled by any sculptors on this side of the atlantic how beautiful are those three doves and how natural that wreath examine the piece for yourselves ladies and gentlemen it is genuine italian marble and will not go to pieces in your hands there you are sir  the bit of statuary was handed to a gentleman who stood directly in front of the auctioneer he gave it a hasty glance and then started to hand it back  pass it through the crowd please i want every one to be convinced of its quality before i attempt to sell it bawled the auctioneer and the gentleman handed it to the man next to him  thus started the bit of bricabrac traveled from one hand to another until it reached a heavyset man with red mustache who stood but a couple of yards from the doorway  humph muttered the man as he turned over the article in contempt i wouldnt give a dollar a cartload for them here you are  as he finished he thrust the piece of bricabrac toward a young lady who had just entered she drew back in surprise not knowing what his action meant the statuary left the mans hand touched the young ladys arm and then fell to the floor with a crash and was broken into a dozen pieces  the young lady uttered a slight shriek of surprise at the accident and instantly the crowd looked toward her and then at the auctioneer  here who broke that demanded the auctioneer in an entirely different tone of voice as he left his stand and hurried to the spot  that young lady replied a fellow who had not seen the movements of the man with the red mustache  no no i did not do it cried the young lady shrinking back i did not touch the piece sir  well but its right at your feet madam you must have let it fall said the auctioneer harshly  i did not sir  well who did then  a man who ran out as soon as the statuary was broken  oh pshaw it isnt likely a man would run away like that  the young lady speaks the truth sir put in the boy previously mentioned the man shoved the statue toward her and when she drew back it slipped from his hand to the floor she was not in the least responsible  thank you for that matt lincoln said the young lady with a grateful nod i shall not forget this service  oh thats all right miss bartlett returned the boy blushing i like to be of service to you  you evidently seem to know this young lady said the auctioneer turning to matt lincoln  i do she is the stenographer at our office thats how i came to notice her when she came in  no wonder you try to shield her sneered the auctioneer but i cant afford to let this matter pass you will have to pay for the damages done madam the cost price of that piece of bricabrac was ten dollars but ill throw off two dollars and call it eight     chapter ii  a lively discussion   at the intimation that she must pay eight dollars the face of the young lady stenographer grew pale while that of matt lincoln flushed up  ii cannot pay the money gasped ida bartlett i have no such amount with me  its a swindle burst in matt lincoln indignantly dont you pay a cent miss bartlett it was not your fault and he cannot force you to pay  shut right up snarled the auctioneer turning to matt fiercely unless you want to get yourself into trouble  i wont shut up and see this young lady illtreated retorted matt flushing still more you may think you can ride over me but you cant do it ill  hush matt pleaded the stenographer catching him by the arm do not say anything rash  but miss bartlett this chap wants to force you into paying for something you didnt do i wouldnt stand it id fight him first  you would would you growled the auctioneer his face growing dark and sour  yes i would retorted the boy defiantly im not afraid of you  say that boys game laughed a bystander  yes a regular little bantam replied another  ill settle with you in a minute said the auctioneer finding he could not silence matt now madam do you intend to pay for the damage done or not  i did not do the damage and i cannot see how you can ask me to pay faltered ida bartlett  i have proof that you let the piece of bricabrac fall  the chap who says he saw her drop it had his back turned at the time put in matt and turning to the individual in question he added can you swear that you saw the piece of statuary leave her hand  nno i cant do that returned the fellow slowly but it went down at her feet and  you imagined the rest finished matt i told you so he went on triumphantly  see here you shut up cried the auctioneer losing his temper dilks come here and help me he went on appealing to the assistant he had before called andrew  the assistant auctioneer came forward upon this his face wore a troubled look as if he did not relish the duty he was called upon to perform  im afraid there is some mistake here mr gulligan he said in a low tone meant only for the auctioneers ears  some mistake howled caleb gulligan for such was the auctioneers name i dont make mistakes  i saw the man run out as soon as the statuary was broken and by his manner i am sure he must be the guilty party  see here andrew dilks who is running this establishment stormed caleb gulligan wrathfully i lay the accident at the door of the young woman and as the man is gone she will pay the billor take the consequences  the assistant auctioneer flushed up at these words it was plain to see that he was an honest young man and did not like such underhand work  perhaps she hasnt the money to pay  then she must take the consequences replied the auctioneer sourly  not much put in matt who had overheard the best part of the conversation between caleb gulligan and his assistant miss bartlett if i was you i wouldnt stay here another minute he went on to the stenographer in a whisper  why what would you do she returned  skip out they havent any right to make you trouble  but matt that would not be right  never mind go ahead you havent any friend here but me mr fenton wouldnt help you any even if you ask him  the young lady stood still for a moment and then made a sudden movement for the doorway caleb gulligan rushed after her only to find matt lincoln barring his progress  get out of my way boy  which way queried matt coolly  you rat out of my way  the auctioneer placed his hand upon the boys arm with the intention of hurling him aside but strange to say although he was taller than the youth he could not budge the latter for several seconds and by that time the young lady had disappeared swallowed up in the noonday crowd which surged past the door  now see what you have done stormed caleb gulligan wrathfully you have aided that young woman to escape  thats just what i meant to do returned matt with a coolness that would have been exasperating to even a less sensitive man than the crusty auctioneer  i shall hold you responsible for it  i dont care if you do was matts dogged reply shes my friend and i always stick up for my friends  at this last remark there was a low murmur of approval from those gathered about evidently the boys unpolished but honest manner had won considerable admiration  do you know that i can have you locked up  what for  for aiding her to escape  didnt she have a right to hurry away if she wanted to go its almost one oclockill have to be off myself soon if i want to keep my job  there was a laugh at this and half a dozen looked at their watches and left  if you please put in the assistant nervously had we not better go on with the sales the crowd will be gone before long we might make more than what was lost here  certainly go on with the sales howled caleb gulligan i will take care of this young rascal and find out what has become of that young woman  and that man began the assistant  never mind the man the young woman shall pay for the damage done and she can fix it up with the man afterward if she wishes i am not going to stand the loss  it seems to me you are making an awful row over a fifteencent piece of plasterofparis said matt to gulligan as andrew dilks turned toward the auctioneers stand why didnt you ask me to pay for the stuff and done  plasterofparis cried the auctioneer wrathfully that is real italian marble  made in centre street interrupted matt  and it is worth every cent of ten dollars  ten dollars a carload you mean went on the boy come let go of me ive got to go to work  youll go to the tombs  no i wont i have done nothing wrong and i want you to let go of me  matt began to struggle much to the delight of the spectators who refused to listen to what the assistant auctioneer might have to say from the stand  ill teach you a lesson fumed caleb gulligan how do you like that  he swung matt around and caught him by the throat and the collar but only for an instant was he able to hold the boy in that fashion matt squirmed and twisted like an eel and suddenly gave the old auctioneer a push which sent him sprawling upon his back before caleb gulligan could recover matt was out of the door and running like a deer up nassau street  hi hi stop him roared the old auctioneer he must not get away  stop him yourself then said one of the bystanders heartlessly we have nothing to do with your quarrel with the boy  you are in league with him fumed caleb gulligan as he scrambled to his feet but never mind ill catch him  he ran out of the auction store and gazed perplexedly up and down into the crowd it was useless matt lincoln like his friend ida bartlett had disappeared     chapter iii  something of the past   matt lincoln did not stop until he reached temple court as that large officebuilding on the corner of nassau and beekman streets is called then he drew a long breath as he took a stand in one corner of a side corridor  there ive put my foot into it again i suppose he said somewhat dismally i reckon old uncle dan was right im the rolling stone thats forever getting into a hole and out without settling anywhere but i couldnt stand it to see miss bartlett threatened it wasnt a fair thing to do and that auctioneer ought to be run out of the city i suppose hell be after my scalp now  matt lincoln was sixteen years of age for the past two years he had been depending entirely upon himself and during that time he had indeed been a rolling stone although not entirely without an object  up to his tenth year matt had lived with his father and mother in the harlem district of the great metropolis he had attended one of the public schools and take it all in all had been a happy boy  then came a cloud over the lincoln home mr lincoln was interested as a speculator in some mines in montana and by a peculiar manipulation of the stocks of these mines he lost every dollar of his hardearned savings he was an oversensitive man and these losses preyed upon his mind until he was affected mentally and had to be sent to an asylum  for several months mrs lincoln and matt paid weekly visits to the asylum to see the father and husband and they were beginning to rejoice over the thought that mr lincoln would soon be himself once more when one day mrs lincoln fell down in the middle of broadway and a heavilyloaded truck passed directly over her chest  when the poor woman was picked up it was found she was unconscious an ambulance was at once summoned and she was conveyed to one of the city hospitals here matt visited her and listened to her last words of love and advice she died before sunrise the next day and three days later was buried  if his mothers unexpected death was a shock to poor matt it was even more of a one to mr lincoln again was the father and husbands mind unbalanced this time far worse than ever before he escaped from the asylum made a dramatic appearance at the home during the burial services and then disappeared no one knew where  matts only remaining relative at this time was his uncle dan a brother to mr lincoln he took charge of matt and took the boy to his home in bridgeport connecticut at the same time a diligent search for mr lincoln was begun  the search for matts father was unsuccessful although continued for several weeks it was learned that he had boarded a train in jersey city bound for philadelphia but there all trace of his whereabouts was lost  matt lived with his uncle dan for four years he went to school in bridgeport part of the time and when not learning could be found at mr lincolns ship chandlery a large place situated down near the docks  it would seem that the tragic occurrences through which he had passed would have made matt melancholy and lowspirited but such was not the case mrs lincoln had naturally been of a light heart and the boy partook of much of his mothers disposition he loved a freeandeasy life loved to roam from place to place with a captain who was a friend of uncle dan he had made a trip to bangor and augusta and he had likewise put in two weeks at a lumber camp in maine and a month during the summer at a hotel among the white mountains doing odd jobs for the proprietor  a rolling stone and nothing less uncle dan had called him over and over again and the title seemed to fit matt exactly  at length when matt was fourteen years old uncle dan lincoln who was then an elderly man was taken with pneumonia and died two weeks later his wife a crabbed woman who detested matt and was glad when he was out of the house at once sold out the chandlery and went to live with her folks in a small village in vermont thus matt was thrown out upon his own resources with no capital but a ten dollar bill which his uncle dan had quietly slipped into his hand only a few days before the end  matt remained around bridgeport but two days after his uncles funeral then he struck up a bargain with the captain of a schooner which was loaded with freight for philadelphia and sailed for that city  when no trace of matts father could be found the detectives who had been put on the case declared their belief that the poor man had drowned himself in the delaware river this belief was strengthened when some clothing that looked like that which the demented man had worn was found in a secluded spot not far from the river bank  but matt could not bring himself to believe that his father was dead there was a hope in his breast which amounted almost to a conviction that some day he would again find his parent alive and well  yet matts search in and around philadelphia lasting several months was unsuccessful his money was soon spent and then he started to tramp from philadelphia to his former home new york  this tramp of about one hundred miles by the various turnpikes through new jersey took the boy just one week and when he arrived in the metropolis both his clothing and his shoes were considerably worn but he brushed up and lost no time in hunting up work knowing that it would never do to remain idle  for two days matt was without employment then he thought of the man who had sold his father the mining shares mr randolph fenton and he paid the stockbroker a visit at his offices on broad street just off of wall street  as it happened randolph fenton was just then in need of a boy to run errands and do copying and after a talk with matt he hired him at a salary of four dollars a week  ill take you in because i thought so much of your dear father explained randolph fenton we were great friends you must know and i feel it my duty to do something for his son  randolph fenton spoke very nicely but matt soon found that he was by no means the kindhearted gentleman he wished to appear in reality he was very mean and close he worked his clerks almost to death and such a thing as a raise in salary was unknown in the office  but matt found it would do no good to complain times were just then somewhat hard and another place was not easy to obtain he decided to make the most of it until times grew better and in this resolve remained with randolph fenton week after week until the opening of this story  matt had been sent by randolph fenton on an errand to temple court to be done as soon as the boy had finished lunch waiting for another minute to make certain that he was not being followed the boy hurried to one of the elevators and was lifted to the third floor  the errand was quickly transacted and with several books under his arm for his employer matt started on the return to the offices in broad street  not wishing to be seen in the vicinity of the auction store matt turned down park row instead of nassau street and so continued down broadway his intention being to pass through wall to broad  he had just reached the corner of fulton street when some one tapped him upon the shoulder and turning he found himself confronted by andrew dilks the old auctioneers assistant     chapter iv  an interesting proposition   on catching sight of andrew dilks matts first thought was to break and run but a second look into the old auctioneers assistants face assured him that no immediate harm was meant and he stood his ground his eyes flashing defiantly  you didnt expect us to meet quite so soon did you remarked andrew dilks with a quiet smile  no i didnt returned matt bluntly  i suppose you were doing your best to keep out of the way of gulligan and myself  is gulligan the man i had the row with  yes  then you are right i dont want to get into trouble for nothing that young lady was not to blame for what happened and i considered it my duty to take her part  mr gulligan was very mad went on andrew dilks still smiling quietly  i cant help that he ought not to have pitched into me the way he did  i agree with you  at these words so quietly but firmly spoken matts eyes opened in wonder was it possible that the old auctioneers assistant took his part  you agree with me he repeated  yes i agree with you gulligan was altogether too hastyhe most generally is returned andrew dilks  ill bet you dont dare tell him that and matt grinned mischievously  i have just told him  what  yes i believe that unknown man was entirely to blame it was a shame the way gulligan carried on as soon as you ran out he turned upon me for not stopping you and we had some pretty hot words  good for you cried matt i must thank you not only for myself but for miss bartlett as well  those hot words have cost me my situation went on andrew dilks more soberly  instantly matts face fell  thats too bad indeed it is he said earnestly why i would rather have gone home and got the money to pay for the broken stuff than have that happen  it was not altogether on account of the broken piece of bricabrac went on andrew dilks gulligan has been angry at me for over two weeksever since i wouldnt pass off a counterfeit fivedollar bill he had taken in i said the bill ought to be burned up but he wouldnt hear of it  but now you are out of a job  thats true but i dont much care working for him was not easy and he never paid me my weekly wages of ten dollars until i had asked for it about a dozen times  i thought auctioneers made more than that said matt there was something about andrew dilks that pleased him and he was becoming interested in the conversation  most of them doa good deal more but gulligan considered that he had taught me the business and that i was still under his thumb  why dont you go in business for yourself it seems to me it would just suit me said matt enthusiastically i once passed through the town of rahway out in new jersey and a fellow not much older than you had a big wagon there and was auctioning stuff off at a great ratecrockery ware lamps albums razors and a lot more of goods they said he had been selling goods there every night for a week  those are the fellows who make money returned andrew dilks here in the city the business is done to death give a man a good team of horses and a wagon and enough money to stock up and he can travel from place to place and make a small fortune  i believe you why dont you start out  i havent enough money thats the only reason  how much would it take  the price of the turnout from two hundred dollars up and about a hundred dollars for stock you know stock can be purchased as often as desired  by crickety if i had the money i would go in with you cried matt caught with a sudden idea that sort of thing would just suit me  you why i thought you were a city boy a clerk  so i am but my uncle dan always called me a rolling stone and that hits it exactly i am tired of new york and i would jump at the first chance to get out of it and see some of the country  then you are like me returned andrew dilks warmly he was quite taken with matts candor if i had a turnout i would travel all over the united states stopping a week here and a week there how old are you  sixteen  i am twentyone do you live with your parents  no i am alone here  so am i i used to live in chicago before all my folks died i like your appearance what is your name  matt told him and also gave andrew dilks a brief bit of his history the auctioneer listened with interest and then told a number of things concerning himself he had been with caleb gulligan four years he had been sick several times but nevertheless had managed to save a hundred and thirtyfive dollars  ive got seventyfive dollars saved part of which i got from other brokers than mr fenton for running errands and so forth said matt that and your money would make two hundred and ten dollars couldnt we start out on that  we might replied andrew dilks reflectively you are on your way to work now are you not  yes and i ought to be at the office this minute cried matt with a start mr fenton will be tearing mad i know but i wont carethat is if we come to a deal  come and see me this evening then i am stopping at the columbus hotel on the bowery  i know the place and ill be up at seven oclock returned matt and on this agreement the two separated  my but i would like to become a traveling auctioneer said the boy to himself as he hurried down broadway i wish i had enough money so that we could go in as equal partners he seems a firstrate chap in every way and honest too or he would not have gotten into that row over the fivedollar counterfeit  matt had lost much time in talking to andrew dilks and now in order to reach wall street the quicker he hopped upon the tailend of a dray that was moving rapidly toward the battery  beating the cable cars out of a nickel he called to the driver and that individual smiled grimly and said nothing  less than ten minutes later the boy entered the stockbrokers main office he was just about to pass into randolph fentons private apartment when the figure of a man moving rapidly down the street attracted his attention it was the red mustached man who had created the trouble at the auction store  please give these books to mr fenton and tell him ill be back shortly said matt to the head clerk and without waiting for a reply he placed his package on a desk and hurried out of the door after the man  illustration the pursuit of a familiar face    y a     chapter v  matt is discharged   when matt lincoln reached the pavement he saw that the man he was after had reached wall street and was turning down toward water street the boy started on a run and caught up to the individual just as he was about to descend into an insurance office which was located several steps below the level of the street  hold on there cried matt and he caught the man by the arm  what is it boy demanded the other with a slight start at being accosted so unexpectedly  i want to see you about that piece of bricabrac you broke at the auction store up on nausau street  the mans face reddened and he looked confused  i dontdont know what you are talking about he stammered  oh yes you do returned matt coolly you tried to let the blame fall on a young lady but it wont work you must go back explain matters and settle up  ill do nothing of the kind blustered the red mustached man he had recovered from his first alarm i know nothing of the affair you have in mind i have not been near an auction store todayfor a month in fact  thats a whopper exploded matt you were in the place less than an hour and a half ago  nonsense boy you have got hold of the wrong man let me go  not much i wont you are the man and you cant fool me  if you dont let go ill call a policeman just as sure as my name is paul carden  i dont care what your name is youve got to go back and set matters straight  the man glared at matt for a moment then without warning he pushed the boy backward matt was standing upon the edge of the steps leading to the insurance office at the time and he went down with a crash into the wirenetting door knocking a large hole into it  before matt could recover the man darted down wall street and around the nearest corner matt would have gone after him but the proprietor of the insurance office came out and demanded to know what he meant by bursting the wirenetting door in such a rude fashion  a man knocked me down the steps matt explained i hope the door isnt ruined  hardly but theres a hole in it  the wire has broken from under the molding that is all said the boy let me see if i cant fix it  he brought out his penknife and loosened part of the molding then drawing the wire back into place he tacked the molding fast again and the door was as good as before  but all this had taken time and matt knew it would now be useless to attempt to follow paul carden he looked around the corner and seeing nothing of the fellow retraced his steps to randolph fentons establishment  where in the world have you been so long demanded mr fenton as matt entered the private apartment here i have been waiting an hour for you to deliver a message to ulmer  grant i hire you to be on hand when wanted lincoln not to loaf your time away  i was not loafing my time away mr fenton returned matt calmly there was a private matter i had to attend to and  you have no business to attend to private matters during office hours roared randolph fenton wrathfully you will mind my business and nothing else  but this could not wait there was a man  i do not care for your explanations young man too much time has already been wasted take this message to ulmer  grants and bring a reply inside of ten minutes or consider yourself discharged  and with his face full of wrath and sourness randolph fenton thrust a sealed envelope into matts hand  an angry reply arose to the boys lips but he checked it and without a word left the office and hurried away on his errand  i trust i make a satisfactory arrangement with andrew dilks said matt to himself it is growing harder and harder every day to get along with mr fenton every time he talks he acts as if he wanted to snap somebodys head off poor miss bartlett at her desk looked halfscared to death  arriving at the offices of ulmer  grant matt found that mr ulmer had gone to boston mr grant was busy but would give him an answer in a few minutes  matt sat down wondering what mr fenton would say about the delay ten fifteen twenty minutes passed at last mr grant was at liberty but it was exactly half an hour before matt managed to gain a reply to the message he carried  when matt got back to randolph fentons office he found the broker in his private apartment alone and almost purple with suppressed rage  you think it smart to keep me waiting i suppose he sneered as he took mr grants message and tore it open  it was not my fault mr ulmer is away and mr grant was busy  why didnt you let mr grant know i was in a hurry  the clerk said he was not to be disturbed just then and  no more explanations lincoln i took you into this office more for the sake of your poor father than for anything else but you have not endeavored to make the most of your chances  i have done my work and more interrupted matt bluntly  stop dont contradict me young man you are more of an idler than aught else this noon you wasted an hour on that errand to temple court and  mr fenton interrupted a voice from the doorway and looking up the stockbroker saw ida bartlett standing there  what is it snapped the broker  if you please i would like to say a word in matthews behalf went on the stenographer timidly  its no use saying anything miss bartlett put in matt hastily mr fenton wont listen to any explanations  yes but it was  its no use went on matt in a whisper im not going to stand it any longer and then he added as the stockbrokers attention was arrested by the reply mr grant had sent i am ready to leave anyway if he discharges me and you will only get into trouble if you mention that auctionstore affair  but it was all my fault  no it wasnt and please keep quiet  but if you are discharged matt  ive got something else in view  oh  well what have you to say miss bartlett asked randolph fenton tearing up the message and throwing the pieces into the waste basket  ii was going to say that i was partly to blame for his being behind time this noon i was  do not try to shield him miss bartlett i know him better than you do he is a very lazy and heedless boy and i have already made up my mind what i am going to do in the matter  and whats that asked matt although he felt pretty certain of what was coming  this shall be your last day of service in these offices this afternoon i will pay you what is due you and tomorrow i will endeavor to get a boy who is willing to attend to business and not fritter away his time on the streets  i have not frittered away my time replied matt warmly and i feel certain you will not get any one to do more than i have done you expect a boy to do two mens work for a boys pay  stop  not until i have finished sir i am perfectly willing to leave even though times are dull and have been contemplating such a step on my own account for some time i was getting tired of being a slave  you outrageous imp not another word from you i will not have you in this place another minute go to mr gaston and draw your pay and leave and never let me see your face again  and white with passion randolph fenton sprang to his feet and threw open the door for matt to pass out     chapter vi  a business partnership   mr randolph fentons voice had been raised to its highest pitch and thus the attention of every one in the offices had been attracted to what was going on  ida bartlett again came forward to speak in matts behalf but ere she could say a word the boy put up his hand warningly and turned to the bookkeeper  i will take what is due me mr gaston he said  mr gaston a somewhat elderly man nodded and without a word turned to his desk and passed over to matt two new onedollar bills  im sorry my boy it isnt more he whispered  thank you returned matt goodby he went on turning to the other office workers and with a smile and a bow to ida bartlett he passed out of the place  not until he was some distance away did he draw a deep breath somehow he felt as if he had just emerged from a prison cell  its a wonder to me that i stood it so long he muttered to himself mr fenton is a regular tyrant and ought to move to russia how poor father ever came to invest in those mining shares through him is a mystery to me matt gave a sigh and for an instant an unusually sober look crossed his handsome face if only i could learn what became of poor fatherif i could make sure whether he was alive or deadi wouldnt care how other matters went i must continue my searching as soon as i can afford to do so  matt boarded with a private family on third avenue and having nothing else to do he walked slowly to the place he wished he might meet the man with the red mustache or andrew dilks but he saw nothing of either when he arrived at the boardinghouse it was still an hour to suppertime he ascended to his roam and spent the time in looking over his wardrobe for matt was handy with a needle and disliked to have buttons off or rent seams in his garments  at length the bell for supper rang and washing up and combing his hair he went below he ate his portion leisurely and was just finishing when the landlady said there was a young lady to see him in the parlor  matt at once thought of ida bartlett who lived but a few blocks away with her two sisters and her mother he was right it was the young lady stenographer  i could not wait matt and so came over just as soon as we had tea she explained i want you to tell me what you are going to do now you are out of mr fentons offices you spoke of having something else in view i trust it is something better  i cant tell as to that yet returned the boy and then sitting down beside her on the têteàtête he told her of andrew dilks and the auctioneers proposition  that sounds as if it might be quite a good thing said ida bartlett when he had finished you are sure this dilks is no sharper there are lots of sharpers in the auction business you know  like the one who tried to make you pay laughed matt  exactly  well to tell the truth i thought of that but dilks doesnt look like a sharper quite the contrary of course ill have to keep my eyes open we will have a written agreement and i will not let the outfit go out of my sight at least not until i know him thoroughly  in that case i think you will be safe  it is possible that we may not come to any agreement he has more money than i he may want somebody who can put up an equal amount  how much has he  a hundred and thirtyfive dollars  and that is a good deal more than you have i suppose  i have saved seventyfive dollars returned matt and not without some pride  is it possible and on a salary of four dollars a week  not much that salary only paid my way i saved the money out of extras i earned from other brokersrunning errands for them and doing writing at home in the evenings  i see it is very creditable to you  yet mr fenton said i was lazy replied matt bitterly  dont you care what he said he is a very mean mani am finding that out more and more every day i myself intend to leave just as soon as i can find another place i have been there three months and can hardly bear it longer  the last stenographer only stayed two months and the one before that a man didnt stay the week out grinned matt they soon find out what kind of a man he is  i would leave tomorrow only i cannot afford to be out of work and times are somewhat dull but about your proposed venture you will need sixty dollars more to hold an equal share if you go in wont you  yes  ida bartlett meditated for a moment  perhaps i might let you have that money she said slowly  whyiihave you got it stammered matt  yes i and my two sisters have saved quite a bit out of our earnings you must know ill have to ask kate and jennie and mother first if they are willing ill let you have the sixty dollars and then you and this dilks can form an equal partnership  you are very kind exclaimed the boy warmly for the offer was entirely unexpected  no more than i ought to be matt you saved me from great annoyance this noon and i have not forgotten the many favors you have done me from time to time when did you say you were to meet this dilks  this evening i ought to be on my way to his hotel now  then do not let me detain you longer  i guess hell wait  i will speak to my two sisters and my mother tonight and i will let you know tomorrow what they think of the matter if they do not consent i can let you have twentyfive dollars on my own account anyway  thank you but supposing the venture doesnt pay we may go all to pieces on the road  ill risk thatwith you smiled ida bartlett if you cannot make it pay in one place i know youll soon find some other place where it will pay the main thing is to make sure that this andrew dilks is honest i would not like to hear of you being swindled  nor would i want to be swindled smiled matt it wouldnt pay and besides i might find it a hard job to pay back what i had borrowed  you may make a fortune  i would be content if we made a good living  and you would be able to see a good part of the country  thats the best part of itto me i hate to stay in one place all the while besidesmatt lowered his voiceit will give me a chance to look for my father if he is still alive  you poor boy returned ida bartlett sympathetically always thinking of him well i trust with all my heart that you may some day find your father alive and well     chapter vii  getting ready to start   a few minutes later found matt on his way to the columbus hotel the bowery was crowded with all classes of people some just returning from work and others out sightseeing and buying but the boy had no difficulty in making his way along at a rapid gait in less than a quarter of an hour he reached the hotel and entered the office he was about to accost the clerk at the desk when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and turning he saw andrew dilks  i have been watching for you said the young man i was a little afraid you might disappoint me  i was detained said matt but i am at your service now where shall we go  my room is rather small and warm but it is more private than the readingroom down here returned andrew dilks suppose we go up there you can sit by the window and get what little breeze there is  they started for the stairs there was no elevator as in all betterclass hotels and were soon comfortably seated in andrew dilks room an apartment on the third floor in the rear  its not a very elegant place remarked the young man apologetically but its cheap and thats what i wanted a fellow cant spend his money and save it too  you are right there  as i said before old gulligan only gave me ten dollars a week and out of that i had to pay for many articles that got broken he put off what he could on me whether it was my fault or not  i believe you said you had a hundred and thirtyfive dollars  yes its not much but its something i wish you had as much ive figured it that we might start with a single horse and an ordinary covered wagon on two hundred and seventy dollars and still keep twenty dollars in cash for emergencies  i have an idea i can raise the amount  you can good enough  but first i want you to give me some of the particulars of your scheme  ill do that willingly i want you to understand every detail before you invest then you will know just what to expect  andrew dilks brought out a sheet of paper and a pencil and began to do some figuring  we will put down our combined capital at two hundred and fifty dollars he said now what can we get a good horse for  two hundred dollars laughed matt  you are right but we must get one cheaper  supposing we look around for a bargain at one hundred dollars then  that is nearer the figure we do not want a fancy animal nor a particularly fast one a horse that can pull our wagon ten to twenty miles a day once or twice a week will answer  yes we can trade him off for something better later on  now ill put down a hundred for the horse the wagon ought not to cost over fifty or sixty dollars  make it seventyfive for wagon and harness said matt  it will foot up to two hundred with rubber blankets and extras  i suppose it will well even that will leave us with fifty dollars for stock  will that be enough  well make it do if we run out i can leave you with the turnout and come back to new york and buy more and have it shipped as freight to the nearest railroad station  i see i suppose they do not do any trusting with auctioneers  not with such traveling auctioneers as we will be i would rather buy for cash anyway for you can buy much cheaper  i suppose you can what would you take along and where would you go  my idea for the balance of this summer would be to strike out through new york state down into pennsylvania and then across to new jersey then we can rent a store in some small town for the winter especially for the holidays and start out early in the spring for the new england states  this plan met with matts approval and he asked what goods andrew dilks thought would be the most profitable to take along  i have a list here in my pocket returned the young man bringing it forth you see it includes fancy articles and statuary besides cheap watches table cutlery spoons imitation gold rings such musical instruments as accordions banjos and violins albums razors whips and a dozen others that ought to meet the wants in almost any small town  can you play the musical instruments asked matt  i can play the accordionnot very well but enough to show the instrument off  i can play the banjo and also the harmonica you had better lay in a stock of mouth harmonicas  i certainly will if you can play them they will sell readily if they are shown off it is good you can play the banjo we can play that and the accordion whenever we want to open up and thus attract a crowd some use a bell but music even when it is poor is better sometimes i used to sing a comic song or two for old gulligan when we were on the road but i didnt much care to do it  no i wouldnt like that said matt  gulligan sold lots of what are called fake goods went on andrew dilks but my intention is to sell honest goods and sell them for just what they are we will perhaps not make as much but people will be better pleased and they will not want to run us out of town if we ever go back to the same place again  i am with you there said matt heartily i was afraid you might want to palm off a lot of trash for firstclass goods and i didnt want to be a party to any such transaction  they continued to talk the subject over for fully an hour and by that time both understood each other thoroughly and had decided if matt could raise the necessary cash to go into the scheme without delay  you see we ought to do all the traveling possible before cold weather sets in said andrew dilks it is in the villages where the most money is to be made especially now when the farmers are about done harvesting and have some ready cash  as i am out of work i can start the moment i get the money said matt and even if i dont get that other money i am willing to put in every cent of what i have now  on the following morning matt was surprised to receive another visit from ida bartlett who had eaten an unusually early breakfast so that she might come over before going to work  i knew you would be anxious to hear from me she said it is all right the others are willing to let you have the money for a year at the regular bank interest three per cent  thank you and ill try to pay it back before the year is out returned matt much relieved  and you have arranged to go into the scheme it is all satisfactory  yes  good i wish you every success     chapter viii  an unexpected setback   the next three days were busy ones for matt and his newlymade partner after they had drawn up and signed such papers as they deemed proper between themselves they set out to look for a horse and wagon  andrew dilks had cut several advertisements of bargains from the morning papers and these they hunted up one after another  the sostyled bargains proved to be more or less false in nearly every instance they ran across some shrewd horsedealer who under pretense of selling an outfit for a widow or man who had left the city tried to palm off on them an animal and wagon not worth taking away  late in the afternoon however when they were almost ready to give up and go to a regular dealer they ran across a german baker who was selling out at a private sale  i vos go to chermany next veek he explained to the two mine old fadder vos dead and he vos left me all his land and houses in bremen see i vos shown you der letter from der lawyers vot have his vill got  and he produced a large letterhead upon which was written a dozen lines in german which neither could read  never mind that said andrew show us your horse and wagon and set a bottom cash price on them  come dis vay  the baker led the way around the corner to a boardingstable and brought forth a good chunky brownandwhite horse that did not look to be over six years old  stand around billy he cried dere he vos chentlemen and chust so goot a horse as der vos in new york  anything the matter with him asked matt as he began an examination of the animal  not a ding sir he vos sound as a tollar and chentle as a lamb i vos use him on der bread route for a year and more  and where is the wagon questioned andrew dilks  here vos der wagon said the baker as he ran the vehicle out so that they might look it over  it was a fourwheeled affair quite large and heavy there was one seat in the center and before and behind this were two big boxes each with a hinged lid in the rear was a rack for pies and cakes there was also a box under the seat and a money drawer which opened with a concealed push button  this is just the thing for us whispered andrew to matt for a onehorse wagon it could not be better arranged the running gear seems to be in good condition too  vell vot you dinks of them asked the baker after they had finished their survey  where is the harness asked matt  here she vos new two veeks ago and here vos der vip too  and what is the lowest you can take for the rig asked andrew we are willing to pay spot cash but cannot afford a fancy figure  i vos sold der whole dings for dree hundred dollar  at this announcement matts face fell three hundred dollars it was more than they had to spend for both turnout and stock  three hundred dollars repeated andrew dilks if thats the case we cant do business with you  dots too pad how much you gif hey  we will give you a hundred and seventyfive  at this announcement the german baker held up his hands in horror and muttered a number of ejaculations in his native tongue  make it two hundred and seventyfive he said  we cant do it  den take der turnout for two hundred and fifty  no we cant do it said matt and with a wink to andrew dilks he pulled his companion toward the stable doors  hold up shouted the baker in alarm dont go yet chentlemen make dot figure two hundred and twentyfive and it vos more as tog cheap at dot  perhaps it is but we cant afford to pay it  if i could haf der dime to sell i vos got more as dot chentlemen  perhaps so returned matt but you havent got to accept our offer you know well look around for something cheaper  you vill bay cash on der spot  yes but you must give us a free and clear bill of sale  i vos do dot make it chust two hundred dollar  but andrew dilks had set his mind on getting a further reduction and at last the bargain was settled and they paid over a hundred and ninety dollars for the turnout leaving them still ten dollars to expend upon rubber blankets and other necessary articles  the purchase completed they made arrangements with the boardingstable keeper to keep the horse and wagon for them until the following monday morning in the meantime they procured some paint and painted over the bakers signs on the wagon and then andrew who was a fair letterer painted on each side of the wagoncover the following    the eureka auction company   best and cheapest goods on earth  there that ought to attract attention wherever we go said andrew when the job was finished the word company makes it sound big and we can call ourselves a company as well as not  on friday and saturday the two made a tour of the wholesale houses in new york and andrew expended the fifty dollars as judiciously as possible in the purchase of goods as business was rather slow and ready money scarce he struck several decided bargains especially in cutlery and musical instruments he had all of the goods sent up to the stable and the two worked until ten oclock saturday night stowing away all of the stock in their wagon  now we are all ready for the start on monday morning said andrew as the two walked away from the stable  yes but we havent decided where we shall go first yet returned matt  let us leave that until the last minute we know about where we are going and it doesnt make much difference what villages we strike so long as we do the business  sunday passed quickly enough for matt he attended church and the sundayschool into which ida bartlett had introduced him and in the evening he packed his valise with all of his worldly possessions ida bartlett also came over to bid him goodby and remained to give him such advice as he might have received from an elder sister  matt had arranged to meet andrew at the stable at six oclock sharp and quarter of an hour before the appointed time found him on his way to the place valise in hand  ill show andrew that i mean to be on time he thought to himself as he turned into the street upon which the stable was situated  suddenly he saw a crowd running up from the block below there were at least a dozen men and boys some of whom were shouting at the top of their lungs  fire fire  fire repeated matt quickly i wonder where it can be  but hardly had he uttered the words than happening to glance toward the stable in which their turnout was located he saw a thick volume of smoke come pouring out of several of the upper windows  my gracious he gasped his face blanching its that stable and our horse and wagon with the stock still inside  that place is doomed said a man beside matt see how the fire is gaining headway they wont be able to save a single horse or anything else     chapter ix  the result of a fire   it was no wonder that matts heart was filled with dismay when he saw the stable which contained the auction outfit being thus rapidly devoured by the flames almost every cent he possessed was invested in the horse wagon and stock and if they were consumed he would be left in new york city next to penniless  close to where he was standing was a grocery store and rushing into this he threw his valise on the counter  keep this for me please he cried to the proprietor i want to try to save my horse and wagon  illustration saving the wagon    y a  and before the grocer could reply he was out of the store again and running toward the burning stable as fast as his feet could carry him  when he reached the front of the building which was three stories high and quite broad and deep he found an excited mob of stablehands cabdrivers and tradespeople assembled each trying to get inside to save his belongings  the owner of the stable was also present having just arrived and was directing or trying to direct the movements of the highly excited ones  go into the alley on the left he shouted you can get more out of the side doors the smoke is blowing too thickly out here  a rush was made for the alley and matt got into the midst of the crowd the side doors to which the owner of the stable had referred were found to be securely bolted from the inside  get some axes  get a log and smash in the doors  never mind that yelled matt ill climb through one of the windows and open the door  good for the boy  give me a boost up somebody  half a dozen willing hands raised matts form to one of the small side windows and an instant later the boys form disappeared within the smokeladen building  he cant stand it in there  hell be smothered to death  once inside matt found it advisable to crouch low down to the floor for the smoke did indeed almost smother him he could see but little and had to feel his way out of a stall and across the floor to where the doors he wished to open were located  im afraid our nag will be a goner he thought dismally a horse never can stand anything in the shape of a fire  at last the doors were reached fortunately he found the bolts at once and lost not a second in drawing them from their sockets then he gave the doors a kick outward and willing hands flung them far back against the side of the building then came a rush of men and boys all eager to save something for the moment it looked as if matt would be carried from his feet  here dont knock me down he cried remember i opened the doors for you  so he did returned a burly cab driver give the lad a show  and then matt was given room he quickly found his way through the smoke and heat to where the wagon stood ready for the start on the road the horse was but a few feet away snorting in alarm  matt had handled horses before and he now knew just the best possible thing to do taking off his coat he flung it over billys head thus completely blindfolding him then he led the animal out of the stall and started him toward the open doors  hi matt is that you yelled a voice close at hand  yes andy and im glad you have come see if you can pull the wagon out  can you manage billy alone  i think i can  but matt had his hands full as he soon learned billy was not in the humor to listen and walk the way he desired he pranced about wildly and the boy had all he could do to keep from having his feet stepped upon  but at last matt managed to reach the open doors and then he gave the horse a sharp cut on the flank which sent him up the alley on a canter the boy did not wait to ascertain how far billy might continue on his way but turned swiftly to help his partner who was straining every nerve to budge the wagon from its restingplace  the floor is uphill to the side doors gasped andrew dilks we cant get it out im afraid  we must get it out returned matt desperately let me get hold of the shafts and you push and be quick for the floor overhead looks as if it was going to give away at any minute  andy did as matt directed and together they strained to their utmost at first the wagon heavily loaded refused to budge but then it moved slowly from its place against the wall  hurrah we are getting it cried andrew dilks be sure and guide it right matt can you see or is the smoke too thick for you  i can see buthold on or well smash into that other wagon  matt held back and allowed another wagon to pass out first in the meantime the burning brands from overhead were coming down livelier than ever one caught matt on the left arm burning the flesh slightly and another landed on andrew dilks neck causing the auctioneer to howl with sudden pain  outside could be heard the whistle of fireengines and the clanging of hookandladder truck bells then came a heavy stream of water from somewhere behind them nearly lifting andy from his feet  but the way was now once more clear and matt yelled to his partner to push both exerted every nerve and ten seconds later the wagon rolled out of the open doors and was guided by matt up the alley  thank goodness we are out panted the boy as they brought the wagon to a standstill in the midst of half a dozen carriages another minute in there would just about have settled me  yes it was getting dangerous returned andy with a serious shake of his head as he tied his handkerchief over his burned neck hark what is that  his words were called forth by a dull boom which made the soft dirt in the alley quake  the upper flooring has come down shouted several in the crowd  they wont be able to get any more stuff out now  we were just in time remarked matt with a shiver supposing we had been in there when that flooring with all the burning hay and those sleighs that were stored there came down  we ought to be very thankful not only for that but for being able to save our wagon and our horse if they had been burned up we would have been next door to beggars  by the way where is billy cried matt i dont see him anywhere around  im sure i dont know  stay here with the wagon and ill hunt him up replied matt and he started off without further delay  the alleyway had now become so choked up with vehicles horses and people that it was with great difficulty that he fought his way through the dense mass out to the next street once here he looked up and down for the horse but could see nothing of him  did you see anything of a brown and white horse around here he asked of a stablehand standing near  yes just saw him gallop up the street was the reply you had better jump on a horsecar if you want to catch him  you saw him run clean out of sight then  yes he must be halfway up to harlem by this time  matt waited to hear no more but boarded the first horsecar which came along bound north he took a position on the front platform and as they moved along kept his eyes open for a sight of the animal in which he owned a halfinterest  ten blocks had been passed and the boy was beginning to grow anxious when chancing to look over the fence of a small yard adjoining a blacksmith shop he saw a horse standing tied to a post a second look convinced him that it was billy and he at once leaped from the moving car and hurried toward the place  well sir what can i do for you asked the blacksmith a tall heavyset fellow as he left his bellows where he had been blowing up the fire  ill take my horse please returned matt  your horse which horse is that  the runaway you just caught  i havent any runaway returned the blacksmith boldly  what cried the boy in amazement why of course you have he is tied to the post in the yard  no runaway here  i mean the brown and white horse  that horse was just left here to be shod  for the moment matt was too dumfounded to speak  to be shod he said at last who left him here  a colored man i dont know his name  but he is my horse and he doesnt need shoeing  i dont know anything about that returned the blacksmith darkly he was left here and thats all i know about it youll have to hunt up the colored man and fix it up with him if you want the horse     chapter x  on the road at last   had the blacksmith spoken with more real concern matt would have believed what he said but there was that in the fellows manner which tended to make the boy suspicious  how long ago was it that the colored man left the horse he asked after a pause  not more than an hour ago  an hour  about that as near as i can remember ive been rather busy this morning  that horse did not get away until about fifteen minutes ago returned matt coldly  oh you must be mistaken returned the blacksmith smoothly  no i am not mistaken replied matt and his tones began to grow sharper he just got away from me after i rescued him from a burning stable he is my horse and i intend to take him away  as matt spoke he crossed the blacksmith shop to where a doorway led to the little yard beyond  hold up there cried the blacksmith roughly you are not going out there  yes i am and you cant stop me returned matt spiritedly i own that horse or at least i own a halfinterest in him and if you dare to molest me youll get into trouble  will i sneered the blacksmith  yes you will if you stop me ill call in the police  at these words the blacksmiths face fell evidently he had not anticipated that a mere boy would take such a decided stand  yes but that colored man he began more mildly  if there was a colored man in the case you can explain matters to suit yourself as for me i believe you caught the horse yourself and wanted to do what you could to keep him  how dare you cried the blacksmith with a threatening gesture do you take me for a thief  never mind what i take you for that is my horse and i am going to take him away  and undaunted by the blacksmiths manner matt marched out into the yard and untied billy who was covered with sweat and still trembling from fright  its playing a bold game you are grumbled the man of the anvil as the boy led the horse through the blacksmithshop toward the front door i reckon you think you are mighty smart  one has to be smart to deal with such a man as you retorted matt had you done the fair thing at the start i might have rewarded you for stopping the horse but as it is i dont believe you deserve a cent  and with this parting shot which by the way was fully deserved by the dishonest blacksmith matt sprang upon billys back and rode off  when the boy reached the alleyway again he found that the fire department had gotten the fire under control and that much of the crowd of people had gone on about their business in the space around the wagon several cabmen were busy getting out their horses and cabs all thankful that their turnouts and animals had not been consumed by the conflagration which had all but leveled the great stable to the ground  andy was seated on the wagon anxiously awaiting his return while the two harnessed billy into place matt told his partner of the trouble he had experienced  that blacksmith meant to bluff you off and keep the horse said the auctioneer if you hadnt come back soon i would have gone off after you  is the wagon damaged questioned matt anxiously  not in the slightest i have examined everything carefully and the stock is o k too we can start off just as if nothing had happened  but we havent decided yet as to just where we are to go returned the boy  oh that reminds me cried andy i meant to tell you before but the fire drove it clean out of my head i saw a fellow yesterday who is going to strike out up through harlem tomorrow he was going to take the very route i had thought out so i was going to propose that we take the ferry over to jersey city and strike out through new jersey first  well one way will suit me just as well as another returned matt so new jersey it is  in less than five minutes later they were ready to start the owner of the stable nearly distracted over his loss was around and into his hand they thrust the money they owed him then matt procured his valise and without waiting to be questioned by the police and the firemen any more than was necessary they drove off  not a very favorable start was andys comment as the scene of the conflagration was left behind but they say a bad beginning makes a good ending so we ought not to lose heart  lose heart cried matt lightly no indeed i am thankful we are able to start even though we do look like a couple of tramps he added with a grin  well take a washup when we are across the ferry well have lots of time for we wont be able to do any business today we must get at least twenty or thirty miles from new york before we attempt to open up  the drive down to cortlandt street ferry was an uneventful one through the crowded streets a boat had just come in when they reached the ferryhouse and after paying the fare they drove upon this and were soon on their way to the new jersey shore  do you know the road asked matt as they tied up upon an open street on the other side and went into the great ferryhouse to wash and brush up  i know the roads through newark and elizabeth returned andrew dilks i think we had better strike along the new jersey central railroad as far as bound brook or somerville and then strike through flemington and across to the delaware river and so on into pennsylvania  that suits me returned matt  it was exactly halfpast ten oclock when they left the vicinity of the ferry in jersey city and moved off toward the old plank road so called which leads to newark five miles distant both were in excellent spirits despite the thrilling experience through which they had passed  i have here a list of all the articles we have in stock said andy as he set billy on a brisk trot you had better study it the prices are also put down and of course we never will auction a thing off for less unless it is unsalable otherwise and we wish to dispose of it  but supposing a thing is put up and people wont bid above a certain figure  we will buy it in ourselves or get some one to bid for us or else refuse to take a bid under a certain sum  matt took the sheet of paper and resting on the box in the back of the wagon began to study it carefully and so absorbed did he become that he did not notice when newark was reached and was only aroused when andy drew up in front of a restaurant and asked him if he did not feel like having some dinner  you can just bet i do exclaimed matt the fire and the drive have made me as hungry as a bear  the restaurant was not a very large place and but few customers were present they ordered what they wished and it was soon brought to them  i didnt want to go to one of those hightoned places where they charge big prices observed andy as he began to fall to we cant afford to cut a spread until we see how our venture is going to pan out  you are right there returned matt as it is i think our supply of cash is getting mighty low  i notice the knives and forks are rather rusty here went on andy i wonder if i cant sell the proprietor some table cutlery we have some on board that is both cheap and good  id try it by all means cried matt heartily  so when the meal was concluded andrew dilks walked up to the proprietor who was also cashier and paid their bill then he asked the man if he did not think some new knives and forks would be appreciated by his customers  i have no doubt but what they would be returned the restaurant keeper but they cost too much money and times are rather hard  i can sell you some cheap returned andy and he mentioned his price  the restaurant man smiled  too cheap to be good he said i must have some that will stand the wear  let me show you them matt go out and bring in a few dozen of the no 23 knives and forks and also some of the x23 spoons went on andy briskly  matt at once complied and his partner continued to talk to the restaurant keeper thus keeping his attention when the articles were brought andy invited the prospective purchaser to make a thorough examination of them  send a couple down to the kitchen and have them scoured they are tripleplated and will stand it he added  andys businesslike way pleased the restaurant keeper and after a little more talk he purchased three dozen each of knives and forks and two dozen spoons  the price was paid over and both andy and matt were congratulating themselves on their good luck when a man who had been standing near the window of the restaurant peering in stepped inside and tapped both on the shoulder  i would like to see your license for selling he said sternly     chapter xi  harsh treatment   both matt and andy were considerably taken aback by the unexpected demand of the stranger when they had come to newark they had not expected to sell anything and therefore had not given the question of a license a single thought  excuse me but i am sorry to state we have no license returned andy frankly we did not expect to make any sales here but were going straight through to elizabeth  very likely sneered the man who was a special officer attached to the police department but i saw you make the sale and you must come with me  oh andy let us pay the license exclaimed matt in a low voice as visions of a week or a month in jail floated before his mind it would be simply terrible to be locked up  thats what we will have to do returned andy who had been through such a predicament before and was not therefore greatly alarmed dont be afraid we will come out all right only it will cost us two or three dollars  i dont care if it costs fiftyi dont want to run afoul of the law returned matt bluntly  nor do i returned his partner  well what do you say demanded the officer sharply  we will go with you and pay the license replied andy  all right  will you ride with us  dont care if i do said the officer and all three hopped on the wagon seat and matt drove off  the office where licenses could be procured was at the city hall on broad street when they turned into that thoroughfare matt uttered a cry of surprise  what a broad street he exclaimed as he surveyed it  it is one of the broadest in any eastern city returned the officer who seemed inclined to be more friendly now that they had shown a disposition to do the right thing  inside of the city hall they were compelled to wait near half an hour before they could procure their license then they were asked for how long a term they desired it  for today only returned andy and so it was made out and as quickly paid for  oh but im glad we are out of that scrape so easily murmured matt as the two walked back to their wagon i was afraid they would lock us up for ten days or a month  they would have their hands full locking up all the peddlers who try to sell goods without a license laughed andy all they care for is the money  we will have to pay in almost every town we go wont we  yes every town some places charge so much that we wont try to sell in them ill make it a point after this to find out about a license as soon as we enter a place  yes do that by all means returned matt much relieved  now that they had a license good for the balance of the day matt moved that they remain in newark and try to make more sales  let us try all the restaurants he said we may be able to sell more of those knives and forks and spoons  i am willing said andy this isnt exactly auctioneering but it pays just as well so we have no cause to grumble  they turned back into the business portion of the city and drove along slowly until two restaurants directly opposite to each other were reached  ill take one and you can take the other said andy be sure and sell all you can he added with a laugh  matt nodded and with half a dozen samples under his arm he entered the restaurant on the right  it must be confessed that the boys heart beat rather fast this was the first time he had endeavored to effect a sale solely on his own responsibility moreover andy was pitted against him trying to sell goods in a similar way to similar people  i must do as well as he thought matt if i dont he may imagine i am not worthy of being an equal partner in the concern  the place matt had entered was handsomely fitted up in the latest style it was quite large but at this hour of the day was but scantily patronized in the back half a dozen waiters were discussing the merits of certain race horses while behind the cashiers desk a young man with an enormous diamond was reading a copy of a sensational weekly  a waiter rushed forward to conduct matt to a seat at one of the tables but the boy shook his head and turned to the desk  can i see the proprietor he asked  the clerk had laid down his paper and gave matt an ugly stare before replying  so you are another one of them he said slowly as he surveyed the boy from head to foot  matt was somewhat mystified by this but smiled pleasantly  i suppose i amif you say so he said did you say the proprietor was in  no i didnt say so say youll wish you hadnt come here if old mattison gives you a chance went on the young man in a lower voice  why will i wish that questioned matt more mystified than ever  because hes a tough customer to get along with  but if my goods and the price suit why it ought to be all right  goods and price what are you talking about demanded the young man quickly  the goods i have to sellknives forks and spoons  oh pshaw i thought you were another of those chumps that want my place here old mattison gave me notice to quit next saturday and put an advertisement in the paper for a new clerk and there have been about a dozen here already  and none of them suit  suit hes a man that is never suited  then perhaps i wont be able to sell him any goods returned matt his heart sinking  it aint likely business is poor and he aint buying more than he can help you can try him though  where is he  ill call him  the young man behind the desk rang the bell for one of the waiters and sent that individual upstairs for the proprietor the waiter was gone nearly five minutes before he returned accompanied by a short stout man with bushy black hair and a heavy beard  well sir what can i do for you asked the man of matt  if you are not too busy i would like to show you some goods which are both good and very cheap returned matt as easily as he could and without waiting for a reply he unrolled his package of samples and placed them upon the desk  and is that what you called me downstairs for cried the proprietor of the restaurant in a rage make me throw down a good hand at cards just to look at a lot of tin knives and forks you peddlers are getting more bold every day the police ought to sit down on every one of you  i am sorry if i disturbed your leisure returned matt as mildly as he could but i thought  you thought you would just like to cheat me into buying a lot of your trash finished the restaurant proprietor well you cant do anything of the kind and you can take that for your impudence  and hastily gathering up the package of samples the restaurant keeper walked to the open doorway and flung knives forks and spoons into the muddy gutter     chapter xii  matt stands up for himself   it was evident by the selfsatisfied look upon the restaurantkeepers face that the hottempered man supposed that he had done a very smart thing in thus disposing of matts wares by throwing the bundle into the muddy gutter of the street  now pick up your goods and skip out he cried as he turned to the boy and the next time you be careful how you disturb folks when they are trying to take it a little easy  for the instant matt was stupefied and stood still hardly moving a muscle  then the boys natural temper arose to the surface and for the moment he felt as if he must fly at the man and pound him in the face just as hard as he could his face grew first red and then deadly pale the man saw the change in his countenance saw the fire flash in the boys eyes and stopped short just as he was about to repeat his injunction to leave the establishment  you are aa brute exclaimed matt stepping forward with clinched fists  whats that cried the restaurantkeeper so loudly that several customers and a number of the waiters gathered round to learn the cause of the trouble  i say you are a brute repeated matt undaunted by the fierce look the restaurantkeeper had assumed if you did not wish to buy from me you could have said so there was no need for you to throw my goods in the gutter  shut up and clear out growled the man i want no back talk from the likes of you do you suppose i buy from beggars and thieves  i am neither a beggar nor a thief returned matt striding still closer and i wont allow you nor any one else to say so  oh you wont sneered the man  no i wont answered matt firmly my business is just as honest and honorable as yours even though i may not make such enormous profits he added bound in some way to get square  see here are you going to get out or must i pitch you out howled the man more savagely than ever  for the moment matt did not reply he was very angry but knew it would do him more harm than good to lose his temper yet he was not the person to allow the insults he had received to pass unnoticed  i will get out just as soon as you restore my goods to me he said you had no right whatever to throw them into the gutter and soil them  what  and let me say too that i expect my goods to come back to me just as clean as they were when you took them  you say another word and ill stand you on your head fumed the proprietor of the restaurant but the look in matts eyes kept him from laying hands upon the boy  if you dare to touch me ill call in the police replied matt more sharply than ever i have a license and by that license the police are bound to protect me now you get my goods back for me and ill leave  ill see you in jericho first  very well but remember if anything is lost or damaged youll pay the bill  good for the boy exclaimed one of the men who had just been lunching in the place i like to see a fellow stick up for his rights  see here i want no outside interference here blustered the restaurantkeeper i am fully capable of attending to this affair myself  well im going to see that the boy gets a show returned the other coolly as he paid the amount of his check and lit a cigar taken from his pocket i dont think it was a fair deal to throw his stuff in the gutter  it wasnt put in another customer hes got to make a living just the same as all of us  oh dont talk cried the restaurantkeeper waving them away with his hand come now no more talk he went on to matt go before i have you thrown out  i wont budge a step excepting it is to call the police returned matt more firmly than ever now that he saw he had friends in the crowd ill give you just five minutes to give me back my goods  the restaurantkeeper began to bluster and threaten and even sent a waiter out ostensibly to call in a policeman but matt was not frightened and in the end another waiter was sent to gather up the sample goods wipe them off and restore them to the boy  good for you boy said one of the customers as he followed matt out upon the sidewalk always stick up for your rights and he nodded pleasantly and passed on  when matt reached the wagon he found andy had not yet come back he accordingly looked around and seeing another restaurant about half a block further down the street entered it  he found the proprietor behind the desk laughing quietly to himself he had heard of what had happened in his neighbors place and was immensely tickled thereby  hullo aint you the boy that had the row with mattison he exclaimed in surprise  i had some trouble with that man said matt but it was not my fault i can assure you  you came out ahead didnt you ha ha ha it does me good to hear it tell me how the row started  matt did so and was compelled to go into all the details to which the man listened with keen interest  served him right he can get along with nobody but you are a clever one too  thank you replied matt  and then he began to talk business showing up his somewhat bedimmed samples to the best possible advantage and quoting prices in a manner that made the restaurantkeeper think he was an old hand at the business  the man was not particularly in need of anything but he liked matts way and thought it was worth something to have a good story to tell to his rivals discredit he bought four dozen tripleplated spoons and a carvingknife and then matt persuaded him to invest in a new toothpick holder and a match holder of aluminum which were both very pretty and cheap  just an even seven dollars thought matt as he hurried back to the wagon i dont think that so bad our profits on that sale ought to be at least two dollars  andy was waiting for him he had sold after a good deal of hard talking a dozen knives and forks upon which he had been forced to make a slight discount he listened to matts story in amazement  seven dollars worth thats fine matt you must be a born salesman keep right on by all means  but i dont expect any such luck every time returned the boy and then he told the story of his troubles in the first restaurant he had visited  it was plucky in you to stick out as you did was andys comment i dont believe i could have done it i would have gone out and picked up the things myself  i wouldnt never cried matt and his whole face showed the spirit within him  it was only four oclock in the afternoon and andy suggested that they continue to try their luck until sundown so they drove on down the street slowly visiting every restaurant and many stores on the way  in one place matt sold a dozen spoons and in another a fancy waterpitcher andy sold some spoons also and a cheap watch and chain which the buyer explained he intended to sell to some customer for double the money  at the last place at which they stopped andy made arrangements to remain all night a stable was also found for billy and the wagon and by eight oclock the partners found themselves free from business cares matt moved that they have supper and to this andy willingly agreed  while the two were waiting for their orders to be filled andy brought out a bit of paper and a pencil and began to figure  the net receipts for the day were eighteen dollars and a half he said when he had finished the goods and the license cost thirteen dollars and sixty cents that leaves a profit of four dollars and ninety cents which is not so bad considering that we only worked about five hours all told  and what were our expenses asked matt  andy did a little more figuring  expenses from this morning until tomorrow morning including this supper about two dollars and thirty cents  then we have two dollars and sixty cents over all  yes that is without counting wear and tear on wagon harness and so forth  of course but that isnt so bad  indeed it is not returned andy if we do as well as that every day we shall get along very well although i trust to do even better     chapter xiii  the corn salve doctor   after supper the two partners found that time hung a little heavily upon their hands matt suggested that they walk around the city a bit taking in the sights but andy was too tired  ill tell you what i will do though said the older member of the firm ill get one of the accordions out and you can get a banjo and we can practice a little there is nothing like being prepared for an emergency you know  that is true and well have to brush up quite a bit if we wish to play in public laughed matt  he accompanied andy to the barn where the wagon was stored and they brought not only the accordion and the banjo but also a violin and a mouth harmonica  these instruments they took to the bedroom which had been assigned to them and here while it was yet early they tuned up and began to practice upon such simple tunes as both knew by heart matt first tried the banjo and after he had it in tune with the accordion the partners played half a dozen selections quite creditably  we wouldnt do for grand opera soloists but i guess it will be good enough to attract crowds in small country towns laughed andy as he ground out a lively german waltz  supposing we try the violin and banjo suggested matt and andy took up the king of instruments  but this did not go so well and it was not long before andy turned back to the accordion which according to his statement halfplayed itself matt tried the mouth harmonica and surprised not only andy but half a dozen listeners by the wonderful effects he produced upon the little instrument  good for you shouted andy as matt finished a particularly clever selection if the auction business fails you can go on the variety stage  no thank you returned matt i understand enough about it to know that it is little better than a dogs life i just as lief stick to what im doing or become a traveling order salesman for some big new york house  well i dont know but what that shows your levelheadedness returned andy  the two slept soundly that night matt was up at five oclock the next morning and he at once aroused his partner they had an early breakfast and then walked around to the stable where the wagon was housed  while they were hitching up billy a middleaged man rather slouchy in appearance came shuffling in  are you the two young fellers whats running this here auction wagon he began addressing matt  we are returned the boy what do you want  pretty good business aint it went on the stranger without answering the question which had been put  sometimes it is  i reckon theres a heap of money in it proceeded the shabby stranger  well we are not yet millionaires put in andy with a pleasant laugh  i know a feller what made a pile of money in the auction business remarked the man as he ejected a quantity of tobacco juice from his mouth he was a ripsnorter at it thoughcould talk a table into walking offand keep it up all day and half the night  to this statement matt and andy made no reply neither liked the looks of the newcomer and both wished he would go away  say you dont want to take a fellow in do you asked the man after a slight pause as he came close beside matt who was nearest to him  no we havent any work for an outsider returned the boy  im a rustler when i get agoing let me tell you i can tell stories and sing and sell more goods than any one has any idea of besides that ive got a new corn salve i put up myself which goes like hot cakes barberrys lightning salve i call itmy name is paul barberry you knowdr barberry most of em call me say the word and ill go with you and put up my salve against your outfit and well share and share alike  as i said before we have no room for an outsider returned matt while andy nodded approvingly the wagon seat only holds two and besides our plans are all completed for our trip  humph the mans face took on a sour look you are missing the chance of your lives  well risk it laughed andy  i can sell more salve than you can sell other goods every day in the weekand make more money too  then you had better start aloneand at once returned andy shortly  i willif you fellers wont take me in as a working partner i made the suggestion only because i thought it would be more pleasant to travel in a company of three  we are satisfied to go it without outside assistance cried matt as he hopped on the seat all ready andy  yes go on returned his partner climbing up beside him  then you wont make a deal with me questioned paul barberry more sourly than ever  no replied matt and andy in a breath and while one gathered up the lines the other spoke to the horse and the turnout began to leave the stable  all right shouted paul barberry you may be sorry for it you young fellows think you know it all but you may get tripped up badly before long and picking up an ancient and decidedly rusty travelingbag which he possessed the corn salve doctor trudged away up the street  what a forward man exclaimed matt as they moved off why he actually wanted to force himself on us  there are a good many such fellows on the road returned andy the moment they see some one who appears to be prospering they try their best to get in with him i dare say that dr paul barberry is about broke and would consider it a windfall of fortune to be taken in by the owners and managers of the eureka auction co  i wonder if well meet him again mused matt as he looked back just in time to see the shabby figure disappear around a corner  oh he may turn up again such fellows very often do replied andy  but neither he nor matt dreamed of the peculiar circumstances under which they would again come in contact with paul barberry  the day was warm and bright and billy the horse appeared in excellent spirits by the way he trotted along over the macadamized road from newark to elizabeth  it was not their intention to stop at the latter place but just as they reached the outskirts of the city billy began to limp and they saw that one of his shoes had become loose  well have to take him around to a blacksmith shop said andy and they accordingly drove on until such a place was reached  here they found they would have to wait until dinnertime before the shoe could be refitted rather than go to the trouble and expense of getting a license however they decided to spend the time in walking around  this is one of the oldest towns in new jersey remarked andy as they walked around the depots and down broad street the main thoroughfare down along the water front is one of the largest sewing machine factories in the world i was through it once and i can tell you it was a sight well worth seeing  just before twelve oclock they stopped in a restaurant not far from the blacksmith shop and had dinner by the time this was over billys shoe had been readjusted and once more they were off  it was easy driving along the smooth country road and after passing through cranford westfield and several smaller places they struck out for plainfield which andy declared was to be their first regular stopping place  it is a fairsized city he said and if we can strike the right stand we ought to do well there for several days or a week  i hope we do well returned matt we need a good start for as yet our ready funds are rather low  you will have your first chance to do a bit of regular auctioneering smiled andy i trust you are not nervous over the prospects  never mind if i am returned matt bravely i am going to do my best if i get nervous ill get over it just as quickly as i can  some time before sundown they entered plainfield half an hour later they found a suitable stopping place and then andy went off to secure some stand where they might do business  he came back in an hour and stated that he had secured an empty store which would be much better than selling from the wagon  the store will only cost us a dollar a day as long as we use it and we ought to be able to make that much more out of it he said  they went to work that night transferring the stock from the wagon to the store shelves and when this was finished both set to work to wash and dress the show window  on the following morning at ten oclock they hung out a red flag and then the eureka auction co was ready for business     chapter xiv  the young auctioneer   i feel like a cat in a strange garret exclaimed matt as he walked up and down behind the counter on a raised platform he and andy had placed there this is like going into cold water an inch at a time i would rather plunge in head first  then here goes cried andy catching up an accordion that stood close at hand let us see what we can do toward drawing a crowd in there must be something going on for the streets are filling up with people  there is a cheap circus to exhibit i saw the posters perhaps they intend to give a parade  most likely get your banjo matt and let us give them our best selection  matt did as requested and as the music rang out those on the pavement began to pause and half a dozen stopped at the open door and peered in  come right in come right in shouted andy the auction is now about to begin and you dont want to miss the chance of your lives  plenty of room for everybody shouted matt directly after him his voice was a trifle unsteady through excitement dont wait outside but secure a good place where you can hear and see all that is going on you need not buy if you do not wish one more tune ladies and gentlemen and then we will show you the best bargains ever exhibited in this city thats right come right in  thus urged the folks began to drift in singly and in pairs until when the next tune was finished the store held perhaps twentyfive men women and boys several children had tried to enter but andy had shook his head at them and thus kept them outside  say whats them pocketknives worth asked one old man evidently from the country as he pointed to a board stuck full of the glittering blades  which knife sir asked matt in a businesslike way  that one with the buckhorn handle and prunin blade  that sir is one of our best knives well made of the best steel and one that ought to last you a good many years what do you offer for it sir  offer repeated the old man in astonishment  yes sir make an offer please  aint you got no price sot on it  no sir this is an auction store and we take what we can get for a thing come make an offer  ill give ye a quarter for it said the old man after considerable hesitation  a quarter i am offered for this beautiful knife shouted matt taking up the blade and holding it up so that all might see it it is a knife with four strong blades a buckhorn handle well riveted and extratempered springs fully warranted a quarter ladies and gentlemen who says thirty cents  thirty returned a young man after an examination of the knife  thirty cents i am offered thirty thirty some one make it thirtyfive  thirtyfive cents put in the old countryman i guess that knife is wuth that to me  forty said the young man promptly he appeared to be rich and was bidding more to tease the old countryman than because he desired the knife  illustration the young auctioneers at work    y a  forty i am offered sang out matt who did not care who obtained the knife so long as a good figure was reached forty forty come gentlemen a bit higher than that please  fortyfive cents and thats more than a good price grumbled the old countryman who had however set his heart on the knife the moment he had first seen it  half a dollar sang out the young man promptly  fifty cents i am offered went on matt in a businesslike way fifty cents gentlemen for a knife that ought to be in every ones pocketa knife worth having who says seventyfive  matt knew very well that no one in the crowd would make such a jump but he hoped to cause the old man to bid again and his hope was realized instead of going to fiftyfive the countryman offered sixty cents  he had hardly made the offer when the young man thinking he had aroused the old man to a state of recklessness in which he would keep on bidding offered seventyfive cents for the knife  seventyfive cents i am offered cried matt who makes it a dollarninetyeightfiveeighty and he glanced inquiringly at the old countryman  but the old man shook his head  not a penny over seventyfive cents he muttered in a low tone  seventyfive went on matt come now raise it just a bit the knife is really worth it who says eighty seventyfivefivefive last call remember going goinggone to that young man for seventyfive cents  and matt held out the knife to the last bidder and motioned to andy to collect the money  the young man grew red and drew back  oh pshaw i didnt want the knife he grumbled put it up again maybe youll get a bigger price for it and he began to edge his way toward the door  hold on not so fast said andy in a low voice as he caught him by the arm this company doesnt do business that way if you did not wish the knife you should not have bid for it we are not running this store for fun  the young man looked at him impudently but the clear stern eyes of matts partner made him wilt and muttering something under his breath about getting square he paid over the amount took the knife and sneaked out of the now crowded store  in the meantime the old countryman was about to leave disappointed over his failure to secure the prize he coveted he wished just such a knife and knew that he would have to pay a dollar or more at the hardware store for it  wait a minute please said matt to him i have another such a knife if you wish it you can have it at the same figure that the young man paid  lets look at the knife  the countryman made a careful examination of the blade and finally agreed to take it  ill send my son tom around for an accordion he said before leaving hes dead stuck on music tom is  thank you we shall be pleased to see him returned matt politely and the old countryman went off much pleased over the way he had been treated  at a word from andy matt brought the entire board of knives out so that all might examine them  seventyfive cents was the auction price he explained so any one can step up and take his or her choice for that amount they are well worth your inspection any of the knives will stick but you cant get stuck on a single one of them  this little joke made the crowd laugh and a dozen or more pressed forward to look at the knives one young man bought a pearlhandled article and a young lady bought one which contained a lead pencil and a buttonhook  while matt was making these sales andy was busy showing off the merits of several articles of bricabrac which a bevy of ladies were admiring he told them how he had obtained them at a sacrifice sale and was thus enabled to sell them quite reasonable the lady who led the party did not wish to bid on the articles at auction so andy very obligingly set a figure and after some little haggling the lady took three dollars worth of goods to be delivered at her house on the outskirts of the city  by this time both of the young auctioneers were certain that they were going to have a good days sales  that circus has brought the people out whispered andy to matt we were very fortunate to strike here when we did we must make the most of the day  what shall i try next asked matt i have sold four of the knives  try something small for they wont want to carry bulky packages with them i see there are a lot of young fellows drifting in you might get out the mouth harmonicas and interest them in them ill show those ladies the jewelry and try to make some more private sales  to this matt agreed and he was soon playing a lively air that caused all of the young men and boys to gather around him  any one can play if he has music in him and such an instrument as this in his possession he argued after he had finished to show that it is all right and in perfect tune i will put up the one i have been playing upon how much am i offered  ten cents cried a boy standing close at hand  ten cents i am offered ten ce  matt got no farther for at that moment a loud cry upon the street drowned out every other sound  look out for the bear he is mad  he is coming this way  scatter for your lives  these and a hundred other cries rent the air then came a crash of window glass and the next moment a huge brown bear leaped into the show window not over two yards away from where matt was standing     chapter xv  the charms of music   for the moment after the brown bear crashed through the glass and landed in the show window of the auction store matt was too astonished to move  the entrance of the great beast which had undoubtedly escaped from the circus men during the parade was so totally unexpected that all in the place were too paralyzed with fear to move  screams of terror rent the air and to these the brown bear added a growl which was both deep and angry  andy who stood some distance behind matt was the first to do any rational talking  grab the pistol matt he exclaimed grab it quick  the weapon to which andy referred was lying under the counter just in front of the boy it had been purchased by the firm and placed there in case some ugly person raised a dispute or a sneakthief tried to run off with any article andy had said that the mere sight of a pistol would often bring matters to terms when words had no effect  matt understood his partners cry and he lost no time in acting upon it he caught up the pistol and at once aimed it at the bears head  whether or not the beast understood that his life was in danger would be hard to say but no sooner had the weapon been pointed at him than he arose on his hind legs and emitted a growl that was fairly bloodcurdling to the involuntary listeners  matt did not claim to be a crack shot having had but slight experience in pistol practice and even in that moment of peril he hesitated to shoot fearful of missing the bear and striking some one on the sidewalk outside  clear the way out there he cried clear the way or you may get shot  his words had the effect of scattering the few venturesome persons who had collected to see what the bear might do in the meantime those in the store ran out of the open doors as quickly as they could andy alone remained with his partner arming himself with the longest carvingknife the stock afforded  once on his hind legs the brown bear hesitated in his movements he was separated from matt by five feet of space between the show window and the raised platform upon which the boy stood he did not seem to wish to leap the span nor did he appear inclined to step down to the floor and then up upon the platform  why dont you let him have it yelled andy as he saw matt raise the pistol and then lower it again  i dont believe hes so mad after all returned the boy im not going to shoot until i have to say he went on suddenly give him a tune on one of the accordions  whats that gasped andy in astonishment  play him a tune he may be a trained bear and if so the music may soothe him  andy at once caught matts idea and taking up an accordion which stood close at hand he began a lively tune of a popular sort  at the first bars of the tune the brown bear appeared surprised he raised himself up higher than ever on his hind legs until his head touched the top of the show window then he started as if to dance crashing over every article which was on exhibition finding he could not dance in the limited space around him he leaped to the pavement outside and there to the bystanders amazement and relief began to execute a clumsy jig  hes dancing sure enough cried andy that was a good idea of yours matt  keep it up until his keepers come returned the boy lively now andy for playing means something  andy continued to play and as the brown bear began to dance more heartily than ever the people who a moment before had been so frightened gathered about and began to laugh  thats better than shooting him remarked one man  indeed it is returned another keep it up young fellow  and andy did keep it up until two keepers appeared hatless and almost out of breath and took the bear in charge  doxie would have been all right one of them explained but while he was performing on the square below some mischievous boy threw some pepper in his mouth  yes and doxie went after him added the other its lucky for the boy that he got out of sight for had doxie caught him he would have chewed him up  i am very thankful that he did not do any further damage said matt i thought i would have to shoot him and he exhibited the pistol  its lucky for you that you didnt shoot doxie cried the head keeper you would have been a couple of hundred out of pocket  that reminds me put in andy who is going to pay for that smashed show window and the ruined goods  at this the faces of the two keepers fell the brown bear had been in their keeping and they knew that the proprietor of the circus would hold them responsible for any damage done  well that is not our fault returned the head keeper blandly i reckon you will have to bear the loss yourselves  indeed not cried matt the owner of this bear will pay every cent  well go on and see him then returned the keeper curtly and throwing a chain over the bears head he started to lead the animal away  hold on said andy quietly but firmly you will not take that bear away until this matter is settled matt see if you can find a policeman  a policeman was close at hand and he was at once summoned a long altercation followed in which the keepers tried to disown any responsibility in the matter  whom does the bear belong to questioned andy at last  mr menville the proprietor of the show  then you leave him here until mr menville comes for him was the quick reply mr officer please see to it that the bear is not taken away i think he might very easily be chained to that hitchingpost by the curb  sure an oi dunno about this exclaimed the policeman an old irishman ye had better let him take the baste away  no hell stay here until damages are settled said andy they do not own the bear and if they attempt to take him away arrest them both  andy did not know if he was acting according to law or not and for that matter neither did the policeman but the auctioneers firm stand had the desired effect for the two keepers presently weakened and asked what it would cost to replace the window and the goods spoiled  a glazier was called in and while he was figuring matt and andy went over the stock at the end of ten minutes it was found that sixteen dollars would cover all loss with much grumbling the circus men paid the amount and they were then permitted to lead the brown bear away  quite a bit of excitement i must say was matts comment after it was all over i dont want to go through any such scare again  nor i returned andy but see there is quite a crowd gathered around yet let us make the most of the chance  i am too unstrung to auction off any stuff admitted matt that first scare was enough to take the heart right out of a fellow you go ahead if you wish and ill clean out the window and get things ready for that new frame and glass  so without further delay andy began to address the people and soon he had the store once more filled he kept on auctioning stuff off until one oclock in the afternoon when the crowd thinned out being composed principally of folks who had come into the city to visit the circus  by that time matt had set the carpenter and the glazier to work and the new woodwork and the glass were in all it needed was a couple of coats of paint and the show window would be as good as new the owner of the building having heard of the affair came around to view the situation and expressed himself perfectly satisfied with what had been done  and im glad you made them pay up on the spot he said for if those circus people had been allowed to leave town i would never have gotten a cent  and to show his gratitude he bought a razor and strop for himself and a pair of scissors for his wife  there will not be much doing now until evening said andy to matt so we will have dinner and then one of us can deliver those articles that lady bought  ill deliver the stuff andy i fancy the walk will brace me up more than anything else would  well go on then said andy and so after he had had dinner matt set out with the bundle of goods under his arm  the way to the ladys house led past the circus and with a natural curiosity to see what was going on matt pushed his way through the crowd to where a number of banners were stretched containing vivid pictures of the many wonderful sights which the ticket seller said could be seen within  the boy was much interested in the slick way of speaking which the ticket seller had and to gain points as he called it for the auction business he remained almost an hour listening to all that was said  he was about to leave the crowd when a welldressed man who was standing beside him pushed him a bit to one side and then stooped to pick something from the ground at matts feet  it was a large pocketbook and apparently well filled     chapter xvi  the confidence man   by jove look at that cried the man in a low tone as he picked up the pocketbook and surveyed it thats a find isnt it  it is indeed returned matt how much is there in it  come with me and ill see said the man and without waiting for matt to offer a reply he caught the boy by the arm and forced him through the crowd to an open spot behind a large tree  i would like to know who lost this went on the man as he opened the flap of the pocketbook and gazed inside at the contents by jove look at that pile of bills he went on as he turned the pocketbook around so that matt might catch sight of what certainly did look like twentyfive or thirty bank bills tucked away in one of the pockets must be a hundred dollars or more in it  the owner of that pocketbook will miss it returned matt you ought to make an effort to find him  of course of course assented the man heartily i dont want to keep anybodys moneynot if i know it is theirs let me see if there is a card in it  he turned the pocketbook around and put his fingers first in one pocket and then another  not a blessed thing but that pile of bills he went on now isnt that strange  then he suddenly drew from his vest pocket a gold watch and looked at it  quarter to three he exclaimed in a startled tone and i must catch the three oclock train for baltimore i havent time to look up the owner of this pocketbook valuable as it is  you might take a later train suggested matt  the man shook his head  no i have an engagement in baltimore immediately upon the arrival of this train which i would not miss for a dozen such pocketbooks  then youll have to take the money with you  i wouldnt feel just right about doing that returned the man with a bland smile i would feel like a thief ill tell you what i will do he went on smoothly and earnestly give me twenty dollars and you take the pocketbook perhaps you wont be able to find an owner and then the money will all be yours and if you do find an owner he will certainly offer more of a reward than twenty dollars  i take the pocketbook said matt considerably surprised by the offer  yes i really cant wait and i do not feel satisfied to take that money with me  but supposing i do not find the owner do you not want part of the money  no you can keep it all  this certainly seemed a very liberal offer and had matt had less experience of the world at large he might have accepted on the spot but the apparent openheartedness of the stranger only served to make him more cautious  let us count the money and see how much there is in the pocketbook he remarked hardly knowing what else to say  no i havent time to do that said the stranger hastily as it is i have now barely ten minutes in which to get to the depot if you want to accept my offer give me the twenty dollars and ill run for the depot  and the man moved around as if in the greatest hurry of his life  i havent twenty dollars with me  indeed i thought you looked like a welltodo young man  i have twelve dollars  welllet that do but be quick  and the stranger held out his hand for the amount  never mind remarked matt struck with an idea which he resolved to carry out if he went into the scheme at all ill take the money from the pocketbook and if i find the owner i will tell him how i came to do it  no dont you touch the contents of the pocketbook exclaimed the stranger hastily snatching the article in question from matts hand that would not be right  yes but i will make it right with the owner if i  i cant wait any longer for that train cried the stranger and without another word he placed the pocketbook into his coatpocket and disappeared into the crowd  for the instant matt stared after him and then a light burst upon the boys mind  he is a confidence man and was trying to swindle me he murmured to himself if that pocketbook contained much it was a single dollar bill on a pile of green paper how lucky i was not to jump at his offer when he first made it  as soon as he had reached this conclusion matt made after the man but the crowd was too thick and too large to find him and after a quarter of an hours search the young auctioneer gave it up  it was now getting late and as soon as he was satisfied that the confidence man was gone matt hurried along on his errand  he found that the lady who had purchased the goods had just reached home she had heard of the brown bear episode and insisted upon matt giving her the particulars which he did she was very much interested in his story and after she had heard how the affair terminated she plied him with questions concerning the auction business  you may think me very curious she said at length but the reason i ask is because my only son tom inwold ran away with a traveling auctioneer about three months ago  ran away repeated matt  yes he got into a difficulty in school and when i insisted that he apologize to his teachers he grew angry and left the house  how old was he  tom was fifteen last may  he was very young to become an auctioneer smiled matt i am hardly old enough for the business  he has made a friend of this auctioneerwho used to stand up in a wagon and sing songs and then sell cheap jewelryand he went off with him one saturday when i thought he had gone to new york with his uncle  and doesnt he want to come back asked matt deeply interested  i have never heard of him since he went away mrs inwold put her handkerchief to her eyes to dry the tears which had started one reason i wished these goods delivered was because i thought i might get a chance to talk to you about tom you intend to travel from place to place do you not  yes madam we shall remain here but a few days  then perhaps in your travels you may run across tom if you do i wish you would tell him to send word home he ought to come home of himself but i suppose he wont do that he is so headstrong  i should think he would prefer a good home to traveling around with a cheap jewelry man was matts comment as he looked around at the comfortable house mrs inwold occupied i know i would  boys do not always know what is best for them sighed the lady tom generally had his own way and that made him headstrong he is my only son and as his father is away most of the time i suppose i treated him more indulgently than was good for him  you have no idea where he and the jewelry man went  not the slightest i notified the police and sent out several detectives but could learn nothing the detectives told me that the jewelry man was little better than a thief and always covered his tracks when he left a city so that his victims could not trace him up  thats most likely true but i trust you do not take my partner and me for such fellows added matt honestly  no you look like a young gentleman and the other young man was one too i feel sure  we try to do things on the square we never willfully misrepresent what we sellas many do  that is right and if you keep on that way you will be bound to prosper no one ever yet gained much by resorting to trickery in trying to get along  mrs inwold talked to matt for quite awhile after this and promised to come down to the store and buy several other articles of which she thought she stood in need it was nearly five oclock when the boy left the mansion  a very nice lady thought matt as he hurried back to the auction store i hope i meet her son tom some day ill tell him how she feels about his going away and advise him to return home without delay my gracious you wouldnt catch me leaving a home like that in order to put up with the hardships of the road     chapter xvii  the storm   that evening matt and andy were kept busy until nearly eleven oclock selling goods to people that came from the circus they put up nearly every kind of article on their shelves and only about half the stock remained unsold when they finally closed and locked the doors  that circus was a windfall to us exclaimed andy we would not have done half as well had it not been in town  maybe it would be a good idea to follow up the circus suggested matt that seems to draw out the people more than anything else i know of  we will follow the circus as much as we can matt but there is one thing i must do first  and what is that  take the first train back to new york in the morning and buy more goods some of our best sellers are entirely gone  then go by all means returned matt quickly  but can you get along alone  i guess so if i cant ill lock up till you get back  all right then now let us go over the stock and ill make out a list of whats wanted  let us figure up what we have made returned matt quickly for he was anxious to know what the exact amount would be  very well i would like to know myself  on a sheet of paper they had kept a record of every article sold with the price opposite these andy who was more familiar with their cost than matt placed the amount of profit on each then with his partner leaning over his shoulder he added the column up  thirtyone dollars and a quarter exclaimed matt as he surveyed the result of andys calculations did we really make as much as that  we did of course we must take out our personal expenses and billys keep that amounts to four dollars and a quarter nearly  that still leaves twentyseven dollars for one days work at this rate well get rich fast  we must not expect such luck every day matt remember today was circus day we will have rainy days and days spent in traveling during which we will not take in anything while our expenses go on just the same  but its a good thing we didnt have that kind of a start andy we would have been busted otherwise  you are right there returned andy  by seven oclock on the following morning he was on the way to new york leaving matt to open the store alone this the young auctioneer did and as trade was very quiet matt spent the time in cleaning up such goods as had been handled and tidying up generally  compared with the day before the street was almost deserted but during the noon hour when people were going to and coming from dinner matt managed to start up a sale which lasted until nearly two oclock and by which he disposed of over three dollars worth of goods at a good profit  it was nearly seven oclock when andy returned he had rushed matters in new york but had bought several bargains especially one in imitation cut glassware which when it arrived the next day made a pretty showing in the window  they remained in plainfield two days longer and then loaded their wagon once more and started on the road they made brief stops at bound brook and somerville doing fairly well at both places and then just ten days after leaving the city struck flemington  at this latter place they again came across menvilles circus and as a consequence did a big days business they intended to leave flemington on the day following but after talking the matter over decided to remain until the following monday  on monday morning you can strike across the country for high bridge alone if you will said andy i can take another trip to new york and buy more goods and have them shipped direct to that place or else on to phillipsburg which shall be our last stopping place in new jersey  to this matt agreed and on saturday night all was made ready for an early morning start on monday sunday was a quiet day for both although they attended divine services and took a long walk among the farms outside of the town proper  by creation but it looks like a storm exclaimed andy on monday morning as he jumped out of bed and aroused matt  well if it rains we will have to make the most of it i suppose returned the boy philosophically its a pity we havent any umbrellas to sell  there ill put them on the list at once cried andy with a laugh i declare matt you are getting to be more of a business man every day  if i am its because i have such a good partner for a teacher andy  oh nonsense returned the young man but nevertheless considerably pleased to learn that matt appreciated his efforts you are as bright as any one on the road  when they went down to the diningroom of the hotel at which they were stopping it certainly did look like rain yet there was a brisk breeze blowing and several expressed themselves as certain that it would pass around to the north of them  less than half an hour later andy was on his way to the depot to catch a train and matt hurried to the stable where billy and the wagon were  ill get to high bridge just as soon as i can he said to himself i have no desire to be caught in a thunderstorm on a strange country road  you may get a bit wet but thats all remarked the stablekeeper as he saw the boy glance at the heavy clouds scurrying across the sky that there storm if it comes which is doubtful wont last half an hour  with this reassurance if such it could be called matt saw to it that all was in good condition and sprang upon the seat he had made careful inquiries concerning the road so that he might not go astraya thing easy to do in most parts of the countryand in a short space of time he was out of the town and on the turnpike  had it been a pleasant day the boy would have enjoyed that drive thoroughly for it was through a most beautiful section of the country on both sides of the road were broad fields dotted here and there with patches of woods and bushes several brooks were also crossed and at one of these he stopped for a few minutes to watch a trio of boys fishing  but then the sky seemed to grow darker suddenly and somewhat alarmed matt whipped up billy the wind died out utterly and the air grew close and sultry  that means a heavy thunderstorm and nothing less thought matt i wish i was near the journeys end instead of only about half through with it  presently came a sudden and quite unexpected rush of wind and a second later a heavy dash of rain which drove almost into the boys face  matt at once stopped driving and adjusted the rubber blanket in front of his seat this was no easy job for the wind kept increasing in violence he had barely completed the work when there came a crash of thunder and then the rain came down harder than ever  i wish i could find some shelter he muttered to himself i would willingly pay to be allowed to drive into some barn until this was over i hope none of the stock gets wet  matt tried to peer about him but he could not see far owing to the sheets of rain which fell all around  well have to stick to the road until something comes in sight billy he said addressing the shivering horse get up old boy and step lively  thus addressed the animal started on once more but the rain prevented him going as fast as before the ground was very heavy and the road in spots was covered with water which had not time to run off so heavy was the downpour  presently they came to where the road ran through a heavy bit of timber here it was almost as dark as night and the branches of the trees laden with water hung down so low that many swept the wagon as the turnout went by  ugh i wish we were out of this muttered matt as he tried in vain to pierce the gloom ahead you must find the road billy for i cant see it  illustration a perilous drive    y a  a terrific crash of thunder drowned out the last words billy sprang forward in alarm and away went the wagon over rocks and decaying tree trunks  whoa shouted matt whoa billy whoa you have left the road old boy whoa  but now a blinding flash of lightning lit up the scene and then came another crash of thunder even louder than before billy reared up and then came down with a leap on the instant he was off like a rocket over bushes logs and rocks dragging the swaying and creaking wagon after him     chapter xviii  a holdup   for the time being matt on the seat of the heavilyladen wagon felt certain that the entire turnout must come to grief and that very soon billy thoroughly frightened by the thunder and lightning was straining every nerve to make his way through the woods despite brush stones and fallen trees  between the flashes of light the way beneath the trees was almost totally dark the rain swept this way and that and matt standing up on the footrest was soaked to the skin  whoa billy old boy whoa he called again you are all right  but the scared horse paid no attention to his call his nerves seemed to be strained to their utmost and on he plunged dragging the wagon along with bumps and jolts which more than once threatened to land the young auctioneer out on his head  realizing that something must be done quickly if he would save the wagon from becoming a total wreck matt resolved upon a bold move he tied the reins to the dashboard and then with a swift jump cast himself upon billys back  for the instant the horse worse frightened than before tore along over the uneven surface at a greater rate of speed than ever the wagon struck a rock and seemed about to lurch over upon its side but it righted and seeing this matt began to talk to the horse patting him in the meanwhile upon the neck in an affectionate way  this show of kindness soon had more effect upon billy than anything which had previously been done the animal slackened his speed gradually and then as there came a brief lull in the storm stopped short almost winded but still inclined to go on at the first sign of further danger  as soon as billy had come to a halt matt sprang to the ground a tree the boy had feared they would collide with was close at hand and to this he tied the horse making sure that the halter should be well secured and for the time being the danger of being wrecked through a runaway was over  but the trouble was by no means past the storm still kept on the lightning being as vivid as ever and the thunder causing billy to tug violently at the strap which held him it was with a shiver that matt wondered what the consequence would be should that particular tree be struck by lightning  to prevent billy doing damage to the wagon by twisting in the shafts or by kicking matt unharnessed him and pushed the wagon back a few feet into a somewhat open space here the rain came down heavier but he felt safer than in close proximity to the tree  feeling that nothing was to be done until the storm should abate matt climbed into the wagon again and protected himself as well as he could with the rubber blanket and the laprobe the back shade of the wagon was down and he was glad to see that so far the stock inside had sustained no damage  a halfhour dragged along slowly several times the storm appeared upon the point of clearing away but each time the clouds settled down heavier than before until under the trees it was as black as midnight  matt wondered how far he was from the road and if there were a farmhouse anywhere at hand  if i could reach a house of some sort it wouldnt be so bad he murmured to himself but being out here alone isnt any fun thats certain  at last the clouds seemed to scatter for good a fresh breeze stirred the trees and bushes and ere long the rain ceased although the drops still came down from the heavilyladen branches overhead  as soon as he felt certain that the sky was brightening to remain so matt untied billy and harnessed him to the wagon once more  now billy well get back to the road just as fast as we can he said to the horse and i trust that you will never run away again in that fashion old boy  on all sides arose bushes and rocks and although the road might be close at hand matt thought it best to return the way they had come he wished to take no more chances feeling that it would be the easiest thing in the world to get lost or to run the turnout into some hollow or hole from which it would be next to impossible to extricate it  but to return by the route they had come was itself no easy task in his terror billy had dragged the heavy vehicle over several very uneven places full of stumps and rocks and now the animal still somewhat exhausted had all he could do to move back over the trail which had been left  matt led the horse and on more than one occasion had to place his shoulder to the rear end of the wagon to help over a particularly bad spot thus they moved on taking half an hour to cover a distance which had previously been traveled in less than half that time  thank goodness we are out of that at last exclaimed matt as the road finally appeared in sight now to see if any damage has been done  the young auctioneer made a minute examination of every bolt and spring as well as of the running gear and harness he was overjoyed to find everything still in good order despite the rough usage to which it had been put the wagon body was scratched in a dozen places but this could be easily remedied  the rubber blankets were put away and the laprobe left fluttering in the rear to dry and then matt once more resumed his lonely journey in the direction of high bridge  the heavy rain had left the road deep with mud and through this billy plodded slowly along matt not having the heart to urge him to a greater speed knowing well that the faithful animal was doing as well as could be reasonably expected of him  as soon as we reach high bridge i must find a good stable for billy and change my clothes thought matt and something hot to drink wont go bad either ugh i am chilled clear to the bone  and he gave a shiver that was as genuine as it was uncomfortable  the road now led downward and around a bend where was situated another heavy bit of timber as matt approached the wood he saw some distance back from the road a shanty built of rough logs and boards and thatched with weatherbeaten shingles and bits of old tin and oilcloth there was a rude chimney upon the outside of the rear of this shanty and from this a thin cloud of smoke was issuing  humph here is somebodys home but a very poor one thought matt i shouldnt wonder but those inside got a pretty good soaking by the looks of things  at first the young auctioneer determined to stop but upon second thought he concluded to go on satisfied that no accommodations worthy of the name could be had there  if i cant strike something better ill keep right on to high bridge was his thought and he was just about to urge billy on once more when the door of the shanty opened and a man came out  the man was apparently fifty years of age and rough in looks his beard was long as was also his hair and both seemed to be much in need of shears and brush his clothing and his face were dirty and altogether he presented a decidedly illfavored appearance  hullo there stranger he called out where bound  bound for high bridge replied matt as he drew rein how many miles is it  not many was the rather indefinite reply suppose you got cotched in that storm eh  yes i got the full benefit of it  it was a heavy one no mistake about that what sort of a turnout have you got there  an auction goods wagon  carrying stuff around the country to sell at auction  yes  i see say maybe youve got something you would like to sell me and the man after speaking to some one in the shanty stepped up closer to the turnout  perhaps i have but its pretty well packed up returned matt who was not at all taken by the mans manner well be open at high bridge this evening or tomorrow if nothing happens  we got somebody else with you  not on the wagon but i have a partner  i see what line of goods do you carry  matt named over a number of articles the mans eyes brightened as he listened  let me have a pair of suspenders he said i need them worst way and if youve got a good pocketknife ill patronize you so much more drive up in the back of the house and tie fast anywhere  excuse me but i would prefer getting to high bridge i am wet to the skin and i want to change my clothes  thats all right young fellow weve got a fire inside and you can dry yourself there just as well as not  but my horse  ill take care of the horse ive got a shed a bit back of those bushes come on in what are you afraid of  thus urged matt sprang from the wagon seat to the ground as he did so he noted a look of satisfaction gleam upon the mans dirty face and he saw the fellow wave his hand toward the shantys one window he turned swiftly in the direction and was in time to see two equally repulsive heads dodge aside out of sight  only for a second did the young auctioneer hesitate then something warned him to beware of danger and he turned again to the wagon and placed one foot upon the shaft step  hi what are you going to do cried the man in surprise  i guess i wont stop returned the boy that storm does not seem to be quite over and i do not wish to catch a second dose  but you will stop sonny exclaimed the man with a sudden change of manner hi jake baldy come out here and help me manage this young fellow he went on in a louder tone  the other men at once rushed from the shanty and in a trice matt was surrounded     chapter xix  out of a bad scrape   it did not take the young auctioneer long to understand the true nature of the situation in which he now found himself the three men who had surrounded him were nothing more or less than tramps who had undoubtedly sought shelter in the shanty from the storm that they were thoroughly unscrupulous men went without saying and it must be confessed that matts heart sank within him as he realized the danger in which he was placed  let go of me he said sternly to the first man who had presumed to catch him by the arm let go i say  dont you do it crabs put in the tramp called jake hold tight to him while i tie up the hoss  what do you mean to do demanded matt as he struggled to free himself but in vain  youll learn fast enough sonny returned crabs with a wicked grin just keep quiet now will you  i certainly shall not retorted the young auctioneer hotly do you suppose i am going to submit tamely to being robbed  who said anything about robbin you demanded the third tramp he called baldy although his head was covered with a shock of hair twice as thick as either of his companions you had better act civillike sonny if you want to get off without a licking  you let me go went on matt paying no attention to the last remark let go i sayor take the consequences  the consequences sneered him called crabs  yesthere  and without further warning matt drew back with his clinched fist and gave the tramp a stinging blow between the eyes which caused the much surprised individual to let go his hold and stagger back to the shantys side  howhatwhat do you mean by hitting me he howled  i told you to let go retorted matt and free from his tormentor he essayed to leap to the wagon seat and gain possession of the heavy whip with which he might keep the tramps at bay  but hardly had he placed his foot on the rest than baldy who was now close at hand caught him by the ankle and gave a sudden jerk which brought matt down on his chest and face scratching his left cheek in two places and giving him a severe shaking up  hold the horse jake cried baldy hold the horse and ill hold the boy  let me get at him cried crabs in a rage just let me get at him and ill teach him to strike me between the eyes  as he spoke he rushed past his companion and was on the point of kicking matt in the side when baldy stopped him with a side dig of his ragged elbow  dont strike him if it aint necessary he said ill hold him all right enough come be still now he went on to the young auctioneer  matt was on his face on the ground and baldy was sitting on top of him but nevertheless the boy did not intend to give up the struggle  he squirmed and twisted this way and that until finally free and then before the tramp could catch him again he sprang to his feet and leaped upon the footrest of the wagon  stand back there all of you he cried determinedly and the next instant had the whip and was flourishing it over the heads of those below him  see that hes got away from you cried crabs to baldy in tones of deep disgust now dont you wish you had let me tend to him  stick to the horse jake cried baldy ignoring the last remark ill soon have the young fellow on the ground again  let go of that horse commanded matt let go or ill lash you right and left  the tramp called jake looked up into the young auctioneers face at these words evidently he did not like the looks of the set lines about matts mouth for without delay he obeyed the order and stepped back lie had hardly done so before matt struck billy a light blow and off went the horse at quite a respectable gait leaving the three wouldbe plunderers standing staring after the turnout in wonder and disgust  phew but that was a narrow escape gasped matt to himself as he caught up the lines and gave billy another tap i suppose i ought to be thankful that i was not robbed of everything in my keeping those fellows looked wicked enough to do almost anything  after he had gone on some little distance he leaned out of the wagon to see if he was being pursued but the tramps had deemed it unwise to follow him and once more the young auctioneer had the road to himself  it was not long before the houses of high bridge appeared in sight at the first place the young auctioneer asked for directions to the hotel and here he had the wagon and horse safely stabled and then went to the room which had been assigned to him to change every article of clothing he wore  he had ordered a hot meal to be served and when he came down he found the table spread for him  got caught in the shower eh questioned the hotelkeeper as matt sat down  yes indeed returned the boy and he related the particulars of his adventures while eating not forgetting to mention the three tramps  those three rascals have been bothering folks around here for quite a bit remarked the hotelkeeper after he had finished the constable is after em now but i dont think hell catch em for they slide around from place to place you can bet on it that they are miles away from that shanty by this time  well i trust that i never fall in with them again returned matt with a slight shudder  going to hold an auction went on the hotelkeeper curiously  thats what i expect to do i would like to find some good spot where would be the best place for me to locate do you think  the hotelkeeper thought for a moment  well most of the folks come around here and over across the way to the general stores but i reckon the storekeepers wont like you around much  they never dobut i cant help that ive got to make a living as well as they  thats true tell you what you might do theres the old paintshop next door you can use that for an auction place if you are a mind to be liberal for the use of it said the hotelkeeper  as soon as he had finished matt went out and inspected the old paintshop he found it would do very well for his purpose and on returning offered the hotelkeeper a good pocketknife for its use for the following day this offer was at once accepted and matt set to work without delay to get the place into shape  by nightfall he was ready for business in the meantime he had sent a couple of small boys around to all the houses in the neighborhood to notify the folks of the sale and as a consequence by eight oclock he had the shop quite comfortably filled  without waiting to see if andy might return on the late evening train matt started up business and inside of half an hour had matters in full swing he opened up with a lot of goods which the folks appeared to need and they sold readily much to the disgust of one of the proprietors of the regular stores who came over to see what was going on  humph its only a boy he muttered but loud enough for all to hear what does he know about the goods he is selling like as not they are secondhanded and all shopworn  these goods are strictly new and of the latest designs called out matt looking squarely at the man they are direct from new york and i venture to say cannot be duplicated in high bridge at the price at which i am knocking them down for now ladies and gentlemen what am i offered for this elegant family album bound in plush with sliverplated clasps  one dollar called a rustic standing close at hand  a dollar and a quarter shouted a farmer near the door  see here podders you ought to buy your things of me whispered the keeper of the general store to the latter bidder i trust you till the money for crops comes in  so you doand i pay you for the accommodation too retorted the farmer  i can sell you an album for half the money hell charge you  i dont know about that returned the farmer with a shake of his head  yes i can come on over to the store and see  i want to watch this sale first  by this time another person had offered a dollar and a half for the album and matt was hard at work trying to get a raise on this figure but he overheard the storekeepers words and his face flushed with indignation he stopped short and pointed directly at the man  will you please come forward a moment he asked in a loud and clear tone  whatwhats that stammered the storekeeper taken by surprise  i asked you if you would please come forward  what for  i wish to ask you what right you have to come in here and endeavor to take away my possible customers  why youi aint taken any one away  but you were just trying to induce that man to leavetold him you could sell him an album for half the money i would charge  what if i didi can too  i doubt it if you could folks would not flock to such an auctionsale as this they come here because they can get things cheapbecause they are not overcharged as they are in some placesbecause they are told the truth about goodsbecause they like to see a boy get along in spite of what some mean man may do to take away his businessbecause they  but matt could go no further his unexpected speech brought forth a sudden applause that for the moment drowned out every other sound     chapter xx  accused of stealing   it was plain to see that the storekeeper who had thus thrust himself into the young auctioneers business was not in high favor with the residents of the country town to tell the truth the man was not liked by any one and was only patronized by force of circumstances or through longstanding habit he was a thoroughly mean man and the fact that his trade had been falling off steadily for several years had not tended to sweeten his temper  thets one on ike marvelling sure laughed a young man near the auction stand  yes an ike deserves it returned a woman beside him he has no right to come in here and abuse the boy  thats so he aint added another woman  ike was always highpriced in everything remarked a jollyfaced farmer if he had pickle mountain to sell he would want double price for it  this bit of humor caused a laugh at the storekeepers expense and put him in even worse humor than had matts caustic remarks  see here i didnt come in here to be abused he cried addressing the young auctioneer in a bullying tone  you were not asked in here at all to my knowledge returned matt and you should have remained away unless you intended to do the right thing  see here boy what do you mean  what would you think of me if i came over to your store and told your customers that i could sell them goods cheaper than you could i rather guess you would be for running me outand mighty lively too  that he would laughed several he wouldnt give you time to open your mouth  i came in here because i know all these auction salesthey aint really auctions at allare frauds blustered isaac marvelling finding it hard to say anything in the face of so much opposition these chaps oughten to be allowed to sell a thingthey swindle folks so and if i had my way the constable would  stop right there interrupted matt his eyes flashing when you insinuate that i am a swindler you go too far you must take back those words  must i sneered the storekeeper well i reckon not  very well then matt turned to several men standing by the door will one of you gentlemen kindly call in the constable or some other officer  whatwhat do you mean asked isaac marvelling in a lower tone and much disturbed  i mean to have you put out as a disorderly character thats what i mean returned matt firmly i have paid my license and so long as i do business on the square i do not intend to allow any one to bulldoze me or call me a swindler  thats right thats right cried several men in the crowd and the woman who had first spoken nodded approvingly  youre a mighty big boy sneered the storekeeper but all noticed that he retreated several steps toward the open doorway  i am big enough to defend myself replied the young auctioneer quickly i want you to leave i am no more of a swindler than you areperhaps not as much i am conducting this business on an honest basis and i will not stand by and let you or any one else blacken my character  well seewell see muttered isaac marvelling and greatly enraged but unable to say a word in his own defense and fearful that an officer might appear he withdrew  this little incident served to make matt many friends people always like to see persons stick up for their rights and in this particular case they were pleased to see the mean storekeeper talkeddown as he well deserved to be  the album was again put up and after considerable talking was knocked down to podders the very individual isaac marvelling had endeavored to persuade away from the sale matt purposely let podders have the album quite cheaply and as soon as it was his podders declared he would call at marvellings store and see if it could be duplicated at the price he had paid  the young auctioneer knew this could not be done and he offered to buy the album back at double the price should podders succeed  this pleased the farmer and also many others and as a consequence matt had a brisk run of luck until closingup time the boy felt highly elated especially when on counting up the cash he found he had taken in sixteen dollars one third of which was profit  on the following morning another heavy rain came up and matt found it of no advantage to open up for business shortly after dinner andy came back from new york and to him matt related all that had occurred  thats right matt always stick up when you are in the right and youll come out on top said the senior partner of the firm  andy had struck several decided bargains in goods in the metropolis and had invested every dollar of available cash he had had all of the goods shipped to phillipsburg the next stopping place and said they would most likely find them at the freight depot upon their arrival there  during the afternoon it cleared up and people began to drift into the shop andy opened up the sale and by evening both of the partners were quite busy when he went to supper matt saw isaac marvelling but the storekeeper only favored him with a deep scowl  i suppose he would like to chew my head off if he dared laughed the young auctioneer as he related the occurrence to andy  no doubt of it matt he feels sore especially as we are selling just such goods as he has displayed in his window and at about half the price  well we wont worry him after tonight smiled matt for the start for phillipsburg was to be made on the following morning  after closing up the sale that night the wagon was once more packed so that they might be on the way at an early hour the stock on hand was growing lighter and they were glad to know that more goods would await them upon their arrival  we are doing famously remarked andy if we keep on we shall soon be rich  i want to pay back miss bartlett what she loaned me as soon as i can  i reckon she is in no hurry you had better keep some cash on hand in case of an emergency  the work of selling goods and packing the wagon had tired matt considerably but his mind was too much aroused to go to sleep at once and so he started out for a short walk before retiring  he knew very little of the roads around the village but he was confident that he would not get lost especially as it was a bright starlight night  he passed the shop where the sales had been conducted and then branched off on a road that but a short distance away crossed a tiny brook  at the brook he paused and then struck with a sudden fancy he left the bridge to go down and bathe his hands and face in the cool running water  he had hardly leaped from the bridge to the rocks below when a sudden noise beside him caused him to start back almost at the same time a dark form passed under the bridge and was lost to view in the bushes beyond it looked somewhat like the form of a man but matt was not sure  that was queer thought the young auctioneer as he paused in perplexity was that a man or only some animal  disturbed at the occurrence matt leaped up upon the bridge again without having touched the water he had hardly come up into the starlight when two men came rushing toward him from the road  whos that cried one of the men  that must be the man cried the other and matt recognized isaac marvellings voice catch hold of him jackson  in another moment the two men stood beside matt as he recognized the young auctioneer isaac marvelling set up a cry of surprise and triumph  i told you so he declared i said them auction fellows werent no better than thieves this is the chap that broke in my store jackson i feel sure of it i want him arrested and you had better handcuff him so that he cant get away from you no wonder they can sell cheap when they steal their goods     chapter xxi  the telltale cap   for the moment matt could do little more than stare at the two men that confronted him in a dim way he realized that isaac marvellings store had been entered and robbed and that the meanminded storekeeper fully believed that he was the guilty party  are you aholding him jackson went on isaac marvelling anxiously look out or he may slip away from you  ive got him right enough returned jackson one of the local constables hell have hard work to get away  what does this mean demanded the young auctioneer aroused at last to the necessity of doing something in his own behalf let go of me  oh no not just yet returned jackson youre wanted and you know it  thats right jackson dont let him slip you put in marvelling eagerly hes a good talker but dont let that count with you  will you tell me what i am wanted for asked matt  for entering his store and stealing a lot of cutlery and jewelry returned the constable  fortyfive dollars worth added marvelling and all new stock too oh you thought you would get away with it mighty smartlike didnt you he sneered  i havent been near your store and i know nothing about the theft was matts steady reply  but we saw you run away from the store and come down here didnt we jackson  we certainly did returned the constable with a grave shake of his head  you saw me gasped matt starting back  exactly said isaac marvelling i heard you run out of the yard behind the store right after i had called in jackson to tell him about the robbery we both saw you jump the fence and skip off in this direction  you might as well own up to what you have done added the constable it wont do you any good to deny it  for the moment matt did not reply to this he was thinking of what had occurred at the bridge just before the two men had reached it could it be possible that the dark object which had left the place when he had arrived was the thief rooted out of what he had considered a safe hidingplace  how near were you to me when you saw me first he asked of marvelling  we were near enough  did you see my face  never mind if we did or not  no i must say i didnt see your face said the constable who although a friend of the storekeeper was yet disposed to be fair and square  you probably saw a man and he ran in this direction went on matt  we saw you said marvelling doggedly march him back to the store jackson and well make him confess where he has placed the stolen stuff he doesnt seem to have it with him  if you wish to get back your goods you had better listen to what i have to say returned matt trying to keep down his rising temper i did not enter your store but perhaps i can put you on the track of the party who did  oh pshaw thats all talk snarled isaac marvelling march him back jackson  it wont do any harm to listen to his story said the constable meekly i reckon you want to get the goods back more than anything  of course of course responded the storekeeper eagerly i cant afford to lose fortyfive dollars worth of stuff at once  you say you didnt do the job and that you think you can put us on the right track  i think i can do something for you returned matt  and in a few brief words he told how he happened to be at the bridge and what he had seen the constable listened with deep interest but isaac marvelling poohpoohed the whole story  hes a good one at telling em said the storekeeper i dont place no credit in what he says  well it wont do any harm to investigate replied jackson you hold him while i light my lantern and take a look under the bridge  he may try to get away from me said marvelling as he surveyed matts tall and wellbuilt form with some trepidation he would most likely do anything to keep out of jail  i have more at stake than you have cried the young auctioneer  indeed  yes sir i consider my reputation worth considerably more than a paltry fortyfive dollars  do you well to me the reputation of a traveling and swindling auctioneer isnt worth much grumbled isaac marvelling  you may regret those words was matts brief reply and for the time being he said no more  in the meanwhile jackson had struck a match and lit the somewhat smoky lantern he carried  seeing to it that matt was safe in marvellings custody the constable sprang down from the bridge to the rocks below a second later he disappeared under the bridge  the two above heard him rummaging around in the loose stones and among the brush for all of five minutes both listened for some call from him the storekeeper all the while keeping a tight hold on matts arm  well have you found anything cried the storekeeper at last unable longer to stand the suspense  i have returned jackson and a second later he appeared again holding in his hand a carvingknife and two spoons  found these under the bridge he explained as he clambered up upon the structure again they are your goods i take it  of course they are my goods cried isaac marvelling as he glanced at the articles is that all he went on disappointedly  thats all i could find there may be more there or in the water  this young rascal threw them there cried the storekeeper shaking matts arm savagely you imp tell me where the other things are at once or ill skin you alive  look here mr marvelling i want you to let go of me and be reasonable returned matt as calmly as he could i am not a thief if i was would i tell the story i did or send down your companion to find those things my story about that object under the bridge is true and to my way of thinking it was the thief you saw jump the fence and run in this direction when i sprang down to bathe my face and hands he got scared and ran out on the other side of the bridge and in his hurry he must have dropped the things which have been found  stuff and nonsense  his story may be true put in jackson mildly  my advice is to follow up the brook and see if you cannot track the thief went on the young auctioneer and do not lose any time in doing it  and what will become of you sneered the storekeeper  i will go with you if you wish  thats a good idea said the constable come let us start without delay if we cant find anybody we can take the boy to the lockup anyway  isaac marvelling grumbled but at last consented and soon all three were down under the bridge here it was pitchdark and the feeble rays of the lantern only lit up a circle that was less than three yards in diameter  in hopes of clearing himself more than for the purpose of aiding isaac marvelling in the recovery of the goods matt set to work with a will  here is another spoon he said presently and he handed over a silverplated affair which at the most was not worth fifteen cents wholesale  here are a couple of knives added jackson and here is a bit of paper some of the stuff must have been wrapped in  look here suddenly cried matt as he pointed down into the water heres a mans cap and it looks as if it had just fallen in for one side of the peak is not yet wet  let me see that cap returned the constable quickly  he snatched it from matts hand and turned with it to the lantern his examination lasted but a few seconds  say marvelling have you seen anything of old joe yedley lately he asked turning to the storekeeper  yedley why yes he was in the store begging only yesterday was the reply but what has he  did you give him anything  give him anything cried marvelling wrathfully not a cent i told him to clear out that i didnt want him to ever come in again i have no use for beggars  did he go near the case with the cutlery and jewelry in it  humph i suppose he did but what has he to do with this  this is joe yedleys cap i would know it out of a thousand he is an old offender and it is more than likely that he is the thief     chapter xxii  the shanty in the woods   the reader may rest assured that matt listened with deep interest to the words of the constable he knew nothing of the man that had been mentioned as the probable thief but he was willing to believe jacksons supposition true  that joe yedleys cap returned isaac marvelling slowly  certainly you ought to know it well enough he has worn nothing else for years  humph how did it get here  the man must have dropped it in his haste to get away when i came here said matt he left in a big hurry  thats most likely it said the constable to tell the truth it looks just like a piece of yedleys work he added slowly he did it in order to get square as much as anything i reckon he always resented being called a beggar  humph muttered isaac marvelling not particularly pleased over the turn affairs seemed to be taking he may be guilty and he may not be i rather think you had better hold this young fellow for awhile yet  just as you say  you may hold me if you wish put in the young auctioneer but if you want to get all of your stuff back you had better follow up this yedley  ill do that returned the constable i have an idea i can find out where he has gone to he has several old hangouts here and most likely hell be at one or another of them  are any of the places close at hand  he used to put up at a shanty back here in the woods was the slow reply it is possible he has struck for that placeor else for bill voeglers barn  supposing we three make for the shanty without delay  the matter was talked over and finally isaac marvelling urged on solely by the desire to recover his goods and not to clear matt consented to accompany the others to the place the constable had named  it was a dark and lonely road the trio had to travel but jackson knew the way well and to avoid suspicion put out the light he cautioned them not to make any noise and so as silently as indians they filed along jackson first and marvelling last with the young auctioneer between them  ten minutes walking brought them to the edge of a bit of woodland surrounded on three sides by cornfields here jackson called a halt  the shanty is not two hundred feet from here keep quiet while i go on and investigate he whispered  the constable glided out of sight and five minutes of silent suspense followed  it aint likely hell find anything grumbled isaac marvelling this aint anything but a wild goose chase  wait returned matt he must go slow or he may  the young auctioneer broke off short for at that instant several loud exclamations reached their ears  surrender yedley they heard jackson cry surrender in the name of the law  who told ye to come here yelled the voice of an old man git out an leave me alone  i arrest you yedley for stealing hullo hes gone stop him stop him  there was the banging of a shanty door and then a crashing in the bushes footsteps came close to where matt and marvelling stood  hes coming this way cried the young auctioneer let us stop him  you stop him stammered the storekeeper he isis a very ugly man to deal with  and as the old fellow in question appeared in sight the storekeeper dropped down behind the rail fence leaving matt to face joe yedley alone  this the young auctioneer did without hesitation  stop where you are he cried out and as yedley attempted to leap the fence he caught the fellow by the leg and dragged him to the ground  let go of me howled the man savagely let go boy or it will be the worse for you  dont you attempt to rise or ill knock you down was matts undaunted reply just you remain where you are until mr jackson gets back  but yedley would not remain still and as a consequence a fierce struggle ensued matt called to isaac marvelling to come to his assistance but the storekeeper was too afraid to do so and only screamed for jackson to come and secure the thief  yedley although well along in years was very strong and active and matt gradually found himself being overpowered but he held on until jackson arrived and then the man was quickly subdued by the sight of the constables pistol  now yedley you had better tell us what you have done with the stolen goods said jackson after he and the others had somewhat regained their breath  yes yes hand over my goods put in isaac marvelling eagerly  aint got no goodsdidnt steal nuthin growled the old man  we know better said jackson well search the shanty  this was done and in one corner under some loose flooring was found a large bundle done up in several newspapers when this was opened there came to light many knives forks and spoons as well as a quantity of cheap jewelry such as watch chains rings and trinkets the entire collection was not worth over fifteen dollars although isaac marvelling stuck to it that the articles had cost him fortyfive dollars cash  after the storekeeper had made certain that all of his goods with the exception of several cheap spoons which must have slipped out of the bundle on the way were safe all hands made their way back to the village yedley begged to be allowed to go but the constable was firm and the man was eventually locked up and later on sent to jail for one year  isaac marvelling was too mean a man to recognize the service matt had done him or to apologize for the false charges he had made against the young auctioneer as soon as he could he got out of matts way and that was about the last the boy saw of him  but jackson the constable did not hesitate to tell the whole story and as a consequence the people of the village thought less of the mean storekeeper than ever his trade dropped down daily until he was at last forced to give up his store and go back to the farm from which he had originally come  on the following morning matt and his partner set off bright and early for phillipsburg andy had heard the particulars of matts adventures and he sincerely trusted that neither would have anything further to do with thieves little dreaming of what fate had in store for them in the near future  they had done very well in high bridge and so took their time to reach the pretty manufacturing town which lies on the east bank of the delaware the road was a good one and on the way they stopped at a farmhouse where andy treated the firm as he termed it to apple pie and fresh milk he was going to pay for these articles in cash but the farmers wife wished a hatpin and gladly took one out of their stock instead  when they arrived in phillipsburg they found that their new goods from new york had not yet arrived but were told that the cases would probably come in on the afternoon freight after this they started to find a vacant store strange to say there was none to be had which would suit their purpose there were several large places vacant but all of them were on side streets and these they declined to hire  well have to sell direct from the wagon said andy perhaps well do just as well  they found a good corner and after paying a license fee and getting a square meal opened up for business hardly anything was done during the afternoon but toward evening trade picked up and when they finally dismissed the crowd they found they had taken in seventeen dollars  and thats pretty good considering that we are out of many of our best sellers was andys comment we must go around to the freight house the first thing in the morning and stock up again  i see by the posters that there is to be a big firemens parade in easton day after tomorrow said matt would it not be a good idea to locate there just before it comes off  excellent day after tomorrow you say  yes the posters are everywhere  then instead of remaining here we had better cross the river as soon as we have our cases of goods if we can only get a store in a good location we may do better than we did on circus day in those other places  thats true andy for i saw by the bills that the railroads are going to run special excursions on account of the big parade so there will be many strangers with money in the city  as soon as the freight depot was open the next morning the two drove to the place and andy entered the office and called for the cases three in number  whats the name asked the agent in charge  andy told him and an examination of all the freight which had come in was made and then the two made the dismaying discovery that no goods for them had arrived     chapter xxiii  something is missing   the goods havent come in cried matt whats to be done now we cant open up without them and we cant afford to miss the chance of taking a good round sum on parade day  ill telegraph to new york and find out what the trouble is returned andy and he started for the telegraph office without delay  the message was sent to the metropolis within quarter of an hour reaching its destination before any of the downtown wholesale houses were open for business at eleven oclock a reply came back that the cases had been duly sent and that the delay would be traced up if possible at the freight depot there  this leaves us in a pickle for today said andy as he handed the message over to matt  well it wont be so bad if only we get our goods by tomorrow morning andy let us go over to easton anyway and look for a store and if we can find one take the risk of hiring it  so they crossed the river and began a search leaving the horse and wagon tied up at the freight depot in phillipsburg in the meantime  they found that the firemens parade was really to be very large and already the storekeepers were decorating in its honor on the streets numerous fakirs were about offering badges medals songsheets souvenirs and other wares for sale  ill take this street and you take that said andy as they came to a corner go around the block and then take the next block in that way we may find a store quicker there is no use for both of us to go over the same ground  so after appointing a meetingplace the two separated and matt hurried along the street andy had designated to him  here you are gents the most wonderful corn and bunion salve in the market he presently heard a voice crying out made first expressly for the emperor of germany and now sold in america for the first time warranted to cure the worst corn ever known and sold for the small sum of ten cents they go like hotcakes the boxes do for they all know how good the salve is thank you sir wholl have the next  matt stopped short as something in the voice of the street merchant attracted his attention he looked at the man and saw that it was paul barberry the fellow who had wished to be taken in as a partner in newark  give me a box of that ere salve matt heard an old man say and saw the traveling corn doctor hand over a package of his preparation  the purchaser of the package handed over a quarter of a dollar in silver barberry stuck the money in his pocket and without attempting to give back any change thrust two more packages of his corn salve into the old mans hands  whatwhats this stammered the old fellow where is my change  thats all right three for a quarter sir returned paul barberry briskly wholl have the next dont all crowd up at once  but i dont want three said the old man timidly i want my change  youll find you need three find em very valuable sir thats right come right up and buy buy buy its the greatest on the face of the globe bawled barberry turning away and addressing another crowd on the sidewalk  well ill be jiggered muttered the old man and much put out but too timid to stand up for his rights and demand the return of his money he placed the packages in his coattail pocket and walked off  well thats what i call a rather highhanded proceeding thought matt no wonder some folks consider street merchants and traveling auctioneers little better than thieves when some of them act in that fashion i dont think hell prosper though in the end  he was about to continue on his way when paul barberry caught sight of him and came forward  hullo my young friend he called out pleasantly what brings you to eastonthe big parade  matt did not like this manner of being addressed he considered the corn salve doctor altogether too familiar so he replied rather coldly  not particularly we merely struck easton in the course of our travels  oh then you and your companion are still on the road with your wagon  yes  paul barberry seemed to grow interested at once  good enough and how is business  very good returned matt and not without pardonable pride  then you are not ready to take me in as a partner yet  not quite my friend and i can run the business very well without outside help  but you might make more money with me in the firm went on paul barberry persistently  we havent room for a third person  where are you stopping now  we havent a place yet my partner and i have just started to look for an empty store  oh then you are going to stay several days or a week  yes  where were you last  across the river  do pretty well in phillipsburg  we did very welluntil we began to run out of goods  i couldnt do anything in phillipsburg grumbled paul barberry its only a onehorse place anyway so you ran out of goods there  we ran out of some goodsour best sellers  why dont you send for more goods  we have sent and we are expecting the cases at any moment at the phillipsburg freight depot  where is your horse and wagon  tied up at the depot over there and to avoid being questioned further matt began to move off  i think i can get a good store for you went on barberry catching him by the arm  thank you but i would prefer to do my own hunting returned the young auctioneer still more coolly  dont want anything to do with me eh retorted the corn salve vender angrily  i dont want you to take your valuable time in transacting my business returned matt and off he hurried before barberry could offer any reply  he and his partner are mighty independent chaps grumbled the pretended doctor as he gazed after matt with a scowl on his face i suppose he thinks himself above me because he has a horse and wagon well maybe he wont be any better off than i am some day  and in far from a good humor paul barberry resumed the sale of his sostyled wonderful corn cure a preparation by the way which was of no value as a remedial agent  matt walked along for several blocks without running across any empty stores that would be suitable for holding sales most of the places were too small and others were in outoftheway corners to which it would be next to impossible to attract a crowd  at the appointed time he walked to the spot where he was to meet andy his partner was waiting for him a smile resting on his pleasant face  any luck matt he asked  none  ive struck something that i imagine will just suit us come on and look at it  the two hurried to the place andy had in mind it was indeed a good store and just in the right spot and ten minutes later they were on the way to hunt up the landlord and rent the place  it was no easy matter to find the person for whom they were seeking and it was well along in the afternoon before the man who owned the building was found he agreed to let them have the store for four days for ten dollars and the bargain was closed on the spot  then they returned to the store and cleaned it up as best they could and at a little after five oclock locked up and started back to phillipsburg to ascertain if their cases of goods had yet arrived  the walk across the bridge did not take long and the freight depot was close at hand  why where is the horse and wagon cried matt as he discovered that the turnout was missing from the place where billy had been fastened  well thats what i would like to know returned andy i dont see a thing of it anywhere do you  they looked around up one street and down another but neither billy nor the gaylypainted wagon came into view  ill ask the freight agent about it said matt and he hurried into the office  your horse and wagon repeated the agent in reply to his question why i guess your man drove off with them  our man gasped the young auctioneer  yes the one you sent around here to get those cases of goods you were expecting he took the cases too     chapter xxiv  along the river   matt could do nothing but stare at the freight agent a man had come there and driven off with the horse and wagon and taken the cases of goods with him it seemed too boldfaced to be true  our man he stammered we have no man  didnt you send the man here demanded the agent as he stopped short in his work of checking off packages  we certainly did not returned the young auctioneer andy he called out as he stepped back toward the open door and a moment later andy dilks hurried into the depot  he says a man came here got the cases of goods and drove off with billy cried matt breathlessly you did not send any one here did you  certainly not returned andy promptly when was this  less than two hours ago replied the freight agent and he was now all attention do you mean to say the fellow was a thief  he was cried matt  i dont see how he could be anything else added andy did he pretend to have an order for the cases  yes he had a written order  and the bill of lading  nno he didnt have that was the slow reply but i thought it was all right he looked like an honest chap you had better notify the police at once  we will said matt what sort of a looking fellow was he  as best he could the freight agent gave a description of the man who had driven off with the goods and the turnout matt and andy both listened attentively  by the boots ill bet it was that paul barberry almost shouted the young auctioneer ere the agent had ceased talking this is his way of getting even with us for not taking him into partnership  perhaps you are right returned andy did you say anything to him about the wagon being here  i did and matt briefly narrated the conversation he had had with the corn doctor  then the agent was questioned further and it was not long before all three were convinced that the pretended doctor was the guilty party  if i had known he wasnt square i would not have let him have the cases of goods thats sure said the agent meekly  i do not doubt that returned andy but the loss of the horse and wagon is more than we can stand as it is we will have to hold the railroad responsible for the three cases  cant we go after the thief suggested the agent considerably worried for he well knew that if the stolen cases were not recovered the loss would come out of his own pocket  have you a horse and wagon  yes and i can get it in five minutes  what direction did the thief take do you suppose  the freight agent thought for a moment  it is my opinion that he either went over to easton or else up the river  it is not likely that he went across the bridge said matt if it was this paul barberry he would be afraid to take that direction fearing to meet me and my partner on our way here  yes thats so put in andy  then he went up the river there is quite a good road for a number of miles  well supposing you get your horse and wagon said matt impatiently it will not do to waste time here  but what of the police questioned andy  we can notify them when we come backthat is if we are unsuccessful  all right hurry up that wagon then  the freight agent at once disappeared around the corner of the building he was gone nearly five minutes when he returned he was leading a fine black horse attached to a light road wagon  brought you flip my fast trotter he explained he ought to be able to overtake any bit of horseflesh in these parts  well we want a fast horse replied matt as he sprang into the wagon without delay he was quickly followed by andy and the freight agent and off they went at a spanking gait down the smooth road  it was a fine day cool and clear and under any other circumstances both matt and andy would have enjoyed the drive but just now they were filled with fears supposing they were unable to recover their turnout and goods what then  the partners looked at each other and that look meant but one thing they must recover their property such a thing as failure was not to be countenanced  at length phillipsburg was left far behind and they entered a somewhat hilly farming section presently they came to a farmhouse standing close to the road there was an old countryman standing by the gate smoking a pipe leisurely and matt directed the freight agent to draw rein  good afternoon said the young auctioneer politely i wish to ask you for a bit of information  well son what is it returned the old countryman removing his pipe from his mouth and gazing at all three curiously  did an auction wagon pass this way a short while ago  an auction wagon  yes sir a covered wagon with the sign eureka auction co painted on the sides it had a single white horse with brown spots  the old mans face lit up  oh yes i saw that wagon he replied  you did cried andy we are very glad to hear it which way did it go  right up that way and the countryman waved his hand to the northwest  along the river still said the freight agent i thought so  he was about to drive on when matt stopped him  did you notice who was driving the wagon he called back  yes a tall man kind of shabbily dressed  must be barberry muttered the young auctioneer  whats the trouble questioned the countryman curiously  the turnout has been stolen thats the trouble replied the boy and off they sped again leaving the old countryman staring after them in openmouthed wonder  they turned from the main road which about half a mile back had led away from the delaware and took the side road the old man had indicated it was an uneven wagon track and they went bumping over rocks and stumps of trees in a most alarming fashion  he couldnt have gone far in this direction muttered the freight agent ruefully why it is enough to break the springs of any wagon ever made  my idea is that he had an object in coming down here responded andy thoughtfully is there any sort of bridge in the neighborhood  the agent shook his head  no  or a place where the river might be forded  not now the heavy rains have swollen the stream as you can see in real dry weather he might find a place to ford  well its certain that if he came this way to merely get out of our reach he chose an awful way of doing it remarked matt as a sudden lurch of the wagon sent him bouncing up into the air this is the worst riding ive struck yet  worse than when billy ran away questioned andy with a sudden gleam of humor  well hardly that admitted the young auctioneer but that wasnt riding at all that was a slapbang goasyouplease trip which didnthullo look there  he motioned to the freight agent to draw rein and pointed to a deep track in a soft bit of ground ahead  its the track of our wagon sure enough exclaimed andy i could tell it out of a hundred  so could i andy follow that please went on matt to the agent  its queer you didnt see that track before said the driver slowly  the reason is because it comes from the rocks barberry thought it best to keep on the rocks i suppose maybe he thought he would get stuck in the mud with the cases if he got on soft ground  thats the truth of it you can depend on it said andy hurry up and follow that track to the end and well soon have our wagon and goods back  on and on they went over soft patches of ground through low bushes and around rocks and fallen trees sometimes they were close to the waters edge and again they traveled almost out of sight of the clearflowing stream  we cant go much further in this direction said the freight agent when all of a mile of ground had been covered  why not asked andy  there is a big wall of rock just ahead we will have to pull away from the river now  no we wont shouted matt look there  and he pointed to where the wagon tracks led directly down into the water  ill bet all i am worth that he crossed the stream here he went on do you not see how shallow it is he went over to that island and from there directly to the other side     chapter xxv  a bitter mistake   both andy and the freight agent saw at once that matt was right and the jaw of the driver of the wagon dropped  humph i was certain he couldnt cross right after such heavy rains he said moodily  but you see he has crossed went on the young auctioneer i will tell you what im going to dowade across and see if i cant strike the tracks on the other side  youll get pretty wet especially if you slip into a deep hole returned andy  ill take off part of my clothing returned matt and he did so without delay  the water was colder than he had anticipated and he shivered slightly as he waded in deeper and deeper  can you swim should you slip called out andy anxiously  yes i can swim returned matt but i hope that wont be necessary  moving along cautiously where the rocks stuck up the highest the young auctioneer worked his way slowly over to the island he had previously pointed out it was painful work for he had taken off his shoes and now he found the bottom in many places cut his feet but at last the island was reached and he walked out upon the dry ground  it did not take matt long to discover the wagon tracks for which he was searching they were close at hand and led almost in a straight line across the little patch which was not over two hundred feet in width  here they are he shouted back to the others he went right across just as i supposed  humph now what is to be done questioned the agent with a perplexed look upon his face  we must cross and follow him replied andy determinedly  do you want me to take the horse and wagon across  why not the thief took that heavily loaded wagon over i guess this light affair will go over all right  the agent was doubtful about this and rubbed his chin reflectively  i might drive on till i got to a bridge or turn back to one he suggested  that would take too long returned matts partner impatiently we must strike while the iron is hot as the saying is  come on shouted matt from the island come straight over and you will be all right  well we can make the venture but i am a bit shaky over it said the freight agent and with a face full of the concern he felt for his turnout he headed his trotter toward the water  at first the horse was inclined to shy to one side he pranced up and down a bit and dug into the sand and loose stones with his hoofs  you can see he dont want to go said the driver i really think we had better find a bridge  oh nonsense give me the reins returned andy sharply seeing that the fellow was altogether too easily frightened i will take him over safely  dont be too sure cried the agent in alarm he will break at the least little thing  but andy would not listen to him further he took the reins and holding them firmly tapped the trotter with the whip  the horse made a rush into the water and in less than ten seconds the wagon was in up to the axles  we will be drowned we will be drowned cried the agent in sudden terror i cant swim  we wont be drowned just you hold on and keep quiet returned andy shortly  butbut we are going deeper  not much deeper i can still see the bottom  supposing we should slipor flip should slip  or we had an earthquake added andy utterly disgusted with the freight agents actions dont you want to get back those cases or do you prefer to pay for them  this last remark effectually silenced the man he clung to the seat looking badly scared but he offered no more suggestions  with due caution but as rapidly as possible andy drove the horse over the rocks carefully avoiding such spots as he thought might be extra deep or slippery matt on the island shouted several directions to him and thus the journey was safely accomplished  good so far cried the young auctioneer when the horse was once more on dry ground that was easy enough  easier than i thought it would be exclaimed the freight agent with a deep breath of relief i wish we were over all the way  the second trip will be easier than the first was remarked andy it is much more shallow  i will wade ahead and make sure of the way put in matt and without loss of time he started out  it was not so deep toward the pennsylvania shore but the current appeared to run swifter and the boy had all he could do when up to his thighs to keep his feet but the horse and wagon came along all right and inside of ten minutes they were high and dry upon the opposite bank  here it did not take long to rediscover the tracks made by the auction turnout and as soon as matt could don what clothing he had taken off they started to follow it up once more  i cant see why he crossed the river in that fashion grumbled the freight agent as he tapped his horse with the whip  i can returned andy he did it to throw us off the track he had no time to get rid of the signs on the wagon and he knew we would learn sooner or later in what direction he had gone but he thought we would not find out how he had crossed and would think that he had kept along on the eastern bank  on and on they went over the rocky roads now through a sharp cut between the mountains and then again around a curve overlooking some tiny stream far below  a beautiful place said matt as his eyes rested on a particularly beautiful bit of picturesque scenery how can people stick in the stuffy city when there is so much like this going to waste so to speak  thats a conundrum returned andy but i have heard it said that many cityborn folks would rather die between brick walls than live amid green fields  just look at those rocks and trees and listen to those birds sing  it is truly grand thats a fact returned andy do you know if i was wealthy i believe i would like nothing better than to spend all of my summer in among the mountains  and that would just suit me returned matt enthusiastically and then he suddenly sobered down but we are not rich andy and unless we get back our turnout well be as poor as ever  oh well have to catch that thief put in the freight agent he cant be many miles ahead  the trouble is its growing dark and we can hardly see the wagon tracks any more said the young auctioneer  it grows dark early in among the mountains remarked andy if the land was level it would be light enough  on they went passing through several little hamlets at each of these places they inquired about the auction wagon and were told that it had passed through the man driving at almost top speed  he is going to get away as far as he can before he puts up for the night said andy i do not believe we will catch him until we reach the place at which he is stopping  my trotter is not used to this sort of thing said the freight agent he is beginning to play out  at the next town we reach we can hire a horse said matt and you can go back if you wish there is no telling how long this chase may last  i ought to be back attending to business was the agents reply my clerk can hardly take my place would you two be willing to go on alone  certainly returned andy  the next place a village of perhaps twenty or thirty houses and half a dozen stores was soon reached there was a small tavern and they drove up to this alighting matt ran inside and questioned the half a score of loungers concerning the auction wagon  every man in the place shook his head the wagon had not been seen in the village nearly all of the men had just come in from work and every one said that had the wagon been on the main road at all he would have seen it  matt listened with a sinking heart and as andy came in he grasped his partner by the shoulder  we have made a mistake he said faintly  a mistake matt  yes the wagon did not come here at all we are on the wrong track     chapter xxvi  something of a surprise   andy was certainly as much dismayed as matt at the discovery which had been made just at the time when they supposed that they were drawing closer to the object of their chase they found that they were most likely further away than ever the older member of the firm gave another groan and this was supplemented by another from the freight agent  i knew he couldnt cross that river growled the latter now just see what a wild goose chase you have led us  oh he crossed the river there is no doubt of that returned matt quickly but where we got off the track was somewhere among the mountains we dropped the right track and took something that resembled it  yes that must be the truth of the matter put in andy its too bad  whats it all about anyway questioned the tavernkeeper curiously  in a few brief words andy explained matters while not only the tavernkeeper but also the others in the place listened with deep interest  any reward offered for catching the rascal questioned one of the men present a brawny individualevidently a mountaineer  yes returned matt quickly how much shall we offer andy he asked in a whisper  twentyfive dollars would not be too much returned his partner it is quite a sum to us i know but i guess we would rather have our turnout back a dozen times over  we will give twentyfive dollars in cash for the return of our horse wagon and goods said matt in a voice loud enough for all to hear  twentyfive dollars in cash repeated several and it was plain to see that this offer was regarded as quite liberal  what kind of a looking turnout is it was next asked  matt described billy and the wagon all listened attentively and when he had finished the mountaineer who had first spoken tapped him on the shoulder  ill go out with ye and hunt him up stranger  so will i cried another  and i added a third and soon six men stood ready to continue the search with andy and matt  seeing this the freight agent decided to drive back home taking a much better road which led down to easton he did not lose any time in starting and if the truth must be told both andy and matt were glad to be rid of him  after he had gone the auctioneers procured another horse and wagon from the tavernkeeper and also a couple of lanterns the mountaineer had a mule upon which he rode and the other men went along on foot  they traveled the road by which the young auctioneers had come the village was situated in a small open spot and now when they once more found themselves between the mountains they were enveloped in a darkness which the rays of the lanterns scarcely dispersed  they traveled along as rapidly as possible and inside of half an hour came to a fork in the road which matt had had in mind since the discovery of their mistake had been made  we will examine the ground here he said it is more than likely he branched off here  he was soon hard at work and all of the others with him the wagon track they had followed was very plainly to be seen and now matt saw at a spot which was covered with loose stones where the thief had branched off with his stolen outfit  that is the road he took he announced to the others had we followed him from here in the first place we would most likely have caught up to him by this time  is that ere track the right one questioned the mountaineer eagerly  i believe it is  then im off fer the reward shouted the brawny fellow git up bones and he slapped the mule with the flat of his hand and was off without another word  ramson will get it sure grumbled one of the other men no use for us to go any further  and he turned on his heel and started back for the village followed by most of the others leaving a single man to race after the mountaineer on foot  matt and andy were not slow to urge their fresh horse forward but the way was now even darker than before and also rougher and it was with difficulty that the wagon moved along  i dont believe he went very far on this road said matt bringing the horse to a halt i am going to follow that track on foot  he sprang down from the seat and with the light close to the ground moved along in front of the horse it was well that he did so for hardly had he advanced a hundred feet than he uttered a cry and came to a halt  whats up now questioned andy peering forward through the gloom  he turned off here and went into the brush on the left dont you see the tracks  but there is no road through the brush he would lose his way and get caught among the rocks further back  i have an idea that he drove away in here to hide the wagon suddenly cried matt he could very well do that you know and then ride off on horseback to some place and put up for the night  by the boots i believe you are right returned andy why of course that is just what he has done how stupid of us not to think of that before  i hope the wagon is still o k went on matt it would be hard work to get a spring fixed in this outoftheway place  well we must find the wagon first supposing we tie up and go ahead on foot  im willing  they were soon side by side making their way through the brush and around the rocks as rapidly as they could  let us go forward as silently as possible suddenly whispered the boy barberry may still be around and if that is so we want to surprise him  thats a good idea what a pity we cant put out the light  we cant do without it the track is growing fainter we are coming to almost solid rock  on and on they pushed until andy calculated that they had covered a distance of five hundred feet from the main road then they found themselves on the verge of a deep ravine with a high wall of rock to the left of them  phew supposing he drove over that shuddered andy as he pointed into the blackness of the hollow that must be a hundred feet or more deep  he went to the right andythe only way he could go have you any matches with you  yes what do you want of them  i am going to put out the light for i fancy the wagon is not far off and the thief may be around also if we wish we can light up again later on  matt did as he had intimated and the two found themselves in a darkness that was simply intense to the last degree they could not see their hands before their faces and had to literally feel their way along  matt went first with his partner holding on to the hem of his jacket they had progressed but a dozen feet when on rounding a high rock the young auctioneer stopped once more  i was right he whispered the wagon is directly ahead  how do you know  i can see the lantern which is standing on the seat  then the thief must still be around returned andy excitedly  i suppose so but i dont see any one come on but dont make any noise or he may run away and i think he ought to be captured and locked up  certainly he ought to be placed under arrest i am ready wont he be surprised when he sees us  once again they moved forward toward where the auction wagon stood beneath the shelter of a large tree matt noted that billy had been unharnessed and was tied to the rear where he was engaged in making a meal of some feed which had been given him  barberry is making himself at home evidently murmured the young auctioneer to himself that fellow certainly has nerve  hold up suddenly cried andy catching the boy by the arm  whats up andy  look there to your right  matt did as directed and saw a sight which both amazed and alarmed him there by a little fire built to keep them comfortable in the night air sat two burly men drinking and smoking neither of the individuals was paul barberry     chapter xxvii  timely assistance   those fellows must be the thieves whispered andy as he pointed to the pair beneath the tree  i believe you are right returned matt if so we have made a big mistake neither of them is paul barberry and i was almost certain he was the thief  so was i matt but never mind that now what worries me is the fact that there are two of them  yes and they both look like strong fellows returned the young auctioneer as he surveyed the pair if they get ugly when we claim the turnout we may have a lively time with them  well we are in the right and we must stick up for our own  of course well do that cried matt determinedly but i say wouldnt it be best if we each got a stout stick they may show fight if they fancy we are beyond outside aid  perhaps we can bluff them into believing that we have the village authorities at our back suggested andy i would rather frighten them off than run the risk of coming off second best in a setto with them  hi what are you fellows doing here suddenly demanded a voice just behind andy do you belongwhat you  and the speaker none other than paul barberry stepped back in amazement  whats the trouble there barberry cried one of the men by the fire and both sprang up in alarm  why here are thethea couple of young fellows stammered the corn salve doctor he was so surprised he could hardly speak how did you get here he asked slowly  never mind that returned matt i imagine you know what we are here for  no i dont  really returned andy sarcastically well then let me tell you that we came for our horse and wagon and stock  i havent anything of yours returned paul barberry gradually recovering from his surprise in making a circle around the improvised camp he had stumbled upon them quite unexpectedly you talk as if i was a thief  didnt you run off with that horse and wagon demanded matt  run off with it no why should i the outfit belongs to me isnt that so boys and the corn salve doctor turned to his burly companions  why of course it does returned the men  a thunderbolt from the sky at that moment would not have taken andy and matt more by surprise than did this statement paul barberrys assurance actually staggered them and neither could speak for the moment  that outfit belongs to you cried matt at length  of course  thats the biggest falsehood i ever heard in my life burst out andy you know very well that everything there belongs to us  i know no such thing returned barberry coldly i bought the outfit from you and you know it these gentlemen know it also  and he waved his hand toward his companions  certainly we know all about it said one of the men  yes we saw the money paid over added the second fellow  matt and andy looked at each other each knew very well that the other had never made any bargain for the sale of the turnout and stock the whole scheme was one of the corn doctor to get possession of their belongings  see here barberry there is no use for you to talk in this fashion went on matt as calmly as he could although he was worked up to the top notch of excitement you know very well that you are asserting that which is not true the outfit belongs to us and you havent the shadow of an interest in it you stole it from the phillipsburg freight depot and  stop that blustered the corn salve doctor how dare you call me a thief boy  that is what you are and nothing less if you  do you hear that fellows interrupted barberry turning to the two men  you want to keep a civil tongue in your head boy cried one of the men sharply calling a man a thief is a serious business  and being a thief is still more serious replied andy perhaps you fancy you can bluff us as the saying is but you are mistaken this turnout is ours and we are here to claim it if you molest us in the least we will hand you all over to the police  we can stand up for ourselves returned the man with a deep scowl we are three to two and we are armed  so you would use force to retain our property eh said andy  we do not admit that it is your property  but it is now let me tell you something we stopped at the village just north of here and got the assistance of nearly a dozen men they are scattered about and should you attempt to molest us i shall give them a signal  not much you wont cried the man addressed and springing forward he clapped his hand over andys mouth tend to the other one fellows i can manage this one  all right returned his companion and he as well as paul barberry fell upon matt  the attack had been so sudden that andy and matt were hardly prepared to defend themselves the former was forced over on his back and despite his utmost exertions was unable to remove his assailants hand from his mouth  matt was thrown over on his side and while paul barberry held one of his arms the other man tried to force him into silence  make a single sound and ill kick you in the face he ejaculated in a low but intense tone  help help cried matt ignoring the threat entirely and he continued to call out so long as his breath lasted  the burly ruffian tried to kick him as he had promised but with his disengaged hand matt caught his foot and after dancing about to regain his balance the man came down heavily across the young auctioneers legs  the force of the fall was so great that matt cried out shrilly with pain for the moment he imagined that both of his limbs must be broken  clap your hand over his mouth barberry cried the burly man as he struggled to regain his feet confound you boy ill teach you to throw me  he sprang at matt but not before the young auctioneer had had a chance to turn over and spring up matt realized what was at stake and knew he must fight his best or the worst would happen  before the man could touch him matt placed barberry between them then he gave the corn doctor a push that sent him staggering up against his companion  in the meantime poor andy was still flat on his back unable to speak or to move his assailant was on top of him and there did not appear to be any immediate relief in sight  seeing this matt as soon as he had freed himself leaped to his partners assistance he caught the ruffian by the shoulders and with a sharp jerk sent him sprawling flat upon his back on a number of sharp stones  go at them with stones andy shouted matt as he himself stooped to pick up a small rock which lay at his feet we ought to show them no mercy  thats true panted his partner as he followed the suggestion by arming himself with several handy missiles they are a set of cowards in my opinion  well show you if we are cried the fellow who had first attacked matt come on barberry we must make them prisoners  and once more he sprang forward while the fellow on his back with a groan of pain staggered up to lend his assistance in the struggle  but now came help for matt and andy from an unexpected quarter there was a crashing through the brush and a tall form the thieves did not recognize burst into view it was ramson the mountaineer  wots agoing on here anyway shouted the mountaineer in a tone of wonder fighting worse nor a lot of bears i declare wots it all about  help us wont you cried matt these are the fellows who stole the turnout and they will not give it up  wont hey well its yourn aint it  it certainly is and if you will help us you shall have that reward put in andy this is the main thief and the other two are helping him and he pointed to paul barberry  without more ceremony the tall mountaineer strode forward and caught barberry by the shoulder and gave him such a twist about that the pretended doctor howled with pain  these two young men are honest fellows i take it he said and if you imagine you can do them out of their rights you are mistaken at least so long as i am around now just you stand still while i attend to your helpers and illhullo if they aint gone and run away  ramson was right hardly had he made his little speech than paul barberrys two companions had taken time by the forelock and made a rush for the brush matt and andy dashed after them but it was useless for a few seconds later they disappeared in the darkness     chapter xxviii  back to the village   never mind let them go said andy as he saw the mountaineer make a movement as if to follow the retreading pair i do not think that they have any of the stolen things in their possession  but they ought to be locked up insisted ramson such thieves ought never to be allowed their liberty  i agree with you but as matters stand we cannot bother to follow them just now  maybe this fellow will tell us who they were i didnt get a square look at them went on the mountaineer who felt sore to think the pair had gotten away thus easily  yes i imagine we can learn from barberry who they are put in matt as he caught the pretended doctor by the arm dont you try to run he added  paul barberry appeared greatly disconcerted he had not expected this sudden turn of affairs and he knew not what to say or do  march him up to the wagon and light the other lantern said andy i see the fire is going out  ill soon fix that returned ramson and he threw on some dry twigs causing the fire to blaze up merrily they were making themselves quite at home  what are you going to do with me asked barberry sullenly as he found himself surrounded with no hope of escape  before we answer that question we wish to ask a few on our account returned andy now tell us who your companions were  a couple of tramps i picked up in phillipsburg  tramps  that is what i call them they were bound for easton to sell prize packages of toilet soap  fakirs like yourself put in matt how did you come to pick them up were you afraid to steal the outfit alone  i didnt say i stole the outfit  no but you did nevertheless now how did you happen to fall in with those fakirs  will you let me go if i tell you  certainly not cried the boy we intend to put you where you will not be able to steal any more for some time to come  arrest me exclaimed paul barberry in great alarm evidently he had not thought such a thing at all likely  yes put in andy and unless you do as we wish you to it may go mighty hard with you  but ill stick to it that i bought the turnout returned the corn salve doctor trying to put on a bold front youll have to prove that you didnt make the sale i wont be bulldozed  get a rope and bind him matt said andy paying no attention to the last remark well take him to the nearest police station i suppose there will have to be some papers made out before he can be taken back to new jersey  the young auctioneer sprang into the wagon and soon brought forth a long and stout rope paul barberry watched these preparations with an anxious face and when ramson stepped forward to aid in making him a close prisoner he began to wilt  see here he said addressing andy and matt i dont want to be locked up it would injure my reputation to a great extent i am willing to admit that i have done wrong but iidid it by mistake i havent felt well for several days and my head has been affected thats the whole truth of the matter when i get those spells i dont know what i am doing  hes a good one at crawling remarked ramson in disgust hell get over the spells when hes locked up  in spite of his protestations and pleadings barberry was tightly bound and fastened to the rear of the wagon then billy who had had quite a rest was harnessed up once more and with matt on the seat and ramson going on ahead to pick the way they started off for the village andy keeping in the rear to see to it that their prisoner should not escape  the way was dark and uncertain but the tall mountaineer proved a good and careful guide and at the end of an hour and a half the worst part of the journey was over they entered the village just as the town clock was striking one  if you want the man arrested you had better take him directly to justice harwigs house said ramson he does all the law business in these parts  so to that individuals cottage they turned and matt sprang from the wagon and used the oldfashioned knocker vigorously a long silence followed and then a window upstairs was raised and a head adorned with a nightcap was thrust out  whats wanted  weve got a criminal for ye judge called out ramson the fellow as run away with that auction turnout  a criminal eh all right ill be down in a minnit  the head disappeared and the window was closed five minutes passed and then a light appeared in a wing of the house and the justice opened the door to what he termed his office  now whats it all about he asked in a sleepy voice  all hands entered the place andy and the mountaineer leading paul barberry who looked anything but comfortable the prisoner was marched up before the justices desk and the others ranged themselves alongside of him while justice harwig a very pleasant man made himself comfortable to listen to what all hands might have to say  the hearing was a short one and at its conclusion paul barberry was marched off to the village lockup the justice stating that he would notify the phillipsburg authorities so that they could get the necessary papers and take him away  barberry did all he could to beg off offering at the last moment to pay a fine equal to the amount of money in his pocketeighteen dollars but neither the justice nor the others would listen to this had he not made the fight matt and andy might have had some pity on him but they were but human and could not so easily forget the blows they had suffered at the hands of the thieves  it was not deemed worth while to send out any one to look for the two men who had escaped and after barberry was safe in jail the young auctioneers drove over to the tavern and put up there for the night ramson accompanied them and before parting with the mountaineer they paid him the reward that had been promised for which he was very thankful  on the following morning matt and andy lost no time in starting back for easton telling justice harwig that they would report to the authorities in phillipsburg whenever wanted they found that the turnout had suffered no damage by being stolen the new goods which had been in the cases had been stored away in some confusion but andy soon straightened this out  i tell you we can consider ourselves very lucky to get out of this so nicely he said after he had finished his work and knew all was right as it stands we will be out hardly a cent  yes we were lucky returned matt but we wouldnt have been had we taken that freight agents advice and remained on the other side of the delaware  well no doubt hell be glad to learn that we have recovered the goods it saves him something like seventyeight dollars  we will lose the best part of todays trade for we wont be able to get back much before two or three oclock  never mind the city is full of people and we ought to do best in the evening replied andy  it was a cool clear day and although both were rather tired from the adventures of the night before they enjoyed the drive back to easton at first andy drove while matt took it easy on the goods in the back of the wagon and when half the distance was covered the partners changed places so that by the time the store they had previously hired was reached both were sufficiently rested to go ahead with the duties on hand  they lost no time in transferring the stock to the store shelves after which andy drove off with the wagon and found a stable where the turnout might be put up during their stay matt arranged the stock on the shelves and made a great window display the red flag was hung out and inside of an hour afterward business was in full swing     chapter xxix  undesirable customers   among their customers they numbered a great many fire laddies and these they made it a point to treat extra well selling them goods at almost cost as a consequence the firemen told their friends and by eight oclock that evening the store was packed  this is going to be the banner day after all whispered andy just after making several good sales i believe we can keep things moving until midnight  they found a great demand for pocketknives and cheap jewelry and by playing on the instruments they sold over three dozen mouth harmonicas and three accordions then andy and matt gave a duet on the violin and banjo and as a consequence sold both of the instruments they had handled  the music had attracted even a greater crowd and among the people were four tall and rather uglylooking colored men they shoved their way forward rudely causing some timid customers to leave in a hurry and then began to laugh and joke among themselves in a loud and coarse manner  i am afraid we are going to have trouble with those chaps whispered matt to his partner they have been drinking and they are out for a lark  thats my idea too returned andy we must watch them closely  for a few minutes the young auctioneers paid no attention to the four negroes excepting to see that they did not take up something without laying it down again the fellows moved around through the crowd and at length two of them leaned up heavily against one of the showcases which belonged to the store fixtures  the combined weight of the two men was too much for the top glass of the case and with a sharp crack it broke into half a dozen pieces  hullo dat glass dun gone and got broke cried one of the negroes i wonder how dat happened  you broke that glass exclaimed matt sharply you and your companion  me returned the offender in pretended surprise  yes youand your friend  dat aint so at all boss we didnt touch dat yere glass did we jeff  deed we didnt tooker  we didnt come in here to do no kind ob damage boss  never mind what you came in for returned matt you broke the glass and you will have to pay for it  at the young auctioneers statement the faces of all four of the colored men took on a savage look they had drifted in to do pretty much as they pleased and had not expected to meet with such strong and sudden opposition  i wont pay for nuffin growled the ringleader of the quartet i dun reckon somebody else in the crowd broke the glass  cos da did replied another of the colored men maybe yo think yo kin lay it on us just because we is colored hey  not at all a colored man can be as much of a gentleman as any oneif he wishes to be put in andy  do youse mean to insinuate dat we aint genmen questioned one of the crowd roughly  you are not gentlemen when you break glass and refuse to pay for it returned andy that glass is worth at least a dollar and unless it is paid for somebody will be handed over to the police  huh do yo fink yo kin scare us boss  yo say another word an well do up de hull place  we is as good as any white trash remember dat  in the meantime one of the colored men slid his hand into the showcase which had been damaged and essayed to grab a small box of watchchains which rested close by matt saw the movement slick as it was just in time and springing forward he caught the colored man by the arm  drop that box he cried sternly  oh i wasnt gwine to take de box returned the wouldbe offender i was jess gwine to look at yo stock how much is dem chains worth  i am not selling chains to you tonight returned matt  he had hardly spoken when andy leaned over his shoulder and whispered into his ear  talk to them for a few minutes and ill slip out and notify the police treat them well until i get back  and the next instant matts partner had disappeared into the crowd without any of the colored men noticing his departure  yo dont want to sell me any chain repeated the colored man  not tonight  why not  this isnt chain night im selling harmonicas and banjos  well lets see some banjos den put in another of the negroes and he winked at his companions thinking that matt had become too scared to refer to the broken showcase again  all right but i dont want any more showcases broken returned the young auctioneer  he took a banjo from one of the cases and began to tune it up slowly  kin yo play us a jig asked one of the colored men while the white people in the place looked on in wonder at the turn affairs had taken  oh yes i can play a jig returned matt coolly  den give us one now  you will have to wait until i am done tuning up gentlemen  all right well wait  matt tuned up more slowly than ever and even allowed one of the strings to break that he might gain an extra minute in repairing the damage at last after fully five minutes had passed the banjo was in order for use and the young auctioneer struck off a few chords  now give us dat jig if yo kin play it said the colored man impatiently he was the same who had tried to steal the box of chains  i wont play a jig until you and your companion pay for the glass you broke returned matt shortly and he laid down the instrument abruptly and folded his arms  wot roared the colored men in concert  you heard what i said  see here do yo want us to smash de hull place demanded the ringleader of the disturbers  i dont think youll smash anything more replied matt  i wont hey well see  the colored man made a movement as if to strike the young auctioneer in the face but before the blow could land he was hauled back by a strong arm he and his companions looked around and found themselves confronted by two policemen whom andy had fortunately met upon the corner below  the two colored men who had kept somewhat in the background at once sneaked through the crowd and escaped through the open doorway the other two the ones who had done the damage were held by the policemen much to their discomfiture  a lively talk followed and then upon payment for the damage done the colored men were allowed to go first being warned by matt and andy not to show themselves in the store again had they not paid up they would have been arrested  after this scene was ended one of the policemen remained in the vicinity of the place for all the while the store remained open but nothing more occurred to disturb the auction sales  business in easton was so good that they remained there until tuesday of the following week during that time they took in nearly two hundred dollars leaving them a profit after all expenses were met of fortyfive dollars  on saturday morning matt and andy were called to belvidere the county seat to testify against barberry for the robbery at phillipsburg strange to say barberry pleaded guilty so the two boys had no trouble in the way of being detained as witnesses against him the corn salve doctor was held for sentence  after leaving easton matt and andy struck out for bethlehem and allentown the weather was now growing gradually colder but they calculated that they would have at least a month of weather which would be fit to travel in even in this mountainous country  at allentown we can stop long enough for me to take a trip to philadelphia and buy goods remarked andy as they were driving out of easton  just as you say returned matt i am glad we have to stock up so often and i am looking forward to the time when it will be necessary for us to buy a larger wagon and get another horse to put beside billy  it will hardly pay us to buy another horse this fall you must remember that we are to locate in some place during the winter i have no desire to move around much when the thermometer is below the freezing point  they were soon on the outskirts of easton and then they struck a rather rough road leading over numerous hills and around jagged rocks  by jinks i believe we have missed the way remarked matt as at last he brought billy to a standstill that stablekeeper said the road was a good one and i fail to find this so  well stop at the next house and find out returned andy do you see any place in sight  there is a cottage down in the hollow yonder stay here with billy and ill ask the way there  matt sprang from the wagon and was soon hurrying across a barren bit of pasture land that led down to a brook which was all but dried up the cottage stood upon the bank of the brook and walking up to it the young auctioneer rapped upon the door  there was an exclamation of surprise from within and then he was asked to enter he did so and was greatly vexed to find himself in the presence of three of the colored men who had created the disturbance in the store but a few nights before     chapter xxx  a dash from danger   had matt known that he would meet three of the colored men in the cottage in the hollow it is more than likely that he would not have gone near the place  when he and andy had had the trouble at the store the two men who had been compelled to pay for the broken glass had gone off in anything but a happy frame of mind and the young auctioneer had then remarked to his partner that they might have trouble with the men should they chance to meet them away from police protection  matt saw at once that the negroes recognized him and that his reception would be far from agreeable had he been less courageous he would have turned and fled but as it was he stood his ground  all three of the colored men had been seated around a kitchen table playing cards but at his entrance the two who had been the primary cause of the former trouble sprang to their feet and came toward him  huh what brings yo heah demanded the ringleader of the mischiefmakers wrathfully  for the instant matt hardly knew how to reply he recognized his mistake in coming to the cottage and he was anxious now to make as early a departure as possible  do you live here he asked boldly  yes we do returned the colored man  then i have made a mistake in coming here i thought some one else might live here  and he took a step backward to the door  hol on exclaimed the colored man coming still closer what brung yo heah  i wanted to find out if we were on the right road that was all but i can find out elsewhere  whars yo wagon  over on the road and matt waved his hand in the direction  gwine to leave easton questioned the second colored man  yes  no sooner had matt made the reply than the three colored men glanced at each other and the ringleader whispered to his companions  see yeah yo aint gwine befo we is squar wid yo he cried as he caught matt by the arm  let go of me exclaimed the young auctioneer i wont stand being molested  well see about dat cried the second colored man and he also caught hold of matt  close dat doah shelby went on the ringleader to the man still at the table dis is just de chance we wanted at dis yeah boy  the man addressed at once arose and rushing to the somewhat rickety door not only closed it but also locked it  matt viewed this movement with increased alarm and squirmed to release himself but without avail  yo cant git away from us nohow cried the ringleader as he squeezed the young auctioneers arm until matt thought he would crack a bone we is gwine for to teach you a lesson boy dat yo wont forgit in a long while  help help yelled matt without more ado realizing that the situation was becoming suddenly desperate  he had barely time to repeat his cry when the ringleader of the negroes clapped his big hand over his mouth then he was forced over backward upon the floor  go frough his pockets jeff  dats wot i intends to do tooker  hes got a putty good watch  maybe hes got a lot o money too  the rascals began to go through matts pockets and he called jeff made a movement toward relieving the boy of his watch and chain  the timepiece had once belonged to mr lincoln and to the young auctioneer it was a valuable heirloom the thought that he was to be deprived of it angered him more than did anything else and he began to kick out hotly right and left  the negroes were not prepared for this and before they could guard against it one received a severe blow in the chin and the other had the toe of matts shoe nearly knock out his eye they both gave sharp cries of pain and fell back and taking advantage of this matt leaped to his feet  open that he commanded to the third negro who stood with his back against the door open that before i make it warm for you also  but the colored man would not budge and matt was compelled to attack him in his fight for freedom  the young auctioneer was thoroughly aroused and now showed what muscle he had gained during his freeandeasy life on the road he attacked the man without hesitation and forcing him aside compelled him to keep away from the door by blows and kicks delivered with surprising rapidity  the man had at the last moment taken the key from the lock and thrown it in the far corner of the room not waiting to recover this matt began to hammer at the door and gathering himself together threw his whole weight against it  as has been said the door was a rickety one and it went down with a crash tumbling the young auctioneer upon his face just outside the cottage  hullo what on earth does this mean cried a voice close by and andy rushed up a look of blank astonishment plainly depicted upon his face  those negroes gasped matt struggling to rise from amid the wreckage of the door come on dont wait for they are three to two and they are just drunk enough to be as ugly as sin  he caught andy by the arm and before the latter could ask for a further explanation hurried him up the hill toward the wagon  the negroes came out of the cottage and made after them but only for a short distance then they came to a sudden halt and after a brief consultation hurried back to the cottage  what do you suppose they went back forpistols and razors questioned andy as they reached the turnout and he unhitched billy from the tree to which he had been tied  no they are afraid we are going after the police returned matt springing up to the seat every one of that crowd ought to be in jail this minute he went on bitterly  what did they do to you  nearly robbed me and in a few brief words he related what had happened to him  well do you want to go back to easton and make a complaint asked andy when he had finished  no i am sick of having to do with the police andy all i want is to be let alone  thats my sentiment matt we are out for businessand moneynot trouble  andy sprang up beside matt and it was soon decided by the partners to continue on the road until another house should appear they looked back but saw nothing more of the negroes and then started off  they passed through a bit of woods and down a long hill here they found a neat farmhouse where a pleasant enough woman was sitting upon the doorstep knitting socks  this is one road but it is not the best road replied the woman in reply to andys question regarding the way to bethlehem but now you are this far you had better keep on for it will be harder to turn back  how far is it to the town  not over a mile and a half  and is the road fairly good from here  oh yes you can get along very well  then we will continue returned andy by the way he went on do you know anything of the negroes that live in the cottage back a ways  the womans face lost its smile and she sighed  yes i know them only too well she replied they have stolen so many of our chickens and so much garden truck that my husband is going to make a complaint against them i wish they would leave the neighborhood  i trust your husband succeeds in having them all locked up put in matt for they richly deserve it and after a few words more with the farmers wife they passed on  it was getting on toward noon when they finally arrived at bethlehem that pretty little town on the lehigh river they drove past several of the silk mills and finally found a livery stable at which billy and the wagon were put up  it looks as if we might do some business here said andy as they started for a restaurant for dinner let us open up this afternoon if possible  shall we hire a store  let us try to sell from the wagon first  immediately after dinner they procured a license and found a suitable corner they did all in their power to attract a crowd and finally toward evening when the working people were on their way home succeeded in bringing quite an assemblage around them  but strange to say they could not make a single sale try their best both used up all their eloquence matt played on the banjo and mouth harmonica and andy told funny stories it was no use the crowd merely smiled or frowned and then one after another drifted away  this is the worst luck yet whispered andy to matt i never dreamed that we would strike anything like this  a stout german who stood in the crowd saw the look of wonder and disappointment on andys face and he laughed heartily  you tont vos caught der same pirds twice alretty he chuckled to several bystanders  whats that questioned matt who overheard the remark  you tont vos caught der same pirds twice mit der same salt returned the german and he laughed heartily at what he considered a good joke while those around smiled and nodded approvingly  i must say i dont see the joke said matt cheerfully wont you let me in the secret  dose udder fellers vos schwindle us put you cant do it twice times was the reply  other fellows swindled you repeated matt  yes dose fellers mit dot wagon vot vas here all last week i dont dink but vot you vos der same crowd of fellers     chapter xxxi  dangerous mountain traveling   both matt and andy began to smell a mouse as the saying is and they lost no time in questioning not only the german but several other people that remained around the wagon  the young auctioneers soon learned that a rival party of auctioneers with a large twohorse wagon had stopped at the town during the entire previous week and sold goods which were next to worthless for the highest prices to be obtained they had been cool and shrewd men thoroughly dishonest and they had swindled every one who had had dealings with them  and where did they go to asked andy of the german after the matter had been talked over for some time  ve tont know of ve did ve vould tar an fedder dem py chiminy was the emphatic reply  that settles it we wont be able to do any business here said matt and though they remained in bethlehem the remainder of that day and all of the next his words proved true only a few trifles were sold and these at prices that did not reimburse them for the trouble of handling  seeing that it would not pay to remain in the town longer they started once more on the road and by the end of the week found themselves established in a store in allentown and doing quite a good business  while in this city andy made a trip to philadelphia and had several more cases of goods shipped on which matt was careful to procure before they might be stolen from the freight depot the wagon was also sent to a repair shop and thoroughly overhauled for the roads beyond allentown promised to be rougher than those heretofore traversed  both matt and andy were curious to know more about the rival auctioneers and they wondered if they would meet the men nothing had been heard of them in allentown so that their business in that city was not injured they did fairly well although a strike in some of the mills made business duller than it would otherwise have been  but both of the partners thought they had no cause for complaint during the time they had been away from home they had cleared above all expenses one hundred and seventytwo dollars which equally divided was eightysix dollars apiecenot a fortune but still an amount which matt at least viewed with considerable satisfaction  if we do as well right straight through he said as he and andy talked it over on their way to lehighton and mauch chunk we will have quite an amount to place to our credit in the bank by the time we reach new york again  i am in hopes that we will do even better as cold weather comes on returned andy folks seem to buy more theni dont know why and besides after stopping at mauch chunk we will only go to large places for i think it will pay to skip the smaller ones  i dont know but what you are right i know one thing that i am going to do when i get to mauch chunkthat is if business continues good  and what is that  i am going to buy a postoffice order and send miss bartlett the money she so kindly loaned me wont she be surprised to get it back so soon  no doubt of it matt it was very kind of her to loan it to you i suppose you are going to pay her the interest  for the full year finished the boy and at christmas if i can do it im going to make her some sort of a nice present she is the only friend i had left in new york  a very nice young lady returned andy and then he went on with a short laugh i wonder what old caleb gulligan would say if he knew of our prosperity  and i wonder what mr randolph fenton would say if he knew how i was doing i hope when i write to miss bartlett that she lets him know went on matt i suppose he thought that after he discharged me i would go to the dogs  yes men like him very often imagine the world cannot possibly get along without them i reckon you are glad that you are no longer in his employ  glad isnt a strong enough word andy it makes me shudder to look back at the times i spent in his offices being bossed around and scolded from morning to night  i think traveling around has done us both a deal of good matt i feel stronger than i have in years and you look the picture of health barring those bruises you received from barberry and his companions  oh i feel fine outdoor life always did agree with me when i was in fentons offices i felt very much like a prisoner in a jail i wouldnt go back to that life again for the world  thus the talk ran on from one subject to another andy had given his young partner the full particulars of his own roving life and in return matt had related everything concerning himself and the two felt as if they had known each other for years in fact as matt once stated later on they were more like brothers than mere partners in business  andy was deeply interested in the fact of mr lincolns disappearance and he wondered nearly as much as did matt himself if the unfortunate man would ever turn up again  as for the boy he could not bring himself to believe that his parent was dead and although he rarely mentioned his fathers name he was constantly on the watch for him and often when they were stopping at a place he would go off on what he termed a still hunt hoping thereby to pick up a stray bit of information which would put him on the right track to learn of his fathers whereabouts  the drive up through walnut port to lehigh gap was very nice at the latter place they stopped over night and then pushed on to lehighton sometimes along the river and then by way of a road through and around the mountains  this scenery is just grand cried matt as they were driving on about ten oclock in the forenoon just look at that mountain over yonder and see how the river winds along through the valley below here  it is very fine indeed returned andy but ill tell you what i would rather be on horseback than in the wagon it seems to me that some of the bends around the mountain side are positively dangerous  oh i guess not andy why look there is a regular wagon road if other wagons can pass along here i fancy we can do so too  other wagons may not be as heavy as ours with that big case tied on behind dont you notice how billy slips every once in awhile  well we might have had him shod sharp when we had the wagon overhauled returned matt slowly as he noticed for the first time that billy did slip more than usual we can have it done during our stop at mauch chunk or at lehighton if it becomes necessary maybe we are on the wrong road again  well certainly this road is growing worse instead of better said andy soberly just look at that turn ahead the road isnt over ten feet wide and it slopes down to that steep hill  drive as close to the inside wall as you can was matts somewhat nervous reply as he saw the possible danger ahead steady now billy steady  the horse moved along slowly up to the curve which ran around the mountain side as andy had said the road at this point was scarcely ten feet wide and on the other side was a steep downward slope terminating below at a tiny brook filled with loose rocks  the curve was reached and the two were just congratulating themselves upon having passed the dangerous spot in safety when a large bird flying from a nearby bush frightened billy and caused him to shy to one side  in another instant the wagon was at the very edge of the slope     chapter xxxii  an interesting letter   to andy and matt it looked as if the entire turnout must slide down the hillside to the bottom there to be smashed into a hundred pieces  it was small wonder therefore that both gave a loud cry of alarm and that both caught at the lines to lead billy away from the danger so imminent  the horse continued to move ahead but instead of drawing closer to the inside he walked upon the very outer edge of the road  ill lead him cried andy and while matt continued to hold the lines he sprang out and caught billy by the bridle  ordinarily the faithful animal would have come along willingly but he now seemed to grow obstinate and pulled back when andy caught hold the wagon stopped and then the rear wheels were sent partly down the slope  pull him up cried matt pull him andy  he wont come gasped andy tugging at the bridle with might and main  but he must come the wagon will go down in another second  i cant help it i cant make him come panted andy between his clinched teeth as he renewed the struggle to bring the wagon up on the level once more  tying the lines fast matt sprang out he had seen a loose stone of fair size close at hand and this he now picked up running around to the rear of the wagon he placed it on the sloping ground so that one of the wheels was blocked from further slipping  good cried andy can you find another stone  im going to push on the other wheel get up billy get up there  matt placed his shoulder to the wheel and exerted all of his strength and seeing this andy also urged the horse billy gave a tugthere was a moments strainand then the turnout rolled up once more upon the level road  thank goodness for that burst out andy i thought for a moment that it was a goner  so did i andy you had better lead him until we reach a safer bit of the road  i intend to do that and after this ill know enough to lead him around such a bend instead of taking such a dangerous chance  only a hundred feet further on the mountain road left the proximity of the slope and then the two once more climbed up on the seat billy the horse did not appear to be in the least disturbed over the adventure but matt and andy were bathed in a cold perspiration which did not leave them until some time after  at lehighton where they stopped for dinner they determined to drive right through to mauch chunk four miles further on many people from the former place did their trading at mauch chunk and the young auctioneers thought they would catch just as much trade by not stopping on the way  at mauch chunk a stop was made for three days and during that time there were several excursions to the place from new york and philadelphia the city folks coming up to see the autumnal beauties of glen onoko and the various mountains through which the switchback gravity road runs these crowds helped business some and the stay proved nearly as profitable as the one at easton had been  on the first day at mauch chunk matt procured the money order of which he had spoken and sent it to ida bartlett with a long letter in which he thanked her for her kindness and gave her an account of the trip since leaving the metropolis he stated that if she wished to write to him within the week to address the letter to wilkesbarre or on the following week to scranton as they were bound for both places  during their spare hours both andy and matt took the ride on the gravity road and enjoyed it very much the rhododendrons were out in full bloom and matt wished he could send ida bartlett a bunch of the beautiful flowers  they were soon once again on the road but billys shoes had been carefully attended to and now they were very careful whenever they came to a spot that looked at all dangerous  one scare is enough was the way andy put it and matt thoroughly agreed with him  after leaving mauch chunk they passed through penn haven and leslie run and so on to white haven at the latter place they stopped for two days but found it very unprofitable as there was little or no money afloat  well we have to take the bad with the good said andy in reply to matts remark concerning the dullness of trade we cannot expect to make money wherever we go if that was to be done i reckon there would be many other auctioneers in the field  that reminds me i wonder what has become of those auctioneers we heard of in bethlehem  im sure i dont know but it is likely that we will hear from them again sooner or later  on leaving white haven for wilkesbarre they struck the first snowstorm of the season it was not a heavy storm and yet as the wind blew in their faces the drive of thirty miles proved anything but pleasant they were glad enough when the city was reached and they were able to put up the turnout at a livery stable and warm up around the office stove  we wont be able to travel much longer if this keeps on remarked andy well have to pick out some place to settle down in for the winter  have you any place in view asked matt with interest  ive had my eye on middletown new york state thats a lively place and it gets a trade from a good many miles around  do you think we can make it  i think so we can go from scranton to carbondale and honesdale and so on through lackawaxen and port jervis by taking that route we can stop on the way and still reach middletown inside of two weeks  well i shouldnt like to miss a letter from miss bartlett if it was sent  you can leave directions to forward it if it comes after we are gone the postoffice authorities will willingly send the letter wherever you direct  perhaps she has already written  if you think so why dont you call at the postoffice and find out  i willas soon as we have had something to eat and drink  they passed over to the commercial hotel and after brushing up entered the diningroom here a late dinner was served for them and it is needless to say that both did full justice to all that was set before them  after they had finished andy went off to hunt up an empty store and matt after securing directions walked off to the postoffice  to his delight there was a letter for him and addressed in ida bartletts hand as it was the first letter he had received since being on the road the reader can understand his curiosity to master its contents standing back in an outoftheway spot of the corridor he split open the envelope with his penknife and was soon reading that which had been written  the letter surprised him not a little after acknowledging the receipt of the money order and congratulating him upon his evident success ida bartlett wrote as follows    and now matt i am going to tell you something that i think will   interest you even more than it does me it is about mr fenton and   the mining shares which he once sold your father last week mr   gaston the bookkeeper had a quarrel with mr fenton and was   discharged before he left however he and mr fenton had some   high words which i being in the next office could not help   hearing    during this quarrel something was said about the shares sold to   william lincoln and mr gaston said that if the papers in   connection with the shares which your father had bought could be   recovered he would expose mr fenton i could not understand the   whole drift of the matter but mr fenton seemed to be glad that   your father was missinghe said he was most likely deadand that   the papers had disappeared with him    do you know anything of the papers mr gaston has gone to   boston but i could write to him if you think that mr fenton is a   swindler and that you can get back any money which he may have   defrauded your father out of i myself am going to leave mr   fentons employ on the first of next month having secured a   better place with another firm of brokers let me hear from you   again as soon as possible i hope if he has any money belonging to   your father you can get it     chapter xxxiii  the rival auctioneers   it may well be imagined that matt read ida bartletts letter with great interest the young auctioneer had never received a communication as surprising as was this one  he went over every word carefully several times then placed the letter in his pocket and started off to find andy  half an hour later he came across his partner on the main street andy had just rented a store one of two vacant ones which were side by side and was now on his way to drive the wagon around and unload the stock  well did you get a letter matt  i did  good enough any special news  yes indeed just read that  and the young auctioneer passed the communication over for his partners perusal  andy read the letter as carefully as had matt he emitted a long low whistle  what do you think of it  i hardly know what to think matt do you know anything about this mining share business  i know that randolph fenton sold my father some shares that is all i never saw the certificates if that is what they are called  did you ever see the papers in connection with the shares  no  then they must have been in your fathers possession when he disappeared  i dont know about that mother might have had them when father was first sent to the asylum for treatment although i remember hearing her once say that since fathers mind had become affected he would not trust any one with his affairs but kept all his money and papers hidden away  its too bad you havent the papers  thats so if i had them i would hunt up mr gaston and get him to expose randolph fenton  it might pay you to do that anyway  i dont know if there was any likelihood of this being the case i think miss bartlett would have written to that effect  what do you intend to do  i am going to write to her again telling her just how matters stand with me and ask her if she thinks it will do any good for me to come on if she thinks it will ill try to manage it some way to take a run to new york  you can do that whenever you wish matt i will take care of things the same as you did when i was gone  on the way to the stable where the wagon and billy were located they talked the matter over at a greater length andy took a warm personal interest in the matter and did not hesitate to say so  if this fenton swindled your father i trust you are able to prove it and get your money back he said i dont know of any one that deserves money more than you do  the wagon was soon driven around to the store and the goods unloaded then the showwindow and the shelves were arranged to attract the eye after which andy hung out the red flag which now began to look to the young auctioneers like an old friend  as soon as everything was in shape for business matt brought out paper pen and ink and set to work upon the letter to ida bartlett at first he hardly knew how to express himself but before he had finished he had filled eight pages and told the young lady exactly how matters stood he begged for her further assistance and assured her that she should not lose through her kindness to him  the letter finished matt did not place it in a letterbox but marched with it to the postoffice that it might be included with the first outgoing new york mail  if i only could find father he sighed to himself as he turned back to the store something in my heart tells me that he is not dead and yet if this is so where can he be  on arriving at the store he found andy already busy with a crowd which had begun to collect the moment that the red flag was hung out matt had to begin work at once and this was a good thing for the boy for it kept him from brooding over his parents possible fate and thus growing melancholy  if i am any kind of a judge we are going to do the best business yet at this city said andy as there came a little lull in trade it started off briskly and it has kept on steadily ever since  well that just suits me laughed matt to my way of thinking we cannot do too much business  during the next day matt noticed two sharpeyed men hanging around the place a good deal at first he paid no attention to them but at last pointed them out to andy  yes i noticed them myself returned the senior partner they do not look as if they wanted to buy but just as if they were spying  supposing i call them in and ask them to buy suggested matt for both of the men were at that moment gazing in the window at the articles displayed there  certainly you can do that if you want to returned andy  so matt walked from behind the counter toward the door but before he could reach it one of the men saw him and spoke to his companion and both hurried up the street and around the nearest corner  humph thats queer to say the least said the young auctioneer and andy agreed with him  there had been a to let bill upon the showwindow of the vacant store next door but on the following morning when the young auctioneers opened up they found the bill gone the door of the store was open and inside a boy somewhat younger than matt was cleaning up  hullo cried matt stopping short then he poked his head in at the door and confronted the boy  so we are going to have neighbors eh he remarked pleasantly  bet your life was the slangy reply from the boy as soon as he had noted who had addressed him you didnt expect us did you  no i didnt know the store was taken until a moment ago said matt  well it cant be helped it was the only store vacant in the neighborhood  cant be helped repeated matt somewhat puzzled what do you mean  oh i thought you might object to our opening up alongside of you  i dont see why i should what business are you in  same line  matt was taken aback somewhat by this unexpected reply and his face showed it  do you mean to say you are going to open an auction store here  thats it and we are going to make it everlastingly warm for you fellows too went on the boy triumphantly weve been awatching how you run things and we are going to scoop every bit of trade when we get started  matt drew a long breath here was certainly a new experience he and andy had expected to encounter rivals but had never dreamed of having them at such close quarters  well i suppose we will have to stand it he said hardly knowing how else to reply to the boys bragging statement  if i was you id pack up and try some other place went on the boy gissem  fillow will take every bit of tradethey always do wherever they go  gissem  fillow are those the names of the men who run the concern  yes and they are the slickest auctioneers in the country  perhaps you only think so  oh i know it ill bet you a new hat you dont take in a dollar after we get agoing  thank you but i dont bet may i ask where you came from  we came from stroudsburg  were you down in bethlehem before that  yes how did you know that  we came through there after you had gone  bet you didnt sell anything we squeezed the town dry  we didnt sell much returned matt he was on the point of stating that he had heard how the folks had been swindled but he changed his mind how long do you expect to remain here  oh a week or so you might as well pack up and leave  i guess we will venture to remain at least a day or two longer said matt perhaps well be able to do a little in spite of you  at that moment a large wagon began to back up to the curb the seat was occupied by two men and matt at once recognized them as the fellows he had caught hanging around the previous day they were the rival auctioneers who had been watching to learn how matt and andy conducted their business     chapter xxxiv  matt speaks his mind   matt did not wait to encounter the rival auctioneers but walked away and entered the door of his own store andy was busy dusting up and to his partner he told what he had heard  phew whistled andy that will make matters rather interesting is that their wagon out there  i suppose it is those are the same two men i am certain  yes they are well if they are the swindlers folks in bethlehem said they were we ought not to fear them people are not fools and they soon learn if a man is honest or not  they may take away a good bit of trade nevertheless andy and we were just congratulating ourselves on what a fine week we were going to have  we must do our best matt this puts me on my mettle  they talked the matter over a bit and then set to work to put their best foot forward as andy termed it the window was cleaned as it had never been cleaned before and also the showcases and shelves and then they proceeded to make the most elaborate display possible  there that ought to attract people if anything will remarked andy when the work was finished  you are right the window couldnt look better but perhaps they will put out big price signs  never mind they cant afford to sell any cheaper than we can i bought all the goods at bottom figures let us start up before they get ready  they began to play on several instruments and as soon as half a dozen people were collected andy began to talk and tell jokes before the rival auctioneers had their stock inside of their store matt and andy were doing a pretty fair business  seeing this gissem  fillow hurried up their preparations and by noon both places were going it for all they were worth as matt expressed it  gissem seemed to be the principal member of the firm fillow and the boy being merely helpers he was a tall thinfaced and cleanshaven man with hard steelyblue eyes  this way for bargains he cried out coming out upon the sidewalk this way gents and ladies the only place in wilkesbarre selling reliable goods at rockbottom figures dont be deceived by rival concerns trying to obtain a bit of our wellearned prosperity come right in and be convinced and he kept on in this strain for fully five minutes  well that is what i call downright mean cried matt to andy of course all these cracks at rival concerns are meant for us he wants to draw the crowd away from us  more than that he is trying to scare them so that if they wont patronize him they wont purchase anywhere returned the senior partner it is certainly not a fair way to do  cant we stop him andy  i dont see how he has mentioned no names  andy began to talk but as he was inside of the store while gissem was outside very few of the people on the street were attracted they made several sales to those inside but after the purchasers were gone the store was empty in the meantime the next place was filled to overflowing  let us give them a tune suggested matt i see our rivals have no musical instruments  he brought out a banjo and andy took up the largest accordion in the place sitting down in a spot from which the music could float out of the door they played several of their best selections  the music pleased many people they stopped listening to gissem and after some hesitation several came in more followed and seeing this matt and andy kept on until the store was once more filled  then matt began to talk he made no wild statements but in an earnest manner told what they had to sell and asked those around him to examine the goods carefully  that fellow next door said to beware of rival concerns remarked a man in the crowd slyly and several smiled at the words  well i take it that people are bright enough to know what they are doing returned matt we are too busy to talk about our neighbors we are here to show what we have and sell goodsif we can we do not misrepresent and if any one is dissatisfied with his purchase he can return it and get his money back isnt that fair enough  i reckon it is  we carry a large stock as you can see and we sell everything for what it is  let me see those spoons will you questioned a man standing beside the one talking to matt  certainly sir and the young auctioneer handed over several samples  are these triple plated  no sir they are single plated on white metal  then they are just as good as triple plated  almost as good for ordinary wear here are some that are triple plated  i know they are  oh you do  yes i know all about spoons for i used to be in the plating business i only asked to see what you would say that man next door tried to sell my friend some single plated ones for triple plated i brought him in here to see what you had to say about your stock  well i have not misrepresented have i  no you have told the exact truth john if you want any spoons you might as well buy them here for i see they are put at a very reasonable figure  upon this the man who had first spoken began to pick out some of the goods what his friend had said had been heard by the crowd who now began to feel more like trusting in what the young auctioneers might have to say  matt sold the spoons and in the meantime andy put up a number of other articles at auction and sold them at fairly good prices  they managed to keep busy until two oclock in the afternoon when trade fell off once more seeing this andy prepared to go out to dinner he had just put on his hat when gissem the rival auctioneer rushed in  see here i want to talk to you two fellows he blustered  well what is it questioned matt as coolly as he could  youve been telling people i tried to stick a man on a lot of tinplated spoons saying they were solid silver  who said so  never mind who said so let me tell you i aint going to stand such work  excuse me sir but we circulated no such story interrupted andy we know enough to mind our own business  but they told me one or the other of you had said so we wont stand thatwell have you arrested forfor defamation of character stormed the rival auctioneer working himself up into a fine pitch of assumed indignation  we have said nothing concerning you said matt we have not even advised people to beware of our rivals nor have we mentioned your stop in bethlehem and how the folks of that town regarded your doings there he went on pointedly  whatwhat do you mean stammered gissem taken by surprise  i mean just what i infer we know how people there were swindled and we know how anxious some of them are to lay hands on a certain firm of auctioneers  have a care boy or illill  what will you do  never mind youll see fast enough  you cannot bully me now that you have taken the trouble to come in here let me tell you something you just cast several reflections upon our characters that has got to be stopped  humph why you are but a boy and dare talk to me  never mind he knows what he is saying put in andy we are not to be mistreated by rivals or by any one else  dont talk to me snapped gissem and unable to keep up the talk with credit to himself he fled from the store  i dont think he will dare to bother us again said andy he is too much afraid to have his past record raked up  andy went off to dinner leaving matt in sole charge the snow had cleared away but it was still cold and to keep himself warm matt went to the rear of the establishment and got his overcoat he was just putting on the garment when a noise near the showwindow attracted his attention he ran forward and saw that a thin stream of water was coming down through the boards of the ceiling the water was splashing on some of the stock and unless it was speedily checked it would do a good bit of damage  matt knew that the upper part of the building was not occupied in the rear of the store was a door leading to the back hallway and through this he ran and started to go upstairs  as he did so somebody started to come down it was the boy who worked for the rival auctioneers     chapter xxxv  tom inwold   as soon as the boy saw matt he stopped short and then endeavored to retreat but matt was coming up the steps in a tremendous hurry and in ten seconds he was close enough to the boy to catch him by the arm  let go of me cried the boy badly frightened  what have you done questioned matt sternly and without waiting for a reply forced the boy to accompany him into the rooms  a glance around revealed the cause of the flood below in one of the rooms was a sink with city water the water had been turned on full and the sinkholes stopped up with putty the sink had overflowed and the water was running through several cracks in the floor  as rapidly as he could matt turned off the faucet then leaving the water still in the sink to the brim he dashed downstairs  you come with me and help me save my stock he cried to the boy if you dont ill hand you over to the first policeman i can find  oh please dont have me arrested howled the boy almost scared out of his wits by the threat iididnt mean any harm  you didnt mean any harm well see come down now  the boy hesitated and then followed matt into the store here a portion of the stock had to be removed and then the young auctioneer set the boy to work mopping up the water on the counter and the floor  say please dont have me arrested will you asked the boy almost in tears over what he considered a very serious predicament  you ought to be taught a lesson returned matt severely what put you up to the idea of letting the water overflow  what mr gissem said he was awful mad after he was in here and he told mr fillow he wished that you would burn out or that the water pipes would burst and drown you out then he asked me if i couldnt worry you a bit and i said id try and thats the truth of it  well that man ought to be cowhided was matts vigorous exclamation excuse me but is he any relation to you  oh no  is mr fillow  no neither of them  then how do you come to be traveling with them  the boys face took on a sober look and he swallowed something like a lump in his throat  ii got tired of going to school and i ran away from home  what do you mean matt stopped short as a certain thought flashed over his mind say is your name tom inwold and do you come from plainfield  at this unexpected question the boy looked at matt in amazement his mouth wide open and his eyes as big as they could well be  who told you who i was he gasped  no one i guessed it  but i dont know you  thats true we stopped in plainfield a number of weeks ago and there i met your mother  and what did she say faltered tom inwold  she told me that you had run away with an auctioneer  andand was that all went on the boy his voice trembling with emotion  no she was very anxious to have you come home again she missed you very much and she could not understand how you could have the heart to leave her  at these words which matt delivered very seriously the tears sprang into tom inwolds eyes evidently he was not hardhearted and had been led astray purely by bad associates  ii wish i was back home again he said in a low voice  you do not like being an auctioneers helper then  no i dont i might like you but gissem and fillow treat me awful  in what way  well in the first place they dont half feed me and then they dont pay me the wages they promised  what did they promise you  five dollars a week to start on and ten dollars when i was worth it ive been with them a long time but i was never able to get a cent out of them  supposing you had the money would you go home asked matt kindly for he saw that the boys better feelings had been touched  i dont know if i would dare ma might whip me and have me sent to the reform school or something like that  i dont think she wouldnot if you promise to turn over a new leaf i should think you would rather go home than remain where you have to work for nothing  i guess i would go home if i had a railroad ticket and some clothes fit to wear you can see how this suit looks and tom inwold showed up his ragged elbows and patched trousers  ill see if i can do something for you said matt  when andy came back he told his partner tom inwolds story to this the boy himself added the tale of his hardships while with the rival auctioneers and added that he was very sorry he had endeavored to do any injury to the stock in the store  i believe he means it said matt as he and andy walked a little to one side and i would like to do something for the lad for his mothers sake as much as his own  i think i can fix it replied andy ill have a talk with this gissem  he ought to pay the boy something for his work  i reckon he willwhen i tell him that he is liable to arrest for enticing the boy from home  andy told tom inwold to accompany him to the store next door at first the boy hung back but when andy promised that he would take the responsibility of the coming interview entirely upon his own shoulders the lad consented to go along  they were gone nearly an hour and during that time matt heard some pretty loud talking through the partition which separated the two stores but when andy and tom inwold came back he saw by their faces that they had triumphed  at first gissem was in for facing me down said andy said he had nothing to do with the boy and all that but i threatened him with immediate arrest and promised to have the mother of the boy here to testify against him and then he weakened and at length gave tom thirty dollars with which to buy a new suit of clothes a pair of shoes a hat and a railroad ticket upon conditions that he would not be prosecuted i reckon he was badly scared too  matt was much pleased leaving andy in charge of the store he went out to dinner taking tom inwold along with him after the meal the wearing apparel was purchased and donned and then they made their way to the depot here a ticket for plainfield was procured and the young auctioneer saw to it that the boy boarded the proper train  ill never forget you never said tom inwold on parting and he never has nor has mrs inwold who was grateful to the last degree for what matt had been instrumental in doing for her  on the following morning on going down to the store to open up andy and matt saw that the entire stock of the store adjoining had been removed during the night gissem had been fearful of trouble despite what andy had promised and had taken time by the forelock and left for parts unknown the young auctioneers never met him or his partner again  by having the entire field to themselves the young auctioneers did a splendid business and when they were ready to pack up and start for scranton they found that they had cleared nearly ninety dollars by their stay in wilkesbarre  in the meantime the weather had been growing steadily colder and they found it necessary to invest in a secondhand robe to keep them warm when driving  it looks a bit like snow remarked andy as they drove out of the city one morning i hope we dont catch it before we reach where we are going to a snowstorm in the mountains is not a very pleasant thing to encounter  we must run our chances returned matt and billy was urged forward and soon the city outskirts were left far behind  the sun had shone for awhile but about nine oclock it went under a heavy cloud then it began to get slightly warmer and andy was certain that snow was coming  his prediction was fulfilled by ten oclock it was snowing furiously and by eleven the ground was covered to the depth of half a foot  that settles it we cant make scranton today nor even pittston said matt we had better hunt up some sort of a house with a barn attached where we can put up  but andy was for continuing the journey so onward they went until at last just before the noon hour they found the road getting too heavy for billy they went down into a hollow which the falling snow had covered and there the wagon remained despite every effort to budge it  they looked around in some dismay not even a house nor a building of any sort was in sight  this is a pretty pickle muttered andy i wish we had followed your advice and sought shelter  weve got to do something returned matt if we stay here well be completely snowed under the snow is coming down thicker every minute whats to be done  ah what was to be done that was a question not easy to answer both of the young auctioneers were much disturbed     chapter xxxvi  lost in the snow   it was not a pleasant outlook stuck in a deep hollow on the road with the snow coming down furiously already the ground was covered to the depth of a foot or more and around the heavilyladen wagon a drift was forming which soon reached above the axles  we must do something thats certain muttered matt as he sprang to billys head for at least the fifth time come old fellow cant you stir it up a bit  andy ran to the back of the wagon and placed his shoulder against the case there strapped on but though the two and billy the horse did their best the auction wagon remained where it was  its no use groaned andy as he stopped to catch his breath we are stuck as hard as if we were planted here and it looks as if we would have to remain here for some time  we must move on returned matt desperately in a few hours night will be coming on and well be completely covered  the snow is coming down faster than ever and the wind is rising maybe we are going to have a blizzard if we do heaven help us  let us take those cases of goods off suggested the young auctioneer after a moment of thought that will lighten the load for billy somewhat  the big packing boxes were unstrapped and let down in the snow they were followed by every other article which could be removed from the turnout without damage  then billy was once more urged to go on matt and andy pushing with all their strength in the meanwhile the wheels of the wagon and the axles creaked and then moved forward slowly  hurrah weve got it started shouted matt joyfully get up billy get up  and the horse really did strain every muscle until two minutes later the wagon was out of the hollow and up on the ridge of a little hill  thank fortune we are out of that exclaimed andy now what is to be done  we had better strap the cases in place again and continue on our way  the cases are awfully heavy i wonder if we cant hide them somewhere and come back for them later the snow is not melting so that wont hurt them  the matter was talked over and finally they decided to leave the two cases which had not been opened and were well packed under a big tree near the roadside the cases were removed to the spot without delay placed upon a couple of dead trees and covered with brush  then they moved on again andy leading the horse and matt going on ahead to inspect the road and thus avoid getting into another hollow  it was bitterly cold and having nothing but a light overcoat on the young auctioneer was chilled to the bone he was compelled to caper about and clap his hands continually to keep from being frozen the snow now fine and hard beat into his face mercilessly and to protect himself from this he pulled his hat far down over his eyes and tied his handkerchief over his mouth and nose  but the hardships of the storm were not to be endured for long a quarter of a mile further on they came to a large farmhouse situated some little distance back from the road in the rear was a barn and a cowshed  running ahead matt knocked upon the door of the house it was opened by an elderly farmer who was smoking and who held a paper in his hand  goodafternoon said the young auctioneer can we get shelter here for ourselves and our horse we are willing to pay for the accommodation  whats the matter caught on the road returned the farmer pleasantly  yes sir and matt briefly narrated the particulars  drive right around to the barn were the farmers welcome words ill open up for you and make your horse comfortable enough  and reaching for his hat and coat he put them on and came outside  andy was not slow to drive billy into shelter the barn was a large one and far from filled and the wagon went in without difficulty  as soon as the horse had been cared for the young auctioneers followed the farmer back to the house the family had just finished their dinner but set to work at once to prepare food for the halffrozen and exhausted travelers  while matt and andy were warming up they told the farmer about the cases which had been left on the road  i suppose they ought not to be left there too long said andy if i had a light wagon and a pair of strong horses i would go after them as soon as ive had something to eat  dont you mind ill go after em for you said the farmer ive got sam and bess and they can pull through most anything perhaps after youve had dinner it will be too late  well if you get them we will pay you whatever it is worth returned matts partner  the farmer set about the trip without delay and just as andy and matt were called to the diningtable he drove out of the yard  the meal was a good one there being plenty to eat and all of it well served to the two halffamished ones it seemed to be about the best meal they had ever tasted  after it was over they sat down by the fire and began to chat with the farmers wife a motherly creature of the same age as her husband every five minutes matt would walk to the window to see if the farmer was yet returning  it was nearly an hour before mr pearsall for such was the farmers name drove up to the door matt and andy ran out to meet him and were relieved to learn that the cases of goods had been brought in good condition they were taken around to the barn and there transferred to their original places on the auction wagon  mr pearsall was curious to know something of their business and when they were once more in the house the two young auctioneers told their story to which both the farmer and his wife listened with deep interest  as it continued to snow matt and andy decided to remain at the farmhouse over night and arrangements were made to that effect they spent a pleasant evening and all hands retired early  in the morning much to their joy they found that the snow had stopped coming down and that the sun was shining brightly they had an early breakfast and then after settling with mr pearsall who did not wish cash but took goods his wife desired instead they set off for pittston which was scarcely half a mile distant  billy had had a good rest and the city mentioned above was reached in a short while here they arranged for an extra horse that was hitched up in front of their own in this manner they started for scranton with more confidence  the road was as rocky and uneven as before but it being bright and clear they were enabled to avoid hollows with ease they stopped at taylor for dinner and arrived in scranton an hour before nightfall tired out but happy to think that their journey for the balance of the week at least was over  as soon as they had settled in a vacant store matt left andy in charge and hurried to the postoffice to look for a letter from ida bartlett he was not disappointed the letter was there and he read it with deep interest  since receiving your letter she wrote i have been watching mr fenton closely and i am satisfied that he is much disturbed over the fact that mr gaston has left his employ and that he was threatened with exposure i have also taken the liberty to write to mr gaston but have as yet received no reply will write again as soon as he answers it is a pity you cannot find out what became of your poor father and the papers     chapter xxxvii  more of auction life   yes i would give every cent i am worth and more to learn what did become of father said matt to andy after he had allowed his partner to peruse the letter  i have no doubt you would matt returned andy feelingly i can imagine how much it worries younot knowing if he is dead or alive but you must keep a stout heart and trust to the future to clear up the mystery  im trying to do that but andy its hard work and matts handsome face took on an unusually sober look  knowing that nothing could be gained by discussing the matter which had been talked over a score of times previously andy changed the subject business had opened very well and he wished to go out and have some circulars printed by which even a larger crowd might be attracted to the sale  it remained clear for two days and during that time both of the young auctioneers were kept busy from eight oclock in the morning until eleven at night  on the third day it began to grow warmer and by noon it was raining steadily  well never mind the rain will wash the snow away and if it only stays clear afterward we will have a chance to get on to carbondale was andys cheerful comment  seeing that matt could get along very well alone he left the store in the afternoon to buy a heavy overcoat at some clothing establishment if he procured what he wished matt was to buy one also  left to himself the young auctioneer did what he could to attract trade but without success he waited on the few customers who had drifted in but when they were gone found himself alone  rather than have the time hang heavily upon his hands he began to clean up the stock cutlery and spoons need constant care to keep them looking bright and matt was therefore never at a loss for employment  while he was hard at work shining up some silverplated ware which was slightly tarnished through handling the door of the store was flung open violently and a large heavilybuilt man staggered in at a glance matt saw that the man was much the worse for the liquor he had drunk  say is this an auction store grunted the man as he tried to walk up to the counter with some show of steadiness  it is returned the young auctioneer briefly of all persons to deal with he hated a drunken man the worst  it is heya genuine auction store went on the tipsy individual  yes what can i do for you and matt put the silverware he was handling away  i want to buy a pistol  matt was surprised at this statement and he was also alarmed the tipsy man was certainly not the person to have a firearm in his possession  you wish a pistol he said slowly  thats me boy hand out the best pistol you have in the place i dont want any toy popgun remember  and the man glared at matt as though the boy were his one personal enemy  excuse me but i hardly think i have a pistol to suit you replied the young auctioneer thinking it best to discourage the man if possible you had better go to a regular firearms store  i aint agoing nowhere but here growled the wouldbe customer as he gave a lurch against the counter i want a pistol best you got understand  i understand but i havent any pistol for you matt replied steadily he wished andy would come back  what do you mean to say you refuse to sell me a pistol howled the man savagely let me tell you boy that i have ample means for reimbursing you  i havent any pistol for you sir you had better go elsewhere  wont go understand i wont go let me see them pistols in that showcase and be quick about it  matt was now growing alarmed the man was just intoxicated enough to be thoroughly ugly and might try to do him harm should he refuse the request which had been made yet he realized more than ever that the man was not the one to be trusted with a firearm  i do not care to show you the pistols was all the young auctioneer could say you must go elsewhere if you wish one  wont sell me one hey  no i will not  why  i have my reasons  youre awfully smart boy most too smart to live but i am going to have what i want understand that  with unsteady steps the man walked to the rear end of the counter and came around to the inner side he was met by matt who becoming alarmed had picked up the buttend of a fishingrod with which to defend himself  you cant come back here sir  oh yes i can  i say you cannot the best thing you can do is to go elsewhere  what do you threaten me  i want you to understand that you cannot come back here i told you i did not wish to sell you a pistol and that ought to be enough  want to fight boy demanded the man scowling savagely and doubling up his fists  no i do not wish to fight i merely wish to be left alone  matt had hardly spoken when the tipsy man hurled himself forward intending to catch the young auctioneer by the throat but matt was too quick for him he stepped backward and the consequence was that the man went headlong striking the floor with such force that every article in the store shook and rattled  youyou young villain panted the tipsy man as he attempted to rise to his feet what do you mean by such conduct help me up do you hear  i hear but i am not going to assist you until you promise to leave at once returned matt  im going to look at those pistols first growled the intoxicated one and by holding fast to the counter he managed but not without much difficulty to rise to his feet once more thats a fine way to treat a gentleman  it was your own fault you had no business to try to catch me by the throat  and you had no business to be saucy understand boy saucy i never allow any one to be saucy to me now them pistols and no more nonsense  instead of replying matt tried to push the man out from behind the counter the young auctioneer thought that if he could get him out near the door he would then be able to summon assistance and have the tipsy individual taken away  evidently the man suspected his intention he declined to be pushed back and seeing what he considered a good chance he hurled himself at matt once more and this time both rolled to the floor  in going down the young auctioneer struck his head upon the sharp corner of a box he was partly stunned and for several seconds could not make a movement in his own favor the piece of the fishingrod flew out of his hand and this his opponent picked up  ill teach you to talk to a gentleman like myself growled the tipsy man and he aimed a blow at the young auctioneers head with the weapon he had secured  the blow failed to reach its mark but undismayed by his failure to injure matt the man gathered himself together and prepared for a second attack     chapter xxxviii  a surprising discovery   it looked as if the young auctioneer was in for a serious time of it as has been said the wouldbe purchaser of a pistol was just drunk enough to be ugly and unreasonable he had refused to leave the auction store and now he was bent upon doing mischief to the boy who had failed to treat him as he fancied he ought to be served  now how do you like that you young rascal growled the man as he brought the end of the fishingrod down for a second time  i dont like it at all returned matt as he recovered sufficiently to dodge out of the way although the stick came uncomfortably close to his ears let me up at once  not much boy not much im going to teach you a lesson to be civil to customers  you are getting yourself into serious trouble  ho ho i reckon i am able to take care of myself  once again the man sought to strike matt and this time he succeeded the blow landed upon the young auctioneers shoulder and caused him to cry out with pain  at that instant the door opened and andy entered the store carrying on his arm the new overcoat he had just purchased  whats the matter matt he cried in quick alarm  help me andy this drunken man is trying to knock me out with that stick  the senior partner of the firm needed no second call for assistance without hesitation he flung the overcoat on a packing case and rushing up to matts assailant caught him by the collar and dragged him from behind the counter  let meme go spluttered the tipsy individual let go my collar  dont you do it andy and matt sprang to his feet as quickly as he could  i dont intend to was andys determined answer whats the meaning of this trouble  he wouldnt let me look at the pistols whined the tipsy man collapsing now that he saw he was powerless to do any more injury  i didnt think he was in fit condition to look at anything put in matt  you had no right to abuse my partner said andy sure that matt was in the right of the altercation now you get right out of here and dont show your face again  and andy shoved the man toward the door which he had left partly open  the tipsy man began to remonstrate and wanted to fight both of them he grew quite abusive and threatened to wreck all the things in the establishment before he could carry out his threat however andy and matt landed him out on his back on the sidewalk and beckoned to a passing policeman  what so its you again cried the officer on seeing the intoxicated individual i thought you had warning enough at the hotel what has he been doing he asked of matt  he got mad because i wouldnt let him handle the pistols in the place  the pistols  yes sir he insisted upon seeing the best pistol we had and i wouldnt accommodate him i thought it might be dangerous of course he would want cartridges and then he might go off and shoot somebody  that was his intention he got into a row in the hotel on the next block and the clerk says he threatened to shoot the proprietor i suppose he was bent on getting the pistol to do it with just you come with me and ill give you a chance to sober up  the tipsy man remonstrated and tried to make the policeman believe that the rows at the hotel and at the store were only jokes but the officer would not listen and took the drunken individual to the stationhouse where later on he was sentenced to thirty days in the county jail for disturbing the peace  thats another side of the auction business said matt after he and andy were left alone and i must confess its a side i dont like it was lucky you came along when you did  an intoxicated man never makes a good customer matt some storekeepers try to get his money away from him but as for me i want nothing to do with him  the blow on the shoulder had not injured matt and soon the incident exciting as it had been was almost forgotten andy had struck a bargain as he termed it in the purchase of his new overcoat and he wished matt to go off at once and get one like it  they are selling about two dozen off at bottom price he said and you want to lose no time if you wish to get fitted it is the first store on the third block above here  all right ill go andy for i cant do without the overcoat and off matt started never once dreaming of what was going to happen on that simple little shopping trip  matt located the clothing shop without difficulty it was quite well filled with customers but he soon found the salesman who had served andy and this young man did not keep him waiting any longer than was absolutely necessary  there were three overcoats which just fitted matt and he hesitated as to which to take he tried them all on but could not decide the question  ill take them to the daylight and examine them he said and walked from the center of the store which was lighted by gas toward the show window  here he began to examine each overcoat critically one was black the other brown and third a dark blue matt rather fancied the dark blue  while he was handling over the darkblue coat the form of a ragged man darkened the side of the show window furthest from the door with hardly a thought matt looked up to see who it was  then the heart of the young auctioneer seemed to fairly stop beating the ragged man on the pavement outside was his father  with a sharp cry that startled every one in the establishment matt dashed down the garments he held and made a rush for the door at the same moment the man outside catching one glimpse of matts face put up both his hands to his forehead and sped up the street as if running for his life  whats the matter with that young fellow  whats the matter with the man  say come back here  did he steal anything  these and a score of other cries rang out in quick succession but matt paid no attention nor did he stop to offer any explanation to the astonished clothing salesman he had seen his father his father for whom he had been searching so long and so earnestly he could tell that face as haggard and white as it was among a million  away sped the man up the street and on after him came matt running as he had never run before he could not understand why his parent should thus try to get away from him but he did not stop to reason on the matter he wanted to reach his father that was all and he strained every muscle to accomplish his effort  but although matt was a good runner the man he was after appeared well able to keep beyond his reach evidently some dreadful fear urged him on for many times he would look back over his shoulder and each time pass his hands over his forehead as if to wipe the sight from his brain and memory  soon several blocks had been passed and then the man turned a corner and started toward the poorer section of the city matt continued to follow for half a dozen blocks further then he saw his father dart into the open hallway of a halftumbleddown tenement  when he reached the building the young auctioneer peered into the hallway but could see no one several little girls were playing upon the sidewalk and he asked them if they had seen any one go in  crazy will just went in replied one of the girls guess he has gone up to his room in the garret  crazy will murmured matt to himself poor father how thankful i am that i have found you at last  and trembling with emotion he hurried up the rickety stairs until he reached the door of the apartment which one of the girls pointed out as that occupied by crazy will     chapter xxxix  a mystery cleared up   the door of the garret room was closed and when matt tried the knob he found that it was also locked he knocked lightly upon it  at first there was no response then a weak voice which he could but faintly recognize as that of his father asked sharply  whos there what do you want why dont you go away and leave me alone  father father come and open the door exclaimed matt his voice trembling as it had never trembled before  who speaks go away i say and leave a poor old man alone  father it is me matt dont you remember me  matt matt oh no matt was lost when his mother was lost and the money yes the money mother and matt too bad go away and dont persecute me  no father you are mistaken i am here fatheryour only son matt please open the door  you are fooling me didnt you fool me about matt only last week and throw a pail of water on me and call me crazy will go away i say  no father i will not go away you must open the door you must i have been hunting for you so longever since mother died and you disappeared and now that i have found you we shall never separate again open the door do please  these words spoken with an intensity which cannot be described had the necessary effect upon the poor weakminded man inside of the garret room matt heard him move slowly toward the door and then heard the key turn in the lock the next instant the door opened and the boy sprang into the room and caught his father around the neck  oh father dont you know me he cried with deep emotion it is matt your only son  he looked his father steadily in the eyes the tears meanwhile coursing freely down his cheeks mr lincoln returned the gaze for a moment then the wild look died out of his eyes and his breast heaved and he gave a deep sob  matt matt it is really you my son my son  he caught the boy in his arms and hugged him to his breast sobbing the meanwhile like a little child he spoke of his wife and her death of his lost money and a hundred other things and then in the midst of it all threw up his arms and sank to the floor in a dead faint  a less courageous boy than matt would have been badly scared but he knew of these fainting spells for his father had had them years before and had always come out of them feeling weaker in body it was true but always clearer in mind  in one corner of the room lay an old mattress and upon this he placed his fathers form then he opened the tightlyclosed window and began to bathe his fathers forehead with some water that stood in a cracked pitcher near by  two of the girls that had told him about crazy will had followed him up the tenement stairs and were now standing outside of the garretroom door staring at all that was going on matt called them in  do either of you want to earn twentyfive cents he asked  what doin asked the older of the two girls promptly  i want you to deliver a message for me  where to  matt mentioned the auction store and described its location the girl said she knew where it was and would willingly take a message there  dont yer want a doctor she asked  not yet you take this note and it will be all right but you must not lose a minute  ill run all the way replied the girl  taking out a notebook he carried matt hastily scribbled down the following brief message    andy i have found my father come with the bearer at once    matt  this he folded up and addressed to his partner in another minute the girl was flying down the tenement stairs two steps at a time the other girl close behind her  when they were gone matt closed the door and again turned his attention to his father  mr lincolns eyes were still closed but by putting his ear down to his parents chest matt found that his father was breathing quite regularly he continued to bathe his parents forehead and also fanned him with a newspaper which was lying by  while waiting for his father to come to again matt could not help but gaze at the surroundings the garret room was small and bare of furniture containing nothing but the mattress a brokendown stove and a few cracked dishes there was half a loaf of stale bread beside the dishes and nothing else to eat was in sight  what a place to live in murmured the boy to himself poor father poor father  he again bent over the motionless form and it was not long before he had the satisfaction of seeing his father open his eyes  matt is it really you or is this another one of those tantalizing dreams asked mr lincoln feebly as he essayed to rise to a sitting position  it is really i father returned the son gently you had better lie still for awhile your run exhausted you  how thankful i am that it is really you but there must be some mistake i have dreamed of these things before that is why i ran away  there is no mistake now father it is really and truly i and matt bent lower and wound his arms around his fathers neck you have nothing more to fear father just rely on me for everything  i will matt i will i know it is you now that you are so close to me  and father you must promise that you will not run away again  i promise matt my mind was upsetits upset yet im afraid but i wont leave you matt i wont leave you i used to imagine i saw you and then the boys on the street would plague me and call me crazy will but thats all over now thank heaven thats all over now     chapter xl  the mining sharesconclusion   in less than half an hour andy reached the garret room and matt told his partner his story andy was introduced to mr lincoln as a friend who could be trusted in all things and although the weakminded man was suspicious of all strangers he made no demonstration against his sons companion  i wish to take him to some quiet place where he can have the best of medical attention said matt to andy do you think you can find such a place i do not dare to leave him yet  i will do my best returned andy  he went off in search of the right place and in an hour came back accompanied by a pleasant man fifty or sixty years of age whom he introduced as dr zabrinsky  the doctor will take your father into his own home he said he has two patients suffering from mental troubles and makes a specialty of such things he will do his best  matt was pleased by the medical mans appearance and after some little conversation a carriage was called and mr lincoln was removed accompanied by matt to the doctors private sanitarium andy was left behind to go over mr lincolns meager effects and bring away anything of value  at the doctors home the almost helpless man was made as comfortable as possible he was inclined to become excited over what had happened but the doctor administered an opiate and he soon after sank into a gentle slumber  when andy reached the house some time later his face betoken that he had something of unusual interest to tell he bore a package of papers in his hand and these he handed over to matt  i found then stuck in the mattress he said they are papers in reference to the mining shares your father purchased from randolph fenton from what you have told me i believe fenton swindled your father as soon as your father is well enough to be left i would send for that mr gaston and have the matter looked up  matt examined the papers with keen interest he became satisfied that andy was right and determined to act upon his suggestions  dr zabrinsky was true to his word he did all that was possible for the sufferer and between his medical skill and matts watchful care mr lincoln recovered rapidly once in a great while his mind would take on a flighty turn but matt was watchful and always calmed him down and at the end of six months the man whose mind had been so strangely affected was as rational and well as ever  long before this time matt made a trip to new york and called upon ida bartlett at her new place of business they had a long conversation concerning randolph fenton and his methods of selling stocks and shares  at the end of this talk matt made inquiries concerning mr gastons whereabouts he learned that the former clerk was in bridgeport connecticut and telegraphed that he wished to see him without delay on the following friday morning mr gaston presented himself at the hotel at which matt was stopping  the young auctioneer went over his entire story and produced the papers which had been in his fathers possession he promised gaston a liberal reward should they succeed in forcing randolph fenton to make proper restitution for a transaction that was undoubtedly criminal upon its face  the old bookkeeper at once consented to do what he could he called in a lawyer of thorough experience and several affidavits were made out and a search made for mr lincolns rightful shares for the ones randolph fenton had assigned to him had been some of a similar name but of far less value then all hands marched down to the brokers office  randolph fenton was somewhat surprised to see matt and he turned slightly pale when gaston confronted him accompanied by the lawyer and another man he knew was a private detective  without preliminaries the lawyer explained the object of the visit as he proceeded the broker grew paler and paler and he clutched the arms of his chair nervously  youyou are mistaken he finally gasped out that transaction was perfectly legitimate this is a plot on the part of that man and that boy to ruin my reputation  it is no plot mr fenton put in matt for my poor fathers sake as well as my own i ask for justice that is all your actions unbalanced my fathers mind and if i wanted to be hardhearted i would not rest until you were behind the prison bars  stuff and nonsense this is all a putup job  dont get excited mr fenton said the lawyer pointedly the boy is letting you down very easily to my way of thinking  tuttut i wont listen to a word i want you all to leave this office and stop this farce  if we have to leave without satisfaction you will go with mr briarly the detective cried matt now you can take your choice i am no longer your office boy and you cannot twist me around your finger  these words filled randolph fenton with rage he wanted to abuse everybody within hearing but both the lawyer and the detective cut him short by threatening him with immediate arrest finally he asked for time in which to consider the case  this was granted but after they left matt instructed the detective to keep a close watch on the man fearful that fenton who according to mr gastons statement was in bad favor in a number of places would convert what securities he held into cash and leave for parts unknown  it was well that matt did this for on the following night the detective captured the broker just as the latter was boarding a train at the grand central depot he had a satchel full of money with him and in his card case was found a railroad ticket for montreal canada randolph fenton was placed under arrest and then all of his many misdeeds were thoroughly investigated and exposed  out of the wreckage the swindling broker had left behind him matt was able to secure threefourths of the rightful shares of mining stock for his father these shares had gone up in value and were found to be worth close on to fiftyeight thousand dollars to matt who in his wanderings around had learned the true value of money it seemed a fortune  you wont want any more of the auction business said andy you will have your hands full taking care of that money and your father  yes i guess my days as a young auctioneer are over returned matt i want to get a better education if possible and thus fit myself for something higher in life  what about your share in the business i cant buy it out just yet  i have talked it over with father andy and i have decided to make you a present of it you deserve it for ever since we met you have been a real brother to me make what you can out of the business and if you ever get in a tight corner dont hesitate to come to me and i will do what i can for you  andy demurred at matts generosity but was finally persuaded to accept the gift he settled in middletown for the winter and did very well in the spring he started on his travels again and by fall had made enough to open a goodsized picture and art store in new york city on fourteenth street he still runs the store and is making money fast much to the disgust of caleb gulligan who grows poorer each year  after matt left the auction business he settled down with his father in a quiet home on the hudson river not many miles above the great metropolis he took care of his father until the next autumn when mr lincoln felt sufficiently recovered to go into business and purchased the controlling interest in a large flour and feed establishment the business is very prosperous ida bartlett is stenographer and confidential clerk to the firm and has a wellpaying position which will remain open for her so long as the kindhearted young woman cares to occupy it matt did not fail to keep his former determination to give her a handsome christmas present and the two are likely to be lifelong friends  as for matt himself he has just finished a course at columbia college and next month will become the junior partner in a promising young law firm let us wish him every success for the honest and fearless lad who was once the young auctioneer deserves it   the end
