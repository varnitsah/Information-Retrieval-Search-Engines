10805576	twentyfive village sermons     sermon i  gods world    psalm civ 24  o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all  the earth is full of thy riches  when we read such psalms as the one from which this verse is taken we cannot help if we consider feeling at once a great difference between them and any hymns or religious poetry which is commonly written or read in these days  the hymns which are most liked now and the psalms which people most willingly choose out of the bible are those which speak or seem to speak about gods dealings with peoples own souls while such psalms as this are overlooked people do not care really about psalms of this kind when they find them in the bible and they do not expect or wish nowadays any one to write poetry like them  for these psalms of which i speak praise and honour god not for what he has done to our souls but for what he has done and is doing in the world around us  this very 104th psalm for instance speaks entirely about things which we hardly care or even think proper to mention in church now  it speaks of this earth entirely and the things on it  of the light the clouds and windof hills and valleys and the springs on the hill sidesof wild beasts and birdsof grass and corn and wine and oilof the sun and moon night and daythe great sea the ships and the fishes and all the wonderful and nameless creatures which people the watersthe very birds nests in the high trees and the rabbits burrowing among the rocksnothing on the earth but this psalm thinks it worth mentioning  and all this which one would expect to find only in a book of natural history is in the bible in one of the psalms written to be sung in the temple at jerusalem before the throne of the living god and his glory which used to be seen in that templeinspired as we all believe by gods spirit gods own word in short  that is worth thinking of  surely the man who wrote this must have thought very differently about this world with its fields and woods and beasts and birds from what we think  suppose now that we had been old jews in the temple standing before the holy house and that we believed as the jews believed that there was only one thin wall and one curtain of linen between us and the glory of the living god that unspeakable brightness and majesty which no one could look at for fear of instant death except the highpriest in fear and trembling once a yearthat inside that small holy house he god almighty appeared visiblygod who made heaven and earth  suppose we had been there in the temple and known all this should we have liked to be singing about beasts and birds with god himself close to us  we should not have liked itwe should have been terrified thinking perhaps about our own sinfulness perhaps about that wonderful majesty which dwelt inside  we should have wished to say or sing something spiritual as we call it at all events something very different from the 104th psalm about woods and rivers and dumb beasts  we do not like the thought of such a thing  it seems almost irreverent almost impertinent to god to be talking of such things in his presence  now does this shew us that we think about this earth and the things in it in a very different way from those old jews  they thought it a fit and proper thing to talk about corn and wine and oil and cattle and fishes in the presence of almighty god and we do not think it fit and proper  we read this psalm when it comes in the churchservice as a matter of course mainly because we do not believe that god is here among us  we should not be so ready to read it if we thought that almighty god was so near us  that is a great difference between us and the old jews  whether it shews that we are better or not than they were in the main i cannot tell perhaps some of them had such thoughts too and said it is not respectful to god to talk about such commonplace earthly things in his presence perhaps some of them thought themselves spiritual and pureminded for looking down on this psalm and on david for writing it  very likely for men have had such thoughts in all ages and will have them  but the man who wrote this psalm had no such thoughts  he said himself in this same psalm that his words would please god  nay he is not speaking and preaching about god in this psalm as i am now in my sermon but he is doing more he is speaking to goda much more solemn thing if you will think of it he says o lord my god thou art become exceeding glorious  thou deckest thyself with light as with a garment  all the beasts wait on thee when thou givest them meat they gather it  thou renewest the face of the earth  when he turns and speaks of god as he saying he appointed the moon and so on he cannot help going back to god and pouring out his wonder and delight and awe to god himself as we would sooner speak to any one we love and honour than merely speak about them  he cannot take his mind off god  and just at the last when he does turn and speak to himself it is to say praise thou the lord o my soul praise the lord as if rebuking and stirring up himself for being too coldhearted and slow for not admiring and honouring enough the infinite wisdom and power and love and glorious majesty of god which to him shines out in every hedgeside bird and every blade of grass  truly i said that man had a very different way of looking at gods earth from what we have  now in what did that difference lie  what was it  we need not look far to see  it was thisdavid looked on the earth as gods earth we look on it as mans earth or nobodys earth  we know that we are here with trees and grass and beasts and birds round us  and we know that we did not put them here and that after we are dead and gone they will go on just as they went on before we were borneach tree and flower and animal after its kind but we know nothing more  the earth is here and we on it but who put it there and why it is there and why we are on it instead of being anywhere else few ever think  but to david the earth looked very different it had quite another meaning it spoke to him of god who made it  by seeing what this earth is like he saw what god who made it is like  and we see no such thing  the earthwe can eat the corn and cattle on it we can earn money by farming it and ploughing and digging it and that is all most men know about it but david knew something moresomething which made him feel himself very weak and yet very safe very ignorant and stupid and yet honoured with glorious knowledge from godsomething which made him feel that he belonged to this world and must not forget it or neglect it that this earth was his lessonbookthis earth was his workfield and yet those same thoughts which shewed him how he was made for the land round him and the land round him was made for him shewed him also that he belonged to another worlda spirit world shewed him that when this world passed away he should live for ever shewed him that while he had a mortal body he had an immortal soul too shewed him that though his home and business were here on earth yet that for that very reason his home and business were in heaven with god who made the earth with that blessed one of whom he said thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands they shall perish but thou shalt endure they all shall fade as a garment and like a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall stand fast in thy sight  as a garment shalt thou change them ay there was davids secret  he saw that this earth and skies are gods garmentthe garment by which we see god and that is what our forefathers saw too and just what we have forgotten but david had not forgotten it  look at this very 104th psalm again how he refers every thing to god  we say the light shines david says something more he says thou o god adornest thyself with light as with a curtain  light is a picture of god  god says st john is light and in him is no darkness at all  we say the clouds fly and the wind blows as if they went of themselves david says god makes the clouds his chariot and walks upon the wings of the wind  we talk of the rich airs of spring of the flashing lightning of summer as dead things and men who call themselves wise say that lightning is only matterwe can grind the like of it out of glass and silk and make lightning for ourselves in a small way and so they can in a small way and in a very small one david does not deny that but he puts us in mind of something in that lightning and those breezes which we cannot make  he says god makes the winds his angels and flaming fire his ministers and st paul takes the same text and turns it round to suit his purpose when he is talking of the blessed angels saying that text in the 104th psalm means something more it means that god makes his angels spirits that is winds and his ministers a flaming fire  so shewing us that in those breezes there are living spirits that gods angels guide those thunderclouds that the roaring thunderclap is a shock in the air truly but that it is something morethat it is the voice of god which shakes the cedartrees of lebanon and tears down the thick bushes and makes the wild deer slip their young  so we read in the psalms in church that is davids account of the thunder  i take it for a true account you may or not as you like  see again  those springs in the hill sides how do they come there  rainwater soaking and flowing out we say  true but david says something more he says god sends the springs and he sends them into the rivers too  you may say why water must run downhill what need of god  but suppose god had chosen that water should run uphill and not down how would it have been thenvery different i think  no he sends them he sends all things  wherever there is any thing useful his spirit has settled it  the help that is done on earth he doeth it all himselfloving and mercifulcaring for the poor dumb beastshe sends the springs and david says all the beasts of the field drink thereof  the wild animals in the night he cares for them toohe the almighty god  we hear the foxes bark by night and we think the fox is hungry and there it ends with us but not with david  he says the lions roaring after their prey do seek their meat from godgod who feedeth the young ravens who call upon him  he is a god  he did not make the world says a wise man and then let it spin round his finger as we wind up a watch and then leave it to go of itself  no his mercy is over all his works  loving and merciful the god of nature is the god of grace the same love which chose us and our forefathers for his people while we were yet dead in trespasses and sins the same only begotten son who came down on earth to die for us poor wretches on the crossthat same love that same power that same word of god who made heaven and earth looks after the poor gnats in the winter time that they may have a chance of coming out of the ground when the day stirs the little life in them and dance in the sunbeam for a short hour of gay life before they return to the dust whence they were made to feed creatures nobler and more precious than themselves  that is all gods doing all the doing of christ the king of the earth  they wait on him says david  the beasts and birds and insects the strange fish and shells and the nameless corals too in the deep deep sea who build and build below the water for years and thousands of years every little tiny creature bringing his atom of lime to add to the great heap till their heap stands out of the water and becomes dry land and seeds float thither over the wide waste sea and trees grow up and birds are driven thither by storms and men come by accident in stray ships and build and sow and multiply and raise churches and worship the god of heaven and christ the blessed oneon that new land which the little coral worms have built up from the deep  consider that  who sent them there  who contrived that those particular men should light on that new island at that especial time  who guided thither those seedsthose birds  who gave those insects that strange longing and power to build and build on continually christ by whom all things are made to whom all power is given in heaven and earth he and his spirit and none else  it is when he opens his hand they are filled with good  it is when he takes away their breath they die and turn again to their dust  he lets his breath his spirit go forth and out of that dead dust grow plants and herbs afresh for man and beast and he renews the face of the earth  for says the wise man all things are gods garment outward and visible signs of his unseen and unapproachable glory and when they are worn out he changes them says the psalmist as a garment and they shall be changed   the old order changes giving place to the new and god fulfils himself in many ways   but he is the same  he is there all the time  all things are his work  in all things we may see him if our souls have eyes  all things be they what they may which live and grow on this earth or happen on land or in the sky will tell us a tale of godshew forth some one feature at least of our blessed saviours countenance and charactereither his foresight or his wisdom or his order or his power or his love or his condescension or his longsuffering or his slow sure vengeance on those who break his laws  it is all written there outside in the great green book which god has given to labouring men and which neither taxes nor tyrants can take from them  the man who is no scholar in letters may read of god as he follows the plough for the earth he ploughs is his fathers  there is gods mark and seal on ithis name which though it is written on the dust yet neither man nor fiend can wipe it out  the poor solitary untaught boy who keeps the sheep or minds the birds long lonely days far from his mother and his playmates may keep alive in him all purifying thoughts if he will but open his eyes and look at the green earth around him  think now my boys when you are at your work how all things may put you in mind of god if you do but choose  the trees which shelter you from the wind god planted them there for your sakes in his lovethere is a lesson about god  the birds which you drive off the corn who gave them the sense to keep together and profit by each others wit and keen eyesight  who but god who feeds the young birds when they call on himthere is another lesson about god  the sheep whom you follow who ordered the warm wool to grow on them from which your clothes are made  who but the spirit of god above who clothes the grass of the field the silly sheep and who clothes you too and thinks of you when you dont think of yourselvesthere is another lesson about god  the feeble lambs in spring they ought to remind you surely of your blessed saviour the lamb of god who died for you upon the cruel cross who was led as a lamb to the slaughter and like a sheep that lies dumb and patient under the shearers hand so he opened not his mouth  are not these lambs then a lesson from god  and these are but one or two examples out of thousands and thousands  oh that i could make you young and old all feel these things  oh that i could make you see god in every thing and every thing in god  oh that i could make you look on this earth not as a mere dull dreary prison and workhouse for your mortal bodies but as a living book to speak to you at every time of the living god father son and holy ghost sure i am that that would be a heavenly life for yousure i am that it would keep you from many a sin and stir you up to many a holy thought and deed if you could learn to find in every thing around you however small or mean the work of gods hand the likeness of gods countenance the shadow of gods glory    sermon ii  religion not godliness    psalm civ 1315  he watereth the hills from his chambers  the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works  he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man  that he may bring forth food out of the earth and wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his face to shine and bread which strengtheneth mans heart  did you ever remark my friends that the bible says hardly any thing about religionthat it never praises religious people  this is very curious  would to god we would all remember it  the bible speaks of a religious man only once and of religion only twice except where it speaks of the jews religion to condemn it and shews what an empty blind useless thing it was  what does this bible talk of then  it talks of god not of religion but of god  it tells us not to be religious but to be godly  you may think there is no difference or that it is but a difference of words  i tell you that a difference in words is a very awful important difference  a difference in words is a difference in things  words are very awful and wonderful things for they come from the most awful and wonderful of all beings jesus christ the word  he puts words into mens mindshe made all things and he makes all words to express those things with  and woe to those who use the wrong words about thingsfor if a man calls any thing by its wrong name it is a sure sign that he understands that thing wrongly or feels about it wrongly and therefore a mans words are oftener honester than he thinks for as a mans words are so is a mans heart out of the abundance of our hearts our mouths speak and therefore by right words by the right names which we call things we shall be justified and by our words by the wrong names we call things we shall be condemned  therefore a difference in words is a difference in the things which those words mean and there is a difference between religion and godliness and we shew it by our words  now these are religious times but they are very ungodly times and we shew that also by our words  because we think that people ought to be religious we talk a great deal about religion because we hardly think at all that a man ought to be godly we talk very little about god and that good old bible word godliness does not pass our lips once amonth  for a man may be very religious my friends and yet very ungodly  the heathens were very religious at the very time that as st paul tells us they would not keep god in their knowledge  the jews were the most religious people on the earth they hardly talked or thought about anything but religion at the very time that they knew so little of god that they crucified him when he came down among them  st paul says that he was living after the strictest sect of the jews religion at the very time that he was fighting against god persecuting gods people and gods son and dead in trespasses and sins  these are ugly facts my friends but they are true and well worth our laying to heart in these religious ungodly days  i am afraid if jesus christ came down into england this day as a carpenters son he would geta better hearing perhaps than the jews gave him but still a very bad hearingone dare hardly think of it  and yet i believe we ought to think of it and by gods help i will one day preach you a sermon asking you all round this fair questionif jesus christ came to you in the shape of a poor man whom nobody knew should you know him should you admire him fall at his feet and give yourself up to him body and soul  i am afraid that i for one should noti am afraid that too many of us here would not  that comes of thinking more of religion than we do of godlinessin plain words more of our own souls than we do of jesus christ  but you will want to know what is after all the difference between religion and godliness  just the difference my friends that there is between always thinking of self and always forgetting selfbetween the terror of a slave and the affection of a childbetween the fear of hell and the love of god  for tell me what you mean by being religious  do you not mean thinking a great deal about your own souls and praying and reading about your own souls and trying by all possible means to get your own souls saved  is not that the meaning of religion  and yet i have never mentioned gods name in describing it  this sort of religion must have very little to do with god  you may be surprised at my words and say in your hearts almost angrily why who saves our souls but god therefore religion must have to do with god  but my friends for your souls sake and for gods sake ask yourselves this question on your knees this dayif you could get your souls saved without gods help would it make much difference to you  suppose an angel from heaven as they say was to come down and prove to you clearly that there was no god no blessed jesus in heaven that the world made itself and went on of itself and that the bible was all a mistake but that you need not mind for your gardens and crops would grow just as well and your souls be saved just as well when you died  to how many of you would it make any difference  to some of you thank god i believe it would make a difference  here are some here i believe who would feel that news the worst news they ever heardworse than if they were told that their souls were lost for ever there are some here i do believe who at that news would cry aloud in agony like little children who had lost their father and say no father in heaven to love  no blessed jesus in heaven to work for and die for and glory and delight in  no god to rule and manage this poor miserable quarrelsome world bringing good out of evil blessing and guiding all things and people on earth what do i care what becomes of my soul if there is no god for my soul to glory in  what is heaven worth without god  god is heaven  yes indeed what would heaven be worth without god  but how many people feel that the curse of this day is that most people have forgotten that  they are selfishly anxious enough about their own souls but they have forgotten god  they are religious for fear of hell but they are not godly for they do not love god or see gods hand in every thing  they forget that they have a father in heaven that he sends rain and sunshine and fruitful seasons that he gives them all things richly to enjoy in spite of all their sins his mercies are far above out of their sight and therefore his judgments are far away out of their sight too and so they talk of the visitation of god as if it was something that was very extraordinary and happened very seldom and when it came only brought evil harm and sorrow  if a man lives on in health they say he lives by the strength of his own constitution if he drops down dead they say he died by the visitation of god  if the corncrops go on all right and safe they think that quite natural the effect of the soil and the weather and their own skill in farming and gardening  but if there comes a hailstorm or a blight and spoils it all and brings on a famine they call it at once a visitation of god  my friends do you think god visits the earth or you only to harm you  i tell you that every blade of grass grows by the visitation of god  i tell you that every healthy breath you ever drew every cheerful hour you ever spent every good crop you ever housed safely came to you by the visitation of god  i tell you that every sensible thought or plan that ever came into your headsevery loving honest manly womanly feeling that ever rose in your hearts god visited you to put it there  if gods spirit had not given it you you would never have got it of yourselves  but people forget this and therefore they have so little real love to godso little real loyal childlike trust in god  they do not think much about god because they find no pleasure in thinking about him they look on god as a taskmaster gathering where he has not strewed reaping where he has not sowna taskmaster who has put them very miserable sinful creatures to struggle on in a very miserable sinful world and though he tells them in his bible that they cannot keep his commandments expects them to keep them just the same and will at the last send them all into everlasting fire unless they take a great deal of care and give up a great many natural and pleasant things and beseech and entreat him very hard to excuse them after all  this is the thought which most people have of god even religious people they look on god as a stern tyrant who when man sinned and fell could not satisfy his own justicehis own vengeance in plain words without killing some one and who would have certainly killed all mankind if jesus christ had not interfered and said if thou must slay some one slay me though i am innocent  oh my friends does not this all sound horrible and irreverent and yet if you will but look into your own hearts will you not find some such thoughts there  i am sure you will  i believe every man finds such thoughts in his heart now and then  i find them in my own heart  i know that they must be in the hearts of others because i see them producing their natural fruits in peoples actionsa selfish slavish view of religion with little or no real love to god or real trust in him but a great deal of uneasy dread of him  for this is just the dark false view of god and of the good news of salvation and the kingdom of heaven which the devil is always trying to make men take  the evil one tries to make us forget that god is love he tries to make us forget that god gives us all things richly to enjoy he tries to make us forget that god gives at all and to make us think that we take not that he gives to make us look at god as a taskmaster not as a father in one word to make us mistake the devil for god and god for the devil  and therefore it is that we ought to bless god for such scriptures as this 104th psalm which he seems to have preserved in the bible just to contradict these dark slavish notionsjust to testify that god is a giver and knows our necessities before we ask and gives us all things even as he gave us his blessed sonfreely long before we wanted themfrom the foundation of all things before ever the earth and the world was madefrom all eternity perpetual love perpetual bounty  what does this text teach us  to look at god as him who gives to all freely and upbraideth not  it says to usdo not suppose that your crops grow of themselves  god waters the hills from above  he causes the grass to grow for the cattle and the green herb for the service of man  do not suppose that he cares nothing about seeing you comfortable and happy  it is he he only who sends all which strengthens mans body and makes glad his heart and makes him of a cheerful countenance  his will is that you should be cheerful  ah my friends if we would but believe all thiswe are too apt to say to ourselves our earthly comforts here have nothing to do with godliness or god god must save our souls but our bodies we must save ourselves  god gives us spiritual blessings but earthly blessings the good things of this life for them we must scramble and drudge ourselves and get as much of them as we can without offending godas if god grudged us our comforts as if godliness had not the promise of this life as well as the life to come  if we would but believe that god knows our necessities before we askthat he gives us daily more than we can ever get by working for itif we would but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness all other things would be added to us and we should find that he who loses his life should save it  and this way of looking at gods earth would not make us idle it would not tempt us to sit with folded hands for gods blessings to drop into our mouths  no i believe it would make men far more industrious than ever mere self interest can make them they would say god is our father he gave us his own son he gives us all things freely we owe him not slavish service but a boundless debt of cheerful gratitude therefore we must do his will and we are sure his will must be our happiness and comforttherefore we must do his will and his will is that we should work and therefore we must work  he has bidden us labour on this earthhe has bidden us dress it and keep it conquer it and fill it for him  we are his stewards here on earth and therefore it is a glory and an honour to be allowed to work here in gods own landin our loving fathers own garden  we do not know why he wishes us to labour and till the ground for he could have fed us with manna from heaven if he liked as he fed the jews of old without our working at all  but his will is that we should work and work we will not for our own sakes merely but for his sake because we know he likes it and for the sake of our brothers our countrymen for whom christ died  oh my friends why is it that so many till the ground industriously and yet grow poorer and poorer for all their drudging and working  it is their own fault  they till the ground for their own sakes and not for gods sake and for their countrymens sake and so as the prophet says they sow much and bring in little and he who earns wages earns them to put in a bag full of holes suppose you try the opposite plan  suppose you say to yourself i will work henceforward because god wishes me to work  i will work henceforward for my countrys sake because i feel that god has given me a noble and a holy calling when he set me to grow food for his children the people of england  as for my wages and my profit god will take care of them if they are just and if they are unjust he will take care of them too  he at all events makes the garden and the field grow and not i  my land is filled not with the fruit of my work but with the fruit of his work  he will see that i lose nothing by my labour  if i till the soil for god and for gods children i may trust god to pay me my wages  oh my friends he who feeds the young birds when they call upon him and far far more he who gave you his onlybegotten son will he not with him freely give you all things  for after all done he must give to you or you will not get  you may fret and stint and scrape and puzzle one man may sow and another man may water but after all who can give the increase but god  can you make a load of hay unless he has first grown it for you and then dried it for you  if you would but think a little more about him if you would believe that your crops were his gifts and in your hearts offer them up to him as thankofferings see if he would not help you to sell your crops as well as to house them  he would put you in the way of an honest profit for your labour just as surely as he only put you in the way of labouring at all  trust in the lord and be doing good dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed for without me says our lord you can do nothing  no  these are his own wordsnothing  to him all power is given in heaven and earth he knows every root and every leaf and feeds it  will he not much more feed you oh ye of little faith  do you think that he has made his world so ill that a man cannot get on in it unless he is a rogue  no  cast all your care on him and see if you do not find out ere long that he cares for you and has cared for you from all eternity    sermon iii  life and death    psalm civ 24 2830  o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all  the earth is full of thy riches  that thou givest them they gather  thou openest thine hand they are filled with good  thou hidest thy face they are troubled  thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust  thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created  and thou renewest the face of the earth  i had intended to go through this psalm with you in regular order but things have happened this parish awful and sad during the last week which i was bound not to let slip without trying to bring them home to your hearts if by any means i could persuade the thoughtless ones among you to be wise and consider your latter end i mean the sad deaths of various of our acquaintances  the death bell has been tolled in this parish three times i believe in one daya thing which has seldom happened before and which god grant may never happen again  within two miles of this church there are now five lying dead  five human beings young as well as old to whom the awful words of the text have been fulfilled  thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust  and the very day on which three of these deaths happened was ascensionday the day on which jesus the lord of life the conqueror of death ascended upon high having led captivity captive and became the firstfruits of the grave to send down from the heaven of eternal life the spirit who is the giver of life  that was a strange mixture death seemingly triumphant over christs people on the very day on which life triumphed in jesus christ himself  let us see though whether death has not something to do with ascensionday let us see whether a sermon about death is not a fit sermon for the sunday after ascensionday  let us see whether the text has not a message about life and death tooa message which may make us feel that in the midst of life we are in death and that yet in the midst of death we are in life that however things may seem yet death has not conquered life but life has conquered and will conquer death and conquer it most completely at the very moment that we die and our bodies return to their dust  do i speak riddles  i think the text will explain my riddles for it tells us how life comes how death comes  life comes from god he sends forth his spirit and things are made and he renews the face of the earth  we read in the very two verses of the book of genesis how the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters the creation and woke all things into life  therefore the creed well calls the holy ghost the spirit of god that isthe lord and giver of life  and the text tells us that he gives life not only to us who have immortal souls but to every thing on the face of the earth for the psalm has been talking all through not only of men but of beasts fishes trees and rivers and rocks sun and moon now all these things have a life in them  not a life like ours but still you speak rightly and wisely when you say that tree is alive and that tree is dead  that running water is live waterit is sweet and fresh but if it is kept standing it begins to putrefy its life is gone from it and a sort of death comes over it and makes it foul and unwholesome and unfit to drink  this is a deep matter this how there is a sort of life in every thing even to the stones under our feet  i do not mean of course that stones can think as our life makes us do or feel as the beasts life makes them do or even grow as the trees life makes them do but i mean that their life keeps them as they are without changing or decaying  you hear miners and quarrymen talk very truly of the live rock  that stone they say was cut out of the live rock meaning the rock as it is under ground sound and hardas it would be for aught we know to the end of time unless it was taken out of the ground out of the place where gods spirit meant it to be and brought up to the open air and the rain in which it is not its nature to be  and then you will see that the life of the stone begins to pass from it bit by bit that it crumbles and peels away and in short decays and is turned again to its dust  its organisation as it is called or life ends and thenwhat does the stone lie for ever useless  no  and there is the great blessed mystery of how gods spirit is always bringing life out of death when the stone is decayed and crumbled down to dust and clay it makes soilthis very soil here which you plough is the decayed ruins of ancient hills the clay which you dig up in the fields was once part of some slate or granite mountains which were worn away by weather and water that they might become fruitful earth wonderful but any one who has studied these things can tell you they are true  any one who has ever lived in mountainous countries ought to have seen the thing happen ought to know that the land in the mountain valleys is made at first and kept rich year by year by the washings from the hills above and this is the reason why land left dry by rivers and by the sea is generally so rich  then what becomes of the soil  it begins a new life  the roots of the plants take it up the salts which they find in itthe staple as we call themgo to make leaves and seed the very sand has its use it feeds the stalks of corn and grass and makes them stiff  the cornstalks would never stand upright if they could not get sand from the soil  so what a thousand years ago made part of a mountain now makes part of a wheatplant and in a year more the wheat grain will have been eaten and the wheat straw perhaps eaten too and they will have dieddecayed in the bodies of the animals who have eaten them and then they will begin a third new lifethey will be turned into parts of the animals bodyof a mans body  so that what is now your bone and flesh may have been once a rock on some hillside a hundred miles away  strange but true all learned men know that it is true  you if you think over my words may see that they are at least reasonable but still most wonderful  this world works right well surely  it obeys gods spirit  oh my friends if we fulfilled our life and our duty as well as the clay which we tread on doesif we obeyed gods spirit as surely as the flint does we should have many a heartache spared us and many a headache too  to be what god wants usto be men to be women and therefore to live as children of god members of christ fulfilling our duty in that state to which god has called us that would be our bliss and glory  nothing can live in a state in which god did not intend it to live  suppose a tree could move itself about like an animal and chose to do so the tree would wither and die it would be trying to act contrary to the law which god has given it  suppose the ox chose to eat meat like the lion it would fall sick and die for it would be acting contrary to the law which gods spirit had made for itgoing out of the calling to which gods word has called it to eat grass and not flesh and live thereby  and so with us  if we will do wickedly when the will of god as the scripture tells us is our sanctification our holiness if we will speak lies when gods law for us is that we should speak truth if we will bear hatred and illwill when gods law for us is love as brothersyou all sprang from one father adamyou were all redeemed by one brother jesus christ if we will try to live as if there was no god when gods law for us is that a man can live like a man only by faith and trust in godthen we shall die if we break gods laws according to which he intended man to live  thus it was with adam god intended him to obey god to learn every thing from god  he chose to disobey god to try and know something of himself by getting the knowledge of good and evil and so death passed on him he became an unnatural man a bad man more or less and so he became a dead man and death came into the world that time at least by sin by breaking the law by which man was meant to be a man  as the beasts will die if you give them unnatural food or in any way prevent their following the laws which god has made for them so man dies of necessity  all the world cannot help his dying because he breaks the laws which god has made for him  and how does he die  the text tells us god takes away his breath and turns his face from him  in his presence it is written is life  the moment he withdraws his spirit the spirit of life from any thing body or soul then it dies  it was by sin came deathby mans becoming unfit for the spirit of god  therefore the body is dead because of sin says st paul doomed to die carrying about in it the seeds of death from the very moment it is born  death has truly passed upon all men  most sad and yet there is hope and more than hope there is certain assurance for us that though we die yet shall we live  i have shewn you in the beginning of my sermon how nothing that dies perishes to nothing but begins a new and a higher life  how the stone becomes a plantsomething better and more useful than it was before the plant passes into an animala step higher still  and therefore we may be sure that the same rule will hold good about us men and women that when we die we shall begin a new and a nobler life that is if we have been true men if we have lived fulfilling the law of our kind  st paul tells us so positively  he says that nothing comes to life except it first die then god gives it a new body  he says that even so is the resurrection of the deadthat we gain a step by dying that we are sown in corruption and are raised in incorruption we are sown in dishonour and are raised in glory we are sown in weakness and are raised in power we are sown a natural body and are raised a spiritual body that as we now are of the earth earthy after death and the resurrection our new and nobler body will be of the heavens heavenly so that when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then death shall be swallowed up in victory  therefore i say sorrow not for those who sleep as if you had no hope for the dead for christ is risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept  for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive  and i say that this has to do with the textit has to do with ascensionday  for if we claim our share in christif we claim our share of our heavenly fathers promise to give the holy spirit to those who ask him then we may certainly hope for our share in christs resurrection our share in christs ascension  for says st paul rom viii 10 11 if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him who raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you  there is a blessed promise that in that as in every thing we shall be made like christ our master the new adam who is a lifegiving spirit that as he was brought to life again by the spirit of god so we shall be  and so will be fulfilled in us the glorious rule which the text lays down thou o god sendest forth thy spirit and they are created and thou dost renew the face of the earth fulfilledyes but far more gloriously than ever the old psalmist expected  read the revelations of st john chapters xxi and xxii for the glory of the renewed earth read the first epistle of paul to the thessalonians chap iv 1618 for the glorious resurrection and ascension of those who have died trusting in the blessed lord who died for them and then see what a glorious future lies before ussee how death is but the gate of lifesee how what holds true of every thing on this earth down to the flint beneath our feet holds true ten thousand times of men that to die and to decay is only to pass into a nobler state of life  but remember that just as we are better than the stone we may be also worse than the stone  it cannot disobey gods laws therefore it can enjoy no reward any more than suffer any punishment  we can disobeywe can fall from our callingwe can cast gods law behind uswe can refuse to do his will to work out our own salvation and just because our reward in the life to come will be so glorious if we fulfil our life and law the life of faith and the law of love therefore will our punishment be so horrible if we neglect the life of faith and trample under foot the law of love  oh my friends choose  death is before you all  shall it be the gate of everlasting life and glory or the gate of everlasting death and misery  will you claim your glorious inheritance and be for ever equal to the angels doing gods will on earth as they in heaven or will you fall lower than the stones who at all events must do their duty as stones and not do gods will at all but only suffer it in eternal woe  you must do one or the other  you cannot be like the stones without feelingwithout joy or sorrow just because you are immortal spirits every one of you  you must be either happy or miserable blessed or disgraced for ever  i know of no middle pathdo you  choose before the night comes in which no man can work  our life is but a vapour which appears for a little time then vanishes away  o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all  the earth is full of thy riches  that thou givest them they gather  thou openest thine hand they are filled with good  thou hidest thy face they are troubled  thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust  thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created  and thou renewest the face of the earth    sermon iv  the work of gods spirit    james i 16 17  do not err my beloved brethren every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights  this text i believe more and more every day is one of the most important ones in the whole bible and just at this time it is more important for us than ever because people have forgotten it more than ever  and according as you firmly believe this text according as you firmly believe that every good gift you have in body and soul comes down from above from god the father of lightsaccording i say as you believe this and live upon that belief just so far will you be able to do your duty to god and man worthily of your blessed saviours calling and redemption and of the high honour which he has given you of being free and christened men redeemed by his most precious blood and led by his most noble spirit  now just because this text is so important the devil is particularly busy in trying to make people forget it  for what is his plan  is it not to make us forget god to put god out of all our thoughts to make us acknowledge god in none of our ways to make us look at ourselves and not at god that so we may become first earthly and sensual and then devilish like satan himself therefore he tries to make us disbelieve this text  he puts into our hearts such thoughts as theseay all good gifts may come from god but that only means all spiritual gifts  all those fine deep doctrines and wonderful feelings that some very religious people talk of about conversion and regeneration and sanctification and assurance and the witness of the indwelling spiritall those gifts come from god no doubt but they are quite above us  we are straightforward simple people who cannot feel fine fancies if we can be honest and industrious and good natured and sober and strong and healthy that is enough for us and all that has nothing to do with religion  those are not gifts which come from god  a man is strong and healthy by birth and honest and goodnatured by nature  those are very good things but they are not giftsthey are not gracesthey are not spiritual blessingsthey have nothing to do with the state of a mans soul ungodly people are honest and goodtempered and industrious and healthy as well as your saints and your methodists so what is the use of praying for spiritual gifts to god when we can have all we want by nature  did such thoughts never come into your head my friends  are they not often in your heads more or less  perhaps not in these very words but something like them  i do not say it to blame you for i believe that every man each according to his station is tempted to such thoughts i believe that such thoughts are not yours or any mans i believe they are the devils who tempts all men who tempted even the son of god himself with thoughts like these at their root  such thoughts are not yours or mine though they may come into our heads  they are part of the evil which besets uswhich is not uswhich has no right or share in uswhich we pray god to drive away from us when we say deliver us from evil  have you not all had such thoughts but have you not all had very different thoughts have you not every one of you at times felt in the bottom of your hearts after all this strength and industry this courage and honesty and goodnature of mine must come from god i did not get them myself if i was born honest and strong and gentle and brave some one must have made me so when i was born or before  the devil certainly did not make me so therefore god must  these too are his gifts  did you ever think such thoughts as these  if you did not not much matter for you have all acted more or less in your better moments as if you had them  there are more things in a mans heart thank god than ever come into his head  many a man does a noble thing by instinct as we say without ever thinking whether it is a noble thing or notwithout thinking about it at all  many a man thank god is led at times by gods spirit without ever knowing whose spirit it is that leads him  but he ought to know it for it is willing reasonable service which god wants of us  he does not care to use us like tools and puppets and why  he is not merely our maker he is our father and he wishes us to know and feel that we are his childrento know and feel that we all have come from him to acknowledge him in all our ways to thank him for all to look up lovingly and confidently to him for more as his reasonable children day by day and hour by hour  every good gift we have comes from him but he will have us know where they all come from  let us go through now a few of these good gifts which we call natural and see what the bible says of them and from whom they come  first now that common gift of strength and courage  who gives you thatwho gave it david  for he that gives it to one is most likely to be he that gives it to another  david says to god thou teachest my hands to war and my fingers to fight by the help of god i can leap over a wall  he makes me strong that my arms can break even a bow of steelthat is plainspoken enough i think who gave samson his strength again  what says the bible  how samson met a young lion which roared against him and he had nothing in his hand and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and he tore the lion as he would have torn a kid  and again how when traitors had bound him with two new cords the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords which were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and fell from off his hands  and for gods sake do not give in to that miserable fancy that because these stories are what you call miraculous therefore they have nothing to do with youthat samsons strength came to him miraculously by gods spirit and yet yours comes to you a different way  the bible is written to tell you how all that happens really happenswhat all things really are god is working among us always but we do not see him and the bible just lifts up once and for all the veil which hides him from us and lets us see in one instance who it is that does all the wonderful things which go on round us to this day that when we see any thing like it happen we may know whom to thank for it  the great physician healed the blind and the lame in judea and whyto shew us who heals the blind and the lame nowto shew us that the good gift of medicine and surgery and the physicians art comes down from him who cured the paralytic and cleansed the lepers in judeato whom all power is given in heaven and earth  so again with skill in farming and agriculture  from whom does that come  the very heathens can tell us that for it is curious that among the heathen in all ages and countries those men who have found out great improvements in tilling the ground have been honoured and often worshipped as divine menas gods thereby shewing that the heathen among all their idolatries had a true and just notion about mans practical skill and knowledgethat it could only come from heaven that it was by the inspiration and guidance of god above that skill in agriculture arose  what says isaiah of that to the very same purpose  doth the ploughman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the clods of his ground  when he hath made plain the face thereof doth he not cast abroad the vetches and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rye in their place  for his god doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach him  this also says isaiah cometh from the lord of hosts who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working would to god you would all believe it  again wisdom and prudence and a clear powerful mindare not they parts of gods likeness  how is gods spirit described in scripture  it is called the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of prudence and might  therefore surely all wisdom and understanding all prudence and strength of mind are like that spirit part of gods image and where did we get gods image  can we make ourselves like god  if we are like him he must have formed that likeness and he alone  the spirit of god says the scripture giveth us understanding  or again goodnature and affection love generosity pitywhose likeness are they  what is gods name but love  god is love  has not he revealed himself as the god of mercy full of longsuffering compassion and free forgiveness and must not then all love and affection all compassion and generosity be his gift  yes  as the rays come from the sun and yet are not the sun even so our love and pity though they are not god but merely a poor weak image and reflection of him yet from him alone they come  if there is mercy in our hearts it comes from the fountain of mercy  if there is the light of love in us it is a ray from the full sun of his love  or honesty again and justicewhose image are they but gods  is he not the just onethe righteous god  is not what is just for man just for god  are not the laws of justice and honesty by which man deals fairly with man his lawsthe laws by which god deals with us  does not every booki had almost said every pagein the bible shew us that all our justice is but the pattern and copy of gods justicethe working out of those six latter commandments of his which are summed up in that one command thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  now here again i ask  if justice and honesty be gods likeness who made us like god in thiswho put into us this sense of justice which all have though so few obey it  can man make himself like god  can a worm ape his maker  no  from gods spirit the spirit of right came this inborn feeling of justice this knowledge of right and wrong to uspart of the image of god in which he created manpart of the breath or spirit of life which he breathed into adam  do not mistake me  i do not say that the sense and honesty and love in us are gods spiritthey are the spirit of man but that they are like gods spirit and therefore they must be given us by gods spirit to be used as gods spirit himself uses them  how a man shall have his share of gods spirit and live in and by gods spirit is another question and a higher and more blessed one but we must master this question firstwe must believe that our spirits come from god then perhaps we shall begin to see that our spirits never can work well unless they are joined to the spirit of god from whom they came  from whom else i ask again can they come can they come from our bodies  our bodies  what are theyflesh and bones made up of air and water and earthout of the dead bodies of the animals the dead roots and fruits of plants which we eat  they are earthmatter  can matter be courageous  did you ever hear of a goodnatured plant or an honest stone  then this goodnature and honesty and courage of ours must belong to our soulsour spirits  who put them there  did we  does a child make its own character  does its body make its character first  can its father and mother make its character  no  our characters must come from some spirit above useither from god or from the devil  and is the devil likely to make us honest or brave or kindly  i leave you to answer that  godgod alone my friends is the author of goodthe help that is done on earth he doeth it all himself every good gift and every perfect gift cometh from him  now some of you may think this a strange sort of sermon because i have said little or nothing about jesus christ and his redemption in it but i sayno  you must believe this much about yourselves before you can believe more  you must fairly and really believe that god made you one thing before you can believe that you have made yourselves another thing  you must really believe that you are not mere machines and animals but immortal souls before you can really believe that you have sinned for animals cannot sinonly reasonable souls can sin we must really believe that god made us at bottom in his likeness before we can begin to find out that there is another likeness in us besides godsa selfish brutish too often a devilish likeness which must be repented of and fought against and cast out that gods likeness in us may get the upper hand and we may be what god expects us to be  we must know our dignity before we can feel our shame  we must see how high we have a right to stand that we may see how low alas we have fallen  now youi know many such here thank godto whom god has given clear powerful heads for business and honest kindly hearts i do beseech youconsider my words who has given you these but god they are talents which he has committed to your charge and will he not require an account of them  he only and his free mercy has made you to differ from others if you are better than the fools and profligates round you he and not yourselves has made you better what have you that you have not received  by the grace of god alone you are what you are  if good comes easier to you than to others he alone has made it easier to you and if you have done wrongif you have fallen short of your duty as all fall short is not your sin greater than others for unto whom much is given of them shall much be required  consider that for gods sake and see if you too have not something to be ashamed of between yourselves and god  see if you too have not need of jesus christ and his precious blood and gods free forgiveness who have had so much light and power given you and still have fallen short of what you might have been and what by gods grace you still may be and as i hope and earnestly pray still will be  and you young men and womenconsiderif god has given you manly courage and high spirits and strength and beautythinkgod your father has given them to you and of them he will surely require an account therefore rejoice young people says solomon in your youth and let your hearts cheer you in the days of your youth and walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes  but remember continues the wisest of menremember that for all these things god shall bring you into judgment  now do not misunderstand that  it does not mean that there is a sin in being happy  it does not mean that if god has given to a young man a bold spirit and powerful limbs or to a young woman a handsome face and a merry loving heart that he will punish them for thesegod forbid what he gives he means to be used  but this it means that according as you use those blessings so will you be judged at the last day that for them too you will be brought to judgment and tried at the bar of god  as you have used them for industry and innocent happiness and holy married love or for riot and quarrelling and idleness and vanity and filthy lusts so shall you be judged  and if any of you have sinned in any of these ways god forbid that you should have sinned in all these ways but surely surely some of you have been idlesome of you have been riotoussome of you have been vainsome of you have been quarrelsomesome of you alas have been that which i shall not name herethink if you have sinned in any one of these ways how can you answer it to god  have you no need of forgiveness  have you no need of the blessed saviours blood to wash you clean  young people  god has given you much  as a young man i speak to you youth is an inestimable blessing or an inestimable curse according as you use it and if you have abused your springtime of youth as all i am afraid haveas i haveas almost all do alas in this fallen world where can you get forgiveness but from him that died on the cross to take away the sins of the world    sermon v  faith    habakkuk ii 4  the just shall live by faith  this is those texts of which there are so many in the bible which though they were spoken originally to one particular man yet are meant for every man  these words were spoken to habakkuk a jewish prophet to check him for his impatience under gods hand but they are just as true for every man that ever was and ever will be as they were for him  they are worldwide and worldold they are the law by which all goodness and strength and safety stand either in men or angels for it always was true and always must be true that if reasonable beings are to live at all it is by faith  and why  because every thing that is heaven and earth men and angels are all the work of godof one god infinite almighty allwise allloving unutterably glorious  my friends we do not think enough of thisnot that all the thinking in the world can ever make us comprehend the majesty of our heavenly father but we do not remember enough what we do know of god  we think of god watching the world and all things in it and keeping them in order as a shepherd does his sheep and so far so good but we forget that god does more than thiswe forget that this earth sun and moon and all the thousand thousand stars which cover the midnight sky many of them suns larger than the sun we see and worlds larger than the world on which we stand that all these stretching away millions of millions of miles into boundless spaceall are lying like one little grain of dust in the hollow of gods hand and that if he were to shut his hand upon them he could crush them into nothing and god would be alone in the universe again as he was before heaven and earth were made  think of thatthat if god was but to will it we and this earth on which we stand and the heaven above us and the sun that shines on us should vanish away and be nowhere and nothing  think of the infinite power of god and then think how is it possible to live except by faith in him by trusting to him utterly  if you accustom yourselves to think in the same way of the infinite wisdom of god and the infinite love of god they will both teach you the same lesson they will shew you that if you were the greatest the wisest the holiest man that ever lived you would still be such a speck by the side of the almighty and everlasting god that it would be madness to depend upon yourselves for any thing while you lived in gods world  for after all what can we do without god  in him we live and move and have our being  he made us he gave us our bodies gave us our life what we do he lets us do what we say he lets us say we all live on sufferance  what is it but gods infinite mercy that ever brought us here or keeps us here an instant  we may pretend to act without gods leave or help but it is impossible for us to do so the strength we put forth the wit we use are all his gifts  we cannot draw a breath of air without his leave  and yet men fancy they can do without god in the world  my friends these are but few words and poor words about the glorious majesty of god and our littleness when compared with him but i have said quite enough at least to shew you all how absurd it is to depend upon ourselves for any thing  if we are mere creatures of god if god alone has every blessing both of this world and the next and the will to give them away whom are we to go to but to him for all we want  it is so in the life of our bodies and it is so in the life of our spirits  if we wish for gods blessings from god we must ask them  that is our duty even though god in his mercy and longsuffering does pour down many a blessing upon men who never trust in him for them  to us all indeed god gives blessings before we are old enough to trust in him for them and to many he continues those blessings in afterlife in spite of their blindness and want of faith  he maketh his sun to shine on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust  he givesgivesit is his glory to give  yet strange that men will go on year after year using the limbs and eating the food which god gives them without ever believing so much as that god has given them without so much as looking up to heaven once and saying god i thank thee  but we must remember that those blessings will not last for ever  unless a man has lived by faith in god with regard to his earthly comforts death will come and put an end to them at once and then it is only those who have trusted in god for all good things and thanked him accordingly in this life who shall have their part in the new heavens and the new earth which will so immeasurably surpass all that this earth can give  and it is the same with the life of our spirits in it too we must live by faith  the life of our spirits is a gift from god the father of spirits and he has chosen to declare that unless we trust to him for life and ask him for life he will not bestow it upon us  the life of our bodies he in his mercy keeps up although we forget him the life of our souls he will not keep up  therefore for the sake of our spirits even more than of our bodies we must live by faith  if we wish to be loving pure wise manly noble we must ask those excellent gifts of god who is himself infinite love and purity wisdom and nobleness  if we wish for everlasting life from whom can we obtain it but from god who is the boundless eternal life itself  if we wish for forgiveness for our faults and failings where are we to get it but from god who is boundless love and pity and who has revealed to us his boundless love and pity in the form of a man jesus christ the saviour of the world  and to go a step further it is by faith in christ we must livein christ a man like ourselves yet god blessed for ever  for it is a certain truth that men cannot believe in god or trust in him unless they can think of him as a man  this was the reason why the poor heathen made themselves idols in the form of men that they might have something like themselves to worship and those among them who would not worship idols almost always ended in fancying that god was either a mere notion or else a mere part of this world or else that he sat up in heaven neither knowing nor caring what happened upon earth  but we to whom god has given the glorious news of his gospel have the very person to worship whom all the heathen were searching after and could not findone who is very god infinite in love wisdom and strength and yet very man made in all points like ourselves but without sin so that we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but one who is able to help those who are tempted because he was tempted himself like us and overcame by the strength of his own perfect will of his own perfect faith  by trusting in him and acknowledging him in every thought and action of our lives we shall be safe for it is written the just shall live by faith  these things are true and always were true  all that men ever did well or nobly or lovingly in this world was done by faithby faith in god of some sort or other even in the man who thinks least about religion it is so  every time a man means to do and really does a just or generous action he does it because he believes more or less clearly that there is a just and loving god above him and that justice and love are the right thing for a manthe law by which god intended him to walk  so that this small dim faith still shews itself in practice and the more faith a man has in god and in gods laws the more it will shew itself in every action of his daily life and the more this faith works in his life and conduct the better man he isthe more he is like gods image in which man was originally madeand the more he is like christ the new pattern of gods image whom all men must copy  so that the sum of the matter is this without christ we can do nothing by trusting in christ we can do every thing  see then how true the verse before my text must be that he whose soul is lifted up in him is not upright for if a man fancies that his body and soul are his own to do what he pleases with them when all the time they are gods giftif a man fancies that he can take perfect care of himself while all the time it is god that is keeping him out of a thousand sins and dangersif a man fancies that he can do right of himself when all the time the little good that he does is the work of gods spirit which has not yet left himif a man fancies in short that he can do without god when all the time it is in god that he lives and moves and has his being how can such a man be called upright  upright he is utterly wronghe is believing a lie and walking accordingly and therefore instead of keeping upright he is going where all lies lead into all kinds of low and crooked ways mistakes absurdities and at last to ruin of body and soul  nothing but truth can keep a man upright and straight can keep a man where god has put him and where he ought to be and the man whose heart is puffed up by pride and self conceit who is looking at himself and not at god that man has begun upon a falsehood and will soon get out of tune with heaven and earth  for consider my friends  suppose some rich and mighty prince went out and collected a number of children and of sick and infirm people and said to them you cannot work now but i will give you food medicine every thing that you require and then you must help me to work and i though you have no right to expect it of me will pay you for the little work you can do on the strength of my food and medicineis it not plain that all those persons could only live by faith in their prince by trusting in him for food and medicine and by acknowledging that that food and medicine came from him and thanking him accordingly  if they wished to be true men if they wished him to continue his bounty they would confess that all the health and strength they had belonged to him of right because his generosity had given it to them  just in this position we stand with christ the lord  when the whole world lay in wickedness he came and chose us of his free grace and mercy to be one of his peculiar nations to work for him and with him and from the time he came all that we and our forefathers have done well has been done by the strength and wisdom which christ has given us  now suppose again that one of the persons of whom i spoke was seized with a fit of pridesuppose he said to himself my health and strength does not come from the food and medicine which the prince gave me it comes from the goodness of my own constitution the wages which i am paid are my just due i am a free man and may choose what master i like  suppose any one of your servants treated you so would you not be inclined to answer you are a faithless ungrateful fellow go your ways then and see how little you can do without my bounty  but the blessed king in heaven though he is provoked every day is more longsuffering than man all he does is to withdraw his bounty for a moment to take this worlds blessings from a man and let him find out how impossible it is for him to keep himself out of afflictionto take away his holy spirit for a moment from a man and let him see how straight he rushes astray and every way but the right and then if the man is humbled by his fall or his affliction and comes back to his lord confessing how weak he is and promising to trust in christ and thank christ only for the future then our lord will restore his blessings to him and there will be joy among the angels of god over one sinner that repents  this was the way in which god treated job when in spite of all his excellence his heart was lifted up  and then when he saw his own folly and abhorred himself and repented in dust and ashes god restored to him sevenfold what he had taken from himhonour wisdom riches home and children  this is the way too in which god treated david  in my prosperity he tells us i said i shall never be moved thou lord of thy goodness hast made my hill so strongforgetting that he must be kept safe every moment of his life as well as made safe once for all  thou didst turn thy face from me and i was troubled  then cried i unto thee o lord and gat me to my lord right humbly  and then he adds god turned my heaviness into joy and girded me with gladness psalm xxx  and again he says before i was troubled i went wrong but now i have kept thy word psalm cxix  and this is the way in which christ the lord treated st peter and st paul and treats in his great mercy every christian man when he sees him puffed up to bring him to his senses and make him live by faith in god  if he takes the warning well if he does not he remains in a lie and must go where all lies lead  so perfectly does it hold throughout a mans whole life that he whose soul is lifted up within him is not upright but that the just must live by faith  now there is one objection apt to rise in mens minds when they hear such words as these which is that they take such a low view of human nature it is so galling to our pride to be told that we can do nothing for ourselves  but if we think of the matter more closely and above all if we try to put it into practice and live by faith we shall find that there is no real reason for thus objecting  this is not a doctrine which ought to make us despise men any doctrine that does does not come of god  men are not contemptible creaturesthey are glorious creaturesthey were created in the image of god god has put such honour upon them that he has given them dominion over the whole earth and made them partakers of his eternal reason and his spirit gives them understanding to enable them to conquer this earth and make the beasts ay and the very winds and seas and fire and steam their obedient servants and human nature too when it is what god made it and what it ought to be is not a contemptible thing  it was noble enough for the son of god to take it upon himselfto become man without sinning or defiling himself and what was good enough for him is surely good enough for us  wickedness consists in unmanliness in being unlike a man in becoming like an evil spirit or a beast  holiness consists in becoming a true man in becoming more and more like the likeness of jesus christ  and when the bible tells us that we can do nothing of ourselves but can live only by faith the bible puts the highest honour upon us which any created thing can have  what are the things which cannot live by faith the trees and plants the beasts and birds which though they live and grow by gods providence yet do not know it do not thank him cannot ask him for more strength and life as we can are mere dead tools in gods hands instead of living reasonable beings as we are  it is only reasonable beings like men and angels with immortal spirits in them who can live by faith and it is the greatest glory and honour to us i say again that we can do so that the glorious infinite god maker of heaven and earth should condescend to ask us to be loyal to him to love him should encourage us to pray to him boldly and then should condescend to hear our prayerswe who in comparison of him are smaller than the gnats in the sunbeam in comparison of men  and then when we remember that he has sent his only son into the world to take our nature upon him and join us all together into one great and everlasting family the body of christ the lord and that he has actually given us a share in his own almighty holy spirit that we may be able to love him and to serve him and to be joined to him the almighty father do we not see that all this is infinitely more honourable to us than if we were each to go on his own way here without godwithout knowing anything of the everlasting world of spirits to which we now belong  my friends instead of being ashamed of being able to do nothing for ourselves we ought to rejoice at having god for our father and our friend to enable us to do all things through him who strengthens usto do whatever is noble and loving and worthy of true men  instead then of dreaming conceitedly that god will accept us for our own sakes let us just be content to be accepted for the sake of jesus christ our king  instead of trying to walk through this world without gods help let us ask god to help and guide us in every action of our lives and then go manfully forward doing with all our might whatsoever our hands or our hearts see right to do trusting to god to put us in the right path and to fill our heads with right thoughts and our hearts with right feeling and so our faith will shew itself in our works and we shall be justified at the last day as all good men have ever been by trusting to our heavenly father and to the lord jesus christ and the guidance of his holy spirit    sermon vi  the spirit and the flesh    galatians v 16  i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh  for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other  the more we think seriously my friends the more we shall see what wonderful and awful things words are how they mean much more than we fancyhow we do not make words but words are given to us by one higher than ourselves  wise men say that you can tell the character of any nation by its language by watching the words they use the names they give to things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks and by our words our lord tells us we shall be justified and condemned  it is god and christ the word of god who gives words to men who puts it into the hearts of men to call certain things by certain names and according to a nations godliness and wisdom and purity of heart will be its power of using words discreetly and reverently  that miracle of the gift of tongues of which we read in the new testament would have been still most precious and full of meaning if it had had no other use than thisto teach men from whom words come  when men found themselves all of a sudden inspired to talk in foreign languages which they had never learnt to utter words of which they themselves did not know the meaning do you not see how it must have made them feel that all language is gods making and gods giving  do you not see how it must have made them feel what awful mysterious things words were like those cloven tongues of fire which fell on the apostles  the tongues of fire signified the difficult foreign languages which they suddenly began to speak as the spirit gave them utterance  and where did the tongues of fire come from  not out of themselves not out of the earth beneath but down from the heaven above to signify that it is not from man from mans flesh or brain or the earthly part of him that words are bred but that they come down from christ the word of god and are breathed into the minds of men by the spirit of god why do i speak of all this  to make you feel what awful wonderful things words are how when you want to understand the meaning of a word you must set to work with reverence and godly fearnot in selfconceit and prejudice taking the word to mean just what suits your own notions of things but trying humbly to find out what the word really does mean of itself what god meant it to mean when he put it into the hearts of wise men to use that word and bring it into our english language  a man ought to read a newspaper or a storybook in that spirit how much more when he takes up the bible  how reverently he ought to examine every word in the new testamentthis very text for instance  we ought to be sure that st paul just because he was an inspired apostle used the very best possible words to express what he meant on so important a matter and what are the best words  the clearest and the simplest words are the best words else how is the bible to be the poor mans book  how unless the wayfaring man though simple shall not err therein  therefore we may be sure the words in scripture are certain to be used in their simplest most natural most everyday meaning such as the simplest man can understand  and therefore we may be sure that these two words flesh and spirit in my text are used in their very simplest straightforward sense and that st paul meant by them what workingmen mean by them in the affairs of daily life  no doubt st peter says that there are many things in st pauls writings difficult to be understood which those who are unlearned and unstable wrest to their own destruction and most true it is so they do daily  but what does wresting a thing mean  it means twisting it bending it turning it out of its original straightforward natural meaning into some new crooked meaning of their own  this is the way we are all of us too apt i am afraid to come to st pauls epistles  we find him difficult because we wont take him at his word because we tear a text out of its right place in the chapterthe place where st paul put it and make it stand by itself instead of letting the rest of the chapter explain its meaning  and then again people use the words in the text as unfairly and unreasonably as they use the text itself they wont let the words have their commonsense english meaningthey must stick a new meaning on them of their own  oh they say that text must not be taken literally that word has a spiritual signification here  flesh does not mean flesh it means mens corrupt nature little thinking all the while that perhaps they understand those words spiritual and corrupt and nature just as ill as they do the rest of the text  how much better my friends to let the bible tell its own story not to be so exceeding wise above what is written just to believe that st paul knew better how to use words than we are likely to dojust to believe that when he says flesh he means flesh everybody agrees that when he says spirit he means spirit why in the name of common sense when he says flesh should he not mean flesh  for my own part i believe that when st paul talks of mans flesh he means by it mans body mans heart and brain and all his bodily appetites and powerswhat we call a mans constitution in a word the animal part of man just what a man has in common with the beasts who perish  to understand what i mean consider any animala dog for instance how much every animal has in it what men havea body and brain and heart it hungers and thirsts as we do it can feel pleasure and pain anger and loneliness and fear and madness it likes freedom company and exercise praise and petting play and ease it uses a great deal of cunning and thought and courage to get itself food and shelter just as human beings do  in short it has a fleshly nature just as we have and yet after all it is but an animal and so in one sense we are all animals only more delicately made than the other animals but we are something more we have a spirit as well as a flesh an immortal soul  if any one asks what is a man the true answer is an animal with an immortal spirit in it and this spirit can feel more than pleasure and pain which are mere carnal that is fleshly things it can feel trust and hope and peace and love and purity and nobleness and independence and above all it can feel right and wrong  there is the infinite difference between an animal and a man between our flesh and our spirit an animal has no sense of right and wrong a dog who has done wrong is often terrified but not because he feels it wrong and wicked but because he knows from experience that he will be punished for doing it  just so with a mans fleshly naturea carnal fleshly man a man whose spirit is dead within him whose spiritual sense of right and wrong and honour and purity is gone when he has done a wrong thing is often enough afraid but why  not for any spiritual reason not because he feels it a wicked and abominable thing a sin but because he is afraid of being punished for it because he is afraid that his body his flesh will be punished by the laws of the land or by public opinion or because he has some dim belief that this same body and flesh of his will be burnt in hellfire and fire he knows by experience is a painful thingand so he is afraid of it there is nothing spiritual in all thatthat is all fleshly carnal the heathens in all ages have been afraid of hellfire but a mans spirit on the other hand if it be in hell is in a very different hell from mere firea spiritual hell such as torments the evil spirits at this very moment although they are going to and fro on this very earth  this earth is hell to them they carry about hell in themthey are their own hell  everlasting shame discontent doubt despair rage disgust at themselves feeling that they are out of favour with god out of tune with heaven and earth loving nothing believing nothing ever hating hating each other hating themselves most of allthere is their hell  there is the hell in which the soul of every wicked man isay is now while he is in this life though he will only awake to the perfect misery of it after death when his body and fleshly nature have mouldered away in the grave and can no longer pamper and stupify him and make him forget his own misery  ay there has been many a man in this life who had every fleshly enjoyment which this world can give riches and pleasure banquets and palaces every sense and every appetite pamperedhis pride and his vanity flattered who never knew what want or trouble or contradiction was on the smallest point a man i say who had every carnal enjoyment which this earth can give to a mans selfish flesh and yet whose spirit was in hell all the while and who knew it hating and despising himself for a mean selfish villain while all the world round was bowing down to him and envying him as the luckiest of men  i am trying to make you understand the infinite difference between a mans flesh and his spirit how a mans flesh can take no pleasure in spiritual things while mans spirit of itself can take no pleasure in fleshly things now the spirit and the flesh body and soul in every man are at war with each otherthey have quarrelled that is the corruption of our nature the fruit of adams fall  and as the article says and as every man who has ever tried to live godly well knows from experience that infection of nature does remain to the last even in those who are regenerate  so that as st paul says the spirit lusteth against the flesh and the flesh against the spirit and it continually happens that a man cannot do the things which he would he cannot do what he knows to be right thus as st paul says again a man may delight in the law of god in his inward man that is in his spirit and yet all the while he shall find another law in his members ie in his body in his flesh in his brain which thinks and his heart which feels and his senses which are fond of pleasure and this law of the flesh these appetites and passions which he has like other animals fight against the law of his mind and when he wishes to do good make him do evil  now how is this the flesh is not evil a mans body can be no more wicked than a dumb beast can be wicked  st paul calls mans flesh sinful flesh not because our flesh can sin of itself but because our sinful souls make our flesh do sinful things for he says christ came in the likeness of sinful flesh and yet in him was no sin  the pure and spotless saviour could not have taken mans flesh upon him if there was any sinfulness in it  the body knows nothing of right and wrong it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be says st paul  and why  because gods law is spiritual deals with right and wrong  wickedness like righteousness is a spiritual thing  if a man sins his body is not in fault it is his spirit his weak perverse will which will sooner listen to what his flesh tells him is pleasant than to what god tells him is right for this my friends is the secret of the battle of life  we stand between heaven and earth  above is gods spirit striving with our spirits speaking to them in the depths of our soul shewing us what is right putting into our hearts good desires making us long to be honest and just pure and manful loving and charitable for who is there who has not at times longed after these things and felt that it would be a blessed thing for him if he were such a man as jesus christ was and isabove us i say is gods spirit speaking to our spirits below us is this world speaking to our flesh as it spoke to eves saying to us this thing is pleasant to the eyesthis thing is good for foodthat thing is to be desired to make you wise and to flatter your vanity and selfconceit  below us i say is this world tempting us to ease and pleasure and vanity and in the middle betwixt the two stands up the third part of man his soul and will set to choose between the voice of gods spirit and the temptations of this worldto choose between what is right and what is pleasantto choose whether he will obey the desires of the spirit or obey the desires of the flesh  he must choose  if he lets his flesh conquer his spirit he falls if he lets his spirit conquer his flesh he rises if he lets his flesh conquer his spirit he becomes what he was not meant to bea slave to fleshly lust and then he will find his flesh set up for itself and work for itself  and where mans flesh gets the upper hand and takes possession of him it can do nothing but evilnot that it is evil in itself but that it has no rule no law to go by it does not know right from wrong and therefore it does simply what it likes as a dumb beast or an idiot might and therefore the works of the flesh areadulteries drunkenness murders fornications envyings backbitings strife  when a mans body which god intended to be the servant of his spirit has become the tyrant of his spirit it is like an idiot on a kings throne doing all manner of harm and folly without knowing that it is harm and folly  that is not its fault  whose fault is it then  our faultthe fault of our wills and our souls  our souls were intended to be the masters of our flesh to conquer all the weaknesses defilements of our constitutionour tempers our cowardice our laziness our hastiness our nervousness our vanity our love of pleasureto listen to our spirits because our spirits learn from gods spirit what is right and noble  but if we let our flesh master us and obey its own blind lusts we sin against god and we sin against god doubly for we not only sin against gods commandments but we sin against ourselves who are the image and glory of god  believe this my friends believe that because you are all fallen human creatures there must go on in you this sore lifelong battle between your spirit and your fleshyour spirit trying to be master and guide as it ought to be and your flesh rebelling and trying to conquer your spirit and make you a mere animal like a fox in cunning a peacock in vanity or a hog in greedy sloth  but believe too that it is your sin and your shame if your spirit does not conquer your fleshfor god has promised to help your spirits ask him and his spirit will teach themfill them with pure noble hopes with calm clear thoughts and with deep unselfish love to god and man  he will strengthen your wills that they may be able to refuse the evil and choose the good  ask him and he will join them to his own spiritto the spirit of christ your master for he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit with him  ask him and he will give you the mind of christteach you to see and feel all matters as christ sees and feels them  ask him and he will give you wisdom to listen to his spirit when it teaches your spirit and then you will be able to walk after the spirit and not obey the lusts of the flesh and you will be able to crucify the flesh with its passions and lusts that is to make it what it ought to be a dead thinga dead tool for your spirit to work with manfully and godly and not a live tyrant to lead you into brutishness and folly and then you will find that the fruit of the spirit of your spirit led by gods spirit is really as st paul says love joy peace longsuffering gentleness honestywhatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honourable and of good report and instead of being the miserable slaves of your own passions and of the opinions of your neighbours you will find that where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty true freedom not only from your neighbours sins but what is far better freedom from your own  these are large words my friends and promise mighty things  but i dare speak them to you for god has spoken to you  these promises god made you at your baptism these promises i on the warrant of your baptism dare make to you again  at your baptism god gave you the right to call him your loving father to call his son your saviour his spirit your sanctifier  and he is not a man that he should lie nor the son of man that he should repent  try him and see whether he will not fulfil his word  claim his promise and though you have fallen lower than the brutes he will make men and women of you  he will be faithful and just to forgive you your sins and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness    sermon vii  retribution    numbers xxxii 23  be sure your sin will find you out  the full meaning of this text is that every sin which a man commits is certain sooner or later to come home to him with fearful interest  moses gave this warning to two tribes of the israelitesto the reubenites and gadites who had promised to go over jordan and help their countrymen in war against the heathen on condition of being allowed to return and settle on the east bank of jordan where they then were but if they broke their promise and returned before the end of the war they were to be certain that their sin would find them out that god would avenge their falsehood on them in some way in their lifetime  in their lifetime i say for there is no mention made in this chapter or in any part of the story of heaven or hell or any world to come  and the text has been always taken as a fair warning to all generations of men that their sin also even in their lifetimes will be visited upon them  now it is strange at first sight that these texts which warn men that their sins will be punished in this life are just the most unpleasant texts in the whole bible that men shrink from them more and shut their eyes to them more than they do to those texts which threaten them with hellfire and everlasting death  strangethat men should be more afraid of being punished in this life for a few years than in the life to come for ever and everand yet not strange if we consider for to worldly and sinful souls that life after death and the flames of hell seem quite distant and dim things of which they know little and believe less while this world they do know they are quite certain that its good things are pleasant and its bad things unpleasant and they are thoroughly afraid of losing them  their hearts are where their treasure is in this world and a punishment which deprives them of this worlds good things hits them home  but their treasure is not in heaven and therefore about losing heaven they are by no means so much concerned  and thus they can face the dreadful news that the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the people that forget god while as for the news that the wicked shall be recompensed on the earth that their sins will surely find them out in this life they cannot face thatthey shut their ears to itthey try to persuade themselves that sin will pay them here at all events and as for hereafter they shall get off somehowthey neither know nor care much how  yet gods truth remains and gods truth must be heard and those who love this world so well must be told whether they like or not that every sin which they commit every mean every selfish every foul deed loses them so much enjoyment in this very present world of which they are so mighty fond  that is gods truth and i will prove it true from common sense from holy scripture and from the witness of mens own hearts  take common sense  does not common sense tell us that if god made this world and governs it by righteous and godlike laws this must be a world in which evildoing cannot thrive  god made the world better than that surely  he would be a bad lawgiver who made such laws that it was as well to break them as to keep them  you would call them bad laws surely  no god made the world and not the devil and the world works by gods laws and not the devils and it inclines towards good and not towards evil and he who sins even in the least breaks gods laws acts contrary to the rule and constitution of the world and will surely find that gods laws will go on in spite of him and grind him to powder if he by sinning gets in the way of them  god has no need to go out of his way to punish our evil deeds  let them alone and they will punish themselves  is it not so in every thing  if a tradesman trades badly or a farmer farms badly there is no need of lawyers to punish him he will punish himself  every mistake he makes will take money out of his pocket every time he offends against the established rules of trade or agriculture which are gods laws he injures himself and so be sure it is in the world at largein the world in which men and the souls of men live and move and have their being  next to speak of scripture  i might quote texts innumerable to prove that what i say scripture says also  consider but this one thingthat there is a whole book in the bible written to prove this one thingthat our good and bad deeds are repaid us with interest in this lifethe proverbs of solomon i meanin which there is little or no mention of heaven or hell or any world to come  it is all one noble and awful and yet cheering sermon on that one text the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth much more the wicked and the sinnerput in a thousand different lights brought home to us a thousand different roads comes the same everlasting doomvain man who thinkest that thou canst live in gods world and yet despise his will know that in every smiling comfortable sin thou art hatching an adder to sting thee in the days of old age to poison thy cup of sinful joy even when it is at thy lips to haunt thy restless thoughts and dog thee day and night to rise up before thee in the silent sleepless hours of night like an angry ghost  an awful foretaste of the doom that is to come and yet a merciful foretaste if thou wilt be but taught by the disappointment the unsatisfied craving the gnawing shame of a guilty conscience to see the heinousness of sin and would turn before it be too late  what my friendswhat will you make of such texts as this that he who soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption  do you not see that comes true far too often  can it help always coming true seeing that gods apostle spoke it  what will you make of this too that the wicked is snared by the working of his own handsthat evilthe evil which we do of its own selfshall slay the wicked  what says the whole noble 37th psalm of david but that same awful truth of god that sin is its own punishment  why should i go on quoting texts  look for yourselves you who fancy that it is only on the other side of the grave that god will trouble himself about you and your meanness your profligacy your falsehood  look for yourselves in the book of god and see if there be any writer therelawgiver prophet psalmist apostle up to christ the lord himselfwho does not warn men again and again that here on earth their sins will find them out  our saviour indeed when on earth said less about this subject than any of the prophets before him or the apostles after him and for the best of reasons  the jews had got rooted in their minds a superstitious notion that all disease all sorrow was the punishment in each case of some particular sin and thus instead of looking with pity and loving awe upon the sick and the afflicted they were accustomed too often to turn from them as sinners smitten of god bearing in their distress the token of his anger  the blessed one he who came to heal the sick and save the lostreproved that error more than once  when the disciples fancied a certain poor mans blindness to be a judgment from god neither did he sin said the lord nor his parents but that the glory of god might be made manifest in him  and yet on the other hand when he healed a certain man of an old infirmity at the pool of bethesda what were his words to him  go thy way sin no more lest a worse thing come unto theea clear and weighty warning that all his long misery of eightandthirty years had been the punishment of some sin of his and that the sin repeated would bring on him a still severer judgment  what again does the apostle mean in the epistle to the hebrews when he tells us how god scourges every son whom he receives and talks of his chastisements whereof all are partakers  why do we need chastising if we have nothing which needs mending  and though the innocent may sometimes be afflicted to make them strong as well as innocent and the holy chastened to make them humble as well as holy yet if the good cannot escape their share of affliction how will the bad get off  if the righteous scarcely be saved where will the ungodly and the sinner appear  but what use in arguing when you know that my words are true  you know that your sins will find you out  look boldly and honestly into your own hearts  look through the history of your past lives and confess to god at least that the far greater number of your sorrows have been your own fault that there is hardly a days misery which you ever endured in your life of which you might not say if i had listened to the voice of god in my conscienceif i had earnestly considered what my duty wasif i had prayed to god to determine my judgment right i should have been spared this sorrow now  am i not right those who know most of god and their own souls will agree most with me those who know little about god and their own souls will agree but hardly with me for they provoke gods chastisements and writhe under them for the time and then go and do the same wrong again as the wild beast will turn and bite the stone thrown at him without having the sense to see why it was thrown  think again of your past lives and answer in gods sight how many wrong things have you ever done which have succeeded that is how many sins which you would not be right glad were undone if you could but put back the wheels of time  they may have succeeded outwardly meanness will succeed soliesoppressiontheft adulterydrunkennessgodlessnessthey are all pleasant enough while they last i suppose and a man may reap what he calls substantial benefits from them in money and suchlike and keep that safe enough but has his sin succeeded  has it not found him out found him out never to lose him again  is he the happier for it does he feel freer for it  does he respect himself the more for itno  and even though he may prosper now yet does there not run though all his selfish pleasure a certain fearful looking forward to a fiery judgment to which he would gladly shut his eyes but cannot  cunning fairspoken oppressor of the poor has not thy sin found thee out  then be sure it will  in the shame of thine own heart it will find thee

out  then be sure it will hereafter when thou hast become disgusted at thyself and thine own infamyand youth and health and friends are gone and a shameful and despised old age creeps over thee and death stalks nearer and nearer and god vanishes further and further off then thy sin will find thee out  foolish improvident young man who art wasting the noble strength of youth and manly spirits which god has given thee on sin and folly throwing away thine honest earnings in cards and drunkenness instead of laying them by against a time of needhas not thy sin found thee out  then be sure it will some day when thou hast to bring home thy bride to a cheerless unfurnished house and there to live from hand to mouthwithout money to provide for her sicknesswithout money to give her the means

you as you sigh in vain in your comfortless home in your impoverished old age for the money which you wasted in your youth  my friends my friends for your own sakes consider and mend ere that day come as else it surely will  and lastly you who without running into any especial sins as those which the world calls sins still live careless about religion without loyalty to christ the lord without any honest attempt or even wish to serve the god above you or to rejoice in remembering that you are his children working for him and under himbe sure your sin will find you out  when affliction or sickness or disappointment come as come they will if god has not cast you offwhen the dark day dawns and your fools paradise of worldly prosperity is cut away from under your feet then you will find out your follyyou will find that you have insulted the only friend who can bring you out of afflictioncast off the only comfort which can strengthen you to bear afflictionforgotten the only knowledge which will enable you to be the wiser for affliction then i say the sin of your godlessness will find you out if you do not intend to fall soured and sickened merely by gods chastisements either into stupid despair or peevish discontent you will have to go back to go back to god and cry father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son  go back at once before it be too late  find out your sins and mend thembefore they find you out and break your hearts    sermon viii  selfdestruction    1 kings xxii 23  the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets  the chapter from which my text is taken which is the first lesson for this evenings service is a very awful chapter for it gives us an insight into the meaning of that most awful and terrible word temptation  and yet it is a most comforting chapter for it shews us how god is longsuffering and merciful even to the most hardened sinner how to the last he puts before him good and evil to choose between them and warns him to the last of his path and the ruin to which it leads  we read of ahab in the first lesson this morning as a thoroughly wicked manmean and weak cruel and ungodly governed by his wife jezebel a heathen woman in marrying whom he had broken gods law a woman so famous for cruelty and fierceness vanity and wickedness that her name is a byword even here in england nowas bad as jezebel we say to this day  we heard of ahab in this mornings lesson letting jezebel murder the righteous naboth by perjury and slander to get possession of his vineyard and then instead of shrinking with abhorrence from his wifes iniquity going down and taking possession of the land which he had gained by her sin  we read of gods curse on him and yet of gods longsuffering and pardon to him on his repentance  yet neither gods curse nor gods mercy seem to have moved him  but he had been always the same  he did evil the bible tells us in the sight of the lord above all that were before him  he deserted the true god for his wifes idols and false gods and in spite of elijahs miracle at carmelof which you heard last sundayby which he proved by fire which was the true god and in spite of the wonderful victory which god had given him by means of one of gods prophets over the syrians he still remained an idolater  he would not be taught nor understand neither gods threats nor mercies could move him he went on sinning against light and knowledge and now his cup was fullhis days were numbered and gods vengeance was ready at the door  he consulted all his false prophets as to whether or not he should go to attack the syrians at ramothgilead  they knew what to say they knew that their business was to prophesy what would pay them what would be pleasant to him  they did not care whether what they said was true or notthey lied for the sake of gain for the lord had put a lying spirit into their mouths  they were rogues and villains from the first  they had turned prophets not to speak gods truth but to make money to flatter king ahab to get themselves a reputation  we do not hear that they were all heathens  many of them may have believed in the true god  but they were cheats and liars and so they had given place to the devil the father of lies  and now he had taken possession of them in spite of themselves and they lied to ahab and told him that he would prosper in the battle at ramothgilead  it was a dangerous thing for them to say for if he had been defeated and returned disappointed his rage would have most probably fallen on them for deceiving them  and as in those eastern countries kings do whatever they like without laws or parliaments ahab would have most likely put them all to a miserable death on the spot  but however dangerous it might be for them to lie they could not help lying  a spirit of lies had seized them and they who began by lying because it paid them now could not help doing so whether it paid them or not  but the good king of judah jehoshaphat had no faith in these flattering villains  he asked whether there was not another prophet of the lord to inquire of  ahab told him that there was one micaiah the son of imlah but that he hated him because he only prophesied evil of him  what a thorough picture of a hardened sinnera man who has become a slave to his own lusts till he cares nothing for a thing being true provided only it is pleasant  thus the wilful sinner like ahab becomes both fool and coward afraid to look at things as they are and when gods judgments stare him in the face the wretched man shuts his eyes tight and swears that the evil is not there just because he does not choose to see it  but the evil was there ready for ahab and it found him  when he forced micaiah to speak micaiah told him the whole truth  he told him a vision or dream which he had seen  hear thou therefore the word of the lord  i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him  and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead  and there came forth a spirit and said i will go forth and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets  and the lord said thou shalt persuade him and prevail also  go forth and do so  now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee  what warning could be more awful and yet more plain  ahab was told that he was listening to a lie  he had free choice to follow that lie or not and he did follow it  after having put micaiah into prison for speaking the truth to him he went up to ramothgilead and yet he felt he was not safe  he had his doubts and his fears he would not go openly into the battle but disguised himself hoping that by this means he should keep himself safe from evil fool  gods vengeance could not be stopped by his paltry cunning in spite of all his disguises a chance shot struck him down between the joints of his armour  his chariotdriver carried him out of the battle and he was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians and died at even  and the blood ran out of his wound into the midst of the chariot  and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood there according to the word of the lord which he spoke by the mouth of his prophet elijah saying in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth whom thou slewest shall dogs lick thy blood even thine  and do not fancy my friends that because this is a miraculous story of ancient times it has nothing to do with us  all these things were written for our example  this chapter tells us not merely how ahab was tempted but it tells us how we are tempted every one of us here in england in these very days  as it was with ahab so it is with us  every wilful sin that we commit we give room to the devil  every wrong step that we take knowingly we give a handle to some evil spirit to lead us seven steps further wrong  and yet in every temptation god gives us a fair chance  he is no cruel tyrant who will deliver us over to the devil to be led helpless and blindfold to our ruin  he did not give ahab over to him so  he sent a lying spirit to deceive ahabs prophets that ahab might go up and fall at ramothgilead but at the very same time see he sends a holy and a true man a man whom ahab could trust and did trust at the bottom of his heart to tell him that the lie was a lie to warn him of his ruin so that he might have no excuse for listening to those false prophetsno excuse for following his own pride his own ambition to his destruction  so you see let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god tempteth no man but every one is tempted when he is led away by his own lust and enticed  ahab was led away by his own lust his cowardly love of hearing what was pleasant and flattering to him rather than what was truerather than what he knew he deserved that was what enticed him to listen to zedekiah and the false prophets rather than to micaiah the son of imlah  that is what entices us to sinthe lust of believing what is pleasant to us what suits our own selfwillwhat is pleasant to our bodies pleasant to our pursespleasant to our pride and selfconceit then when the lying spirit comes and whispers to us by bad thoughts by bad books by bad men that we shall prosper in our wickedness does god leave us alone to listen to those evil voices without warning  no  he sends his prophets to us as he sent micaiah to ahab to tell us that the wages of sin is deathto tell us that those who sow the wind shall reap the whirlwindto set before us at every turn good or evil that we may choose between them and live or die according to our choice  for do not fancy that there are no prophets in our days unless the gift of the holy spirit which is promised to all who believe be a dream and a lie there are prophets nowadaysyea i say unto you and more than prophets  is not the bible a prophet  is not every page in it a prophecy to us foretelling gods mercies and gods punishments towards men  is not every holy and wise book every holy and wise preacher and writer a prophet expounding to us gods laws foretelling to us gods opinions of our deeds both good and evil ay is not every man a prophet to himself  that still small voice in a mans heart which warns him of what is evilthat feeling which makes him cheerful and free when he has done right sad and ashamed when he has done wrongis not that a prophecy in a mans own heart  truly it is  it is the voice of god within usit is the spirit of god striving with our spirits whether we will hear or whether we will forbearsetting before us what is righteous and noble and pure and what is manly and godliketo see whether we will obey that voice or whether we will obey our own selfish lusts which tempt us to please ourselvesto pamper ourselves our greediness covetousness ambition or selfconceit  and again i say we have our prophets  every preacher of righteousness is a prophet  every good tract is a prophet  that prayerbook those psalms those creeds those collects which you take into your mouths every sunday what are they but written prophecies crying unto us with the words of holy men of old greater than micaiah or david or elijah hear thou the word of the lord  the spirits of those who wrote that prayerbookthe spirits of just men made perfect filled with the spirit of the lordthey call to us to learn the wisdom which they knew to avoid the temptations which they conquered that we may share in the glory in which they shared round the throne of christ for evermore  and if you ask me how to try the spirits how to know whether your own thoughts whether the sermons which you hear the books which you read are speaking to you gods truth or some lying spirits falsehood i can only answer you to the law and to the testimony to the bible if they speak not according to that word there is no truth in them  but how to understand the bible for the fleshly man understands not the things of god  the fleshly man he who cares only about pleasing himself he who goes to the bible full of self conceit and selfishness wanting the bible to tell him only just what he likes to hear will only find it a sealed book to him and will very likely wrest the scriptures to his own destruction  take up your bible humbly praying to god to shew you its meaning whether it be pleasant to you or not and then you will find that god will shew you a blessed meaning in it he will open your eyes that you may understand the wondrous things of his law he will shew you how to try the spirit of all you are taught and to find out whether it comes from god    sermon ix  hell on earth    matthew viii 29  and behold the evil spirits cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god  art thou come hither to torment us before the time  this account of the man possessed with devils and of his language to our lord of our lords casting the devils out of the poor sufferer and his allowing them to enter into a herd of swine is one that is well worth serious thought and i think a few words on it will follow fitly after my last sundays sermon on ahab and his temptations by evil spirits  in that sermon i shewed you what temper of mind it was which laid a man open to the cunning of evil spirits i wish now to shew you something of what those evil spirits are  it is very little that we can know about them  we were intended to know very little just as much as would enable us to guard against them and no more  the accounts of them in the scriptures are for our use not to satisfy our curiosity  but we may find out a great deal about them from this very chapter from this very story which is repeated almost word for word in three different gospels as if to make us more certain of so curious and important a matter by having three distinct and independent writers to witness for its truth  i advise all those who have bibles to look for this story in the 8th chapter of st matthew and follow me as i explain it 1  now first we may learn from this account that evil spirits are real persons  there is a notion got abroad that it is only a figure of speech to talk of evil spirits that all the bible means by them are certain bad habits or bad qualities or diseases  there are many who will say when they read this story this poor man was only a madman  it was the fashion of the old jews when a man was mad to say that he was possessed by evil spirits  all they meant was that the mans own spirit was in an evil diseased state or that his brain and mind were out of order  when i hear such languageand it is very commoni cannot help thinking how pleased the devil must be to hear people talk in such a way  how can people help him better than by saying that there is no devil  a thief would be very glad to hear you say there are no such things as thieves it is all an old superstition so i may leave my house open at night without danger and i believe my friends from the very bottom of my heart that this newfangled disbelief in evil spirits is put into mens hearts by the evil spirits themselves  as it was once said the devil has tried every plan to catch mens souls and now as the last and most cunning trick of all he is shamming dead  these may seem homely words but the homeliest words are very often the deepest  i advise you all to think seriously on them  but it is impossible surely to read this story without seeing that the bible considers evil spirits as distinct persons just as much as each one of us is a person and that our lord spoke to them and treated them as persons  what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god  art thou come hither to torment us before the time and again if thou cast us out suffer us to go into the herd of swine  what can shew more plainly that there were some persons in that poor man besides himself his own spirit his own person and that he knew it and jesus knew it too and that he spoke to these spirits these persons who possessed that man and not to the man himself  no doubt there was a terrible confusion in the poor madmans mind about these evil spirits who were tormenting him making him miserable foul and savage in mind and bodya terrible confusion  we find when jesus asked him his name he answers legion that is an army a multitude for we are many he says again one gospel tells us that he says what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of god  while in another gospel we are told that he said what have we to do with thee  he seems not to have been able to distinguish between his own spirit and these spirits who possessed him  they put the furious and despairing thoughts into his heart they spoke through his mouth they made a slave and a puppet of him  but though he could not distinguish between his own soul and the devils who were in it christ could and christ did  the man says to him or rather the devils make the man say to him if thou cast us out suffer us to go into the herd of swine and drive us not out into the deep  what did christ answer him christ did not answer him as our socalled wise men in these days would my good man this is all a delusion and a fancy of your own about your having evil spirits in youmore persons than one in you for you are wrong in saying we of yourself  you ought to say i as every one else does and as for spirits going out of you or going into a herd of swine or anything else that is all a superstition and a fancy  there is nothing to come out of you there is nothing in you except yourself  all the evil in you is your own the disease of your own brain and the violent passions of your own heart  your brain must be cured by medicine and your violent passions tamed down by care and kindness and then you will get rid of this foolish notion that you have evil spirits in you and calling yourself a multitude as if you had other persons in you besides yourself  any one who spoke in this manner nowadays would be thought very reasonable and very kind  why did not our lord speak so to this man for there was no outward difference between this mans conduct and that of many violent mad people whom we see continually in england  we read that this man possessed with devils would wear no clothes that he had extraordinary strength that he would not keep company with other men but abode day and night in the tombs exceeding fierce crying and cutting himself with stones trying in blind rage which he could not explain to himself to hurt himself and all who came near him  and above all he had this notion that evil spirits had got possession of him  now every one of these habits and fancies you may see in many raging maniacs at this day  but did our lord treat this man as we treat such maniacs in these days  he took the man at his word and more the man could not distinguish clearly between himself and the evil spirits but our lord did  when the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go into the herd of swine our lord answers go and when they were cast out they went into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters  it was as if our lord had meant to say to the bystandersay and to us and to all people in all times and in all countries this poor possessed maniacs notion was a true one  there were other persons in him besides himself tormenting him body and soul  and behold i can drive these out of him and send them into something else and leave the man uninjured himself and only himself again in an instant without any need of long education to cure him of his bad habits  it will be but reasonable then for us to take this story of the man possessed by devils as written for our example as an instance of what might and perhaps would happen to any one of us were it not for gods mercy  st peter tells us to be sober and watchful because the devil goes about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and when we look at the world around we may surely see that that stands as true now as it did in st peters time  why again did st james tells us to resist the devil if the devil be not near us to resist  why did st paul take for granted as he did that christian men were of course not ignorant of satans devices if it be quite a proof of enlightenment and superior knowledge to be ignorant of his devicesif any dread any thought even about evil spirits be beneath the attention of reasonable men  my friends i say fairly once for all that that common notion that there are no men now possessed by evil spirits and that all those stories of the devils power over men are only old wornout superstitions has come from this that men do not like to retain god in their knowledge and therefore as a necessary consequence do not like to retain the devil in their knowledge because they would be very glad to believe in nothing but what they can see and taste and handle and therefore the thought of unseen evil spirits or good spirits either is a painful thing to them  first they do not really believe in angelsministering spirits sent out to minister to the heirs of salvation then they begin not to believe in evil spirits the bible plainly describes their vast numbers but these people are wiser than the bible and only talk of oneof the devil as if there were not as the text tells us legions and armies of devils then they get rid of that one devil in their real desire to believe in as few spirits as possible  i am afraid many of them have gone on to the next step and got rid of the one god out of their thoughts and their belief  i said i am afraid i ought to have said i know that they have done so and that thousands in this day who began by saying evil spirits only mean certain diseases and bad habits in men have ended by saying god only means certain good habits in man  god is no more a person than the evil spirits are persons  i warn you of all this my friends because if you go to live in large towns as many of you will you will hear talk enough of this sort before your hairs are grey put cleverly and eloquently enough for as a wise man said the devil does not send fools on his errands  i pray god that if you ever do hear doctrines of that kind some of my words may rise in your mind and help to shew to you the evil path down which they lead  we may believe then from the plain words of scriptures that there are vast numbers of evil spirits continually tempting men each of them to some particular sin to worldliness for instance for we read of the spirit of the evil world to filthiness for we read of unclean spirits to falsehood for we read of lying spirits and a spirit of lies to pride for we read of a spirit of pridein short to all sins which a man can commit to all evil passions to which a man can give way  we have a right to believe from the plain words of scripture that these spirits are continually wandering up and down tempting men to sin  that wonderful story of jobs temptation which you may all read for yourselves in the first chapter of the book of job is i think proof enough for any one  but next and i wish you to pay special attention to this point  we have no right to believewe have every right not to believe that these evil spirits can make us sin in the smallest matter against our own wills  the devil cannot put a single sin into us he can only flatter the sinfulness which is already in us  for see this pride lust covetousness falsehood and so on to which the bible tells us they tempt us have roots already in our nature  our fallen nature of itself is inclined to pride to worldliness and so on  these devils tempt us by putting in our way the occasion to sin by suggesting to us tempting thoughts and arguments which lead to sin so the serpent tempted eve not by making her ambitious and selfwilled but by using arguments to her which stirred up the ambition and selfwill in her  ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil the devil said to her  so satan the prince of the evil spirits tempted our lord  and as the prince of the devils tempted christ so do his servants tempt us christs servants  our tempers our longings our fancies are not evil spirits they are as old divines well describe them like greedy and foolish fish who rise at the baits which evil spirits hold out to us  if we resist those baitsif we put ourselves under gods protectionif we claim strength from him who conquered the devil and all his temptations then we shall be able to turn our wills away from those tempting baits and to resign our wills into our fathers hand and he will take care of them and strengthen them with his will and we shall find out that if we resist the devil he will flee from us  but if we yield to temptations whenever they come in our way we shall find ourselves less and less able to resist them for we shall learn to hate the evil spirits less and less i mean we shall shrink less from the evil thoughts they hold out to us  we shall give place to the devil as the scripture tells us we shall for instance by indulging in habitual passionate tempers or rooted spite and malice letting the sun go down upon our wrath  and so a man may become more and more the slave of his own nature of his own lusts and passions and therefore of the devils who are continually pampering and maddening those lusts and passions till a man may end in complete possession not in common madness which may be mere disease but as a savage and a raging maniac such as thank god are rare in christian countries though they were common among our own forefathers before they were converted to christianitymen like the demoniac of whom the text speaks tormented by devils given up to blind rage and malice against himself and all around to lust and blasphemy to confusion of mind and misery of body gods image gone and the image of the devil the destroyer and the corrupter arisen in its place  few men can arrive at this pitch of wretchedness in a civilised country  it would not answer the evil spirits purpose to let them do so  it suits his spirits best in such a land as this to walk about dressed up as angels of light  few men in england would be fools enough to indulge the gross and fierce part of their nature till they became mere savages like the demoniac whom christ cured so it is to respectable vices that the devil mostly tempts usto covetousness to party spirit to a hard heart and a narrow mind to cruelty that shall clothe itself under the name of law to filthiness which excuses itself by saying it is a mans nature he cannot help it to idleness which excuses itself on the score of wealth to meanness and unfairness in trade and in political and religious disputesthese are the devils which haunt us englishmen sleek prim respectable fiends enough and truly their name is legion  and the man who gives himself up to them though he may not become a raving savage is just as truly possessed by devils to his own misery and ruin that he may sow the wind and reap the whirlwind that though men may speak well of him and posterity praise his saying and speak good of the covetous whom god abhorreth yet he may go for ever unto his own to the evil spirits to whom his own wicked will gave him up for a prey  i beseech you my friends consider my words they are not mine but the bibles think of them with fearand yet with confidence for we are baptised into the name of him who conquered all devils you may claim a share in that spirit which is opposite to all evil spirits whose presence makes the agony and misery of evil spirits and drives them out as water drives out fire  if he is on your side why should you be afraid of any spirit  greater is he that is in you than he that is against you and he christ himself is with every man every child who struggles however blindly and weakly against temptation  when temptation comes when evil looks pleasant and arguments rise up in your mind that seem to make it look right and reasonable as well as pleasant then out of the very depths of your hearts cry after him who died for you  say to yourselves how can i do this thing and offend against him who bought me with his blood  say to him i am weak i am confused i do not see right from wrong i cannot find my way i cannot answer the devil i cannot conquer these cunning thoughts i know in the bottom of my heart that they are wrong mere temptations and yet they look so reasonable  blessed saviour thou must shew me where they are wrong  thou didst answer the devil thyself out of gods word put into my mind some answer out of gods word to these temptations or at least give me spirit to toss them offstrength of will to thrust the whole temptation out of my head and say i will parley no longer with the devil i will put the whole matter out of my head for a time  i dont know whether it is right or wrong for me to do this particular thing but there are twenty other things which i do know are right  ill go and do them and let this wait awhile  believe me my friends you can do thisyou can resist these evil spirits which tempt us all else why did our lord bid us pray lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil  why  because our father in heaven if we ask him will not lead us into temptation but through it safe  tempted we must be else we should not be men but here is our comfort and our strengththat we have a king in heaven who has fought out and conquered all temptations and a father in heaven who has promised that he will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able but will with the temptation make a way to escape that we may be able to bear it  again i say draw near to god and he will draw near to you resist the devil and he will flee from you    sermon x  noahs justice    genesis vi 9  noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god  i intend my friends according as god shall help me to preach to you between this time and christmas a few sermons on some of the saints and worthies of the old testament and i will begin this day with noah  now you must bear in mind that the histories of these ancient men were as st paul says written for our example  if these men in old times had been different from us they would not be examples to us but they were like usmen of like passions says st james as ourselves they had each of them in them a corrupt nature which was continually ready to drag them down and make beasts of them and make them slaves to their own lustsslaves to eating and drinking and covetousness and cowardice and laziness and love for the things which they could see and handlejust such a nature in short as we have  and they had also a spirit in each of them which was longing to be free and strong and holy and wisesuch a spirit as we have  and to them just as to us god was revealing himself god was saying to their consciences as he does to ours this is right that is wrong do this and be free and clear hearted do that and be dark and discontented and afraid of thy own thoughts  and they too like us had to live by faith by continual belief that they owed a duty to the great god whom they could not see by continual belief that he loved them and was guiding and leading them through every thing which happened good or ill  this is faith in god by which alone we or any man can live worthilyby which these old heroes lived  we read in the twelfth chapter of hebrews that it was by faith these elders obtained a good report and the whole history of the oldtestament saints is the history of god speaking to the hearts of one man after another teaching them each more and more about himself and the history also of these men listening to the voice of god in their hearts and believing that voice and acting faithfully upon it into whatever strange circumstances or deeds it might lead them  by faith we read in this same chapterby faith noah being warned of god prepared an ark to the saving of his house and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith  now to understand this last sentence you must remember that noah was not under the law of moses  st paul has a whole chapter the third chapter of galatians to shew that these old saints had nothing to do with moses law any more than we have that it was given to the jews many hundred years afterwards  so these histories of the oldtestament saints are in fact histories of men who conquered by faithhistories of the power which faith in god has to conquer temptation and doubt and false appearances and fear and danger and all which besets us and keeps us down from being free and holy and children of the day walking cheerfully forward on our heavenward road in the light of our fathers loving smile  noah we read was a just man and perfect in his generations and why  because he was a faithful manfaithful to god as it is written the just shall live by his faith not by trusting in what he does himself in his own works or deservings but trusting in god who made him believing that god is perfectly righteous perfectly wise perfectly loving and that because he is perfectly loving he will accept and save sinful man when he sees in sinful man the earnest wish to be his faithful obedient servant and to give himself up to the rule and guidance of god  this then was noahs justice in gods sight as it was abrahams  they believed god and so became heirs of the righteousness which is by faith not their own righteousness not growing out of their own character but given them by god who puts his righteous spirit into those who trust in him  but moreover we read that noah was perfect in his generations that is he was perfect in all the relations and duties of lifea good son a good husband a good father  these were the fruits of his faith  he believed that the unseen god had given him these ties had given him his parents his children and that to love them was to love god to do his duty to them was to do his duty to god this was part of his walking with god continually under his great taskmasters eyewalking about his daily business with the belief that a great loving father was above him whatever he did ready to strengthen and guide and bless him if he did well ready to avenge himself on him if he did ill  these were the fruits of noahs faith  but you may think this nothing very wonderful  many a man in england does this every day and yet no one ever hears of him he attends to all his family ties doing justly loving mercy and walking humbly with god like one who knows he is redeemed by christs blood he lives he dies he is buried and out of his own parish his name is never known while noah has earned for himself a worldwide fame for four thousand years his name has been spreading over the whole earth as one of the greatest men who ever lived mighty nations have worshipped noah as a god many heathen nations worship him under strange and confused names and traditions to this day and the wisest and holiest men among christians now reverence noah write of him preach on him thank god for him look up to him as next to abraham their greatest example in the old testament  well my friends to understand what made noah so great we must understand in what times noah lived  the wickedness of men was great in the earth in those days and every imagination of the thoughts of their heart was only evil continually and the earth was filled with violence through them  and we must remember that the wickedness of men before the flood was not outwardly like wickedness now it was not petty mean contemptible wickedness of silly and stupid men such as could be despised and laughed down it was like the wickedness of fallen angels  men were then strong and beautiful cunning and active to a degree of which we can form no conception  their enormous length of life six seven and eight hundred years commonly must have given them an experience and daring far beyond any man in these days  their bodily size and strength were in many cases enormous  we read that there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown  their powers of invention seem to have been proportionably great  we read in the fourth chapter of genesis how within a few years after adam was driven out of paradise they had learned to build cities to tame the wild beasts and live upon their milk and flesh that they had invented all sorts of music and musical instruments that they had discovered the art of working in metals  we read among them of tubalcain an instructor of every workman in brass and iron and the old traditions in the east where these men dwelt are full of strange and awful tales of their power  again we must remember that there was no law in noahs days before the flood no bible to guide them no constitutions and acts of parliament to bind men in the beaten track by the awful majesty of law whether they will or no as we have  this is the picture which the bible gives us of the old world before the flooda world of men mighty in body and mind fierce and busy conquering the world round them in continual war and turmoil with all the wild passions of youth and yet all the cunning and experience of enormous old age with the strength and the courage of young men to carry out the iniquity of old ones every one guided only by selfwill having cast off god and conscience and doing every man that which was right in the sight of his own eyes  and amidst all this while men as wise as old as strong as great as himself whirled away round him in this raging sea of sin noah was stedfast he at least knew his wayhe walked with god a just man and perfect in his generations  to noah living in such a world as this among temptation and violence and insult no doubt there came this command from god the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and i will destroy them with the earth and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt make thee an ark of wood after the fashion which i tell thee and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy family and of every living thing two of every sort male and female shalt thou bring into the ark and keep them alive with thee and take thou of all food that is eaten into the ark for thee and for them  what a message my friends  if we wish to see a little of the greatness of noahs faith conceive such a message coming from god to one of us  should we believe itmuch less act upon it  but noah believed god says the scripture and according as god commanded him so did he  now in whatever way this command came from god to noah it is equally wonderful  some of you perhaps will say in your hearts no when god spoke to him how could he help obeying him  but my friends ask yourselves seriouslyfor believe me it is a most important question for the soul and inner life of you and me and every man how did noah know that it was god who spoke to him  it is easy to say god appeared to him but no man hath seen god at any time  it is easy again to say that an angel appeared to him or that god appeared to him in the form of a man but still the same question is left to be answered how did he know that this appearance came from god and that its words were true  why should not noah have said this was an evil spirit which appeared to me trying to frighten and ruin me and stir up all my neighbours to mock me perhaps to murder me  or again suppose that you or i saw some glorious apparition this day which told us on such and such a day such and such a town will be destroyed what should we think of it  should we not say i must have been dreamingi must have been ill and so my brain and eyes must have been disordered and treat the whole thing as a mere fancy of illhealth now why did not noah do the same  why do i say this  to shew you my friends that it is not apparitions and visions which can make a man believe  as it is written if they believe not moses and the prophets neither will they believe though one rose from the dead  no a man must have faith in his heart already  a man must first be accustomed to discern right from wrongto listen to and to obey the voice of god within him that word of god of which it is said the word is nigh thee in thy heart and in thy mind before he can hear gods word from without else he will only explain away miracles and call visions and apparitions sick mens dreams  but there was something yet more wonderful and divine in noahs faithi mean his patience  he knew that a flood was to comehe set to work in faith to build his arkand that ark was in building for one hundred and twenty yearsone hundred and twenty years  it seems at first past all belief  for all that time he built and all the while the world went on just as usual and before he had finished old men had died and children grown into years and great cities had sprung up perhaps where there was not a cottage before and trees which were but a yard high when that ark was begun had grown into mighty foresttimber and men had multiplied and spread and yet noah built and built on stedfastly believing that what god had said would surely one day or other come to pass  for one hundred and twenty years he saw the world go on as usual and yet he never forgot that it was a doomed world  he endured the laughter and mockery of all his neighbours and every fresh child who was born grew up to laugh at the foolish old man who had been toiling for a hundred years past on his mad scheme as they thought it and yet noah never lost faith and he never lost love eitherfor all those years we read he preached righteousness to the very men who mocked him and preached in vainone hundred and twenty years he warned those sinners of gods wrath of righteousness and judgment to come and no man listened to him  that i believe must have been after all the hardest of all his trials  and doubtless noah had his inward temptation many a time no doubt he was ready now and then to believe gods message all a dreamto laugh at himself for his fears of a flood which seemed never coming but in his heart was the still small voice of god warning him that god was not a man that he should lie or repent or deceive those who walked faithfully with him and around him he saw men growing and growing in iniquity filling up the cup of their own damnation and he said to himself verily there is a god who judgeth the earthfor all this a reckoning day will surely come and he worked stedfastly on and the ark was finished  and then at last there came a second call from god come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation  yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the earth  and noah entered into the ark and seven days he waited and louder than ever laughed the scoffers round him at the old man and his family shut into his ark safe on dry land while day and night went on as quietly as ever and the world ran its usual round for seven days more their mad game lastedthey ate they drank they married they gave in marriage they planted they builded and on the seventh day it camethe rain fell day after day and week after weekand the windows of heaven were opened and the fountains of the great deep were broken up and the flood arose and swept them all away    sermon xi  the noachic covenant    gen ix 8 9  and god spake unto noah and his sons with him saying and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you  in my last sermon on noah i spoke of the flood and of noahs faith before the flood i now go on to speak of the covenant which god made with noah after the flood  now noah stood on that newlydried earth as the head of mankind he and his family in all eight souls saved by gods mercy from the general ruin were the only human beings left alive and had laid on them the wonderful and glorious duty of renewing the race of man and replenishing the vast world around them  from that little knot of human beings were to spring all the nations of the earth  and because this calling and destiny of theirs was a great and all important onebecause so much of the happiness or misery of the new race of mankind depended on the teaching which they would get from their forefathers the sons of noah therefore god thought fit to make with noah and his sons a solemn covenant as soon as they came out of the ark  let us solemnly consider this covenant for it stands good now as much as ever  god made it with noah and his seed after him for perpetual generations  and we are the seed of noah every man woman and child of us here were in the loins of noah when the great absolute god gave him that pledge and promise  we must earnestly consider that covenant for in it lies the very ground and meaning of mans life and business on this earth  and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every living creature  into your hand they are delivered  every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things  but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat  and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of men at the hand of every mans brother will i require the life of man whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man  now to understand this covenant consider what thoughts would have been likely to grow up in the mind of noahs children after the flood  would they not have been something of this kind  god does not love men he has drowned all but us and we are men of like passions with the world who perished may we not expect the like ruin at any moment  then what use to plough and sow and build and plant and work for those who shall come after us  let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  and again they would have been ready to say this god whom our forefather noah said sent floods we cannot see him but the floods themselves we can see  all these clouds and tempests lightning sun and stars are we stronger than them  no  they may crush us drown us strike us dead at any moment  they seem too to go by certain wonderful rules and laws perhaps they have a will and understanding in them  instead of praying to a god whom we never saw why not pray to the thunderclouds not to strike us dead and to the seas and rivers not to sweep us away  for this great wonderful awful world in which we are however beautiful may be its flowers and its fruits and its sunshine there is no trusting it we are sitting upon a painted sepulchre a beautiful monster a gulf of flood and fire which may burst up any moment and sweep us away as it did our forefathers  again noahs children would have begun to say these beasts here round us they are so many of them larger than us stronger than us able to tear us to atoms eat us up as they would eat a lamb  they are selfsufficient too they want no clothes nor houses nor fire like us poor weak naked soft human creatures  they can run faster than we see farther than we their scent too what a wonderful mysterious power that is like a miracle to us  and besides all their cunning ways of getting food and building nests they never do wrong they never do horrible things contrary to their nature they all abide as god has made them obeying the law of their kind  are not these beasts then much wiser and better than we  we will honour them and pray to them not to devour usto make us cunning and powerful as they are themselves  and if they are no better than us surely they are no worse than us  after all what difference is there between a man and a beast  the flood which drowned the beasts drowned the men too  a beast is flesh and blood what more is a man  if you kill him he dies just as a beast dies and why should not a mans carcase be just as good to eat as a beasts and better  and so there would have been a free opening at once into all the horrors of cannibalism  again noahs descendants would have said our forefathers offered sacrifices to the unseen god as a sign that all they had belonged to him and that they had forfeited their own souls by sin and were therefore ready to give up the most precious things they hadtheir cattle as a sign that they owed all to that very god whom they had offended  but are not human creatures much more precious than cattle  will it not be a much greater sign of repentance and willingness to give up all to god if we offer him the best things which we havehuman creatures  if we kill and sacrifice to him our most beautiful and innocent thingslittle childrennoble young menbeautiful young girls  my friends these are very strange and shocking thoughts but they have been in the hearts and minds of all nations  the heathens do such things now  our own forefathers used to do such things once they were tempted to worship the sun and the moon and the rivers and the thunder and to look with superstitious terror at the bears and the wolves and the snakes round them and to kill their young children and maidens and offer them up as sacrifices to the dark powers of this world which they thought were ready to swallow them up  and god is my witness my friends when one goes through some parts of england now and sees the minechildren and factory children and all the sin and misery and the people wearying themselves in the fire for very vanity we seem not to be so very far from the same dark superstition now though we may call it by a different name  england has been sacrificing her sons and her daughters to the devil of covetousness of late years just as much as our forefathers offered theirs to the devil of selfish and cowardly superstition  but see now how this covenant which god made with noah was intended just to remedy every one of those temptations which i just mentioned into which noahs childrens children would have been certain to fall and into which so many of them did fall  they might have become reckless i said from fear of a flood at any moment  god promises themand confirms it with the sign of the rainbownever again to destroy the earth by water  they would have been likely to take to praying to the rain and the thunder the sun and the stars god declares in this covenant that it is he alone who sends the rain and thunder that he brings the clouds over the earth that he rules the great awful world that men are to look up and believe in god as a loving and thinking person who has a will of his own and that a faithful and true and loving and merciful will that their lives and safety depend not on blind chance or the stern necessity of certain laws of nature but on the covenant of an almighty and allloving person  again i said that noahs sons would have been ready to fear and at last to worship the dumb beasts gods covenant says no these beasts are not your equalsthey are your slavesyou may freely kill them for your food the fear of you shall be upon them  the huge elephant and the swift horse shall become your obedient servants the lion and the tiger shall tremble and flee before you only claim your rights as men believe that the invisible god who made the earth is your strength and your protector and that he to whom the earth belongs has made you lords of the earth and all that therein is  but said gods covenant to noahs sons you did not make these beastsyou did not give them life therefore i forbid you to eat their blood wherein their life lies that you may never forget that all the power you have over these beasts was given you by god who made and preserves that wonderful mysterious holy thing called life which you can never imitate  again i said that noahs children having been accustomed to the violence and bloodshed on the earth before the flood might hold mans life cheap that having seen in the flood men perish just like the beasts around them they might have begun to think that mans life was not more precious than the beasts  they might have all gone on at last as some of them did to those horrors of cannibalism and human sacrifice of which i just now spoke  now here again comes in gods covenant surely the blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of every mans brother will i require it  whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man  this then is the covenant which god made with noah for perpetual generations and therefore with us the children of noah in this covenant you see certain truths come out into light some of which you read nothing before in the bible and other truths which though they were given to adam yet had been utterly lost sight of before the flood  this has been gods method we find from the bible ever since the creationto lead man step by step up into more and more light up to this very day and to make each sin and each madness of men an occasion for revealing to him more and more of truth and of the living god  and so each and every chapter in the bible is built upon all that has gone before it and he that neglects to understand what has gone before will never come to the understanding of what follows after  why do i say this  because men are continually picking out those scraps of the bible which suit their own fancy and pinning their whole faith on them and trying to make them serve to explain every thing in heaven and earth whereas no man can understand the epistles unless he first understand the gospels  no man will understand the new testament unless he first understands the pith and marrow of the old  no man will understand the psalms and the prophets unless he first understands the first ten chapters of genesis and lastly no one will ever understand any thing about the bible at all who instead of taking it simply as it is written is always trying to twist it into proofs of his own favourite doctrines and make abraham a high calvinist or noah a member of the church of england  why do i say this  to make you all think seriously that this covenant on which i have been preaching is your covenant that as sure as the rainbow stands in heaven as sure as you and i are sprung out of the loins of noah so surely this covenant which binds us is part of our christian covenant and woe to us if we break it  this covenant tells us that we are made in gods likeness and therefore that all sin is unworthy of us and unnatural to us  it tells us that god means us bravely and industriously to subdue the earth and the living things upon it that we are to be the masters of the pleasant things about us and not their slaves as sots and idlers are that we are stewards and tenants of this world for the great god who made it to whom we are to look up in confidence for help and protection  it tells us that our family relationships the blessed duties of a husband and a father are sacred things that god has created them that the great god of heaven himself respects them that the covenant which he makes with the father he makes with the children that he commands marriage and that he blesses it with fruitfulness that it is he who has told us be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth that the tie of brotherhood is his making also that he will require the blood of the murdered man at his brothers hand that a mans brothers his nearest relations are bound to protect and right him if he is injured so that we all are to be in the deepest sense of the word what cain refused to be our brothers keepers and each member of a family is more or less answerable for the welfare and safety of all his relations herein lies the ground of all religion and of all societyin the covenant which god made with noah and just as it is in vain for a man to pretend to be a scholar when he does not even know his letters so it is mockery for a man to pretend to be a converted christian man who knows not even so much as was commanded to noah and his sons  he who has not learnt to love honour and succour his own familyhe who has not learnt to work in honest and manful industryhe who has not learnt to look beyond this earth and its chance and its customs and its glittering outside and see and trust in a great wise loving god by whose will every tree grows and every shower falls what is christianity to him  he has to learn the first principles which were delivered to noah and which not even the heathen and the savage have utterly forgotten    sermon xii  abrahams faith    hebrews xi 9 10  by faith abraham sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise  for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god  in the last sermon which i preached in this church i said that the bible is the history of gods ways with mankind how he has schooled and brought them up until the coming of christ that if we read the bible histories one after another in the same order in which god has put them in the bible we shall see that they are all regular steps in a line that each fresh story depends on the story which went before it and yet in each fresh history we shall find god telling men something newsomething which they did not know before and that so the whole bible from beginning to end is one glorious methodic and organic tree of life every part growing out of the others and depending on the others from the rootthat foundation other than which no man can lay which is christ revealing himself though not by name in that wonderful first chapter of genesisup to the fruit which is the kingdom of christ and gospel of christ and the salvation in which we here now stand  i told you that the lesson which god has been teaching men in all ages is faith in god that the saints of old were just the men who learnt this lesson of faith  now this as we all know was the secret of abrahams greatness that he had faith in god to leave his own country at gods bidding and become a stranger and a pilgrim on the earth wandering on in full trust that god would give him another country instead of that which he had lefta city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god  this was what abraham looked for something of what it means we shall see presently  you remember the story of the tower of babel  how certain of noahs family forgot the covenant which god had made with noah forgot that god had commanded them to go forth in every direction and fill the earth with human beings solemnly promising to protect and bless them and took on themselves to do the very oppositeset up a kingdom of their own fashion and herded together for selfish safety instead of going forth to all the quarters of the world in a natural way according to their families in their tribes after their nations as the eleventh chapter of genesis says they ought to have done  let us build us a city and a tower and make us a name lest they said we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole world  here was one act of disobedience to gods order  but besides this they had fallen into a slavish dread of the powers of naturethey were afraid of another flood  they set to to build a tower on which they might worship the sun and stars and the host of heaven and pray to them to send no more floods and tempests they thus fell into a slavish fear of the powers of nature as well as into a selfish and artificial civilisation  in short they utterly broke the covenant which god had made with noah  but by miraculously confounding their language god drove them forth over the face of the whole earth and so forced them to do that which they ought to have done willingly at first  now we must remember that all this happened in the very country in which abraham lived  he must have heard of it allfor aught we know he had seen the tower of babel  so that for good or for evil the whole babel event must have produced a strong effect on the mind of a thoughtful man like abraham and raised many strange questionings in his heart which god alone could answer for him or for us  now what did god mean to teach abraham by calling him out of his country and telling him i will make of thee a great nation  i think he meant to shew him for one thing that that babel plan of society was utterly absurd and accursed certain to come to naught and so to lead him on to hope for a city which had foundations and to see that its builder and maker must be not the selfishness or the ambition of men but the will and the wisdom and providence of god  let us see how god led abraham on to understand thisto look for a city which had foundations in short to understand what a state and a nation means and ought to be  first god taught him that he was not to cling cowardlike to the place where he was born but to go out boldly to colonise and subdue the earth for the great god of heaven would protect and guide him  get thee out of thy country and from thy fathers house unto a land which i will shew thee  and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee again god taught him what a nation was  i will make of thee a great nation  as much as to say never fancy as those fools at babel did that a nation only means a great crowd of peoplenever fancy that men can make themselves into a nation just by feeding altogether and breeding altogether and fighting altogether as the herds of wild cattle and sheep do while there is no real union between them  for what brought those babel men together  just what keeps a herd of cattle togetherselfishness and fear  each man thought he would be safer forsooth in company  each man thought that if he was in company he could use his neighbours wits as well as his own and have the benefit of his neighbours strength as well as his own  and that is all true enough but that does not make a nation  selfishness can join nothing it may join a set of men for a time each for his own ends just as a jointstock company is made up but it will soon split them up again  each man in a merely selfish community will begin after a time to play on his own account as well as work on his own accountto oppress and overreach for his own ends as well as to be honest and benevolent for his own ends for he will find illdoing far easier and more natural in one sense and a plan that brings in quicker profits than welldoing and so this godless loveless everymanfor himself nation or sham nation rather this jointstock company in which fools expect that universal selfishness will do the work of universal benevolence will quarrel and break up crumble to dust again as babel did  but says god to abraham i will make of thee a great nation  i make nations and not they themselves  so it is my friends  this is the lesson which god taught abraham the lesson which we english must learn nowadays over again or smart for it bitterlythat god makes nations  he is king of kings by him kings reign and princes decree judgment  he judges all nations he nurtureth the nations  this is throughout the teaching of the psalms  it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture for this i take to be the true bearing of that glorious national hymn the 100th psalm and not merely the old truism that men did not create themselves when it exhorts all nations to praise god because it is he that hath made them nations and not they themselves  the psalms set forth the son of god as the king of all nations  in him my friendsin him all the nations of the earth are truly blessed  he the saviour of a few individual souls only  god forbid  to him all power is given in heaven and earth by him were all things created whether in heaven or earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powersall national life all forms of government whether herodespotisms republics or monarchies aristocracies of birth or of wealth or of talentall were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and hold together  every thing or institution on earth which has systematic and organic life in itby him it consistsby him the life and the light who lighteneth every man that cometh into the world  from him come law and order and spiritual energy and loving fellowfeeling and patriotism the spirit of wisdom and understanding and prudence all in short by which a nation consists and holds together  it is not constitutions and acts of parliament and social contracts and rights of the people and rights of kings and so on which make us a nation  these are but the effects and not the consequences of the national life  that is the one spirit which is shed abroad upon a country whose builder and maker is god and which comes down from abovecomes down from christ the king of kings who has given each nation its peculiar work on this earth its peculiar circumstances and history to mould and educate it for its work and its peculiar spirit and national character wherewith to fulfil the destiny which christ has appointed for it  believe me my friends it takes long years too and much training from god and from christ the king of kings to make a nation everything which is most precious and great is also most slow in growing and so is a nation  the scripture compares it everywhere to a tree and as the tree grows a people must grow from small beginnings perhaps from a single family increasing on according to the fixed laws of gods world for years and hundreds of years till it becomes a mighty nation with one lord one faith one work one spirit  but again god said to abraham when he had led him into this far country unto thy seed will i give this land  this was a great and a new lesson for abraham that the earth belonged to that same great invisible god who had promised to guide and protect him and make him into a nationthat this same god gave the earth to whomsoever he would and allotted to each people their proper portion of it  he said st paul on the areopagus hath determined the times before appointed for all nations and the bounds of their habitation that they may seek after the lord and find him  ah this must have been a strange and a new feeling to abraham but stranger still though god had given him this land he was not to take possession of a single foot of it the land was already in the hands of a different nation the people of canaan and abraham was to go wandering about a sojourner as the text says in this very land of promise which god had given him without ever taking possession of his own simply because it belonged to others already how this must have taught abraham that the rights of property were sacred thingsthings appointed by god that it was an awful and a heinous sin to make wanton war on other people to drive them out and take possession of their land that it was not mere force or mere fancy which gave men a right to a country but the providence of almighty god  now abraham needed this warning for the men of babel seem from the first to have gone on the plan of driving out and conquering the tribes round them  they seem to have set up their city partly from ambition  let us make us a name they said meaning let us make ourselves famous and terrible to all the people around us that we may subdue them  and we read of nimrod who was their first king and the founder of babel that he was a mighty hunter before the lord that is as most learned men explain it a mighty conqueror and tyrant in defiance of god and his laws as the poet says of him   a mighty hunter and his game was man   the jews indeed have an old tradition that nimrod cast abraham into a fiery furnace for refusing to worship the host of heaven with him  the story is very likely untrue but still it is of use in shewing what sort of reputation nimrod left behind him in his own part of the world  we may thus see that abraham would need warning against these habits of violence tyranny and plunder into which the men of babel and other tribes were falling  and this was what god meant to teach him by keeping him a stranger and a pilgrim in the very land which god had promised to him for his own  thus abraham learnt respect for the rights and properties of his neighbours thus he learnt to look up in faith to god not only as his patron and protector but as the lord and absolute owner of the soil on which he stood  now in the 14th chapter of genesis there is an account of abrahams being called on to put in practice what he had learnt and by doing so learning a fresh lesson  we read of four kings making war against five kings against chedorlaomer king of elam or persia who had been following the ways of nimrod and the men of babel and conquering these foreign kings and making them serve him  we read of chedorlaomer and four other kings coming down and wantonly ravaging and destroying other countries besides the five kings who had rebelled against them and at last carrying off captive the people of sodom and gomorrah and lot abrahams nephew  we read then how abraham armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and eighteen men and pursued after these tyrants and plunderers and with his small force completely overthrew that great army  now that was a sign and a lesson to abraham as much as to say see the fruits of having the great god of heaven and earth for your protector and your guidesee the fruits of having men round you not hirelings keeping in your company just to see what they can get by it but born in your own house who love and trust you whom you can love and trustsee how the favour of god and reverence for those family ties and duties which he has appointed make you and your little band of faithful men superior to these great mobs of selfish godless unjust robberssee how hundreds of these slaves ran away before one man who feels that he is a member of a family and has a just cause for fighting and that god and his brethren are with him  here you see was another hint to abraham of what it was and who it was that made a great nation  and now some of you may say this is a strange sermon  you have as yet said nothing of christ nothing of the holy spirit nothing of grace redemption sanctification  what kind of sermon is this  my friends do not be too sure that i have not been preaching christ to you and christs spirit to you and christs redemption too most truly in this sermon although i have mentioned none of them by name  there are times for ornamenting the house there are times for repairing the wall there are times too for thoroughly examining the foundation because if that be not sound it is little matter what fine work is built up upon it and there are times when as david says the foundations of the earth are out of course when men have forgotten sadly the very first principles of society and religion  and surely men are doing so in these days men are forgetting that other foundation can no man lay save that which is laid which is christ they laugh at the thought of a city that is a state and form of government not made with hands eternal in the heavens they have forgotten that st paul tells them in the hebrews that we have a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god a kingdom which cannot be moved  yes men who call themselves learned and worldly wise and good men too alas who fancy that they are preaching gods gospel go about and tell men the men of babel were right after all  what have nations to do with god and religion  nations are merely earthly carnal things that were only invented by sinful men themselves to preserve their bodies and goods and make trading easy  religion has only to do with a mans private opinions his single soul the government has nothing to do with the church  a christian has nothing to do with politics  and so these men most unwittingly open a door to all sorts of covetousness and meanness in the nation and all sorts of trickery and cowardice in the government  tell a man that his business has nothing to do with god and you cannot wonder if he acts without thinking of god  if you tell a nation that it is selfishness which makes it prosperous of course you must expect it to be selfish  if you tell us englishmen that the duties of a citizen are not duties to god but only duties to the constable and the taxgatherer what wonder if men believe you and become undutiful to god in their citizenship  no my friends once for all as sure as god made abraham a great nation so if we english are a great nation god has made us soas sure as god gave abraham the land of canaan for his possession so did he give us this land of england when he brought our saxon forefathers out of the wild barren north and drove out before them nations greater and mightier than they and gave them great and goodly cities which they builded not and wells digged which they digged not farms and gardens which they planted not that we too might fear the lord our god and serve him and swear by his nameas sure as he commanded abraham to respect the property of his neighbours so has he commanded usas sure as god taught abraham that the nation which was to grow from him owed a duty to god and could be only strong by faith in god so it is with us we english people owe a duty to god and are to deal among ourselves and with foreign countries by faith in god and in the fear of god seeking first the kingdom of god and his righteousness sure that then all other thingsvictory health commerce art and sciencewill be added to us as the first lesson says  for this is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the nations which shall say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people  for what nation is grown so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as these laws this gospel which god sets before us day by dayus englishmen  and i say that these are proper thoughts for this place  this is not a mere preachinghouse where you may learn every man to save his own soul this is a far nobler place this building belongs to the national church of england and we worship here not merely as men but as men of england citizens of a christian country come here to learn not merely how to save ourselves but how to help towards the saving of our families our parish and our nation and therefore we must know what a country and a nation mean and what is the meaning of that glorious and divine word a citizen that by learning what it is to be a citizen of england we may go on to learn fully what it is to be a citizen of the kingdom of god  for this is part of the whole counsel of god which he reveals in his holy bible and this also we must not and dare not shun declaring in these days    sermon xiii  abrahams obedience    hebrews xi 1719  by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his onlybegotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called  accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure  in this chapter we come to the crowning point of abrahams history the highest step and perfection of his faith beyond which it seems as if mans trust in god could no further go  you know most of you doubtless that isaac abrahams son was come to him out of the common course of naturewhen he and his wife sarah were of an age which seemed to make all chance of a family utterly hopeless  you remember how god promised abraham that this boy should be born to him at a certain time when he appeared to him on the plains of mamre in that most solemn and deepmeaning vision of which i spoke to you last sunday  you remember too no doubt most of you how god had promised abraham again and again that in his seed his children all the nations of the earth should be blessed so that all abrahams hopes were wrapped up in this boy isaac he was his only son whom he loved he was the child of his old age his glory and his joy he was the child of gods promises every time abraham looked at him he felt that isaac was a wonderful child  that god had a great work for him to do that from that single boy a great nation was to spring as many in multitude as the stars in the sky or the sand on the seashore for the great almighty god had said it  and he knew too that from that boy who was growing up by him in his tent all the nations in the earth should be blessed  so that isaac his son was to abraham a daily sacrament as i may say a sign and a pledge that god was with him and would be true to him that as surely as god had wonderfully and beyond all hope given him that son so wonderfully and beyond all hope he would fulfil all his other promises  conceive then if you can what abrahams astonishment and doubt and terror and misery must have been at such a message as this from the very god who had given isaac to him  and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham  and he said behold here i am  and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burntoffering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of  what a storm of doubt it must have raised in abrahams mind  how unable he must have been to say whether that message came from a good or bad spirit or commanded him to do a good action or a bad one that the same god who had said whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed who had forbidden murder as the very highest of crimes should command him to shed the blood of his own son that the same god who had promised him that in isaac all the nations of the earth should be blessed should command him to put to death that very son upon whom all his hopes depended  fearful indeed must have been the struggle in abrahams mind but the good and the right thought conquered at last  his feeling was no doubt this god who has blessed me so long who has guided me so long whom i have obeyed so long shall i not trust him a little further yet how can i believe that he will do wrong how can i believe that he will lead me wrong  if it is really wrong that i should kill my son he will not let me do it  if it really is his will that i should kill my son i will do it  whatever he says must be right it is agony and misery to me but what of that  do i not owe him a thousand daily and hourly blessings  has he not led me hither preserved me guided me taught me the knowledge of himselfchosen me to be the father of a great nation  do i not owe him everything and shall i not bear this sharp sorrow for his sake  i know too that if isaac dies all my hope all my joy will die with him that i shall have nothing left to look for nothing left to work for in this world  nothing shall i not have god left to me  when isaac is dead will the lord die will the lord change will he grow weak never  years ago did he declare to me that he was the almighty god i will believe that he will be always almighty i will believe that though i kill my son my son will be still in gods hands and i shall be still in gods hands and that god is able to raise him again even from the dead  god can give him back to me and if he will not give him back to me he can fulfil his promises in a thousand other ways  ay and he will fulfil his promises for in him is neither deceit nor fickleness nor weakness nor unrighteousness of any kind and come what will i will believe his promise and i will obey his will  some such thoughts as these i suppose passed through abrahams mind  he could not have had a mans heart in him indeed if not only those thoughts but ten thousand more sadder and stranger and more pitiful than my weak brain can imagine did not sweep like a storm through his soul at that last and terrible temptation but the bible tells us nothing of them  why should the bible tell us anything of them the bible sets forth abraham as the faithful man and therefore it simply tells us of his faith without telling us of his doubts and struggles before he settled down into faith  it tells us as it were not how often the wind shifted and twisted about during the tempest but in what quarter the wind settled when the tempest was over and it began to blow steadily and fixedly and gently and all was bright and mild and still in abrahams bosom again just as a mans mind will be bright and gentle and calm even at the moment he is going to certain death or fearful misery if he does but know that his suffering is his duty and that his trial is his heavenly fathers will  and so all we read in the oldtestament account is simply and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burntoffering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off  and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you  and abraham took the wood of the burntoffering and laid it upon isaac his son  and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together  and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son  and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burntoffering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burntoffering  so they went both of them together  and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son  really if one is to consider the whole circumstances of abrahams trials they seem to have been infinite more than mortal man could bear more than he could have borne no doubt if the same god who tried had not rewarded his strength of mind by strengthening him still more and rewarded his faith by increasing his faith when we consider the struggle he must have had to keep the dreadful secret from the young mans mother the tremendous effort of controlling himself the long and frightful journey the necessity and yet the difficulty he seems to have felt of keeping the truth from his son and yet of telling him the truth which he did in those wonderful words god shall provide himself a lamb for a burntoffering on which i shall have occasion to speak presently and last and worst of all the perfect obedience and submission of his son for isaac was not a child then he was a young man of nearly thirty years of age strong and able enough no doubt to have resisted his aged father if he had chosen  but the very excellence of isaac seems to have been that he did not resist that he shewed the same perfect trust and obedience to abraham that abraham did towards god for he was led as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth for we read abraham bound isaac his son and laid him on the wood  surely that was the bitterest pang of all to see the excellence of his son shine forth just when it was too late for him to enjoy himto find out what a perfect child he had in simple trust and utter obedience just at the very moment when he was going to lose him  and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son  at that point abrahams trial finished  he had shewn the completeness of his faith by the completeness of his works that is by the completeness of his obedience  he had utterly given up all for god  he had submitted his will completely to gods will  he had said in heart as our blessed lord said father if it be possible let this woe pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and thus i say he was justified by his works by his actions that is by this faithful action he proved the faithfulness of his heart as the angel said to him now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me for as st james says was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar  seest thou says he how his faith wrought with his works how his works were the tool or instrument which his faith used and by his works his faith was brought to perfection as a tree is brought to perfection when it bears fruit  and so st james continues the scripture was fulfilled which says abraham believed god and it was imputed to him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god  ye see then he says how that by works a man is justified or shewn to be righteous and faithful and not by faith only that is not by the mere feeling of faith for as he says as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also  for what is the sign of a being dead it is its not being able to do anything not being able to work because there is no living and moving spirit in it  and what is the sign of a mans faith being dead his faith not being able to work because there is no living spirit in it but it is a mere dead empty shell and form of wordsa mere notion and thought about believing in a mans head but not a living trust and loyalty to god in his heart  therefore says st james shew me thy faith without thy works if thou canst and i will shew thee my faith by my works as abraham did by offering up isaac his son  oh my friends when people are talking about faith and works and trying to reconcile st paul and st james as they call it because st paul says abraham was justified by faith and st james says abraham was justified by works if they would but pray for the simple childlike heart and the head of common sense and look at their own children who every time they go on a message for them settle without knowing it this mighty difference of mans making between faith and works  you tell a little child daily to do many things the meaning and use of which it cannot understand and the child has faith in what you tell it and therefore it does what you tell it and so it shews its faith in you by obedience in working for you  but to go on with the verses  and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son  that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice  now here remark two things first that it was abrahams obedience in giving up all to god which called forth from god this confirmation of gods promises to him and next that god here promised him nothing new god did not say to him because thou hast obeyed me in this great matter i will give thee some great reward over and above what i promised thee  no god merely promises him over again but more solemnly than ever what he had promised him many years before  and so it will be with us my friends we must not expect to buy gods favour by obeying himwe must not expect that the more we do for god the more god will be bound to do for us as the papists do no god has done for us all that he will do  he has promised us all that he will promise  he has provided us as he provided abraham a lamb for the burntoffering the lamb without blemish and without spot which taketh away the sins of the world  we are his redeemed peoplewe have a share in his promiseshe bids us believe that and shew that we believe it by living as redeemed men not our own but bought with a price and created anew in christ jesus to do good works not that we may buy forgiveness by them but that we may shew by them that we believe that god has forgiven us already and that when we have done all that is commanded us we are still unprofitable servants for though we should give up at gods bidding our children our wives and our own limbs and lives and shew as utter faith in god and complete obedience to god as abraham did we should only have done just what it was already our duty to do    sermon xiv  our father in heaven    1 john ii 13  i write unto you little children because ye have known the father  i preached some time ago a sermon on the whole of these most deep and blessed verses of st john  i now wish to speak to those who are of age to be confirmed three separate sermons on three separate parts of these verses  first to those whom st john calls little children next to those whom he calls grown men  to the first i will speak today to the latter by gods help next sunday  and may the blessed one bring home my weak words to all your hearts  now for the meaning of little children  there are those who will tell you that those words mean merely weak believers babes in grace and so on  they mean that no doubt but they mean much more  they mean first of all be sure what they say  st john would not have said little children if he had not meant little children  surely gods apostle did not throw about his words at random so as to leave them open to mistakes and want some one to step in and tell us that they do not mean their plain commonsense meaning but something else  holy scripture is too wisely written and too awful a matter to be trifled with in that way and cut and squared to suit our own fancies and explained away till its blessed promises are made to mean anything or nothing  no  by little children st john means here children in ageof course christian children and young people for he was writing only to christians  he speaks to those who have been christened and brought up more or less as christened children should be  but no doubt when he says little children he means also all christian people whether they be young or old whose souls are still young and weak and unlearned  all however old they may be who have not been confirmedi do not merely mean confirmed by the bishop but confirmed by gods graceall those who have not yet come to a full knowledge of their own sinsall who have not yet been converted and turned to god with their whole hearts and wills who have not yet made their full choice between god and sinall who have not yet fought for themselves the battle which no man or angel can fight for themi mean the battle between their selfishness and their dutythe battle between their love of pleasure and their fear of sinthe battle in short between the devil and his temptations to darkness and shame and god and his promises of light and strength and gloryall who have not been converted to god to them st john speaks as little childrenpeople who are not yet strong enough to stand alone and do their duty on gods side against sin the world and the devil  and all of you here who have not yet made up your minds who have not yet been confirmed in soulwhether you were confirmed by the bishop or notto you i speak this day  now first of all consider thisthat though st john calls you little children because you are still weak and your souls have not grown to manhood yet he does not speak to you as if you were heathens and knew nothing about god he says i have written unto you little children because ye have known the father  consider that that was his reason for all that he had written to them before that they had known the father the god who made heaven and earththe father of our lord jesus christthe father of little childrenmy father and your father my friends little as we may behave like what we are sons of the almighty god  that was st johns reason for speaking to little children because they had already known the father  so he does not speak to them as if they were heathens and i dare not speak to you young people as if you were heathens however foolish and sinful some of you may be i dare not do it whatever many preachers may do nowadays not because i should be unfair and hard upon you merely but because i should lie and deny the great grace and mercy which god has shewn you and count the blood of the covenant with which you were sprinkled at baptism an unholy thing and do despite to the spirit of grace which has been struggling in your hearts trying to lead you out of sin into good out of light into darkness ever since you were born therefore as st john said i say i preach this day to you young people because you have known your father in heaven  but some of you may say to me you put a great honour on us but we do not see that we have any right to it  you tell us that we have a very noble and awful knowledgethat we know the father  we are afraid that we do not know him we do not even rightly understand of whom or what you preach  well my young friends these are very awful words of st john such blessed and wonderful words that if we did not find them in the bible it would be madness and insolence to god of us to say such a thing not merely of little children but even of the greatest and wisest and holiest man who ever lived but there they are in the biblethe blessed lord himself has told us all when ye pray say our father in heavenand i dare not keep them back because they sound strange  they may sound strange but they are not strange any one who has ever watched a young childs heart and seen how naturally and at once the little innocent takes in the thought of his father which is in heaven knows that it is not a strange thoughtthat it comes to a little child almost by instinctthat his father in heaven seems often to be just the thought which fills his heart most completely has most power over himthe thought which has been lying ready in his heart all the time only waiting for some one to awaken it and put it into words for him that he will do right when you put him in mind of his father above the skies sooner than he will for a hundred punishments  for truly says the poet   heaven lies about us in our infancy not in complete forgetfulness nor yet in utter nakedness but trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home   and yet more truly said the blessed one himself that childrens angels always behold the face of our father which is in heaven and that of such is the kingdom of heaven  yet you say some of you perhaps whatever knowledge of our father in heaven we had or ought to have had when we were young we have lost it now  we have forgotten what we learnt at school  we have been what you would call sinful at all events we have been thinking all our time about a great many things beside religion and they have quite put out of our head the thought that god is our father  so how have we known our father in heaven  well then to answer thatconsider the case of your earthly fathers the men who begot you and brought you up  now there might be one of you who had never seen his father since he was born but all he knows of him is that his name is so and so and that he is such and such a sort of man as the case might be and that he lives in such and such a place far away and that now and then he hears talk of his father or receives letters or presents from him suppose i asked that young man do you know your father would he not answerwould he not have a right to answer yes i know him i never saw him or was acquainted with him but i know him well enough i know who he is and where to find him and what sort of a man he is  that young man might not know his fathers face or love him or care for him at all  he might have been disobedient to his father he might have forgotten for years that he had a father at all and might have lived on his own way just as if he had no father  but when he was put in mind of it all would he not say at once yes i know my father well enough his name is so and so and he lives at such and such a place  i know my father  well my young friends and if this would be true of your fathers on earth it is just as true of your father in heaven  you have never seen himyou may have forgotten himyou may have disobeyed him you may have lived on your own way as if you had no father in heaven still you know that you have a father in heaven  you pray surely sometimes  what do you say  our father which art in heaven  so you have a father in heaven else what right have you to use those wordswhat right have you to say to god our father in heaven if you believe that you have no father there  that would be only blasphemy and mockery  i can well understand that you have often said those words without thinking of themwithout thinking what a blessed glorious soulsaving meaning there was in them but i will not believe that you never once in your whole lives said our father which art in heaven without believing them to be true words  what i want is for you always to believe them to be true  oh young men and young women boys and girlsbelieve those words believe that when you say our father which art in heaven you speak gods truth about yourselves that the evil devil rages when he hears you speak those words because they are the words which prove that you do not belong to him and to hell but to god and the kingdom of heaven  oh believe those wordsbehave as if you believed those words and you shall see what will come of them through all eternity for ever  well but you will ask what has all this to do with confirmation it has all to do with confirmation  because you are gods children and know that you are gods children you are to go and confirm before the bishop your right to be called gods children  you are to go and claim your share in gods kingdom  if you were heir to an estate you would go and claim your estate from those who held it you are heirs to an estateyou are heirs to the kingdom of heaven go to confirmation and claim that kingdom say i am a citizen of gods kingdom  before the bishop and the congregation here i proclaim the honour which god has put upon me  if you have a father you will surely not be ashamed to own him  how much more when the almighty god of heaven is your father  you will not be ashamed to own him  then go to confirmation for by doing so you own god for your father  if you have an earthly father you will not be ashamed to say i know i ought to honour him and obey him how much more when your father is the almighty god of heaven who sent his own son into the world to die for you who is daily heaping you with blessings body and soul  you will not be ashamed to confess that you ought to honour and obey him  then go to confirmation and say i here take upon myself the vow and promise made for me at my baptism  i am gods child and therefore i will honour love and obey him  it is my duty and it shall be my delight henceforward to work for god to do all the good i can to my lifes end because my father in heaven loves the good and has commanded me poor weak countryman though i be to work for him in welldoing  so i say if god is your father go and own him at confirmation  if god is your father go and promise to love and obey him at confirmation and see if he does not like a strong and loving father as he is confirm you in returnsee if he does not give you strength of heart and peace of mind and clear quiet pure thoughts such as a man or woman ought to have who considers that the great god who made the sky and stars above their heads is their father  but perhaps there are some of you young people who do not wish to be confirmed  and why  now look honestly into your own hearts and see the reason  is it not after all because you dont like the trouble  because you are afraid that being confirmed will force you to think seriously and be religious and you had rather not take all that trouble yet  is it not because you do not like to look your ownselves in the face and see how foolishly you have been living and how many bad habits you will have to give up and what a thorough conversion and change you must make if you are to be confirmed in earnest  is not this why you do not wish to be confirmed  and what does that all come to  that though you know you are gods children you do not like to tell people publicly that you are gods children lest they should expect you to behave like gods childrenthat is it  now young men and young women think seriously once for allif you have any common sensei do not say grace left in youthink  are you not playing a fearful game  you would not dare to deny your fathers on earth to refuse to obey them because you know well enough that they would punish youthat if you were too old for punishment your neighbours at least would despise you for mean ungrateful and rebellious children  but because you cannot see god your father because you have not some sign or wonder hanging in the sky to frighten you into good behaviour therefore you are not afraid to turn your backs on him  my friends it is ill mocking the living god  mark my words  if a man will not turn he will whet his sword and make us feel it  you who can be confirmed and know in your hearts that you ought to be confirmed and ought to be really converted and confirmed in soul and make no mockery of itmark my words  if you will not be converted and confirmed of your own good will god if he has any love left for you will convert and confirm you against your will  he will let you go your own ways till you find out your own folly  he will bring you low with affliction perhaps with sickness with illluck with shame  some way or other he will chastise you again and again till you are forced to come back to him and take his service on you  if he loves you he will drive you home to your fathers house  you may laugh at my words now see if you laugh at them when your hairs are grey  oh young people if you wish in afterlife to save yourselves shame and sorrow and perhaps in the world to come eternal death come to confirmation acknowledge god for your father promise to come and serve him faithfully make those blessed words of the lords prayer our father in heaven your glory and your honour your guide and guard through life your titledeeds to heaven  you who know that the great god is your father will you be ashamed to own yourselves his sons    sermon xv  the transfiguration    mark ix 2  jesus taketh peter and james and john and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them  the second lesson for this morning service brings us to one of the most wonderful passages in our blessed saviours whole stay on earth namely his transfiguration  the story as told by the different evangelists is thisthat our lord took peter and john and james his brother and led them up into a high mountain apart which mountain may be seen to this very day  it is a high peaked hill standing apart from all the hills around it with a small smooth space of ground upon the top very fit from its height and its loneliness for a transaction like the transfiguration which our lord wished no one but these three to behold  there the apostles fell asleep while our blessed lord who had deeper thoughts in his heart than they had knelt down and prayed to his father and our father which is in heaven  and as he prayed the form of his countenance was changed and his raiment became shining white as the light and there appeared moses and elijah talking with him  they talked of matters which the angels desire to look into of the greatest matters that ever happened in this earth since it was made of the redemption of the world and of the death which christ was to undergo at jerusalem  and as they were talking the apostles awoke and found into what glorious company they had fallen while they slept  what they felt no mortal man can tellthat moment was worth to them all the years they had lived before  when they had gone up with jesus into the mount he was but the poor carpenters son wonderful enough to them no doubt with his wise searching words and his gentle loving looks that drew to him all men who had hearts left in them and wonderful enough too from all the mighty miracles which they had seen him do but still he was merely a man like themselves poor and young and homeless who felt the heat and the cold and the rough roads as much as they did  they could feel that he spake as never man spakethey could see that gods spirit and power was on him as it had never been on any man in their time  god had even enlightened their reason by his spirit to know that he was the christ the son of the living god but still it does seem they did not fully understand who and what he was they could not understand how the son of god should come in the form of a despised and humble man they did not understand that his glory was to be a spiritual glory  they expected his kingdom to be a kingdom of this worldthey expected his glory to consist in palaces and armies and riches and jewels and all the magnificence with which solomon and the old jewish kings were adorned they thought that he was to conquer back again from the roman emperor all the inestimable treasures of which the romans had robbed the jews and that he was to make the jewish nation like the roman the conquerors and masters of all the nations of the earth so that it was a puzzling thing to their minds why he should be king of the jews at the very time that he was but a poor tradesmans son living on charity  it was to shew them that his kingdom was the kingdom of heaven that he was transfigured before them  they saw his glorythe glory as of the onlybegotten of the father full of grace and truth  the form of his countenance was changed all the majesty and courage and wisdom and love and resignation and pity that lay in his noble heart shone out through his face while he spoke of his death which he should accomplish at jerusalem the holy ghost that was upon him the spirit of wisdom and love and beautythe spirit which produces every thing that is lovely in heaven and earth  in soul and body blazed out through his eyes and all his glorious countenance and made him look like what he wasa god  my friends what a sight  would it not be worth while to journey thousands of milesto go through all difficulties dangers that man ever heard of for one sight of that glorious face that we might fall down upon our knees before it and if it were but for a moment give way to the delight of finding something that we could utterly love and utterly adore  i say the delight of finding something to worship for if there is a noble if there is a holy if there is a spiritual feeling in man it is the feeling which bows him down before those who are greater and wiser and holier than himself  i say that feeling of respect for what is noble is a heavenly feeling  the man who has lost itthe man who feels no respect for those who are above him in age above him in knowledge above him in wisdom above him in goodnessthat man shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven  it is only the man who is like a little child and feels the delight of having some one to look up to who will ever feel delight in looking up to jesus christ who is the lord of lords and king of kings  it was the want of respect it was the dislike of feeling any one superior to himself which made the devil rebel against god and fall from heaven  it will be the feeling of complete respectthe feeling of kneeling at the feet of one who is immeasurably superior to ourselves in every thing that will make up the greatest happiness of heaven  this is a hard saying and no man can understand it save he to whom it is given by the spirit of god  that the apostles had this feeling of immeasurable respect for christ there is no doubt else they would never have been apostles but they felt more than this  there were other wonders in that glorious vision besides the countenance of our lord  his raiment too was changed and became all brilliant white as the light itself  was not that a lesson to them  was it not as if our lord had said to them i am a king and have put on glorious apparel but whence does the glory of my raiment come  i have no need of fine linen and purple and embroidery the work of mens hands i have no need to send my subjects to mines and caves to dig gold and jewels to adorn my crown  the earth is mine and the fulness thereof  all this glorious earth with its trees and its flowers its sunbeams and its storms is mine  i made iti can do what i will with it  all the mysterious laws by which the light and the heat flow out for ever from gods throne to lighten the sun and the moon and the stars of heaventhey are mine  i am the light of the worldthe light of mens bodies as well of their souls and here is my proof of it  look at me  i am he that decketh himself with light as it were with a garment who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters and walketh upon the wings of the wind this was the message which christs glory brought the apostlesa message which they could never forget  the spiritual glory of his countenance had shewn them that he was a spiritual kingthat his strength lay in the spirit of power and wisdom and beauty and love which god had given him without measure and it shewed them too that there was such a thing as a spiritual body such a body as each of us some day shall have if we be found in christ at the resurrection of the justa body which shall not hide a mans spirit when it becomes subject to the wear and tear of life and disease and decay but a spiritual bodya body which shall be filled with our spirits which shall be perfectly obedient to our spiritsa body through which the glory of our spirits shall shine out as the glory of christs spirit shone out through his body at the transfiguration  brethren we know not yet what we shall be but this we do know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is 1 john iii 3  thus our lord taught them by his appearance that there is such a thing as a spiritual body while by the glory of his raiment in addition to his other miracles he taught them that he had power over the laws of nature and could in his own good time change the bodies of their humiliation that they might be made like unto his glorious body according to the mighty working by which he is able to subdue all things to himself  but there was yet another lesson which the apostles learnt from the transfiguration of our lord  they beheld moses and elijah talking with himmoses the great lawgiver of their nation elijah the chief of all the jewish prophets  we must consider this a little to find out the whole depth of its meaning  you remember how christ had spoken of himself as having come not to destroy the law and the prophets but to fulfil them  you remember too how he had always said that he was the person of whom the law and the prophets had spoken  here was an actual sign and witness that his words were truehere was moses the giver of the law and elijah the chief of the prophets talking with him bearing witness to him in their own persons and shewing too that it was his death and his perfect sacrifice that they had been shadowing forth in the sacrifices of the law and in the dark speeches of prophecy  for they talked with him of his death which he was to accomplish at jerusalem  what more perfect testimony could the apostles have had to shew them that jesus of nazareth their master was he of whom the law and the prophets spokethat he was indeed the christ for whom moses and elijah and all the saints of old had looked and that he was come not to destroy the law and the prophets but to fulfil them  we can hardly understand the awe and the delight with which the disciples must have beheld those blessed threemoses and elias and jesus christ their lord talking together before their very eyes  for of all men in the world moses and elias were to them the greatest all truehearted israelites who knew the history of their nation and understood the promises of god must have felt that moses and elias were the two greatest heroes and saviours of their nation whom god had ever yet raised up  and the joy and the honour of thus seeing them face to face the very men whom they had loved and reverenced in their thoughts whom they had heard and read of from their childhood as the greatest ornaments and glories of their nationthe joy and the honour i say of that unexpected sight added to the wonderful majesty which was suddenly revealed to their transfigured lord seemed to have been too much for themthey knew not what to say  such company seemed to them for the moment heaven enough and st peter first finding words exclaimed lord it is good for us to be here  if thou wilt let us build three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias not i fancy that they intended to worship moses and elias but that they felt that moses and elias as well as christ had each a divine message which must be listened to and therefore they wished that each of them might have his own tabernacle and dwell among men and each teach his own particular doctrine and wisdom in his own school  it may seem strange that they should put moses and elias so on an equality with christ but the truth was that as yet they understood moses and elias better than they did christ  they had heard and read of moses and elijah all their livesthey were acquainted with all their actions and wordsthey knew thoroughly what great and noble men the spirit of god had made them but they did not understand christ in like manner  they did not yet feel that god had given him the spirit without measurethey did not understand that he was not only to be a lawgiver and a prophet but a sacrifice for sin the conqueror of death and hell who was to lead captivity captive and receive inestimable gifts for men  much less did they think that moses and elijah were but his servants that all their spirit and their power had been given by him  but this also they were taught a moment afterwards for a bright cloud overshadowed them hiding from them the glory of god the father whom no man hath seen or can see who dwells in the light which no man can approach unto and out of that cloud a voice saying this is my beloved son hear ye him and then hiding their faces in fear and wonder they fell to the ground and when they looked up the vision and the voice had alike passed away and they saw no man but christ alone  was not that enough for them  must not the meaning of the vision have been plain to them  they surely understood from it that moses and elijah were as they had ever believed them to be great and good true messengers of the living god but that their message and their work was donethat christ whom they had looked for was comethat all the types of the law were realised and all the prophecies fulfilled and that henceforward christ and christ alone was to be their prophet and their lawgiver  was not this plainly the meaning of the divine voice  for when they wished to build three tabernacles and to honour moses and elijah the law and the prophets as separate from christthat moment the heavenly voice warned them  thisthis is my beloved sonhear ye him and him only henceforward  and moses and elijah their work being done forthwith vanished away leaving christ alone to fulfil the law and the prophets and all other wisdom and righteousness that ever was or shall be  this is another lesson which christs transfiguration was meant to teach and us that christ alone is to be henceforward our guide that no philosophies or doctrines of any sort which are not founded on a true faith in jesus christ and his life and death are worth listening to that god has manifested forth his beloved son and that him and him only we are to hear  i do not mean to say that christ came into the world to put down human learning  i do not mean that we are to despise human learning as so many are apt to do nowadays for christ came into the world not to destroy human learning but to fulfil itto sanctify itto make human learning true and strong and useful by giving it a sure foundation to stand upon which is the belief and knowledge of his blessed self just as christ came not to destroy the law and the prophets but to fulfil themto give them a spirit and a depth in mens eyes which they never had beforejust so he came to fulfil all true philosophies all the deep thoughts which men had ever thought about this wonderful world and their own souls by giving them a spirit and a depth which they never had before  therefore let no man tempt you to despise learning for it is holy to the lord  there is one more lesson which we may learn from our lords transfiguration when st peter said lord it is good for us to be here he spoke a truth  it was good for him to be there nevertheless christ did not listen to his prayer  he and his two companions were not allowed to stay in that glorious company  and why  because they had a work to do  they had glad tidings of great joy to proclaim to every creature and it was after all but a selfish prayer to wish to be allowed to stay in ease and glory on the mount while the whole world was struggling in sin and wickedness below them  for there is no meaning in a mans calling himself a christian or saying that he loves god unless he is ready to hate what god hates and to fight against that which christ fought against that is sin  no one has any right to call himself a servant of god who is not trying to do away with some of the evil in the world around him  and therefore christ was merciful when instead of listening to st peters prayer he led the apostles down again from the mount and sent them forth as he did afterwards to preach the gospel of the kingdom to all nations  for christ put a higher honour on st peter by that than if he had let him stay on the mount all his life to behold his glory and worship and adore and he made st peter more like himself by doing so  for what was christs life  not one of deep speculations quiet thoughts and bright visions such as st peter wished to lead but a life of fighting against evil earnest awful prayers and struggles within continual labour of body and mind without insult and danger and confusion and violent exertion and bitter sorrow  this was christs lifethis is the life of almost every good man i ever heard ofthis was st peter and st james and st johns life afterwards  this was christs cup which they were to drink of as well as hethis was the baptism of fire with which they were to be baptised of as well as hethis was to be their fight of faith this was the tribulation through which they like all other great saints were to enter into the kingdom of heaven for it is certain that the harder a man fights against evil the harder evil will fight against him in return  but it is certain too that the harder a man fights against evil the more he is like his saviour christ and the more glorious will be his reward in heaven  it is certain too that what was good for st peter is good for us  it is good for a man to have holy and quiet thoughts and at moments to see into the very deepest meaning of gods word and gods earth and to have as it were heaven opened before his eyes and it is good for a man sometimes actually to feel his heart overpowered with the glorious majesty of god and to feel it gushing out with love to his blessed saviour  but it is not good for him to stop there any more than it was for the apostles they had to leave that glorious vision and come down from the mount and do christs work and so have we for believe me one word of warning spoken to keep a little child out of sinone crust of bread given to a beggarman because he is your brother for whom christ diedone angry word checked when it is on your lips for the sake of him who was meek and lowly in heart in short any the smallest endeavour of this kind to lessen the quantity of evil which is in yourselves and in those around you is worth all the speculations and raptures and visions and frames and feelings in the world for those are the good fruits of faith whereby alone the tree shall be known whether it be good or evil    sermon xvi  the crucifixion    isaiah liii 7  he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter  on this day my friends was offered up upon the cross the lamb of godslain in eternity and heaven before the foundation of the world but slain in time and space upon this day  all the old sacrifices the lambs which were daily offered up to god in the jewish temple the lambs which abel and after him the patriarchs offered up the paschal lamb slain at the passover our eastertide all these were but figures of christtokens of the awful and yet loving law of god that without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin  but the blood of dumb animals could not take away sin  all mankind had sinned and it was therefore necessary that all mankind should suffer  therefore he suffered the new adam the man of all men in whom all mankind were as it were collected into one and put on a new footing with god that henceforward to be a man might mean to be a holy being a forgiven being a being joined to god wearing the likeness of the son of godthe human soul and body in which he offered up all human souls and bodies on the cross  for man was originally made in christs likeness he was the word of god who walked in the garden of eden who spoke to adam with a human voice he was the lord who appeared to the patriarchs in a mans figure and ate and drank in abrahams tent and spoke to him with a human voice he was the god of israel whom the jewish elders saw with their bodily eyes upon mount sinai and under his feet a pavement as of a sapphire stone  from him all mans powers came mans speech mans understanding  all that is truly noble in man was a dim pattern of him in whose likeness man was originally made and when man had fallen and sinned and christs image was fading more and more out of him and the likeness of the brutes growing more and more in him year by year then came christ the head and the original pattern of all men to claim them for his own again to do in their name what they could never do for themselves to offer himself up a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world  so that he is the real sacrifice the real lamb as st john said when he pointed him out to his disciples behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world  oh think of that strong and patient lamb who on this day shewed himself perfect in fortitude and nobleness perfect in meekness and resignation  think of him who in his utter love to us endured the cross despising the shame  and what a cross  truly said the prophet his visage was marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men in hunger and thirst in tears and sighs bruised and bleeding his forehead crowned with thorns his sides torn with scourges his hands and feet gored with nails his limbs stretched from their sockets naked upon the shameful cross the son of god hung lingering slowly towards the last gasp in the death of the felon and the slave  the most shameful sight that this earth ever saw and yet the most glorious sight  the most shameful sight at which the sun in heaven veiled his face as if ashamed and the skies grew black as if to hide those bleeding limbs from the foul eyes of men and yet the noblest sight for in that death upon the cross shone out the utter fullness of all holiness the utter fullness of all fortitude the utter fullness of that self sacrificing love which had said the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost the utter fullness of obedient patience which could say father not my will but thine be done the utter fullness of generous forgiveness which could pray father forgive them for they know not what they do the utter fullness of noble fortitude and endurance which could say at the very moment when a fearful death stared him in the face thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to the father and he will send me at once more than twelve armies of angels  but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be  oh my friends look to him the author and perfecter of all faith all trust all loyal daring for the sake of duty and of god  look at his patience  see how he endured the cross despising the shame see how he enduredhow patience had her perfect work in himhow in all things he was more than conqueror  what gentleness what calmness what silence what infinite depths of divine love within him  a heart which neither shame nor torture nor insult could stir from its godlike resolution  when looking down from that cross he beheld none almost but enemies heard no word but mockery when those who passed by reviled him wagging their heads and saying he saved others himself he cannot save his only answer was a prayer for forgiveness for that besotted mob who were yelling beneath him like hounds about their game  consider him and then consider ourselves ruffled and put out of temper by the slightest cross accident the slightest harsh word too often by the slightest pain not to mention insults for we pride ourselves in not bearing them try my friends if you can even in the dimmest way fancy yourselves for one instant in his place this day 1815 years  fancy yourselves hanging on that crossfancy that mocking mob below fancybut i dare not go on with the picture  only thinkthink what would have been your temper there and then you may get some slight notion of the boundless love and the boundless endurance of the saviour whom we love so little for whose sake most of us will not endure the trouble of giving up a single sin  and then consider that it was all of his own free will that at any moment even while he was hanging upon the cross he might have called to earth and sun to heaven and to hell stop thus far but no further and they would have obeyed him and all that cross and agony and the fierce faces of those furious jews would have vanished away like a hideous dream when one awakes  for they lied in their mockery  any moment he might have been free triumphant again in his eternal bliss but he would not  he himself kept himself on that cross till his fathers will was fulfilled and the sacrifice was finished and we were saved  and then at last when there was no more human nobleness no more agony left for him to fulfil no gem in the crown of holiness which he had not won as his own no drop in the cup of misery which he had not drained as his own when at last he was made perfect through suffering and his strength had been made perfect in weakness then he bowed that bleeding thorncrowned head and said it is finished  father into thy hands i commend my spirit  and so he died  how can our poor words our poor deeds thank him  how mean and paltry our deepest gratitude our highest loyalty when compared with him to whom it is duethat adorable victim that perfect sin offering who this day offered up himself upon the altar of the cross in the fire of his own boundless zeal for the kingdom of god his father and of his boundless love for us his sinful brothers oh thou blessed jesus  saviour agonising for us  god almighty who did make thyself weak for the love of us oh write that love upon our hearts so deeply that neither pleasure nor sorrow life nor death may wipe it away  thou hast sacrificed thyself for us oh give us the hearts to sacrifice ourselves for thee  thou art the vine we are the branches  let thy priceless blood shed for us on this day flow like lifegiving sap through all our hearts and minds and fill us with thy righteousness that we may be sacrifices fit for thee  stir us up to offer to thee o lord our bodies our souls our spirits in all we love and all we learn in all we plan and all we do to offer our labours our pleasures our sorrows to thee to work for thy kingdom through them to live as those who are not their own but bought with thy blood fed with thy body and enable us now in thy most holy sacrament to offer to thee our repentance our faith our prayers our praises living reasonable and spiritual sacrificesthine from our birthhour thine now and thine for ever    sermon xvii  the resurrection    luke xxiv 6  he is not herehe is risen  we are assembled here today my friends to celebrate the joyful memory of our blessed saviours resurrection  all friday night saturday and saturday night his body lay in the grave his soul waswhere we cannot tell  st peter tells us that he went and preached to the spirits in prisonthe sinners of the old world who are kept in the place of departed soulsmost likely in the depths of the earth in the great firekingdom which boils and flames miles below our feet and breaks out here and there through the earths solid crust in burning mountains and streams of fire  there some sayand the bible seems to saysinful souls are kept in chains until the judgmentday and thither they say christ went to preachno doubt to save some of those sinful souls who had never heard of him  however this may be for those two nights and day there was no sign no stir in the grave where christ was laid  his body seemed deadthe stone lay still over the mouth of the tomb where joseph and nicodemus laid him the seal which pilate had put on it was unbroken the soldiers watched and watched but no one stirred the priests and pharisees were keeping their sham passover thinking no doubt that they were well rid of christ and of his rebukes for ever  but early on the sunday mornthis day as it might bein the grey dawn of morning there came a changea wondrous change  there was a great earthquake the solid ground and rocks were stirredthe angel of the lord came down from heaven and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it waiting for the king of glory to arise from his slumber and go forth the conqueror of death  his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him those fierce hard soldiers who feared neither god nor man shook and became as dead men  and christ arose and went forth  how he rosehow he looked when he arose no man can tell for no man saw  only before the sun was risen came mary magdalene and the other mary and found the stone rolled away and saw the angels sitting clothed in white who said fear not for i know that ye seek jesus who was crucified  he is not here for he is risen  come see the place where the lord lay  what must they have thought poor faithful souls who came lonely and brokenhearted to see the place where he their only hope was as they thought shut up and lost for ever to hear that he was risen and gone  half terrified half delighted they went back with other women who had come on the same errand with spices to anoint the blessed body and told the apostles  peter and john ran to the sepulchre and saw the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his blessed head wrapped together by itself  they then believed  then first broke on them the meaning of his old saying that he must rise from the dead and so wondering and doubting what to do they went back home  but maryfaithful humble marystood without by the sepulchre weeping  the angels called to her woman why weepest thou they have taken away my lord said she and i know not where they have laid him  then in a moment out of the air he appeared behind her  his body had been changed it was now a glorified spiritual body which could appear and disappear when and how he liked  she turned back and saw him standing but she knew him not  a wondrous change had come over him since last she saw him hanging bleeding pale and dying on the cross of shame  woman said he why weepest thou she fancying it was the gardener said to him sir if thou hast borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away  jesus said to her mary  at the sound of that beloved voicehis own voicecalling by her name her recollection came back to her  she knew himknew him for her risen lord and falling at his feet cried out my master  so jesus christ the son of god rose from the dead  now come the questions why did christ rise from the deadand how did he rise  and first i will say a few words about how he rose from the dead  and this the bible will answer for us as it will every thing else about the spiritworld  christ says the bible was put to death in the flesh but quickened that is brought to life by the spirit  now what is the spirit but the lord and giver of lifelife of all sortslife to the soullife to the body life to the trees and plants around us  with that spirit christ is filled infinitely without measure it is his spirit  he is the prince of life and the spirit which gives life is his spirit proceeding from the father and the son  therefore the gates of hell could not prevail against himtherefore the heavy gravestone could not hold him downtherefore his flesh could not see corruption and decay as other bodies do not because his body was different from other bodies in its substance but because he was filled body and soul with the great spirit of life  for this is the great business of the spirit of god in all nature to bring life out of deathnew generations out of old  what says david  when thou o god turnest away thy face things die and return again to the dust when thou lettest thy breath which is the same as thy spirit go forth they are made and thou renewest the face of the earth  this is the way that seeds instead of rotting and perishing spring up and become new plantsgod breathes his spirit on them  the seeds must have heat and damp and darkness and electricity before they can sprout but the heat and damp and darkness do not make them sprout they want something more to do that  a philosopher can find out exactly what a seed is made of and he might make a seed of the proper materials and put it in the ground and electrify itbut would it grow  not it  to grow it must have lifelife from the fountain of lifefrom gods spirit  all the philosophers in the world have never yet been able among all the things which they have made to make a single living thingand say they never shall because put together all they will still one thing is wanting life which god alone can give  why do i say this  to shew you what gods spirit is to put you in mind that it is near you above you and beneath you about your path in your daily walk  and also to explain to you how christ rose by that spirithow your bodies if you claim your share in christs spirit may rise by it too  you can see now how christ being filled with gods spirit rose of himself  people had risen from the dead before christs time but they had been either raised in answer to the prayers of holy men who had gods spirit or at some peculiar time when heaven was opened and god chose to alter his laws as we call it for a moment  but here was a man who rose of himself  he was raised by god and therefore he raised himself for he was god  you all know what life and power a mans own spirit will often give him  you may have heard of spirited men in great danger or spirited soldiers in battle when faint wounded having suffered enough apparently to kill them twice over still struggling or fighting on and doing the most desperate deeds to the last from the strength and courage of their spirits conquering pain and weakness and keeping off for a time death itself  we all know how madmen diseased in their spirits will when the fit is on them have for a few minutes ten mens strength  well just think if a mans own spirit when it is powerful can give his body such life and force what must it have been with christ who was filled full of the spiritgods spirit the lord and giver of life the lord could not help rising  all the disease and poison and rottenness in the world could not have made his body decay mountains on mountains could not have kept it down  his bodythe prince of lifehe that was the life itself  it was impossible that death could hold him  and does not this shew us why he rose that we might rise with him what did he say about his own death  except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit  he was the grain which fell into the ground and died and from his dead body sprung up another bodyhis glorified body and we his church his people fed with that bodyhis members however strange it may soundst paul said it and therefore i dare to say it little as i know what it meansmembers of his flesh and of his bones  but think  remember what st paul tells you about this very matter in that glorious chapter which is read in the burialservice how when thou sowest seed thou sowest not that body which it will have but bare grain but god gives it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed its own body  for the wheatplant is in reality the same thing as the wheatseed and its life the same life different as the outside of it may look  dig it up just at this time of year and you will find the seedcorn all gone sucked dry the life of the wheatseed has formed it into a wheatplantyet it is the same individual thing  the substance of the seed has gone into the root and the young blade but it is the same individual substance  you know it is and though you cannot tell why yet you say what a fine plant that seed has grown into because you feel it is so that the seed is the very same thing as the plant which springs up from it though its shape is changed and its size and its colour and the very stuff of which it was made is changed since it was a mere seed  and yet it is at bottom the same individual thing as the seed was with a new body and shape  so with christs body  it was changed after he rose  it had gone through pain and weakness and death gone down to the lowest depth of them and conquered them and passed triumphant through them and far beyond their power  his body was now a nobler a more beautiful a glorified body a spiritual body one which could do whatever his spirit chose to make it do one which could never die again one which could come through closed doors appear and vanish as he liked instead of being bound to walk the earth and stand cold and heat sickness and weariness  yet it was the very same body just as the wheatplant is the same as the wheatseedthe very same body  every one knew his face again after his resurrection  there was the very print of the nails to be seen in his hands and feet the spearwound in his blessed side  so shall it be with us my friends  we shall rise again and we shall be the same as we are now and yet not the same our bodies shall be the same bodies and yet nobler purer spiritual bodies which can know neither death nor pain nor weariness  then never care my friends if we drop like ripe grain into the bosom of mother earthif we are to spring up again as seedling plants after deaths long winter on the resurrection morn  truly says the poet 2 how      mother earth she gathers all into her bosom great and small oh could we look into her face we should not shrink from her embrace   no indeed for if we look steadily with the wise searching eye of faith into the face of mother earth we shall see how death is but the gate of life and this narrow churchyard with its corpses closepacked underneath the sod would not seem to us a frightful charnelhouse of corruption  no it would seem like what it isa blessed quiet seedfilled gods garden in which our forefathers after their longlife labour lay sown by gods friendly hand waiting peaceful one and all to spring up into leaf and flower and everlasting paradisefruit beneath the breath of gods spirit at the last great day when the sun of righteousness arises in glory and the summer begins which shall never end  one and all did i say  alas would god it were so  we cannot hope as for all but they are dead and gone and we are not here to judge the dead  they have another judge and all shall be as he wills  but wewe in whose limbs the breath of life still boilswe who can still work let us never forget all grain ripens not  there is some falls out of the ear unripe and perishes some is picked out by birds some withers and decays in the ear and yet gets into the barn with it and is sown too with the wheat of which i never heard that any sprang up againploughed up again it may bea withered dead husk of chaff as it died ploughed up to the resurrection of damnation to burn as chaff in unquenchable fire but the good seed alone ripe and safe with the wheatplant till it is ripe that only will spring up to the resurrection of eternal life  now consider again that parable of the wheatplant  after it has sprung up what does it next but tillerand every new shoot that tillers out bears its own ear ripens its own grain twenty thirty or forty stems and yet they are all the same plant living with the life of that one original seed  so with christs churchhis body the church  as soon as he rose that new plant began to tiller  he did not keep his spirit to himself but poured it out on the apostles and from them it spread and spreadeach generation of christians ripening and bearing fruit and dying a fresh generation of fruit springing up from them and so on as we are now at this day  and yet all these plants these millions and millions of christian men and women who have lived since christs blessed resurrection all are parts of that one original seed the body of christ whose members they are and all owe their life to that one spirit of christ which is in them all and through them all as the life of the original grain is in the whole crop which springs from it  and what can you learn from this  learn this that in christ you are safe out of christ you are lost  but really in christ i mean not like the dead and dying grains mildewed and wormeaten which you find here and there on the finest wheatplant  their end is to be burned and so will ours be for all our springing out of christs root if the angel reapers find us not good wheat but chaff and mildew  every branch in christ which beareth not fruit his heavenly father taketh away  therefore never pride yourself on having been baptised into christ never pride yourself on shewing some signs of gods spirit on being really good right in this and right in thatthe question is not so much are you in christ at all are you part of his tree a member of his body but are you ripening there  if you are not ripening you are decaying and your end will be as god has said  and do you wish to know whether you are in christ safe ripening see whether you are like him  if the young grain does not shew like the seed grain you may be sure it is making no progress and as surely as a wheatplant never brought forth rye or a grapetree thistles so surely if you are not like christ in your character in patience in meekness in courage truth purity piety and love you may be of his planting but you are none of his ripening and you will not be raised with him at the last day to flower anew in the gardens of paradise world without end    sermon xviii  improvement    psalm xcii 12  the righteous shall flourish like the palmtree  he shall grow like the cedar in lebanon  those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god  they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing  the bible is always telling christian people to go forwardsto growto become wiser and stronger better and better day by day that they ought to become better and better because they can if they choose improve  this text tells us so it says that we shall bring forth more fruit in our old age  another text tells us that those who wait on the lord shall renew their strength another tells us that we shall go from strength to strength  not one of st pauls epistles but talks of growing in grace and in the knowledge of god of being filled with gods spirit of having our eyes more and more open to understand gods truth  not one of st pauls epistles but contains prayers of st paul that the men to whom he writes may become holier and wiser  and st paul says that he himself needed to go forwardthat he wanted fresh strengththat he had to forget what was past and consider all he had done and felt as nothing and press forward to the prize of his high calling that he needed to be daily conquering himself more and more keeping down his bad feelings hunting out one bad habit after another lest by any means when he had preached to others he himself should become a castaway  therefore i said rightly that the bible is always bidding us go forwards  you cannot read your bibles without seeing this  what else was the use of st pauls epistles they were written to christian men redeemed men converted men most of them better i fear than ever we shall be and for what to tell them not be content to remain as they were to tell them to go forwards to improve to be sure that they were only just inside the gate of gods kingdom and that if they would go on to perfection they would find strength and holiness and blessing and honour and happiness which they as yet did not dream of  be ye perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect said our blessed lord to all men  be ye perfect says st paul to the corinthians and the ephesians and all to whom he wrote and so say i to you now in gods name for christs sake as citizens of gods kingdom as heirs of everlasting glory be you perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect  now i ask you my friends is not this reasonable  it is reasonable for the bible always speaks of our souls as living things  it compares them to limbs of a body to branches of a tree often to separate plantsas in our lords parable of the tares and the wheat  again st paul tells us that we have been planted in baptism in the likeness of christs death and again in the first psalm which says that the good man shall be like a tree planted by the waterside and again in the text of my sermon which says that those who are planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god  they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing  now what does all this mean  it means that the life of our souls is in some respects like the life of a plant and therefore that as plants grow so our souls are to grow  why do you plant anything but in order that it may grow and become larger stronger bear flower and fruit  be sure god has planted us in his garden christs church for no other reason  consider againwhat is life but a continual growing or a continual decaying  if a tree does not get larger and stronger year by year is not that a sure sign that it is unhealthy and that decay has begun in it that it is unsound at heart  and what happens then  it begins to become weaker and smaller and cankered and choked with scurf and moss till it dies  if a tree is not growing it is sure in the long run to be dying and so are our souls  if they are not growing they are dying if they are not getting better they are getting worse  this is why the bible compares our souls to treesnot out of a mere pretty fancy of poetry but for a great awful deep worldwide lesson that every tree in the fields may be a pattern a warning to us thoughtless men that as that tree is meant to grow so our souls are meant to grow  as that tree dies unless it grows so our souls must die unless they grow  consider that  but how does a tree grow  how are our souls to grow  now here again we shall understand heavenly things best by taking and considering the pattern from among earthly things which the bible gives usthe tree i mean  a tree grows in two ways  its roots take up food from the ground its leaves take up food from the air its roots are its mouth we may say and its leaves are its lungs thus the tree draws nourishment from the earth beneath and from the heaven above and so must our souls my friends if they are to live and grow they must have food both from earth and from heaven  and this is what i meanwhy has god given us senses eyes and ears and understanding  that by them we may feed our souls with things which we see and hear things which are going on in the world round us  we must read and we must listen and we must watch people and their sayings and doings and what becomes of them and we must try and act and practise what is right for ourselves and so we shall by using our eyes and ears and our bodies get practice and experience and knowledge from the world round ussuch as solomon gives us in his proverbsand so our eyes and ears and understandings are to be to us like roots by which we may feed our souls with earthly learning and experience  but is this enough no surely  consider again gods example which he has given usa tree  if you keep stripping all the leaves off a tree as fast as they grow what becomes of it  it dies because without leaves it cannot get nourishment from the air and the rain and the sunlight again if you shut up a tree where it can get neither rain air nor light what happens the tree certainly dies though it may be planted in the very richest soil and have the very strongest roots and why because it can get no food from the sky above  so with our souls my friends  if we get no food from above our souls will die though we have all the wit and learning and experience in the world  we must be fed and strengthened and satisfied with the grace of god from abovewith the spirit of god  consider how the bible speaks of gods spirit as the breath of god for the very word spirit means originally breath or air or gas or a breeze of wind shewing us that as without the airs of heaven the tree would become stunted and cankered so our souls will without the fresh purifying breath of gods spirit  again gods spirit is often spoken of in scripture as dew and rain  his grace or favour we read is as dew on the grass and again that god shall come unto us as the rain as the first and latter rain upon the earth and again speaking of the outpourings of gods spirit on his church the psalmist says that he shall come down as the rain upon the mown grass as showers that water the earth and to shew us that as the tree puts forth buds and leaves and tender wood when it drinks in the dew and rains so our hearts will become tender and bud out into good thoughts and wise resolves when gods spirit fills them with his grace  but again the scripture tells us again and again that our souls want light from above and we all know by experience that the trees and plants which grow on earth want the light of the sun to make them grow  so doubtless here again the scripture example of a tree will hold good  now what does the sunlight do for the tree it does every thing for without light the soil and air and rain are all useless  it stirs up the sap it hardens the wood it brings out the blossom it colours the leaves and the flowers it ripens the fruit  the light is the life of the treeand is there not one my friends of whom these words are writtenthat he is the life and that he is the lightthat he is the sun of righteousness and the bright and morning starthat he is the light which lighteth every man that cometh into the worldthat in him was life and the life was the light of men  do you not know of whom i speak  even of him that was born at bethlehem and died on the cross who now sits at gods right hand praying for us offering to us his body and his bloodjesus the son of god he is the light and the life from him alone our light must come from him alone our life must come now and for ever  oh think seriously of thisand think too how a short time before he died on earth he spoke of himself as the bread of lifethe living bread which comes down from heaven how he declared to men that unless they eat his flesh and drink his blood they have no life in them  and lastly consider this how the same night that he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me  and how likewise he took the cup and when he had blessed it he gave it to them saying drink ye all of this for this is the new covenant in my blood which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins this do as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me  oh consider these words my friendsto you all and every one they were spoken  drink ye all of this said the blessed one and will you refuse to drink it  he offers you the bread of life the sign and the pledge of his body which shall feed your souls with everlasting strength and life and will you refuse what the son of god offers you what he bought for you with his death  god forbid my friends this is your blessed right and privilegethe right and the privilege of every one of youto come freely and boldly to that holy table and there to remember your saviour  at that table to confess your saviour before menat that table to shew that you really believe that jesus christ died for youat that table to claim your share in the strength of his body in the pardon of his blood which cleanses from all sinand at that table to receive what you claim to receive at that table the wine as a sign from christ himself that his blood has washed away your sins and the bread as a sign that his body and his spirit are really feeding your spirits that your souls are strengthened and refreshed by the body and blood of christ as your bodies are with the bread and wine

when the son of god himself invites you you would not come to him that you might have life    sermon xix  mans working day    john xi 9 10  jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day  if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world  but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him  this was our blessed lords answer to his disciples when they said to him master the jews of late tried to stone thee and goest thou among them again  and jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day  if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world  but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him  now at first sight one does not see what this has to do with the disciples questionit seems no answer at all to it  but we must remember who it was who gave that answer  the son of god from whom all words come who came to do good and only good every minute of his life  and therefore we may be sure that he never threw away a single word  and we must remember too to whom he spoketo his disciples whom he was training to be apostles to the whole world teaching them in every thing some deep lesson to fit them for their glorious calling as preachers of the good news of his coming  so we may be sure that he would never put off any question of theirs we may be certain that whatever they asked him he would give them the best possible answer not perhaps just the answer for which they wished but the answer which would teach them most  therefore i say we must believe that there is some deep wonderful lesson in this textthat it is the very best and fullest answer which our lord could have made to his disciples when they asked him why he was going again to judea where he stood in danger of his life  let us think a little about this text in faith that is sure that there is a deep blessed meaning in it if we can but find it out let us take it piece by piece we shall never get to the bottom of it of course but we may get deep enough into it to set us thinking a little between now and next sunday  are there not twelve hours in the day said our lord  we know there are and we know too that if any man walks in the day and keeps his eyes open he does not stumble because he has the light of this world to guide him  twelve hours for business and twelve for food and sleep and rest is our rule for working men or indeed not our rule but gods  he has set the sun for the light of this world to rule the day to settle for us how long we are to work  in this country days vary  in summer they are more than twelve hours and then men work early and late but that is made up to us by winter when the days are less than twelve hours and men work short time  in the very cold countries again far away in the frozen north the sun never sets all the summer and never rises all the winter and there is six months day and six months night wonderful  but even there god has fitted the land and mens lives to that strange climate and they can gather in enough meat in the summer to keep them all the winter that they may be able to spend the long six months night of winter warm in their houses sleeping and resting with plenty of food  so that even to them there are twelve hours in the day though their hours are each a fortnight longi mean a certain fixed time in which to walk and do the business which they have to do before the long frozen night comes wherein no man can work because the sun the light of this world is hid from them below the ice for six whole months  so that our lords words hold true of all men even of those people in the icy north  but in by far the most parts of the world and especially in the hot countries where our lord lived there are twelve common hours in every day wherein men may and ought to work  now what did our lord mean by reminding his disciples of this which they all knew already  he meant thisthat god his father had appointed him a certain work to do and a certain time to do it in that though his day was short only thirtythree years in all while we have many of us seventy years given us yet that there were twelve hours in his day in which he must workthat god would take care that he lived out his appointed time provided he was ready and earnest in doing gods work in itand that he must work in that time which god had given him whatever came of it and do his appointed work before the night of death came in which no man can work  there was a heathen king once named philip of macedon and a very wise king he was though he was a heathen and one of the wisest of his plans was thishe had a slave whom he ordered to come in to him every morning of his life whatever he was doing and say to him in a loud voice philip remember that thou must die  he was a heathen but a great many who call themselves christians are not half so wise as he for they take all possible care not to remember that they must die but to forget that they must die and yet every living man has a servant who like king philips puts him in mind whether he likes it or not that his day will run out at last and his twelve hours of life be over and then die he must and who is that servant  a mans own body  lucky if his body is his servant thoughnot his master and his tyrant  but still be that as it may every fingerache that ones body has every cough and cold ones body catches ought to be to us a warning like king philips servant remember that thou must die  every little pain and illness is a warning a kindly hint from our father in heaven that we are doomed to death that we have but twelve hours in this short day of life and that the twelve must end and that we must get our work done and our accounts settled and be ready for our long journey to meet our father and our king before the night comes wherein no man can work but only takes his wages for them who have done good the wages of life eternal and for them who have done evilgod help them we know what is writtenthe wages of sin is death  now observe next that those who walk in the day do not stumble because they see the light of this world and those who walk in the night stumblethey have no light in them  if they are to see it must be by the help of some light outside themselves which is not part of themselves or belonging to themselves at all  we only see by the light which god has made when that is gone our eyes are useless  so it is with our souls  our wits however clever they may be only understand things by the light which god throws on those things  he must explain and enlighten all things to us  without his lighthis spirit all the wit in the world is as useless as a pair of eyes in a dark night  now this earthly world which we do see is an exact picture and pattern of the spiritual heavenly world which we do not see as solomon says in the proverbs the things which are seen are the doubles of the things which are not seen  and as there is a light for us in this earth which is not ourselves namely the sun so there is a light for us in the spiritworld which is not ourselves and who is that  the blessed lord shall answer for himself  he says i am the light of the world and st john bears witness to him in him was life and the life was the light of men  and does not st paul say the same thing when he blessed god so often for having called him and his congregations out of darkness into that marvellous light  if you read his epistles you will find what he meant by the darkness what he meant by the light  the darkness was heathendom knowing nothing of christ  the light was christianity knowing christ the light and more being in the light belonging to christbeing joined to him as the leaves are to the tree living by trust in christ being taught and made true men and true women of by the noble and holy spirit of christseeing their way through this world by trust in christ and his promisesthat was light  and there is no other light  if a man does not work trusting in christ whom god has set for the light of the world he works in the night where god never set or meant him to work and stumble he will and make a fool of himself sooner or later because he is walking in the night and sees nothing plainly or in a right view for as our lord says truly there is no light in him  no light in him  in one sense there is no light in any one be he the wisest or holiest man who ever lived  but this is just what three people out of four will not believe  they will not believe that the spirit of god gives man understanding  they fancy that they have light in themselves  they try conceitedly and godlessly to walk by the light of their own eyesto make their own way plain before their face for themselves  they will not believe old david a man who worked and fought and thought and saw far more than any one of us will ever do when he tells them again and again in his psalms that the lord is his light that the lord must guide a man and inform him with his eye and teach him in the way in which he should go  and therefore they will not pray to god for lighttherefore they will not look for light in gods word and in the writings of godly men and they are like a man in the broad sunshine who should choose to shut his eyes close and say i have light enough in my own head to do without the sun and therefore they walk on still in darkness and all the foundations of the earth are out of course because men forget the first universal ground rules of common sense and reason and love which gods spirit teaches  i tell you all the mistakes that you ever madethat ever were made since adam fell came from this that men will not ask god for light and wisdom they love darkness rather than light and therefore though gods light is ready for every man shining in the darkness to shew every man his way yet the darkness will not comprehend itwill not take it in and let god change its blindness into day  now then to gather all together what better answer could our lord have given to his disciples question than this are there not twelve hours in the day  if a man walk in the day he does not stumble because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him  it was as if he had said however short my day of life may be there are twelve hours in it of my fathers numbering and measuring not of mine  my times are in his hand as long as he pleases i shall live  he has given me a work to do and he will see that i live long enough to do it  into his hands i commend my spirit for living or dying he is with me  though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death he will be with me  he will keep me secretly in his tabernacle from the strife of tongues and will turn the furiousness of my enemies to his glory and as my day my strength will be  and i have no fear of running into danger needlessly  i have prayed to him daily and nightly for light for his spiritthe spirit of wisdom and understanding of prudence and courage and his word is pledged to keep me in all my ways so that i dash not my foot against a stone  know ye not that i must be about my fathers business  while i am about that i am safe  it is only if i go about my own businessmy own pleasure if i forget to ask him for his light and guidance that i shall put myself into the night and stumble and fall  well my friends what is there in all this which we may not say as well as our lord  in this as in all things christ set himself up as our pattern  oh believe itbelieve that your timeyour measure of life is in gods hand  believe that he is your light that he will teach and guide you into all truth and that all your mistakes come from not asking counsel of him in prayer and thought and reading of his holy bible  believe his blessed promise that he will give his holy spirit to those who ask him  believe too that he has given you a work to doprepared good works all ready for you to walk in  be you labourer or gentleman maid wife or widow god has given you a work to do there is good to be done lying all round you ready for you  and the blessed jesus who bought you body and soul with his own blood commands you to work for him  whatsoever your hand finds to do do it with all your might   work ye manful while ye may work for god in this your day night must stop you rich or poor godly deeds alone endure   and then whether you live or die your fathers smile will be on you and his everlasting arms beneath you and at your last hour you shall find that blessed are the dead that die in the lord for they rest from their labour and their works do follow them    sermon xx  association    galatians vi 2  bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ  if i were to ask you my friends why you were met together here to day you would tell me i suppose that you were come to church as members of a benefit club and quite right you are in coming here as such and god grant that we may meet together here on this same errand many more whitmondays  but this would be no answer to my question i wish to know why you come to church today sooner than to any other place what has the church to do with the benefit club now this is a question which i do not think all of you could answer very readily and therefore i wish to make you especially the younger members of the club think a little seriously about the meaning of your coming here today  you will be none the less cheerful this evening for having had some deep and godly thoughts in your heads this morning  now these benefit clubs are also called provident societies and a very good name for them  you become members of them because you are prudent or provident that is because you are careful and look forward to a rainy day  but why does not each of you lay up his savings for himself instead of putting them into a common purse and so forming a club  because you have found out what every one else in the world but madmen ought to have found out that two are better than one that if a great many men join together in any matter they are a great deal stronger when working together than if they each worked just as hard but each by himself that the way to be safe is not to stand each of you alone but to help each other in short that there is no getting on without bearing one anothers burdens  now this plan of bearing one anothers burdens is not only good in benefit clubsit is good in families in parishes in nations in the church of god which is the elect of all mankind  unless men hold together and help each other there is no safety for them  let us consider what there is bearing on this matter of prudence that makes one of the greatest differences between a man and a brute beast  it is not that the man is prudent and the beast is not many beasts have forethought enough the very sleepmouse hoards up acorns against the winter a fox will hide the game he cannot eat no the great difference between man and beast is that the beast has forethought only for himself but the man has forethought for others also beasts have not reason enough to bear each others burdens as men have  and what is it that makes us call the ant and the bee the wisest of animals except that they do in some degree behave like men in helping one another and having some sort of family feeling and society and government among them by which they can help bear each others burdens  so that we all confess by calling them wise how wise it is to help each other  consider a family again  in order that a family may be happy and prosperous all the members of it must bear each others burdens  if the father only thought of himself and the mother of herself and each of the children did nothing but take care of themselves would not that family come to misery and ruin  but if they all helped each other all thought of each other more than of themselvesall were ready to give up their own comfort to make each other comfortable that family would be peaceful and prosperous and would be doing a great deal towards fulfilling the law of christ  it is just the same in a parish  if the rich help and defend the poor and the poor respect and love the rich and are ready to serve them as far as they canin short if all ranks bear each others burdens that parish is a happy one and if they do not it is a miserable one  just the same with a nation  if the king only cares about making himself strong and the noblemen and gentlemen about their rank and riches and the poor people again only care for themselves and are trying to pull down the rich and so get what they can for themselvesif a country is in this state what can be more wretched  neither a house nor a country divided against itself can ever stand  but if the king and the nobles give their whole minds to making good laws and seeing justice done to all and workmen fairly paid and if the poor in their turns are loyal and ready to fight and work for their king and their nobles then will not that country be a happy and a great country  surely it will because its people instead of caring every man for himself only help each other and bear one anothers burdens  and just in the same way with christs church with the company of true christian men  if the clergymen thought only of themselves and neglected the people and forgot to labour among them and pray for them and preach to them and if the people each cared for himself and never prayed to god to give them a spirit of love and charity and never helped their neighbours or did unto others as they wished to be done by and above all if christ our head left his church and cared no more about us what would become of christs church  what would happen to the whole race of sinful man but misery in this world and ruin in the next  but if the people love and help each other and obey their ministers and pray for them and if the ministers labour earnestly after the souls and bodies of their people and christ in heaven helps both minister and people with his spirit and his providence and protection in short if all in the whole church bear each others burdens then christs church will stand and the gates of hell will not prevail against it  thus you see that this text of bearing one anothers burdens is no new or strange commandment but the very state in which every man is meant to live both in his family his parish his country and his churchall his life helping others and being helped by them in turn  and because families and nations and the church of christ above all are good and holy and beautiful therefore any society which is formed upon the same plani mean of helping each other must be good also  and therefore benefit societies are right and reasonable things and among all the good which they do they do this one great good that they teach men to remember that there is no use trying to stand alone but that the way to be safe and happy is to bear each others burdens  thus benefit societies are patterns of christs church  but now my friends there is another point for each of you to consider which is thisthe benefit club is a good thing but are you a good member of the club  do you do your duty each of you in the club as christian men should  i do not ask whether you pay your subscriptions regularly or not that is quite right and necessary but there is something more than that wanted to make a club go on rightly  mere paying and receiving money will never keep men together any more than any other outward business  a man may pay his clubmoney regularly and yet not be a really good member  and how is this  you remember that i tried to shew you that a family and a nation and a church all were kept together by the same principle of bearing one anothers burdens just as a benefit club is  now what makes a man a good member of christs churcha good christian in short  a man may pay his tithes to the rector and his churchrates to repair gods house and his poorrates to maintain gods poor all very regularly and yet be a very bad member of christs church  these payments are all right and good but they are but the outside the letter of what god requires of him  what is wanted is to serve god in the spirit to have the spiritthe will of a christian in him that is to do all these things for gods sakenot of constraint but willinglynot grudgingly for god loveth a cheerful giver  no  if a man is a really good member of christs church he lives a life of faith in jesus christ and of thankfulness to him for his infinite love and mercy in coming down to die for us and thus the love of god and man is shed abroad in his heart by gods spirit which is given to him therefore that man thinks it an honour to pay churchrates and so help towards keeping gods house in repair and neatness  he pays his tithes cheerfully because he loves gods ministers and feels their use and worth to him  he pays his poorrates with a willing mind for the sake of that god who has said that he who gives to the poor lends to the lord  and so he obeys not only the letter but the spirit of the law  but the man does more than this  besides obeying not only the letter but the spirit of the law he helps his brethren in a thousand other ways  he shews in short by every action that he believes in god and loves his neighbour  and why should it not be just the same in a benefit club  there the good member is not the man who pays his money merely to have a claim for relief when he himself is sick and yet grudges every farthing that goes to help other members  that man is not a good member  he has come into the club merely to take care of himself and not to bear others burdens  he may obey the letter of the clubrules by paying in his subscriptions and by granting relief to sick members but he does not obey the spirit of them  if he did he would be glad to bear his sick neighbours burden with so little trouble to himself  he would therefore grant club relief willingly and cheerfully when it was wanteday he would thank god that he had an opportunity of helping his neighbours  he would feel that all the members of the society were his brothers in a double sense first because they had joined with him to help and support each other in the society and next that they were his brothers in christ who had been baptised into the same church of god with himself  and he would therefore delight in supporting them in their sickness and honouring them when they died and in helping their widows and orphans in their affliction in short in bearing his neighbours burdens and so fulfilling the law of christ  and do you not see that if any of you subscribe to this benefit society in such a spirit as this that they are the men to give an answer to the question i asked at first why are you all here at church to day  they come here for the same reason that you all ought to come to thank god for having kept them well and out of the want of relief for the past year and to thank him too for having enabled them to bear their sick neighbours burdens  and they come also to pray to god to keep them well and strong for the year to come and to raise up those members who are in sickness and distress that they may all worship god here together another year as a company of faithful friends helping each other on through this life and all on the way to the same heavenly home where there will be no more poverty nor sorrow nor sickness nor death and god shall wipe away tears from all widows and orphans eyes  and now my friends i have tried to put some new and true thoughts into your head about your club and your business in this church to day  and i pray god grant that you may remember them and think of this whole matter as a much more solemn and holy one than you ever did before    sermon xxi  heaven on earth    1 cor x 31  whether ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god  this is a command from god my friends which well worth a few minutes consideration this daywell worth considering because though it was spoken eighteen hundred years ago yet god has not changed since that timehe is just as glorious as ever and christian mens relation to god has not changed since that time they still live and move and have their being in god they are still his childrenhis beloved christ who died for us is still our king gods spirit is still with us gods mercy still saves us we owe god as much as any people ever did  if it was ever any ones duty to shew forth gods glory surely it is our duty too  worth considering indeed is this command for though it is in the bible and has been there for eighteen hundred years it is seldom read seldomer understood and still more seldom put into practice men eat and drink and do all manner of things with all their might and main but how many of them do they do to the glory of god  no this is the faultthe especial curse of our day that religion does not mean any longer as it used the service of godthe being like god and shewing forth gods glory  no religion means nowadays the art of getting to heaven when we die and saving our own miserable worthless souls and getting gods wages without doing gods workas if that was godlinessas if that was any thing but selfishness as if selfishness was any the better for being everlasting selfishness  if selfishness is evil my friends the sooner we get rid of it the better instead of mixing it up as we do with all our thoughts of heaven and making our own enjoyment and our own safety the vile root of our hopes for all eternity  and therefore it is that people have forgotten what gods glory is they seem to think that gods highest glory is saving them from hellfire  and they talk not of god and of the wondrous majesty of god but only of the wonder of gods having saved themlooking at themselves all the time and not at god  we must get rid of this sort of religion my friends at all risks in order to get rid of all sorts of irreligion for one is the father of the other  it is a wonder indeed that we are saved from hell much more raised to heaven such peevish cowardly pitiful creatures as the best of us are  and yet the more we think of it the less wonder we shall find it  the more we think of the wonder of all wondersgod himself his majesty his power his wisdom his love his pity his infinite condescension the less reason we shall have to be surprised that he has stooped to save us  yes do not be startled for it is true that he has done for sinful men nothing contrary to himself but just what was to be expected from such unutterable condescension and pity and generosity as gods is  and so recollecting this we shall begin to forget ourselves and look at god and in thinking of him we shall get beyond mere wondering at him and rise to something higherto worshipping him  yes my friends this is what we must try at if we would be really godlyto find out what god isto find out his likeness his character as he is  and has he not shewn us what he is  he who has earnestly read christs storyhe who has understood and admired and loved christs character and its nobleness and beauty he who can believe that jesus christ is now at this minute raising up his heart to good guiding his thoughts to good he has seen god for he has seen the son who is the exact likeness of the fathers glory in whom dwells all the fulness of the godhead in a bodily shape  remember he who knows christ knows godand that knowledge will help us up a noble step fartherit will help us to shew forth gods glory  for when we once know what gods glory is we shall see how to make others know it too  we shall know how to do god justice to set men right as to their notions of god to give them at all events in our own lives and characters a pattern of christ who is the pattern of god and whatsoever we do we shall be able to do all to gods glory  for what is doing every thing to the glory of god  it is thiswe have seen what gods glory is  he is his own glory  as you say of any very excellent man you have but to know him to honour him or of any very beautiful woman you have but to see her to love her so i say of god men have but to see and know him to love and honour him  well then my friends if we call ourselves christian men if we believe that god is our father and delight as on the grounds of common feeling we ought to honour our father we should try to make every one honour him as he deserves  in short whatever we do we should make it tend to his glorymake it a lesson to our neighbours our friends and our families  we should preach gods glory to them day by day not by words only often not by words at all but by our conduct  ay there is the secretif you wish other men to believe a thing just behave as if you believed it yourself  nothing is so infectious as example  if you wish your neighbours to see what jesus christ is like let them see what he can make you like  if you wish them to know how gods love is ready to save them from their sins let them see his love save you from your sins  if you wish them to see gods tender care in every blessing and every sorrow they have why let them see you thanking god for every sorrow and every blessing you have  i tell you friends example is every thing  one good manone man who does not put his religion on once aweek with his sunday coat but wears it for his working dress and lets the thought of god grow into him and through and through him till every thing he says and does becomes religious that man is worth a ton of sermonshe is a living gospelhe comes in the spirit and power of eliashe is the image of god  and men see his good works and admire them in spite of themselves and see that they are godlike and that gods grace is no dream but that the holy spirit is still among men and that all nobleness and manliness is his gift his stamp his picture and so they get a glimpse of god again in his saints and heroes and glorify their father who is in heaven  would not such a life be a heavenly life  ay it would be more it would be heavenheaven on earth  not in versemongering cant but really  we should then be sitting as st paul tells us in heavenly places with jesus christ and having our conversation in heaven  all the while we were doing our daily work following our business or serving our country or sitting at our own firesides with wife and child we should be all that time in heaven  why not we are in heaven nowif we had but faith to see it  oh get rid of those carnal heathen notions about heaven which tempt men to fancy that after having misused this placegods earthfor a whole life they are to fly away when they die like swallows in autumn to another placethey know not wherewhere they are to be very happythey know not why or how nor do i know either  heaven is not a mere place my friends  all places are heaven if you will be heavenly in them  heaven is where god is and christ is  and hell is where god is not and christ is not  the bible says no doubt there is a place nowsomewhere beyond the skieswhere christ especially shews forth his glorya heaven of heavens  and for reasons which i cannot explain there must be such a place  but at all events here is heaven for christ is here and god is here if we will open our eyes and see them  and howhow  did not christ himself say if a man will love me my father will love him and we my father and i will come to him and make our abode with him and we will shew ourselves to him  do those words mean nothing or something  if they have any meaning do they not mean this that in this life we can see godin this life we can have god and christ abiding with us  and is not that heaven  yes heaven is where god is  you are in heaven if god is with you you are in hell if god is not with you for where god is not darkness and a devil are sure to be  there was a great poet oncedante by namewho described most truly and wonderfully in his own way heaven and hell for indeed he had been in both  he had known sin and shame and doubt and darkness and despair which is hell  and after long years of misery he had got to know love and hope and holiness and nobleness and the love of christ and the peace of god which is heaven  and so well did he speak of them that the ignorant people used to point after him with awe in the streets and whisper there is the man who has been in hell  whereon some one made these lines on him   thou hast seen hell and heaven  why not since heaven and hell within the struggling soul of every mortal dwell   think of thatthouand thouand thoufor in thee at this moment is either heaven or hell  and which of them  ask thyself ask thyself friend  if thou art not in heaven in this life thou wilt never be in heaven in the life to come  at death says the wise man each thing returns into its own element into the ground of its life the light into the light and the darkness into the darkness  as the tree falls so it lies  my friends who call yourselves enlightened christian folk do you suppose that you can lead a mean worldly covetous spiteful life here and then the moment your soul leaves the body that you are to be changed into the very opposite character into angels and saints as fairy tales tell of beasts changed into men  if a beast can be changed into a man then death can change the sinner into a saintbut not else  if a beast would enjoy being a man then a sinner would enjoy being in heaven but not else  a sinful worldly man enjoy being in heaven does a fish enjoy being on dry land  the sinner would long to be back in this world again  why what is the employment of spirits in heaven according to the bible for that is the point to which i have been trying to lead you round again  what but glorifying god not trying only to do every thing to gods glory but actually succeeding in doing itbasking in the sunshine of his smile delighting to feel themselves as nothing before his glorious majesty meditating on the beauty of his love filling themselves with the sight of his power searching out the treasures of his wisdom and finding god in all and all in godtheir whole eternity one act of worship one hymn of praise  are there not some among us who will have had but little practice at that work  those who have done nothing for gods glory here how do they expect to be able to do every thing for gods glory hereafter  those who will not take the trouble of merely standing up at the psalms like the rest of their neighbours even if they cannot sing with their voices gods praises in this church how will they like singing gods praises through eternity  no be sure that the only people who will be fit for heaven who will like heaven even are those who have been in heaven in this lifethe only people who will be able to do every thing to gods glory in the new heavens and new earth are those who have been trying honestly to do all to his glory in this heaven and this earth  think over in the meantime what i have said this day consider it and you will have enough to think of and pray over too till we meet here again    sermon xxii  national privileges    luke x 23  blessed are the eyes which see the things which ye see  for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them  this is a noble text my friendsand yet an awful one for if it does not increase our religion it will certainly increase our condemnation  it tells us that we even the meanest among us are more favoured by god than the kings and judges and conquerors of the old world of whom we read this afternoon in the first lesson that we have more light and knowledge of god than even the prophets david isaiah jeremiah and ezekiel to whom gods glory appeared in visible shape  it tells us that we see things which they longed to see and could not that words are spoken to us for which their ears longed in vain that they though they died in hope yet received not the promises god having provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect  now what was this which they longed for and had not and yet we have  it was thisa saviour and a saviours kingdom  all wise and holy hearts for agesas well heathens as jewshad had this longing  they wanted a saviourone who should free them from sin and conquer evilone who should explain to them all the doubt and contradiction and misery of the world and give them some means of being freed from itone who should set them the perfect pattern of what a man should be and join earth and heaven and make godliness part of mans daily life  they longed for a saviour and for a heavenly kingdom also  they saw that all the laws in the world could never make men good that one half of men broke them and the other half only obeyed them unwillingly through slavish fear loving the sin they dared not do  that men got worse and worse as time rolled on  that kings instead of being shepherds of their people were only wolves and tyrants to keep them in ignorance and misery that priests only taught the people lies and fattened themselves at their expense  that in short as david said men would not learn or understand and all the foundations of the earth the grounds and principles of society politics and religion were out of course and the devil very truly the king of this lower world so they longed for a heavenly kingdoma kingdom of god one in which men should obey god for love and not for fear and man for gods sake a spiritual kingdoma kingdom whose laws should be written in mens hearts and spirits and be their delight and glory not their dread they longed for a king of kings who should teach all kings and magistrates to rule in love and wisdom  they longed for a high priest who should teach all priests to explain the wonder and the glory that there is in every living man and in heaven and earth and all that therein lies and lead mens hearts into love and purity and noble thoughts and deeds  they longed in short for a kingdom of god a golden age a regeneration of the world as they called it and rightly  of course the jewish prophets saw most clearly how this would be brought about and how utterly necessary a saviour and his kingdom was to save mankind from utter ruin  they i say saw this best  but still all the wise and pious heathens each according to his measure of light saw the same necessity or else were restless and miserable because they could not see it  so that in all ages of the world in a thousand different shapes there was rising up to heaven a mournful earnest prayerthy kingdom come  and now this kingdom is come and the king of it the saviour of men is jesus christ the son of god  long men prayed and long men waited and at last in the fulness of gods good time just when the night seemed darkest and under the abominations of the roman empire religion honesty and common decency seemed to have died out the sun of righteousness rose on the dead and rotten world to bring life and immortality to light  god sent forth his son made of a woman not to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved  he sent him to be our saviour to die on the cross for our sins and our childrens that all our guilt might be washed away and we might come boldly to the throne of grace with our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in the waters of baptism  he sent him to be our teacher in the perfect law of love our pattern in every thing which a man should be and is not  he sent him to conquer death by rising from the dead that he might have power to raise us also to life and immortality  he sent him to fill men with his spirit the spirit of reason and truth the spirit of love and courage that he might know the will of god and do it as our saviour did before us  he sent him to found a church to join all men into one brotherhood one kingdom of god whose rulers are kings and parliaments whose ministers are the clergy whose prophets are all poets and philosophers authors and preachers who are true to their own calling whose signs and tokens are the sacraments a kingdom which should never be moved but should go on for ever drawing into all honest and true hearts and preserving them ever for christ their lord  and that we might not doubt that we too belonged to this kingdom he has placed in this land his ministers and teachers christs sacraments christs churches in every parish in the land christs bible or the means of attaining the bible in every house and every cottage that from our cradle to our grave we might see that we belonged as sworn servants and faithful children to the great father in heaven and jesus christ the king of the earth  thus my friends all that all men have longed for we possess we want no more and we shall have no more  if under the present state of things we cannot be holy we shall never be holy  if we cannot use our right in this kingdom of christ how can we become citizens of gods everlasting kingdom when christ shall have delivered up the dominion to his father and god shall be all in all  god has done all for us that god will do  he has given us his son for a saviour and a church in which and by which to worship that saviour and what more would we have  alas my friends have we yet used fairly what god has given us and if not how terrible will be our guilt  how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation  and yet how many do neglecthow few live as if they were citizens of christs kingdom  it seems as if god had been too good to us and heaped us so heavily with blessings that we were tired of them and despised them as common things  common things they are the very things as i said which the great and the wise in all ages have longed for and prayed for and yet never found surely surely god may well say to us what could have been done unto my vineyard which has not been done to it  what indeed  i wish i could take some of you into a heathen country for a single week that you might see what it is not to know of a saviournot to be members of his church as we are  why we here in england are in the very garden of the lord  we have but to stretch out our hand to the tree of life and eat and live for ever  from our cradle to our grave christ the king is ready to guide to teach to comfort to deliver us  when we are born we are christened in his name made members of christ children of god and inheritors by hope of the kingdom of heaven  is that nothing  it is alas nothing in the eyes of most parents  as we grow older are we not taught who we aretaught call god our fathertaught about jesus christ who he is and what he is  is that too nothing  alas that knowledge is generally a mere meaningless schoollesson cared for neither by child nor by man  at confirmation again we solemnly declare that we belong to christs kingdom and that we will live as his subjects and his alone  and we are brought to his bishops to be received as free reasonable christian people to claim our citizenship in the kingdom of god  is that nothing  yet that too is nothing with threefourths of us  nothing  hear me young peopleas i have often told youyou are ready enough to excuse yourselves from your confirmation vows by saying you were not taught to understand themwere not taught how to put them into practice  that may be true or it may not your sin is just the same  no one with any common honesty or common sense could answer as you have to the bishops questions at confirmation without knowing that you did make a promise and knowing well enough what you promisedand you who carried to confirmation a careless heart and a lying tongue have only yourselves to blame for itbut to proceed  is not christ present or ready to be present with us sunday after sunday for years have not the churches been opened all around us inviting us to enter and worship christ knowing that where two or three are gathered together there is christ in the midst of them  is that nothing  this creedthese lessonsthese prayers which sunday after sunday you have usedare they nothing are they not all proofs that the kingdom of god is come to you and means whereby you can behave like children of the kingdom  and not on sundays alone  have we not been taught daily in our own houses in our own hearts in all danger and trouble and temptation to pray to jesus christ our king knowing that he will hear and save all them that put their trust in him  is that nothing  on our happy marriage morn too was it not in gods house before christs minister in christs name that we were married  surely the kingdom of god is come to us when our wedlock as well as our souls and bodies is holy to the lord  is that nothing  how few think of their marriagejoys as holy things an ordinance of christs kingdom which he delights in and blesses with his presence and his special smile seeing that it is the noblest and the purest of all things on earththe picture of the great mystery which shall be the bridal of all bridals the marriage of christ and his church  people do not nowadays believe in marriage as a part of their religion and so according to their want of faith it happens to them their marriage is not holy and the love and joy of their youth wither into a peevish careless lonely old ageand yet over their heads these words were said they are man and wife together in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost comes of not believing in christs presence and christs favour of not believing in short in what the creed truly calls the holy catholic church  neither after that does christ leave us  every time a woman is churched is not that meant to be a sign of thankfulness to christ the great physician to whom she owes her life and health once more  then season after season is the sacrament of christs body and blood offered you  is that no sign that christ is here among us  ah blessed are the eyes which see thatblessed are the ears which hear those words take eat this is my body which is given for you  truly if that honourthat blessingis so vast the love and the condescension of christ the lamb of god so unutterable that prophets and kings whatever they believed never could have desired never could have imagined that the son of god should offer to the sons of men year after year in their little parish churches his most precious body his most precious blood  and another thing too those prophets and kings would never have imaginedthat when christ in those churches offers his body and his blood ninetenths of the congregation calling themselves christians should quietly walk out and go home and leave the sacraments of christs body and christs blood behind as a useless and unnecessary matter  that indeed the old prophets and kings never saw and never expected to seebut so it is  christ is among us and our eyes are holden and we know him not  and then at last after all these blessed privileges these tokens of gods kingdom have been neglected through a long life does christ neglect us in the hour of death  ah no  he is at the grave as he was at the font at the marriagebed at his own holy table in gods house and the body is laid in the ground by christs minister in the certain hope of a joyful resurrection  but whata sure and certain hope for each and all  the resurrection is a joyful hopebut is it so for all  only too often a faint dim longing that clings to the last chance and dares not confess to itself how hopeless must be the death of that man or woman whose life was spent in the kingdom of god in the midst of blessings which kings said prophets desired in vain to see and yet who neglected them all never entered into the spirit of themnever loved themnever lived according to them but despised and trampled under foot the kingdom of god from their childhood to their grave as threefourths of us do  christ came to judge no man and therefore christs ministers judge no man and read the christian funeral service over all and pray christ to be there and to remember his blessed promise of raising up the body and soul to everlasting life  but how can they help fearing that christ will not hear themthat after all his offers and gifts in this life have been despised he will give nothing after death but death and that it were better for the sinful worldly sham christian when lying in his coffin if he had never been born  how can those escape who neglect such great salvation  ah my friendsmy friends take this to heart  blessed indeed are the eyes which see what you see and hear what you hear prophets and kings have desired to see and hear them and have not seen or heard  but if you cradled among all these despised honours and means of grace bring forth no fruit in your livesshut out from yourselves the thought of your high calling in jesus christ what shall be your end but ruin  he that despises christ christ will despise him and say not to yourselves as many do we are churchgoerswe are all safe  i say to you god is able from among the negro and the wild irishmanay god is able of these stones to raise up children to the church of england while those of you the children of the kingdom who lived in the church of your fathers and never used or loved her or christ her king shall be cast into outer darkness where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth    sermon xxiii  lenten thoughts    haggai i 5  now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways  next wednesday is ashwednesday the first day of lent the season which our forefathers have appointed for us to consider and mend our ways and return year by year heart and soul to that lord and heavenly father from whom we are daily wandering  now we all know that we ought to have repented long ago we all know that sinning in many things daily as we do we ought all to repent daily  but that is not enough we do want unless we are wonderfully better than the holy men of oldwe do want i say a particular time in which we may sit down deliberately and look our own souls steadily in the face and cast up our accounts with god and be thoroughly ashamed and terrified at those accounts when we find as we shall that we cannot answer god one thing in a thousand  it is all very well to say i confess and repent of my sins daily why should i do it especially in lent  very truelet us see then by your altered life and conduct that you have repented during this lent and then it will be time to talk of repenting every day after lent  but in fact a man might just as well argue i say my prayers every day and god hears them why should i say them more on sundays than any other day  why not only because your forefathers and the church of your forefathers have advised you which though not an imperative reason is still a strong one surely but because the thing is good and reasonable and right in itself  because as they found in their own case and as you may find in yours if you will but think the hurry and bustle of business is daily putting repentance and selfexamination out of our heads  a man may think much and pray much thank god in the very midst of his busiest work but he is apt to be hurried he has not set his thoughts especially on the matters of his soul and so the souls work is not thoroughly done  much for which he ought to pray he forgets to pray for  many sins and feelings of which he ought to repent slip past him out of sight in the hurry of life  much good that might be done is put off and laid by often till it is too late  but now here is a regular season in which we may look back and say to ourselves how have i been getting on for this twelvemonth not in pocket but in character not in the appearance of character in my neighbours eyes but in real characterin the eyes of god  am i more manly or more womanlymore godly more true more humble above all more loving than i was this time last year  what bad habits have i conquered  what good habits have grown upon me  what chances of doing good have i let slip  what foolish unkind things have i done  my duty to god and my neighbours is so and so how have i done it  above all this saviour and king in heaven in whom i profess to believe to whom i have sworn to be loyal and true and to help his good cause the cause of godliness manliness and happiness among my neighbours in my family in my own hearthow have i felt towards him  have i thought about him more this year than i did last  do i feel any more loyalty respect love gratitude to him than i did  ay more do i think about him at all as a living man much less as my king and saviour or is all really know about him the sound of the words jesus christ and the story about him in the apostles creed  do i really believe and trust in jesus christ or do i not  these are sharp searching questions my friendsgood lenten food for any mans soulquestions which it is much more easy to ask soberly and answer fairly now when you look quietly back on the past year than it is alas to answer them day by day amid all the bustle your business and your families  but you will answer this bustle will go on just as much in lent as ever  our time and thoughts will be just as much occupied  we have our livings to get  we are not fine gentlemen and ladies who can lie by for forty days and do nothing but read and pray while their tradesmen and servants are working for them from morning to night how then can we give up more time to religion now than at other times  this is all true enough but there is a sound and true answer to it it is not so much more time which you are asked to give up to your souls in lent as it is more heart  what do i talk of  giving up more time to your souls  and yet this is the way we all talk as if our time belonged to our bodies and so we had to rob them of it to give it up to our soulsas if our bodies were ourselves and our souls were troublesome burdens or peevish children hanging at our backs which would keep prating and fretting about heaven and hell and had to be quieted and their mouths stopped as quickly and easily as possible that we might be rid of them and get about our true business our real dutythis mighty work of eating and drinking and amusing ourselves and making money  i am afraid afraid there are too many who if they spoke out their whole hearts would be quite as content to have no souls and no necessity to waste their precious time as they think upon religion  but my friends my friends the day will come when you will see yourselves in a true light when your soul will not seem a mere hangeron to your body but you will find out that you are your soul  then there will be no more forgetting that you have souls and thrusting them into the background to be fed at odd minutes or left to starve no more talk of giving up time to the care of your souls your souls will take the time for themselves thenand the eternity too they will be all in all to you then perhaps when it is too late  well i want you just for forty days to let your souls be all in all to you now to make them your first objectyour first thought in the morning the last thing at nightyour thought at every odd moment in the day  you need not neglect your business only for one short forty days do not make your business your god  we are all too apt to try the heathen plan of seeking first every thing else in the world and letting the kingdom of god and his righteousness be added to us over and aboveor not as it may happen  try for once the plan the lord of heaven and earth advises and seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and see whether every thing else will not be added to you  again you need not be idle a moment more in lent than at any other time  but i dare say that none of you are so full of business that you have not a free ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes at night of which the best of uses may be made  what do i say  why of all men in the world farmers and labourers have most time i think to themselves working as they do the greater part of their day in silence and alone what opportunities for them to have their souls busy in heaven while they are pacing over the fields ploughing and hoeing  i have read of many many labouring men who had found out their opportunities in this way and used them so well as to become holy great and learned men  one of the most learned scholars in england at this day was once a village carpenter who used when young to keep a book open before him on his bench while he worked and thus contrived to teach himself one after the other latin greek and hebrew  so much time may a man find who looks for time  but after all and above all believe thisthat if your business or your work does actually give you no time to think about god and your own soulsif in the midst of it all you cannot find leisure enough night and morning to pray earnestly to read your bible carefully if it so swallows up your whole thoughts during the day that you have no opportunity to recollect yourself to remember that you are an immortal being and that you have a saviour in heaven whom you are serving faithfully or unfaithfullyif this work or business of yours will not give you time enough for that then it is not gods business and ought not to be yours either  but you have timeyou have all time  when there is a will there is a way  make up your minds that there shall be a will and pray earnestly to god to give it you if it is but for forty days  and in them think seriously slowly solemnly over your past lives examine yourselves and your doings  ask yourselves fairlyam i going forward or back  am i living like a child of god or like a mere machine for making food and wages  is my conduct such as the holy scripture tells me that it should be  you will not need to go far for a set of questions my friends or rules by which to examine yourselves  you can hardly open a page of gods blessed book without finding something which stares you in the face with the question do i do thus or do i not do thus  take for example the epistle of this very day  what better test can we have for trying and weighing our own souls  what says it  that though we were wise charitable eloquentall that the greatest of men can be and yet had not charitylove we are nothingnothing  and how does it describe this necessary indispensable heavenly love  let us spend the last few minutes of this sermon in seeing how  and if that description does not prick all our hearts on more points than one they are harder than i take them forfar harder certainly than they should be  this charity or love we hear which each of us ought to have and must havesuffers long and is kind  what shall we say to that how many hasty revengeful thoughts and feelings have risen in the hearts of most of us in the last yearhere is one thought for lent  charity envies nothave we envied any their riches their happiness their good name health and youthanother thought for lent  charity boasts not herself  alas alas my friends are not the best of us apt to make much of the little good we doto pride ourselves on the petty kindnesses we shewto be puffed up with easy selfsatisfaction just as charity is not puffed up another lenten thought  charity does not behave herself unseemly is never proud noisy conceited gives every mans opinion a fair kindly hearing making allowances for all mistakes  have we done sothen there is another thought for lent  charity seeks not her own does not stand fiercely and stiffly on her own rights on the gratitude due to her  while weare we not too apt when we have done a kindness to fret and fume and think ourselves deeply injured if we do not get repaid at once with all the humble gratitude we expected  of this also we must think  charity thinks no evil sets down no bad motives for any ones conduct but takes for granted that he means well whatever appearances may be while we i speak of myself just as much as of any one are we not continually apt to be suspicious jealous to take for granted that people mean harm and even when we find ourselves mistaken and that we have cried out before we are hurt not to consider it as any sin against our neighbour whom in reality we have been silently slandering to ourselves  charity rejoices not in iniquity but in the truth whatever it may be is never glad to see a high professor prove a hypocrite and fall into sin and shew himself in his true foul colours which we alas are too apt to think a very pleasant sightare not these wholesome meditations for lent  charity hopes all things of every one believes all things all good that is told of every one endures all things instead of flying off and giving up a person at the first fault  are not all these points which our own hearts consciences common sense or whatever you like to call it i shall call it gods spirit tell us are right true necessary  and is there one of us who can say that he has not offended in many if not in all these points and is not that unrighteousnessgoing out of the right straightforward childlike loving way of looking at all people  and is not all unrighteousness sin  and must not all sin be repented of and that as soon as we find it out  and can we not all find time this lent to throw over these sins of oursto confess them with shame and sorrowto try like men to shake them off  oh my friends you who are too busy for forty short days to make your immortal souls your first business take caretake care lest the day shall come when sickness and pain and the terror of death shall keep you too busy to prepare those unrepenting unforgiven sinbesotted souls of yours for the kingdom of god    sermon xxiv  on books    john i 1  in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god  i do not pretend to be able to explain this text to you for no man can comprehend it but he of whom it speaks jesus christ the word of god  but i can by gods grace put before you some of the awful and glorious truths of which it gives us a sight and may christ direct you who is the word and grant me words to bring the matter home to you so as to make some of you at least ask yourselves the golden question if this is true what must we do to be saved  the text says that the word was from the beginning with goday god himself  who the word is there is no doubt from the rest of the chapter which you heard read this morning  but why is christ called the word of all wordsthe word of god  let us look at this is not christ the man the head and pattern of all men who are what men ought to be  and did he not tell men that he is the life  that all life is given by him and out of him  and does not st john tell us that christ the life is the light of menthe true light which lighteth every man who cometh into the world  remember this and then think againwhat is it which makes men different from all other living things we know of  is it not speechthe power of words  the beasts may make each other understand many things but they have no speech  these glorious thingswordsare mans right alone part of the image of the son of godthe word of god in which man was created  if men would but think what a noble thing it is merely to be able to speak in words to think in words to write in words  without words we should know no more of each others hearts and thoughts than the dog knows of his fellow dogwithout words to think in for if you will consider you always think to yourself in words though you do not speak them aloud and without them all our thoughts would be mere blind longings feelings which we could not understand our own selves  without words to write in we could not know what our forefathers didwe could not let our children after us know what to do  but now booksthe written word of manare precious heirlooms from one generation to another training us encouraging us teaching us by the words and thoughts of men whose bodies are crumbled into dust ages ago but whose wordsthe power of uttering themselves which they got from the son of godstill live and bear fruit in our hearts and in the hearts of our children after us till the last day  but where did these wordsthis power of uttering our thoughts come from  do you fancy that men first began like brute beasts or babies with strange cries and mutterings and so gradually found out words for themselves  not they the beasts have been on the earth as long as man and yet they can no more speak than they could when god created adam  but adam we find could speak at once  god spoke to adam the moment he was made and adam understood him so he knew the power and the meaning of words  who gave him that power who but jehovahjesusthe word of god who imparted to him the word of speech and the light of reason  without them what use would there have been in saying to him thou shalt not eat of the tree of knowledge  without them what would there have been in gods bringing to him all the animals to see what he would call them unless he had first given adam the power of understanding words and thinking of words and speaking words  this was the glorious gift of christthe voice or word of the lord god as we read in the second chapter of genesis whom adam heard another time with fear and terrorthe voice of the lord walking in the garden in the cool of the daya text and a story strange enough till we find in the first chapter of st john the explanation of it telling us that the word was in the beginning with godvery god and that he was the light which lighteth every man who cometh into the world so christ is the light which lighteth every man who cometh into the world  how are we to understand that when there are so many who live and die heathens or reprobatessome who never hear of christsome alas in christian lands who are dead to every doctrine or motive of christianity yet the bible says that christ lights every man who comes into the world  difficult to understand at first sight yet most true and simple too at bottom  for how is every one whether heathen or christian child or man enlightened or taught to live and behave  is it not by the words of those round him by the words he reads in books by the thoughts which he thinks out and puts into shape for himself  all this is the light which every human being has his share of  and has not every man too the light of reason and good feeling more or less to tell him whether each thing is right or wrong noble or mean ugly or beautiful  this is another way by which the light which lighteth every man works  and st john tells us in the text that he who works in this wayhe who gives us the power of understanding and thinking and judging and speaking is the very same word of god who was made flesh and dwelt among men and died on the cross for us the lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world  he is the word of godby him god has spoken to man in all ages  he taught adamhe spoke to abraham as a man speaketh with his friend it was he jehovah whom we call jesus whom moses and the seventy elders sawsaw with their bodily eyes on mount sinai who spoke to them with human voice from amid the lightning and the rainbow  it must have been only he the word by whom god the father utters himself to man for no man hath seen god at any time only the word the onlybegotten son who is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him  and who put into the mouth of david those glorious psalmsthe songs in which all true men for three thousand years have found the very things they longed to speak themselves and could not  who but christ the word of god the lord as david calls him put a new song into the mouth of his holy poetthe sweet singer of israel  who spake by the prophets again  what do they say themselvesthe word of the lord came to me saying  and then when the spirit of god stirred them up the word of god gave them speech and they said the sayings which shall never pass away till all be fulfilled  and who was it who when he was upon earth spake as never man spakewhose words were the simplest and yet the deepestthe tenderest and yet the most awful which ever broke the blessed silence upon this earthwhose words now to this day come home to mens hearts stirring them up to the very roots piercing through the marrow of mens soulswhose but christs the word who was made flesh and dwelt among us full of grace and truth  and who since then do you think has it been who has given to all wise and holy poets philosophers and preachers the power to speak and write the wonderful truths which by gods grace they thought out for themselves and for all mankindwho gave them utterancewho but christ the lord of mens spirits the word of god who promised to give to all his true disciples a mouth and wisdom which their enemies should not be able to gainsay or resist  well my friends ought not the knowledge of this to make us better and wiser  ought it not to make us esteem and reverence and use many things of which we are apt to think too lightly  how it should make us reverence the bible the written word of gods saints and prophets of gods apostles of christ the word himself  oh that men would use that treasure of the bible as it deservesoh that they would believe from their hearts that whatever is said there is truly said that whatever is said there is said to them that whatever names things are called there are called by their right names  then men would no longer call the vile person beautiful or call pride and vanity honour or covetousness respectability or call sin worldly wisdom but they would call things as christ calls themthey would try to copy christs thoughts and christs teaching and instead of looking for instruction and comfort to lying opinions and false worldly cunning they would find their only advice in the blessed teaching and their only comfort in the gracious promises of the word of the book of life  again how these thoughts ought to make us reverence all books consider except a living man there is nothing more wonderful than a booka message to us from the deadfrom human souls whom we never saw who lived perhaps thousands of miles away and yet these in those little sheets of paper speak to us amuse us terrify us teach us comfort us open their hearts to us as brothers  why is it that neither angels nor saints nor evil spirits appear to men now to speak to them as they did of old  why but because we have books by which christs messengers and the devils messengers too can tell what they will to thousands of human beings at the same moment year after year all the world over  i say we ought to reverence books to look at them as awful and mighty things  if they are good and true whether they are about religion or politics farming trade or medicine they are the message of christ the maker of all things the teacher of all truth which he has put into the heart of some man to speak that he may tell us what is good for our spirits for our bodies and for our country  and at the last day be sure of it we shall have to render an accounta strict account of the books which we have read and of the way in which we have obeyed what we read just as if we had had so many prophets or angels sent to us  if on the other hand books are false and wicked we ought to fear them as evil spirits loose among us as messages from the father of lies who deceives the hearts of evil men that they may spread abroad the poison of his false and foul messages putting good for evil and evil for good sweet for bitter and bitter for sweet saying to all men i too have a tree of knowledge and you may eat of the fruit thereof and not die  but believe him not  when you see a wicked book when you find in a book any thing which contradicts gods book cast it away trample it under foot believe that it is the devil tempting you by his cunning alluring words as he tempted eve your mother  would to god all here would make that rulenever to look into an evil book a filthy ballad a nonsensical frivolous story  can a man take a snake into his bosom and not be bittencan we play with fire and not be burntcan we open our ears and eyes to the devils message whether of covetousness or filth or folly and not be haunted afterwards by its wicked words rising up in our thoughts like evil spirits between us and our pure and noble dutyour baptismvows  i might say much more about these things and by gods help in another sermon i will go on and speak to you of the awful importance of spoken words of the sermons and the conversation to which you listen the awful importance of every word which comes out of your own mouth  but i have spoken only of books this morning for this is the age of books the time one would think of which daniel prophesied that many should run to and fro and knowledge should be increased  a flood of books newspapers writings of all sorts good and bad is spreading over the whole land and young and old will read them  we cannot stop thatwe ought not  it is gods ordinance  it is more  it is gods grace and mercy that we have a free press in englandliberty for every man that if he have any of gods truth to tell he may tell it out boldly in books or otherwise  a blessing from god one which we should reverence for god knows it was dearly bought  before our forefathers could buy it for us many an honoured man left house and home to die in the battlefield or on the scaffold fighting and witnessing for the right of every man to whom gods word comes to speak gods word openly to his countrymen  a blessing and an awful one for the same gate which lets in good lets in evil  the law dare not silence bad books  it dare not root up the tares lest it root up the wheat also  the men who died to buy us liberty knew that it was better to let in a thousand bad books than shut out one good one for a grain of gods truth will ever outweigh a ton of the devils lies  we cannot then silence evil books but we can turn away our eyes from themwe can take care that what we read and what we let others read shall be good and wholesome  now if ever are we bound to remember that books are words and that words come either from christ or the devilnow if ever we are bound to try all books by the word of godnow if ever are we bound to put holy and wise books both religious and worldly into the hands of all around us that if poor souls they must need eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge they may also eat of the tree of lifeand now if ever are we bound to pray to christ the word of god that he will raise up among us wise and holy writers and give them words and utterance to speak to the hearts of all englishmen the message of gods covenant and that he may confound the devil and his lies and all that swarm of vile writers who are filling england with trash filth blasphemy and covetousness with books which teach men that our wise forefathers who built our churches and founded our constitution and made england the queen of nations were but ignorant knaves and fanatics and that selfish moneymaking and godless licentiousness are the only true wisdom and so turn the divine power of words and the inestimable blessing of a free press into the devils engine and not christs the word of god  but their words shall be brought to nought  may god preserve us and all our friends from that defilement and may he give you all grace in these strange times to take care what you read and how you read and to hold fast by the book of all books and christ the word of god  try by them all books and men for if they speak not according to gods law and testimony it is because there is no truth in them    sermon xxv  the courage of the saviour    john xi 7 8  then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judea again  his disciples say to him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again  we all admire a brave man  and we are right  to be brave is gods gift  to be brave is to be like jesus christ  cowardice is only the devils likeness  but we must take care what we mean by being brave  now there are two sorts of braverycourage and fortitude and they are very different  courage is of the fleshfortitude is of the spirit  courage is good but dumb animals have it just as much as we  a dog a tiger and a horse have courage but they have no fortitudebecause fortitude is a spiritual thing and beasts have no spirits like ours  what is fortitude  it is the courage which will make us not only fight in a good cause but suffer in a good cause  courage will help us only to give others pain fortitude will help us to bear pain ourselves  and more fortitude will make a fearful person brave and very often the more brave the more fearful they are  and thus it is that women are so often braver than men  we men are made of coarser stuff we do not feel pain as keenly as women and if we do feel we are rightly ashamed to shew it  but a tender woman who feels pain and sorrow infinitely more than we do who need not be ashamed of being frightened who perhaps is terrified at every mouse and spiderto see her bearing patiently pain and sorrow and shame in spite of all her fearfulness because she knows it is her dutythat is christs likenessthat is true fortitudethat is a sight nobler than all the bulldog courage in the world  for what is the courage of the bulldog after all or of the strong quarrelsome man  he is confident in his own strength he is rough and hard and does not care for pain and when he thrusts his head into a fight like a surly dog he does it not because it is his duty but because he likes it because he is angry and then every blow and every wound makes him more angry and he fights on forgetting his pain from blind rage  that is not altogether bad men ought to be courageous  but oh my friends is there not a more excellent way to be brave and which is nobler to suffer bravely for gods sake or to beat men made in gods image bravely for ones own sake  think of any fight you ever saw and then compare with that the stories of those old martyrs who died rather than speak a word against their saviour  if you want to see true fortitude think of what has happened thousands of times when the heathen used to persecute the christianshow delicate women who would not venture to set the sole of their foot to the ground for tenderness would submit rather than give up their religion and deny the lord who died for them to be torn from husband and family and endure nakedness and insult and tortures which make ones blood run cold to read of till they were torn slowly piecemeal or roasted in burning flames without a murmur or an angry wordknowing that christ who had borne all things for them would give them strength to bear all things for him trusting that if they were faithful unto death he would give them a crown of life  there was true fortitudethere was true faiththere was gods strength made perfect in womans weakness  do you not see my friends that such a death was truly brave  how does bulldog courage shew beside that couragethe courage which conquers grief and pain for dutyssake instead of merely forgetting them in rage and obstinacy  and do you not see how this bears on my text  how it bears on our lords whole life  was he not indeed the perfectly brave manthe man who endured more than all living men put together at the very time that he had the most intense fear of what he was going to suffer  and stranger still endured it all of his own will while he had it in his power to shake it all off any instant and free himself utterly from pain and suffering  now this speech of our lords in the text is just a case of true fortitude  he was beyond jordan  he had been forced to escape thither to save his life from the mad blinded jews  he had no foolhardiness he knew that he had no more right than we have to put his life in danger when there was no good to be done by it  but now there was good to be done by it  lazarus was dead and he wanted to raise him to life  therefore he said to his disciples let us go into judea again  they knew the danger they said master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again but he would go he had a work to do and he dared bear anything to do his work  ay here is the secret this is the feeling which gives a man true couragethe feeling that he has a work to do at all costs the sense of duty  oh my friends let men women or children once feel that they have a duty to perform let them once say to themselves i am bound to do this thingit is right for me to do this thing i owe it as a duty to my family i owe it as a duty to my country i owe it as a duty to god who called me into this station of life i owe it as a duty to jesus christ who bought me with his blood that i might do his will and not my own pleasurewhen a man has once said that honestly to himself when that glorious heavenly thought it is my duty has risen upon his soul like the sun upon the earth warming his heart and enlightening it and making it bring forth all good and noble fruits then that man will feel a strength come to him and a courage from god above which will conquer all his fears and his selfish love of ease and pleasure and enable him to bear insults and pain and poverty and death itself provided he can but do what is right and be found by god whatever happens to him working gods will where god has put him  this is fortitudethis is true couragethis is christs likenessthis is the courage which weak women on sick beds may have as well as strong men on the battlefield  even when they shrink most from suffering gods spirit will whisper to them it is thy duty it is thy fathers will and then they will find his strength made perfect in their weakness and when their human weakness fails most god will give them heavenly fortitude and they will be able like st paul to say when i am weak then i am strong for i can do all things through christ who strengtheneth me  and now remember that there was no pride no want of feeling to keep up our lords courage  he has tasted sorrow for every man woman and child and therefore he has tasted fear also tempted in all things like as we are that in all things he might be touched with the feeling of our infirmitiesthat there might be no poor soul terrified at the thought of pain or sorrow but could comfort themselves with the thought well the son of god knows what fear is  he who said that his soul was troubledhe who at the thought of death was in such agony of terror that his sweat ran down to the ground like great drops of bloodhe who cried in his agony father if it be possible let this cup pass from mehe understands my painhe tells me not to be ashamed of crying in my pain like him father if it be possible let this cup pass from mefor he will give me the strength to finish that prayer of his and in the midst of my trouble say nevertheless father not as i will but as thou wilt  remember again that our lord was not like the martyrs of old forced to undergo his sufferings whether he liked them or not  we are too apt to forget that and therefore we misunderstand our lords example and therefore we misunderstand what true fortitude is  jesus christ was the son of god he had made the very men who were tormenting him he had made the very wood of the cross on which he hung the iron which pierced his blessed hands and for aught we know one wish of his and they would all have crumbled into dust and he have been safe in a moment  but he would not he endured the cross  he was the only man who ever really endured anything at all because he alone of all men had perfect power to save himself even when he was nailed to the tree fainting bleeding dying  it was never too late for him to stop as he said to peter when he wanted to fight for christ thinkest thou that i cannot pray to my father and he will send me instantly more than twelve legions of angels  but he would not  he had to save the world and he was determined to do it whatever agony or fear it cost him  st peter was a brave man  he drew his sword in the garden and attacked singlehanded that great body of armed soldiers cutting down a servant of the highpriests  but he was only brave our lord was more  the blessed jesus had true fortitude he could bear patiently while peter could only rage and fight uselessly  and see how christs fortitude lasted him while peters mere courage failed him  while our lord was witnessing that glorious confession of his before pilate bearing on through without shrinking even to the cross itself where was peter  he had denied his master and ran shamefully away  he had a long lesson to learn before he was perfect had peter  he had to learn not how to fight but how to sufferand he learnt it and in his old age that strong fierce st peter had true fortitude to give himself up to be crucified like his lord without a murmur and preach christs gospel as he hung for three whole days upon the torturing cross  there was fortitude that violence of his in the garden was only courage as of a brute animalcourage of the flesh not the true courage of the spirit  oh my friends that we could all learn this lesson that it is better to suffer than to revenge better to be killed than to kill  there are times when a man must fightfor his country for just laws for his family but for himself it is very seldom that he must fight  he who returns good for evilhe who when he is cursed blesses those who curse him he who takes joyfully the spoiling of his goods who submits to be cheated in little matters and sometimes in great ones sooner than ruin the poor sinful wretch who has illused him that man has really put on christs likeness that man is really going on to perfection and fulfilling the law of love and for everything he gives up for the sake of peace and mercy which is for gods sake god will reward him sevenfold into his bosom  there are times when a man is bound to go to law bound to expose and punish evildoers lest they should being unpunished become confident and go on from bad to worse and hurt others as well as him  a man sometimes is bound by his duty to his neighbours and to society to defend himself to go to law with those who injure himsometimes but never bound to revenge himself never bound to say he has hurt me and i will pay him off for it at law that is abusing law which is gods ordinance for mere selfish revenge  you may say it is difficult to know which is which when to defend oneself and when not  it is difficult without the light of gods spirit i think no man will know  but let a man live by gods spirit let him pray for kindliness mercifulness manliness and patience for true fortitude to bear and to forbear and god will surely open his eyes to see when he is called on to avenge an injury and when he is called on to suffer patiently  god will shew himif a man wishes to be like christ and to work like christ at doing good god will teach him and guide him in all puzzling matters like this  and do not be afraid of being called cowards and milksops for bearing injuries patientlythose who call you so will be likely to be the greatest cowards themselves  patience is the truest sign of courage  ask old soldiers who have seen real war and they will tell you that the bravest men the men who endured best not in mere fighting but in standing still for hours to be mowed down by cannonshot who were most cheerful and patient in shipwreck and starvation and defeatall things ten times worse than fighting ask old soldiers i say and they will tell you that the men who shewed best in such miseries were generally the stillest and meekest men in the whole regiment  that is true fortitude that is christs imagethe meekest of men and the bravest too  and so books say and seem to prove it by many strange stories that the lion while he is the strongest and bravest of beasts of prey is also the most patient and merciful  he knows his own strength and courage and therefore he does not care to be shewing it off  he can afford to endure an affront  it is only the cowardly cur who flies out and barks at every passerby  and so with our blessed lord  the bible calls him the lion of judah but it also calls him the lamb dumb before the shearers  ah my friends we must come back to him for all the little that is great and noble in man or woman or dumb beast even is perfected in him he only is perfectly great perfectly noble brave meek  he who to save us sinful men endured the cross despising the shame till he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high perfectly brave he is and perfectly gentle and will be so for ever for even at his second coming when he shall appear the conqueror of hell with tens of thousands of angels to take vengeance on those who know not god and destroy the wicked with the breath of his mouth even then in his fiercest anger the scripture tells us his anger shall be the anger of the lamb  almighty vengeance and just anger and yet perfect gentleness and love all the whilemystery of mysteries the wrath of the lamb  may god give us all to feel in that day not the wrath but the love of the lamb who was slain for us    footnotes  1  and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gergesenes there met him two possessed with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man might pass by that way  and behold they cried out saying what have we do with thee jesus thou son of god  art thou come hither to torment us before the time  and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding  so the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine  and he said unto them go  and when they were come out they went into the herd of swine  and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters  2  von stolberg
