27258590	john barleycorn   by  jack london 18761916    1913     chapter i   it all came to me one election day  it was on a warm california afternoon and i had ridden down into the valley of the moon from the ranch to the little village to vote yes and no to a host of proposed amendments to the constitution of the state of california  because of the warmth of the day i had had several drinks before casting my ballot and divers drinks after casting it  then i had ridden up through the vineclad hills and rolling pastures of the ranch and arrived at the farmhouse in time for another drink and supper  how did you vote on the suffrage amendment charmian asked  i voted for it  she uttered an exclamation of surprise  for be it known in my younger days despite my ardent democracy i had been opposed to woman suffrage in my later and more tolerant years i had been unenthusiastic in my acceptance of it as an inevitable social phenomenon  now just why did you vote for it charmian asked  i answered  i answered at length  i answered indignantly  the more i answered the more indignant i became  no i was not drunk  the horse i had ridden was well named the outlaw  id like to see any drunken man ride her  and yethow shall i sayi was lighted up i was feeling good i was pleasantly jingled  when the women get the ballot they will vote for prohibition i said it is the wives and sisters and mothers and they only who will drive the nails into the coffin of john barleycorn  but i thought you were a friend to john barleycorn charmian interpolated  i am  i was  i am not  i never am  i am never less his friend than when he is with me and when i seem most his friend  he is the king of liars  he is the frankest truthsayer  he is the august companion with whom one walks with the gods  he is also in league with the noseless one  his way leads to truth naked and to death  he gives clear vision and muddy dreams  he is the enemy of life and the teacher of wisdom beyond lifes wisdom  he is a redhanded killer and he slays youth  and charmian looked at me and i knew she wondered where i had got it  i continued to talk  as i say i was lighted up  in my brain every thought was at home  every thought in its little cell crouched readydressed at the door like prisoners at midnight waiting a jailbreak  and every thought was a vision brightimaged sharpcut unmistakable  my brain was illuminated by the clear white light of alcohol  john barleycorn was on a truthtelling rampage giving away the choicest secrets on himself  and i was his spokesman  there moved the multitudes of memories of my past life all orderly arranged like soldiers in some vast review  it was mine to pick and choose  i was a lord of thought the master of my vocabulary and of the totality of my experience unerringly capable of selecting my data and building my exposition  for so john barleycorn tricks and lures setting the maggots of intelligence gnawing whispering his fatal intuitions of truth flinging purple passages into the monotony of ones days  i outlined my life to charmian and expounded the makeup of my constitution  i was no hereditary alcoholic  i had been born with no organic chemical predisposition toward alcohol  in this matter i was normal in my generation  alcohol was an acquired taste  it had been painfully acquired  alcohol had been a dreadfully repugnant thingmore nauseous than any physic  even now i did not like the taste of it  i drank it only for its kick and from the age of five to that of twentyfive i had not learned to care for its kick  twenty years of unwilling apprenticeship had been required to make my system rebelliously tolerant of alcohol to make me in the heart and the deeps of me desirous of alcohol  i sketched my first contacts with alcohol told of my first intoxications and revulsions and pointed out always the one thing that in the end had won me overnamely the accessibility of alcohol  not only had it always been accessible but every interest of my developing life had drawn me to it  a newsboy on the streets a sailor a miner a wanderer in far lands always where men came together to exchange ideas to laugh and boast and dare to relax to forget the dull toil of tiresome nights and days always they came together over alcohol  the saloon was the place of congregation  men gathered to it as primitive men gathered about the fire of the squatting place or the fire at the mouth of the cave  i reminded charmian of the canoe houses from which she had been barred in the south pacific where the kinkyhaired cannibals escaped from their womenkind and feasted and drank by themselves the sacred precincts taboo to women under pain of death  as a youth by way of the saloon i had escaped from the narrowness of womans influence into the wide free world of men  all ways led to the saloon  the thousand roads of romance and adventure drew together in the saloon and thence led out and on over the world  the point is i concluded my sermon that it is the accessibility of alcohol that has given me my taste for alcohol  i did not care for it i used to laugh at it  yet here i am at the last possessed with the drinkers desire  it took twenty years to implant that desire and for ten years more that desire has grown  and the effect of satisfying that desire is anything but good  temperamentally i am wholesomehearted and merry  yet when i walk with john barleycorn i suffer all the damnation of intellectual pessimism  but i hastened to add i always hasten to add john barleycorn must have his due  he does tell the truth  that is the curse of it  the socalled truths of life are not true  they are the vital lies by which life lives and john barleycorn gives them the lie  which does not make toward life charmian said  very true i answered  and that is the perfectest hell of it  john barleycorn makes toward death  that is why i voted for the amendment today  i read back in my life and saw how the accessibility of alcohol had given me the taste for it  you see comparatively few alcoholics are born in a generation  and by alcoholic i mean a man whose chemistry craves alcohol and drives him resistlessly to it  the great majority of habitual drinkers are born not only without desire for alcohol but with actual repugnance toward it  not the first nor the twentieth nor the hundredth drink succeeded in giving them the liking  but they learned just as men learn to smoke though it is far easier to learn to smoke than to learn to drink  they learned because alcohol was so accessible the women know the game  they pay for itthe wives and sisters and mothers  and when they come to vote they will vote for prohibition and the best of it is that there will be no hardship worked on the coming generation  not having access to alcohol not being predisposed toward alcohol it will never miss alcohol  it will mean life more abundant for the manhood of the young boys born and growing upay and life more abundant for the young girls born and growing up to share the lives of the young men  why not write all this up for the sake of the men and women coming charmian asked  why not write it so as to help the wives and sisters and mothers to the way they should vote  the memoirs of an alcoholic i sneeredor rather john barleycorn sneered for he sat with me there at table in my pleasant philanthropic jingle and it is a trick of john barleycorn to turn the smile to a sneer without an instants warning  no said charmian ignoring john barleycorns roughness as so many women have learned to do  you have shown yourself no alcoholic no dipsomaniac but merely an habitual drinker one who has made john barleycorns acquaintance through long years of rubbing shoulders with him  write it up and call it alcoholic memoirs     chapter ii   and ere i begin i must ask the reader to walk with me in all sympathy and since sympathy is merely understanding begin by understanding me and whom and what i write about  in the first place i am a seasoned drinker  i have no constitutional predisposition for alcohol  i am not stupid  i am not a swine  i know the drinking game from a to z and i have used my judgment in drinking  i never have to be put to bed  nor do i stagger  in short i am a normal average man and i drink in the normal average way as drinking goes  and this is the very point i am writing of the effects of alcohol on the normal average man  i have no word to say for or about the microscopically unimportant excessivist the dipsomaniac  there are broadly speaking two types of drinkers  there is the man whom we all know stupid unimaginative whose brain is bitten numbly by numb maggots who walks generously with widespread tentative legs falls frequently in the gutter and who sees in the extremity of his ecstasy blue mice and pink elephants  he is the type that gives rise to the jokes in the funny papers  the other type of drinker has imagination vision  even when most pleasantly jingled he walks straight and naturally never staggers nor falls and knows just where he is and what he is doing  it is not his body but his brain that is drunken  he may bubble with wit or expand with good fellowship  or he may see intellectual spectres and phantoms that are cosmic and logical and that take the forms of syllogisms  it is when in this condition that he strips away the husks of lifes healthiest illusions and gravely considers the iron collar of necessity welded about the neck of his soul  this is the hour of john barleycorns subtlest power  it is easy for any man to roll in the gutter  but it is a terrible ordeal for a man to stand upright on his two legs unswaying and decide that in all the universe he finds for himself but one freedomnamely the anticipating of the day of his death  with this man this is the hour of the white logic of which more anon when he knows that he may know only the laws of thingsthe meaning of things never this is his danger hour  his feet are taking hold of the pathway that leads down into the grave  all is clear to him  all these baffling headreaches after immortality are but the panics of souls frightened by the fear of death and cursed with the thricecursed gift of imagination  they have not the instinct for death they lack the will to die when the time to die is at hand they trick themselves into believing they will outwit the game and win to a future leaving the other animals to the darkness of the grave or the annihilating heats of the crematory  but he this man in the hour of his white logic knows that they trick and outwit themselves  the one event happeneth to all alike  there is no new thing under the sun not even that yearnedfor bauble of feeble soulsimmortality  but he knows he knows standing upright on his two legs unswaying  he is compounded of meat and wine and sparkle of sunmote and worlddust a frail mechanism made to run for a span to be tinkered at by doctors of divinity and doctors of physic and to be flung into the scrapheap at the end  of course all this is soulsickness lifesickness  it is the penalty the imaginative man must pay for his friendship with john barleycorn the penalty paid by the stupid man is simpler easier  he drinks himself into sottish unconsciousness  he sleeps a drugged sleep and if he dream his dreams are dim and inarticulate  but to the imaginative man john barleycorn sends the pitiless spectral syllogisms of the white logic  he looks upon life and all its affairs with the jaundiced eye of a pessimistic german philosopher  he sees through all illusions  he transvalues all values  good is bad truth is a cheat and life is a joke  from his calmmad heights with the certitude of a god he beholds all life as evil  wife children friendsin the clear white light of his logic they are exposed as frauds and shams  he sees through them and all that he sees is their frailty their meagreness their sordidness their pitifulness  no longer do they fool him  they are miserable little egotisms like all the other little humans fluttering their mayfly lifedance of an hour  they are without freedom  they are puppets of chance  so is he  he realises that  but there is one difference  he sees he knows  and he knows his one freedom he may anticipate the day of his death  all of which is not good for a man who is made to live and love and be loved  yet suicide quick or slow a sudden spill or a gradual oozing away through the years is the price john barleycorn exacts  no friend of his ever escapes making the just due payment     chapter iii   i was five years old the first time i got drunk  it was on a hot day and my father was ploughing in the field  i was sent from the house half a mile away to carry to him a pail of beer  and be sure you dont spill it was the parting injunction  it was as i remember it a lard pail very wide across the top and without a cover  as i toddled along the beer slopped over the rim upon my legs  and as i toddled i pondered  beer was a very precious thing come to think of it it must be wonderfully good  else why was i never permitted to drink of it in the house  other things kept from me by the grownups i had found good  then this too was good  trust the grownups  they knew  and anyway the pail was too full  i was slopping it against my legs and spilling it on the ground  why waste it and no one would know whether i had drunk or spilled it  i was so small that in order to negotiate the pail i sat down and gathered it into my lap  first i sipped the foam  i was disappointed the preciousness evaded me  evidently it did not reside in the foam besides the taste was not good  then i remembered seeing the grownups blow the foam away before they drank  i buried my face in the foam and lapped the solid liquid beneath  it wasnt good at all  but still i drank  the grownups knew what they were about  considering my diminutiveness the size of the pail in my lap and my drinking out of it my breath held and my face buried to the ears in foam it was rather difficult to estimate how much i drank  also i was gulping it down like medicine in nauseous haste to get the ordeal over  i shuddered when i started on and decided that the good taste would come afterward  i tried several times more in the course of that long halfmile  then astounded by the quantity of beer that was lacking and remembering having seen stale beer made to foam afresh i took a stick and stirred what was left till it foamed to the brim  and my father never noticed  he emptied the pail with the wide thirst of the sweating ploughman returned it to me and started up the plough  i endeavoured to walk beside the horses  i remember tottering and falling against their heels in front of the shining share and that my father hauled back on the lines so violently that the horses nearly sat down on me  he told me afterward that it was by only a matter of inches that i escaped disembowelling  vaguely too i remember my father carried me in his arms to the trees on the edge of the field while all the world reeled and swung about me and i was aware of deadly nausea mingled with an appalling conviction of sin  i slept the afternoon away under the trees and when my father roused me at sundown it was a very sick little boy that got up and dragged wearily homeward  i was exhausted oppressed by the weight of my limbs and in my stomach was a harplike vibrating that extended to my throat and brain  my condition was like that of one who had gone through a battle with poison  in truth i had been poisoned  in the weeks and months that followed i had no more interest in beer than in the kitchen stove after it had burned me  the grownups were right beer was not for children  the grownups didnt mind it but neither did they mind taking pills and castor oil  as for me i could manage to get along quite well without beer  yes and to the day of my death i could have managed to get along quite well without it  but circumstance decreed otherwise  at every turn in the world in which i lived john barleycorn beckoned  there was no escaping him  all paths led to him and it took twenty years of contact of exchanging greetings and passing on with my tongue in my cheek to develop in me a sneaking liking for the rascal     chapter iv   my next bout with john barleycorn occurred when i was seven  this time my imagination was at fault and i was frightened into the encounter still farming my family had moved to a ranch on the bleak sad coast of san mateo county south of san francisco  it was a wild primitive countryside in those days and often i heard my mother pride herself that we were old american stock and not immigrant irish and italians like our neighbours  in all our section there was only one other old american family  one sunday morning found me how or why i cannot now remember at the morrisey ranch  a number of young people had gathered there from the nearer ranches  besides the oldsters had been there drinking since early dawn and some of them since the night before  the morriseys were a huge breed and there were many strapping great sons and uncles heavybooted bigfisted roughvoiced  suddenly there were screams from the girls and cries of fight there was a rush  men hurled themselves out of the kitchen  two giants flushfaced with greying hair were locked in each others arms  one was black matt who everybody said had killed two men in his time  the women screamed softly crossed themselves or prayed brokenly hiding their eyes and peeping through their fingers  but not i  it is a fair presumption that i was the most interested spectator  maybe i would see that wonderful thing a man killed  anyway i would see a manfight great was my disappointment  black matt and tom morrisey merely held on to each other and lifted their clumsybooted feet in what seemed a grotesque elephantine dance  they were too drunk to fight  then the peacemakers got hold of them and led them back to cement the new friendship in the kitchen  soon they were all talking at once rumbling and roaring as bigchested openair men will when whisky has whipped their taciturnity  and i a little shaver of seven my heart in my mouth my trembling body strung tense as a deers on the verge of flight peered wonderingly in at the open door and learned more of the strangeness of men  and i marvelled at black matt and tom morrisey sprawled over the table arms about each others necks weeping lovingly  the kitchendrinking continued and the girls outside grew timorous they knew the drink game and all were certain that something terrible was going to happen  they protested that they did not wish to be there when it happened and some one suggested going to a big italian rancho four miles away where they could get up a dance  immediately they paired off lad and lassie and started down the sandy road  and each lad walked with his sweethearttrust a child of seven to listen and to know the loveaffairs of his countryside  and behold i too was a lad with a lassie  a little irish girl of my own age had been paired off with me  we were the only children in this spontaneous affair  perhaps the oldest couple might have been twenty  there were chits of girls quite grown up of fourteen and sixteen walking with their fellows  but we were uniquely young this little irish girl and i and we walked hand in hand and sometimes under the tutelage of our elders with my arm around her waist  only that wasnt comfortable  and i was very proud on that bright sunday morning going down the long bleak road among the sandhills  i too had my girl and was a little man  the italian rancho was a bachelor establishment  our visit was hailed with delight  the red wine was poured in tumblers for all and the long diningroom was partly cleared for dancing  and the young fellows drank and danced with the girls to the strains of an accordion  to me that music was divine  i had never heard anything so glorious  the young italian who furnished it would even get up and dance his arms around his girl playing the accordion behind her back  all of which was very wonderful for me who did not dance but who sat at a table and gazed wideeyed at the amazingness of life  i was only a little lad and there was so much of life for me to learn  as the time passed the irish lads began helping themselves to the wine and jollity and high spirits reigned  i noted that some of them staggered and fell down in the dances and that one had gone to sleep in a corner  also some of the girls were complaining and wanting to leave and others of the girls were titteringly complacent willing for anything to happen  when our italian hosts had offered me wine in a general sort of way i had declined  my beer experience had been enough for me and i had no inclination to traffic further in the stuff or in anything related to it  unfortunately one young italian peter an impish soul seeing me sitting solitary stirred by a whim of the moment halffilled a tumbler with wine and passed it to me  he was sitting across the table from me i declined  his face grew stern and he insistently proffered the wine and then terror descended upon mea terror which i must explain  my mother had theories  first she steadfastly maintained that brunettes and all the tribe of darkeyed humans were deceitful  needless to say my mother was a blonde  next she was convinced that the darkeyed latin races were profoundly sensitive profoundly treacherous and profoundly murderous  again and again drinking in the strangeness and the fearsomeness of the world from her lips i had heard her state that if one offended an italian no matter how slightly and unintentionally he was certain to retaliate by stabbing one in the back  that was her particular phrasestab you in the back  now although i had been eager to see black matt kill tom morrisey that morning i did not care to furnish to the dancers the spectacle of a knife sticking in my back  i had not yet learned to distinguish between facts and theories  my faith was implicit in my mothers exposition of the italian character  besides i had some glimmering inkling of the sacredness of hospitality  here was a treacherous sensitive murderous italian offering me hospitality  i had been taught to believe that if i offended him he would strike at me with a knife precisely as a horse kicked out when one got too close to its heels and worried it  then too this italian peter had those terrible black eyes i had heard my mother talk about  they were eyes different from the eyes i knew from the blues and greys and hazels of my own family from the pale and genial blues of the irish  perhaps peter had had a few drinks  at any rate his eyes were brilliantly black and sparkling with devilry  they were the mysterious the unknown and who was i a sevenyearold to analyse them and know their prankishness in them i visioned sudden death and i declined the wine halfheartedly  the expression in his eyes changed they grew stern and imperious as he shoved the tumbler of wine closer  what could i do i have faced real death since in my life but never have i known the fear of death as i knew it then  i put the glass to my lips and peters eyes relented  i knew he would not kill me just then  that was a relief  but the wine was not  it was cheap new wine bitter and sour made of the leavings and scrapings of the vineyards and the vats and it tasted far worse than beer  there is only one way to take medicine and that is to take it  and that is the way i took that wine i threw my head back and gulped it down  i had to gulp again and hold the poison down for poison it was to my childs tissues and membranes  looking back now i can realise that peter was astounded  he halffilled a second tumbler and shoved it across the table  frozen with fear in despair at the fate which had befallen me i gulped the second glass down like the first  this was too much for peter  he must share the infant prodigy he had discovered  he called dominick a young moustached italian to see the sight  this time it was a full tumbler that was given me  one will do anything to live  i gripped myself mastered the qualms that rose in my throat and downed the stuff  dominick had never seen an infant of such heroic calibre  twice again he refilled the tumbler each time to the brim and watched it disappear down my throat  by this time my exploits were attracting attention middleaged italian labourers oldcountry peasants who did not talk english and who could not dance with the irish girls surrounded me they were swarthy and wildlooking they wore belts and red shirts and i knew they carried knives and they ringed me around like a pirate chorus and peter and dominick made me show off for them  had i lacked imagination had i been stupid had i been stubbornly mulish in having my own way i should never have got in this pickle  and the lads and lassies were dancing and there was no one to save me from my fate  how much i drank i do not know  my memory of it is of an agelong suffering of fear in the midst of a murderous crew and of an infinite number of glasses of red wine passing across the bare boards of a winedrenched table and going down my burning throat  bad as the wine was a knife in the back was worse and i must survive at any cost  looking back with the drinkers knowledge i know now why i did not collapse stupefied upon the table  as i have said i was frozen i was paralysed with fear  the only movement i made was to convey that neverending procession of glasses to my lips  i was a poised and motionless receptacle for all that quantity of wine  it lay inert in my fearinert stomach  i was too frightened even for my stomach to turn so all that italian crew looked on and marvelled at the infant phenomenon that downed wine with the sangfroid of an automaton  it is not in the spirit of braggadocio that i dare to assert they had never seen anything like it  the time came to go  the tipsy antics of the lads had led a majority of the sobererminded lassies to compel a departure  i found myself at the door beside my little maiden  she had not had my experience so she was sober  she was fascinated by the titubations of the lads who strove to walk beside their girls and began to mimic them  i thought this a great game and i too began to stagger tipsily  but she had no wine to stir up while my movements quickly set the fumes rising to my head  even at the start i was more realistic than she  in several minutes i was astonishing myself  i saw one lad after reeling half a dozen steps pause at the side of the road gravely peer into the ditch and gravely and after apparent deep thought fall into it  to me this was excruciatingly funny  i staggered to the edge of the ditch fully intending to stop on the edge  i came to myself in the ditch in process of being hauled out by several anxiousfaced girls  i didnt care to play at being drunk any more  there was no more fun in me  my eyes were beginning to swim and with wideopen mouth i panted for air  a girl led me by the hand on either side but my legs were leaden  the alcohol i had drunk was striking my heart and brain like a club  had i been a weakling of a child i am confident that it would have killed me  as it was i know i was nearer death than any of the scared girls dreamed  i could hear them bickering among themselves as to whose fault it was some were weepingfor themselves for me and for the disgraceful way their lads had behaved  but i was not interested  i was suffocating and i wanted air  to move was agony  it made me pant harder  yet those girls persisted in making me walk and it was four miles home  four miles i remember my swimming eyes saw a small bridge across the road an infinite distance away  in fact it was not a hundred feet distant  when i reached it i sank down and lay on my back panting the girls tried to lift me but i was helpless and suffocating  their cries of alarm brought larry a drunken youth of seventeen who proceeded to resuscitate me by jumping on my chest  dimly i remember this and the squalling of the girls as they struggled with him and dragged him away and then i knew nothing though i learned afterward that larry wound up under the bridge and spent the night there  when i came to it was dark  i had been carried unconscious for four miles and been put to bed  i was a sick child and despite the terrible strain on my heart and tissues i continually relapsed into the madness of delirium  all the contents of the terrible and horrible in my childs mind spilled out  the most frightful visions were realities to me  i saw murders committed and i was pursued by murderers  i screamed and raved and fought  my sufferings were prodigious  emerging from such delirium i would hear my mothers voice but the childs brain  he will lose his reason and sinking back into delirium i would take the idea with me and be immured in madhouses and be beaten by keepers and surrounded by screeching lunatics  one thing that had strongly impressed my young mind was the talk of my elders about the dens of iniquity in san franciscos chinatown  in my delirium i wandered deep beneath the ground through a thousand of these dens and behind locked doors of iron i suffered and died a thousand deaths  and when i would come upon my father seated at table in these subterranean crypts gambling with chinese for great stakes of gold all my outrage gave vent in the vilest cursing  i would rise in bed struggling against the detaining hands and curse my father till the rafters rang  all the inconceivable filth a child running at large in a primitive countryside may hear men utter was mine and though i had never dared utter such oaths they now poured from me at the top of my lungs as i cursed my father sitting there underground and gambling with longhaired longnailed chinamen  it is a wonder that i did not burst my heart or brain that night  a sevenyearold childs arteries and nervecentres are scarcely fitted to endure the terrific paroxysms that convulsed me  no one slept in the thin frame farmhouse that night when john barleycorn had his will of me  and larry under the bridge had no delirium like mine  i am confident that his sleep was stupefied and dreamless and that he awoke next day merely to heaviness and moroseness and that if he lives today he does not remember that night so passing was it as an incident  but my brain was seared for ever by that experience  writing now thirty years afterward every vision is as distinct as sharpcut every pain as vital and terrible as on that night  i was sick for days afterward and i needed none of my mothers injunctions to avoid john barleycorn in the future  my mother had been dreadfully shocked  she held that i had done wrong very wrong and that i had gone contrary to all her teaching  and how was i who was never allowed to talk back who lacked the very words with which to express my psychologyhow was i to tell my mother that it was her teaching that was directly responsible for my drunkenness had it not been for her theories about dark eyes and italian character i should never have wet my lips with the sour bitter wine  and not until mangrown did i tell her the true inwardness of that disgraceful affair  in those after days of sickness i was confused on some points and very clear on others  i felt guilty of sin yet smarted with a sense of injustice  it had not been my fault yet i had done wrong  but very clear was my resolution never to touch liquor again  no mad dog was ever more afraid of water than was i of alcohol  yet the point i am making is that this experience terrible as it was could not in the end deter me from forming john barleycorns cheekbyjowl acquaintance  all about me even then were the forces moving me toward him  in the first place barring my mother ever extreme in her views it seemed to me all the grownups looked upon the affair with tolerant eyes  it was a joke something funny that had happened  there was no shame attached  even the lads and lassies giggled and snickered over their part in the affair narrating with gusto how larry had jumped on my chest and slept under the bridge how soandso had slept out in the sandhills that night and what had happened to the other lad who fell in the ditch  as i say so far as i could see there was no shame anywhere  it had been something ticklishly devilishly finea bright and gorgeous episode in the monotony of life and labour on that bleak foggirt coast  the irish ranchers twitted me goodnaturedly on my exploit and patted me on the back until i felt that i had done something heroic  peter and dominick and the other italians were proud of my drinking prowess  the face of morality was not set against drinking  besides everybody drank there was not a teetotaler in the community  even the teacher of our little country school a greying man of fifty gave us vacations on the occasions when he wrestled with john barleycorn and was thrown  thus there was no spiritual deterrence  my loathing for alcohol was purely physiological  i didnt like the damned stuff     chapter v   this physical loathing for alcohol i have never got over  but i have conquered it  to this day i conquer it every time i take a drink  the palate never ceases to rebel and the palate can be trusted to know what is good for the body  but men do not drink for the effect alcohol produces on the body  what they drink for is the braineffect and if it must come through the body so much the worse for the body  and yet despite my physical loathing for alcohol the brightest spots in my child life were the saloons  sitting on the heavy potato wagons wrapped in fog feet stinging from inactivity the horses plodding slowly along the deep road through the sandhills one bright vision made the way never too long  the bright vision was the saloon at colma where my father or whoever drove always got out to get a drink  and i got out to warm by the great stove and get a soda cracker  just one soda cracker but a fabulous luxury  saloons were good for something  back behind the plodding horses i would take an hour in consuming that one cracker  i took the smallest nibbles never losing a crumb and chewed the nibble till it became the thinnest and most delectable of pastes  i never voluntarily swallowed this paste  i just tasted it and went on tasting it turning it over with my tongue spreading it on the inside of this cheek then on the inside of the other cheek until at the end it eluded me and in tiny drops and oozelets slipped and dribbled down my throat  horace fletcher had nothing on me when it came to soda crackers  i liked saloons  especially i liked the san francisco saloons  they had the most delicious dainties for the takingstrange breads and crackers cheeses sausages sardineswonderful foods that i never saw on our meagre hometable  and once i remember a barkeeper mixed me a sweet temperance drink of syrup and sodawater  my father did not pay for it it was the barkeepers treat and he became my ideal of a good kind man i dreamed daydreams of him for years  although i was seven years old at the time i can see him now with undiminished clearness though i never laid eyes on him but that one time  the saloon was south of market street in san francisco  it stood on the west side of the street  as you entered the bar was on the left  on the right against the wall was the free lunch counter  it was a long narrow room and at the rear beyond the beer kegs on tap were small round tables and chairs  the barkeeper was blueeyed and had fair silky hair peeping out from under a black silk skullcap  i remember he wore a brown cardigan jacket and i know precisely the spot in the midst of the array of bottles from which he took the bottle of redcoloured syrup  he and my father talked long and i sipped my sweet drink and worshipped him  and for years afterward i worshipped the memory of him  despite my two disastrous experiences here was john barleycorn prevalent and accessible everywhere in the community luring and drawing me  here were connotations of the saloon making deep indentations in a childs mind  here was a child forming its first judgments of the world finding the saloon a delightful and desirable place  stores nor public buildings nor all the dwellings of men ever opened their doors to me and let me warm by their fires or permitted me to eat the food of the gods from narrow shelves against the wall  their doors were ever closed to me the saloons doors were ever open  and always and everywhere i found saloons on highway and byway up narrow alleys and on busy thoroughfares brightlighted and cheerful warm in winter and in summer dark and cool  yes the saloon was a mighty fine place and it was more than that  by the time i was ten years old my family had abandoned ranching and gone to live in the city  and here at ten i began on the streets as a newsboy  one of the reasons for this was that we needed the money another reason was that i needed the exercise  i had found my way to the free public library and was reading myself into nervous prostration  on the poor ranches on which i had lived there had been no books  in ways truly miraculous i had been lent four books marvellous books and them i had devoured  one was the life of garfield the second paul du chaillus african travels the third a novel by ouida with the last forty pages missing and the fourth irvings alhambra this last had been lent me by a schoolteacher  i was not a forward child  unlike oliver twist i was incapable of asking for more  when i returned the alhambra to the teacher i hoped she would lend me another book  and because she did notmost likely she deemed me unappreciativei cried all the way home on the threemile tramp from the school to the ranch i waited and yearned for her to lend me another book  scores of times i nerved myself almost to the point of asking her but never quite reached the necessary pitch of effrontery  and then came the city of oakland and on the shelves of that free library i discovered all the great world beyond the skyline  here were thousands of books as good as my four wonderbooks and some were even better  libraries were not concerned with children in those days and i had strange adventures  i remember in the catalogue being impressed by the title the adventures of peregrine pickle i filled an application blank and the librarian handed me the collected and entirely unexpurgated works of smollett in one huge volume  i read everything but principally history and adventure and all the old travels and voyages  i read mornings afternoons and nights  i read in bed i read at table i read as i walked to and from school and i read at recess while the other boys were playing  i began to get the jerks to everybody i replied go away  you make me nervous  and so at ten i was out on the streets a newsboy  i had no time to read  i was busy getting exercise and learning how to fight busy learning forwardness and brass and bluff  i had an imagination and a curiosity about all things that made me plastic  not least among the things i was curious about was the saloon  and i was in and out of many a one  i remember in those days on the east side of broadway between sixth and seventh from corner to corner there was a solid block of saloons  in the saloons life was different  men talked with great voices laughed great laughs and there was an atmosphere of greatness  here was something more than common everyday where nothing happened  here life was always very live and sometimes even lurid when blows were struck and blood was shed and big policemen came shouldering in  great moments these for me my head filled with all the wild and valiant fighting of the gallant adventurers on sea and land  there were no big moments when i trudged along the street throwing my papers in at doors but in the saloons even the sots stupefied sprawling across the tables or in the sawdust were objects of mystery and wonder  and more the saloons were right  the city fathers sanctioned them and licensed them  they were not the terrible places i heard boys deem them who lacked my opportunities to know  terrible they might be but then that only meant they were terribly wonderful and it is the terribly wonderful that a boy desires to know  in the same way pirates and shipwrecks and battles were terrible and what healthy boy wouldnt give his immortal soul to participate in such affairs  besides in saloons i saw reporters editors lawyers judges whose names and faces i knew  they put the seal of social approval on the saloon  they verified my own feeling of fascination in the saloon they too must have found there that something different that something beyond which i sensed and groped after  what it was i did not know yet there it must be for there men focused like buzzing flies about a honey pot  i had no sorrows and the world was very bright so i could not guess that what these men sought was forgetfulness of jaded toil and stale grief  not that i drank at that time  from ten to fifteen i rarely tasted liquor but i was intimately in contact with drinkers and drinking places  the only reason i did not drink was because i didnt like the stuff  as the time passed i worked as boyhelper on an icewagon set up pins in a bowling alley with a saloon attached and swept out saloons at sunday picnic grounds  big jovial josie harper ran a road house at telegraph avenue and thirtyninth street  here for a year i delivered an evening paper until my route was changed to the waterfront and tenderloin of oakland  the first month when i collected josie harpers bill she poured me a glass of wine  i was ashamed to refuse so i drank it  but after that i watched the chance when she wasnt around so as to collect from her barkeeper  the first day i worked in the bowling alley the barkeeper according to custom called us boys up to have a drink after we had been setting up pins for several hours  the others asked for beer  i said id take ginger ale  the boys snickered and i noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange searching scrutiny  nevertheless he opened a bottle of ginger ale  afterward back in the alleys in the pauses between games the boys enlightened me  i had offended the barkeeper  a bottle of ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer and it was up to me if i wanted to hold my job to drink beer  besides beer was food  i could work better on it  there was no food in ginger ale  after that when i couldnt sneak out of it i drank beer and wondered what men found in it that was so good  i was always aware that i was missing something  what i really liked in those days was candy for five cents i could buy five cannonballsbig lumps of the most delicious lastingness  i could chew and worry a single one for an hour  then there was a mexican who sold big slabs of brown chewing taffy for five cents each  it required a quarter of a day properly to absorb one of them  and many a day i made my entire lunch off one of those slabs  in truth i found food there but not in beer     chapter vi   but the time was rapidly drawing near when i was to begin my second series of bouts with john barleycorn  when i was fourteen my head filled with the tales of the old voyagers my vision with tropic isles and far searims i was sailing a small centreboard skiff around san francisco bay and on the oakland estuary  i wanted to go to sea  i wanted to get away from monotony and the commonplace  i was in the flower of my adolescence athrill with romance and adventure dreaming of wild life in the wild manworld  little i guessed how all the warp and woof of that manworld was entangled with alcohol  so one day as i hoisted sail on my skiff i met scotty  he was a husky youngster of seventeen a runaway apprentice he told me from an english ship in australia  he had just worked his way on another ship to san francisco and now he wanted to see about getting a berth on a whaler across the estuary near where the whalers lay was lying the sloopyacht idler  the caretaker was a harpooner who intended sailing next voyage on the whale ship bonanza  would i take him scotty over in my skiff to call upon the harpooner  would i hadnt i heard the stories and rumours about the idlerthe big sloop that had come up from the sandwich islands where it had been engaged in smuggling opium  and the harpooner who was caretaker how often had i seen him and envied him his freedom  he never had to leave the water  he slept aboard the idler each night while i had to go home upon the land to go to bed  the harpooner was only nineteen years old and i have never had anything but his own word that he was a harpooner but he had been too shining and glorious a personality for me ever to address as i paddled around the yacht at a wistful distance  would i take scotty the runaway sailor to visit the harpooner on the opiumsmuggler idler  would i  the harpooner came on deck to answer our hail and invited us aboard  i played the sailor and the man fending off the skiff so that it would not mar the yachts white paint dropping the skiff astern on a long painter and making the painter fast with two nonchalant halfhitches  we went below  it was the first seainterior i had ever seen  the clothing on the wall smelled musty  but what of that was it not the seagear of menleather jackets lined with corduroy blue coats of pilot cloth souwesters seaboots oilskins  and everywhere was in evidence the economy of spacethe narrow bunks the swinging tables the incredible lockers  there were the telltale compass the sealamps in their gimbals the bluebacked charts carelessly rolled and tucked away the signalflags in alphabetical order and a mariners dividers jammed into the woodwork to hold a calendar  at last i was living  here i sat inside my first ship a smuggler accepted as a comrade by a harpooner and a runaway english sailor who said his name was scotty  the first thing that the harpooner aged nineteen and the sailor aged seventeen did to show that they were men was to behave like men  the harpooner suggested the eminent desirableness of a drink and scotty searched his pockets for dimes and nickels  then the harpooner carried away a pink flask to be filled in some blind pig for there were no licensed saloons in that locality  we drank the cheap rotgut out of tumblers  was i any the less strong any the less valiant than the harpooner and the sailor  they were men  they proved it by the way they drank  drink was the badge of manhood  so i drank with them drink by drink raw and straight though the damned stuff couldnt compare with a stick of chewing taffy or a delectable cannonball i shuddered and swallowed my gorge with every drink though i manfully hid all such symptoms  divers times we filled the flask that afternoon  all i had was twenty cents but i put it up like a man though with secret regret at the enormous store of candy it could have bought  the liquor mounted in the heads of all of us and the talk of scotty and the harpooner was upon running the easting down gales off the horn and pamperos off the plate lower topsail breezes southerly busters north pacific gales and of smashed whaleboats in the arctic ice  you cant swim in that ice water said the harpooner confidentially to me  you double up in a minute and go down  when a whale smashes your boat the thing to do is to get your belly across an oar so that when the cold doubles you youll float  sure i said with a grateful nod and an air of certitude that i too would hunt whales and be in smashed boats in the arctic ocean  and truly i registered his advice as singularly valuable information and filed it away in my brain where it persists to this day  but i couldnt talkat first  heavens i was only fourteen and had never been on the ocean in my life  i could only listen to the two seadogs and show my manhood by drinking with them fairly and squarely drink and drink  the liquor worked its will with me the talk of scotty and the harpooner poured through the pent space of the idlers cabin and through my brain like great gusts of wide free wind and in imagination i lived my years to come and rocked over the wild mad glorious world on multitudinous adventures  we unbent  our inhibitions and taciturnities vanished  we were as if we had known each other for years and years and we pledged ourselves to years of future voyagings together  the harpooner told of misadventures and secret shames  scotty wept over his poor old mother in edinburgha lady he insisted gently bornwho was in reduced circumstances who had pinched herself to pay the lump sum to the shipowners for his apprenticeship whose sacrificing dream had been to see him a merchantman officer and a gentleman and who was heartbroken because he had deserted his ship in australia and joined another as a common sailor before the mast  and scotty proved it  he drew her last sad letter from his pocket and wept over it as he read it aloud  the harpooner and i wept with him and swore that all three of us would ship on the whaleship bonanza win a big payday and still together make a pilgrimage to edinburgh and lay our store of money in the dear ladys lap  and as john barleycorn heated his way into my brain thawing my reticence melting my modesty talking through me and with me and as me my adopted twin brother and alter ego i too raised my voice to show myself a man and an adventurer and bragged in detail and at length of how i had crossed san francisco bay in my open skiff in a roaring southwester when even the schooner sailors doubted my exploit  further ior john barleycorn for it was the same thingtold scotty that he might be a deepsea sailor and know the last rope on the great deepsea ships but that when it came to smallboat sailing i could beat him hands down and sail circles around him  the best of it was that my assertion and brag were true  with reticence and modesty present i could never have dared tell scotty my smallboat estimate of him  but it is ever the way of john barleycorn to loosen the tongue and babble the secret thought  scotty or john barleycorn or the pair was very naturally offended by my remarks  nor was i loath  i could whip any runaway sailor seventeen years old  scotty and i flared and raged like young cockerels until the harpooner poured another round of drinks to enable us to forgive and make up  which we did arms around each others necks protesting vows of eternal friendshipjust like black matt and tom morrisey i remembered in the ranch kitchen in san mateo  and remembering i knew that i was at last a mandespite my meagre fourteen yearsa man as big and manly as those two strapping giants who had quarrelled and made up on that memorable sunday morning of long ago  by this time the singing stage was reached and i joined scotty and the harpooner in snatches of sea songs and chanties  it was here in the cabin of the idler that i first heard blow the man down flying cloud and whisky johnny whisky oh it was brave  i was beginning to grasp the meaning of life  here was no commonplace no oakland estuary no weary round of throwing newspapers at front doors delivering ice and setting up ninepins  all the world was mine all its paths were under my feet and john barleycorn tricking my fancy enabled me to anticipate the life of adventure for which i yearned  we were not ordinary  we were three tipsy young gods incredibly wise gloriously genial and without limit to our powers  ahand i say it now after the yearscould john barleycorn keep one at such a height i should never draw a sober breath again  but this is not a world of free freights  one pays according to an iron schedulefor every strength the balanced weakness for every high a corresponding low for every fictitious godlike moment an equivalent time in reptilian slime  for every feat of telescoping long days and weeks of life into mad magnificent instants one must pay with shortened life and ofttimes with savage usury added  intenseness and duration are as ancient enemies as fire and water  they are mutually destructive  they cannot coexist  and john barleycorn mighty necromancer though he be is as much a slave to organic chemistry as we mortals are  we pay for every nerve marathon we run nor can john barleycorn intercede and fend off the just payment  he can lead us to the heights but he cannot keep us there else would we all be devotees and there is no devotee but pays for the mad dances john barleycorn pipes  yet the foregoing is all in after wisdom spoken  it was no part of the knowledge of the lad fourteen years old who sat in the idlers cabin between the harpooner and the sailor the air rich in his nostrils with the musty smell of mens seagear roaring in chorus yankee ship come down de ribberpull my bully boys pull  we grew maudlin and all talked and shouted at once  i had a splendid constitution a stomach that would digest scrapiron and i was still running my marathon in full vigour when scotty began to fail and fade his talk grew incoherent  he groped for words and could not find them while the ones he found his lips were unable to form  his poisoned consciousness was leaving him  the brightness went out of his eyes and he looked as stupid as were his efforts to talk  his face and body sagged as his consciousness sagged  a man cannot sit upright save by an act of will  scottys reeling brain could not control his muscles  all his correlations were breaking down  he strove to take another drink and feebly dropped the tumbler on the floor  then to my amazement weeping bitterly he rolled into a bunk on his back and immediately snored off to sleep  the harpooner and i drank on grinning in a superior way to each other over scottys plight  the last flask was opened and we drank it between us to the accompaniment of scottys stertorous breathing  then the harpooner faded away into his bunk and i was left alone unthrown on the field of battle  i was very proud and john barleycorn was proud with me  i could carry my drink  i was a man  i had drunk two men drink for drink into unconsciousness  and i was still on my two feet upright making my way on deck to get air into my scorching lungs  it was in this bout on the idler that i discovered what a good stomach and a strong head i had for drinka bit of knowledge that was to be a source of pride in succeeding years and that ultimately i was to come to consider a great affliction the fortunate man is the one who cannot take more than a couple of drinks without becoming intoxicated  the unfortunate wight is the one who can take many glasses without betraying a sign who must take numerous glasses in order to get the kick  the sun was setting when i came on the idlers deck  there were plenty of bunks below  i did not need to go home  but i wanted to demonstrate to myself how much i was a man  there lay my skiff astern  the last of a strong ebb was running out in channel in the teeth of an ocean breeze of forty miles an hour  i could see the stiff whitecaps and the suck and run of the current was plainly visible in the face and trough of each one  i set sail cast off took my place at the tiller the sheet in my hand and headed across channel  the skiff heeled over and plunged into it madly  the spray began to fly  i was at the pinnacle of exaltation  i sang blow the man down as i sailed  i was no boy of fourteen living the mediocre ways of the sleepy town called oakland  i was a man a god and the very elements rendered me allegiance as i bitted them to my will  the tide was out  a full hundred yards of soft mud intervened between the boatwharf and the water  i pulled up my centreboard ran full tilt into the mud took in sail and standing in the stern as i had often done at low tide i began to shove the skiff with an oar  it was then that my correlations began to break down  i lost my balance and pitched headforemost into the ooze  then and for the first time as i floundered to my feet covered with slime the blood running down my arms from a scrape against a barnacled stake i knew that i was drunk  but what of it across the channel two strong sailormen lay unconscious in their bunks where i had drunk them  i was a man  i was still on my legs if they were kneedeep in mud  i disdained to get back into the skiff  i waded through the mud shoving the skiff before me and yammering the chant of my manhood to the world  i paid for it  i was sick for a couple of days meanly sick and my arms were painfully poisoned from the barnacle scratches  for a week i could not use them and it was a torture to put on and take off my clothes  i swore never again the game wasnt worth it  the price was too stiff  i had no moral qualms  my revulsion was purely physical  no exalted moments were worth such hours of misery and wretchedness  when i got back to my skiff i shunned the idler  i would cross the opposite side of the channel to go around her  scotty had disappeared  the harpooner was still about but him i avoided  once when he landed on the boatwharf i hid in a shed so as to escape seeing him  i was afraid he would propose some more drinking maybe have a flask full of whisky in his pocket  and yetand here enters the necromancy of john barleycornthat afternoons drunk on the idler had been a purple passage flung into the monotony of my days  it was memorable  my mind dwelt on it continually i went over the details over and over again  among other things i had got into the cogs and springs of mens actions  i had seen scotty weep about his own worthlessness and the sad case of his edinburgh mother who was a lady  the harpooner had told me terribly wonderful things of himself  i had caught a myriad enticing and inflammatory hints of a world beyond my world and for which i was certainly as fitted as the two lads who had drunk with me  i had got behind mens souls  i had got behind my own soul and found unguessed potencies and greatnesses  yes that day stood out above all my other days  to this day it so stands out  the memory of it is branded in my brain  but the price exacted was too high  i refused to play and pay and returned to my cannonballs and taffyslabs  the point is that all the chemistry of my healthy normal body drove me away from alcohol  the stuff didnt agree with me  it was abominable  but despite this circumstance was to continue to drive me toward john barleycorn to drive me again and again until after long years the time should come when i would look up john barleycorn in every haunt of menlook him up and hail him gladly as benefactor and friend  and detest and hate him all the time  yes he is a strange friend john barleycorn     chapter vii   i was barely turned fifteen and working long hours in a cannery  month in and month out the shortest day i ever worked was ten hours  when to ten hours of actual work at a machine is added the noon hour the walking to work and walking home from work the getting up in the morning dressing and eating the eating at night undressing and going to bed there remains no more than the nine hours out of the twentyfour required by a healthy youngster for sleep  out of those nine hours after i was in bed and ere my eyes drowsed shut i managed to steal a little time for reading  but many a night i did not knock off work until midnight  on occasion i worked eighteen and twenty hours on a stretch  once i worked at my machine for thirtysix consecutive hours  and there were weeks on end when i never knocked off work earlier than eleven oclock got home and in bed at half after midnight and was called at halfpast five to dress eat walk to work and be at my machine at seven oclock whistle blow  no moments here to be stolen for my beloved books  and what had john barleycorn to do with such strenuous stoic toil of a lad just turned fifteen he had everything to do with it  let me show you  i asked myself if this were the meaning of lifeto be a workbeast i knew of no horse in the city of oakland that worked the hours i worked  if this were living i was entirely unenamoured of it  i remembered my skiff lying idle and accumulating barnacles at the boatwharf i remembered the wind that blew every day on the bay the sunrises and sunsets i never saw the bite of the salt air in my nostrils the bite of the salt water on my flesh when i plunged overside i remembered all the beauty and the wonder and the sensedelights of the world denied me  there was only one way to escape my deadening toil  i must get out and away on the water i must earn my bread on the water  and the way of the water led inevitably to john barleycorn  i did not know this  and when i did learn it i was courageous enough not to retreat back to my bestial life at the machine  i wanted to be where the winds of adventure blew  and the winds of adventure blew the oyster pirate sloops up and down san francisco bay from raided oysterbeds and fights at night on shoal and flat to markets in the morning against city wharves where peddlers and saloonkeepers came down to buy  every raid on an oysterbed was a felony  the penalty was state imprisonment the stripes and the lockstep  and what of that the men in stripes worked a shorter day than i at my machine  and there was vastly more romance in being an oyster pirate or a convict than in being a machine slave  and behind it all behind all of me with youth abubble whispered romance adventure  so i interviewed my mammy jennie my old nurse at whose black breast i had suckled  she was more prosperous than my folks  she was nursing sick people at a good weekly wage  would she lend her white child the money  would she  what she had was mine  then i sought out french frank the oyster pirate who wanted to sell i had heard his sloop the razzle dazzle  i found him lying at anchor on the alameda side of the estuary near the webster street bridge with visitors aboard whom he was entertaining with afternoon wine  he came on deck to talk business  he was willing to sell  but it was sunday besides he had guests  on the morrow he would make out the bill of sale and i could enter into possession and in the meantime i must come below and meet his friends  they were two sisters mamie and tess a mrs hadley who chaperoned them whisky bob a youthful oyster pirate of sixteen and spider healey a blackwhiskered wharfrat of twenty mamie who was spiders niece was called the queen of the oyster pirates and on occasion presided at their revels  french frank was in love with her though i did not know it at the time and she steadfastly refused to marry him  french frank poured a tumbler of red wine from a big demijohn to drink to our transaction  i remembered the red wine of the italian rancho and shuddered inwardly  whisky and beer were not quite so repulsive  but the queen of the oyster pirates was looking at me a partemptied glass in her own hand  i had my pride  if i was only fifteen at least i could not show myself any less a man than she  besides there were her sister and mrs hadley and the young oyster pirate and the whiskered wharfrat all with glasses in their hands  was i a milkandwater sop no a thousand times no and a thousand glasses no  i downed the tumblerful like a man  french frank was elated by the sale which i had bound with a twentydollar goldpiece  he poured more wine  i had learned my strong head and stomach and i was certain i could drink with them in a temperate way and not poison myself for a week to come  i could stand as much as they and besides they had already been drinking for some time  we got to singing  spider sang the boston burglar and black lulu the queen sang then i wisht i were a little bird and her sister tess sang oh treat my daughter kindily the fun grew fast and furious  i found myself able to miss drinks without being noticed or called to account  also standing in the companionway head and shoulders out and glass in hand i could fling the wine overboard  i reasoned something like this it is a queerness of these people that they like this viletasting wine  well let them  i cannot quarrel with their tastes  my manhood according to their queer notions must compel me to appear to like this wine  very well  i shall so appear  but i shall drink no more than is unavoidable  and the queen began to make love to me the latest recruit to the oyster pirate fleet and no mere hand but a master and owner  she went upon deck to take the air and took me with her  she knew of course but i never dreamed how french frank was raging down below  then tess joined us sitting on the cabin and spider and bob and at the last mrs hadley and french frank  and we sat there glasses in hand and sang while the big demijohn went around and i was the only strictly sober one  and i enjoyed it as no one of them was able to enjoy it  here in this atmosphere of bohemianism i could not but contrast the scene with my scene of the day before sitting at my machine in the stifling shutin air repeating endlessly repeating at top speed my series of mechanical motions  and here i sat now glass in hand in warmglowing camaraderie with the oyster pirates adventurers who refused to be slaves to petty routine who flouted restrictions and the law who carried their lives and their liberty in their hands  and it was through john barleycorn that i came to join this glorious company of free souls unashamed and unafraid  and the afternoon seabreeze blew its tang into my lungs and curled the waves in midchannel  before it came the scow schooners wingandwing blowing their horns for the drawbridges to open  redstacked tugs tore by rocking the razzle dazzle in the waves of their wake  a sugar barque towed from the boneyard to sea  the sunwash was on the crisping water and life was big  and spider sang      oh its lulu black lulu my darling        oh its where have you been so long           been layin in jail           awaitin for bail      till my bully comes rollin along   there it was the smack and slap of the spirit of revolt of adventure of romance of the things forbidden and done defiantly and grandly  and i knew that on the morrow i would not go back to my machine at the cannery  tomorrow i would be an oyster pirate as free a freebooter as the century and the waters of san francisco bay would permit  spider had already agreed to sail with me as my crew of one and also as cook while i did the deck work  we would outfit our grub and water in the morning hoist the big mainsail which was a bigger piece of canvas than any i had ever sailed under and beat our way out the estuary on the first of the seabreeze and the last of the ebb  then we would slack sheets and on the first of the flood run down the bay to the asparagus islands where we would anchor miles off shore  and at last my dream would be realised i would sleep upon the water  and next morning i would wake upon the water and thereafter all my days and nights would be on the water  and the queen asked me to row her ashore in my skiff when at sunset french frank prepared to take his guests ashore  nor did i catch the significance of his abrupt change of plan when he turned the task of rowing his skiff over to whisky bob himself remaining on board the sloop  nor did i understand spiders grinning sideremark to me gee theres nothin slow about you how could it possibly enter my boys head that a grizzled man of fifty should be jealous of me     chapter viii   we met by appointment early monday morning to complete the deal in johnny heinholds last chance a saloon of course for the transactions of men  i paid the money over received the bill of sale and french frank treated  this struck me as an evident custom and a logical onethe seller who receives the money to wet a piece of it in the establishment where the trade was consummated  but to my surprise french frank treated the house  he and i drank which seemed just but why should johnny heinhold who owned the saloon and waited behind the bar be invited to drink i figured it immediately that he made a profit on the very drink he drank  i could in a way considering that they were friends and shipmates understand spider and whisky bob being asked to drink but why should the longshoremen bill kelley and soup kennedy be asked  then there was pat the queens brother making a total of eight of us it was early morning and all ordered whisky  what could i do here in this company of big men all drinking whisky  whisky i said with the careless air of one who had said it a thousand times  and such whisky i tossed it down  arrrgh i can taste it yet  and i was appalled at the price french frank had paideighty cents eighty cents  it was an outrage to my thrifty soul  eighty centsthe equivalent of eight long hours of my toil at the machine gone down our throats and gone like that in a twinkling leaving only a bad taste in the mouth  there was no discussion that french frank was a waster  i was anxious to be gone out into the sunshine out over the water to my glorious boat  but all hands lingered  even spider my crew lingered no hint broke through my obtuseness of why they lingered  i have often thought since of how they must have regarded me the newcomer being welcomed into their company standing at bar with them and not standing for a single round of drinks  french frank who unknown to me had swallowed his chagrin since the day before now that the money for the razzle dazzle was in his pocket began to behave curiously toward me  i sensed the change in his attitude saw the forbidding glitter in his eyes and wondered  the more i saw of men the queerer they became  johnny heinhold leaned across the bar and whispered in my ear hes got it in for you  watch out  i nodded comprehension of his statement and acquiescence in it as a man should nod who knows all about men  but secretly i was perplexed heavens how was i who had worked hard and read books of adventure and who was only fifteen years old who had not dreamed of giving the queen of the oyster pirates a second thought and who did not know that french frank was madly and latinly in love with herhow was i to guess that i had done him shame and how was i to guess that the story of how the queen had thrown him down on his own boat the moment i hove in sight was already the gleeful gossip of the waterfront and by the same token how was i to guess that her brother pats offishness with me was anything else than temperamental gloominess of spirit  whisky bob got me aside a moment  keep your eyes open he muttered take my tip  french franks ugly  im going up river with him to get a schooner for oystering  when he gets down on the beds watch out  he says hell run you down  after dark any time hes around change your anchorage and douse your riding light  savve  oh certainly i savved  i nodded my head and as one man to another thanked him for his tip and drifted back to the group at the bar  no i did not treat  i never dreamed that i was expected to treat  i left with spider and my ears burn now as i try to surmise the things they must have said about me  i asked spider in an offhand way what was eating french frank  hes crazy jealous of you was the answer  do you think so i said and dismissed the matter as not worth thinking about  but i leave it to any onethe swell of my fifteenyearsold manhood at learning that french frank the adventurer of fifty the sailor of all the seas of all the world was jealous of meand jealous over a girl most romantically named the queen of the oyster pirates  i had read of such things in books and regarded them as personal probabilities of a distant maturity  oh i felt a rare young devil as we hoisted the big mainsail that morning broke out anchor and filled away closehauled on the threemile beat to windward out into the bay  such was my escape from the killing machinetoil and my introduction to the oyster pirates  true the introduction had begun with drink and the life promised to continue with drink  but was i to stay away from it for such reason wherever life ran free and great there men drank  romance and adventure seemed always to go down the street locked arm in arm with john barleycorn  to know the two i must know the third  or else i must go back to my free library books and read of the deeds of other men and do no deeds of my own save slave for ten cents an hour at a machine in a cannery  no i was not to be deterred from this brave life on the water by the fact that the waterdwellers had queer and expensive desires for beer and wine and whisky  what if their notions of happiness included the strange one of seeing me drink when they persisted in buying the stuff and thrusting it upon me why i would drink it  it was the price i would pay for their comradeship  and i didnt have to get drunk  i had not got drunk the sunday afternoon i arranged to buy the razzle dazzle despite the fact that not one of the rest was sober  well i could go on into the future that way drinking the stuff when it gave them pleasure that i should drink it but carefully avoiding overdrinking     chapter ix   gradual as was my development as a heavy drinker among the oyster pirates the real heavy drinking came suddenly and was the result not of desire for alcohol but of an intellectual conviction  the more i saw of the life the more i was enamoured of it  i can never forget my thrills the first night i took part in a concerted raid when we assembled on board the annierough men big and unafraid and weazened wharfrats some of them exconvicts all of them enemies of the law and meriting jail in seaboots and seagear talking in gruff low voices and big george with revolvers strapped about his waist to show that he meant business  oh i know looking back that the whole thing was sordid and silly  but i was not looking back in those days when i was rubbing shoulders with john barleycorn and beginning to accept him  the life was brave and wild and i was living the adventure i had read so much about  nelson young scratch they called him to distinguish him from old scratch his father sailed in the sloop reindeer partners with one clam  clam was a daredevil but nelson was a reckless maniac  he was twenty years old with the body of a hercules  when he was shot in benicia a couple of years later the coroner said he was the greatestshouldered man he had ever seen laid on a slab  nelson could not read or write  he had been dragged up by his father on san francisco bay and boats were second nature with him  his strength was prodigious and his reputation along the waterfront for violence was anything but savoury  he had berserker rages and did mad terrible things  i made his acquaintance the first cruise of the razzle dazzle and saw him sail the reindeer in a blow and dredge oysters all around the rest of us as we lay at two anchors troubled with fear of going ashore  he was some man this nelson and when passing by the last chance saloon he spoke to me i felt very proud  but try to imagine my pride when he promptly asked me in to have a drink  i stood at the bar and drank a glass of beer with him and talked manfully of oysters and boats and of the mystery of who had put the load of buckshot through the annies mainsail  we talked and lingered at the bar  it seemed to me strange that we lingered  we had had our beer  but who was i to lead the way outside when great nelson chose to lean against the bar after a few minutes to my surprise he asked me to have another drink which i did  and still we talked and nelson evinced no intention of leaving the bar  bear with me while i explain the way of my reasoning and of my innocence first of all i was very proud to be in the company of nelson who was the most heroic figure among the oyster pirates and bay adventurers unfortunately for my stomach and mucous membranes nelson had a strange quirk of nature that made him find happiness in treating me to beer  i had no moral disinclination for beer and just because i didnt like the taste of it and the weight of it was no reason i should forgo the honour of his company  it was his whim to drink beer and to have me drink beer with him  very well i would put up with the passing discomfort  so we continued to talk at the bar and to drink beer ordered and paid for by nelson  i think now when i look back upon it that nelson was curious  he wanted to find out just what kind of a gink i was  he wanted to see how many times id let him treat without offering to treat in return  after i had drunk half a dozen glasses my policy of temperateness in mind i decided that i had had enough for that time  so i mentioned that i was going aboard the razzle dazzle then lying at the city wharf a hundred yards away  i said goodbye to nelson and went on down the wharf  but john barleycorn to the extent of six glasses went with me  my brain tingled and was very much alive  i was uplifted by my sense of manhood  i a trulytrue oyster pirate was going aboard my own boat after hobnobbing in the last chance with nelson the greatest oyster pirate of us all strong in my brain was the vision of us leaning against the bar and drinking beer  and curious it was i decided this whim of nature that made men happy in spending good money for beer for a fellow like me who didnt want it  as i pondered this i recollected that several times other men in couples had entered the last chance and first one then the other had treated to drinks  i remembered on the drunk on the idler how scotty and the harpooner and myself had raked and scraped dimes and nickels with which to buy the whisky  then came my boy code when on a day a fellow gave another a cannonball or a chunk of taffy on some other day he would expect to receive back a cannonball or a chunk of taffy  that was why nelson had lingered at the bar  having bought a drink he had waited for me to buy one  i had let him buy six drinks and never once offered to treat  and he was the great nelson i could feel myself blushing with shame  i sat down on the stringerpiece of the wharf and buried my face in my hands  and the heat of my shame burned up my neck and into my cheeks and forehead  i have blushed many times in my life but never have i experienced so terrible a blush as that one  and sitting there on the stringerpiece in my shame i did a great deal of thinking and transvaluing of values  i had been born poor  poor i had lived  i had gone hungry on occasion  i had never had toys nor playthings like other children  my first memories of life were pinched by poverty  the pinch of poverty had been chronic  i was eight years old when i wore my first little undershirt actually sold in a store across the counter  and then it had been only one little undershirt when it was soiled i had to return to the awful homemade things until it was washed  i had been so proud of it that i insisted on wearing it without any outer garment  for the first time i mutinied against my mothermutinied myself into hysteria until she let me wear the store undershirt so all the world could see  only a man who has undergone famine can properly value food only sailors and desertdwellers know the meaning of fresh water  and only a child with a childs imagination can come to know the meaning of things it has been long denied  i early discovered that the only things i could have were those i got for myself  my meagre childhood developed meagreness the first things i had been able to get for myself had been cigarette pictures cigarette posters and cigarette albums  i had not had the spending of the money i earned so i traded extra newspapers for these treasures  i traded duplicates with the other boys and circulating as i did all about town i had greater opportunities for trading and acquiring  it was not long before i had complete every series issued by every cigarette manufacturersuch as the great race horses parisian beauties women of all nations flags of all nations noted actors champion prize fighters etc  and each series i had three different ways in the card from the cigarette package in the poster and in the album  then i began to accumulate duplicate sets duplicate albums  i traded for other things that boys valued and which they usually bought with money given them by their parents  naturally they did not have the keen sense of values that i had who was never given money to buy anything  i traded for postagestamps for minerals for curios for birds eggs for marbles i had a more magnificent collection of agates than i have ever seen any boy possessand the nucleus of the collection was a handful worth at least three dollars which i had kept as security for twenty cents i loaned to a messengerboy who was sent to reform school before he could redeem them  id trade anything and everything for anything else and turn it over in a dozen more trades until it was transmuted into something that was worth something  i was famous as a trader  i was notorious as a miser  i could even make a junkman weep when i had dealings with him  other boys called me in to sell for them their collections of bottles rags old iron grain and gunnysacks and fivegallon oilcansaye and gave me a commission for doing it  and this was the thrifty closefisted boy accustomed to slave at a machine for ten cents an hour who sat on the stringerpiece and considered the matter of beer at five cents a glass and gone in a moment with nothing to show for it  i was now with men i admired  i was proud to be with them  had all my pinching and saving brought me the equivalent of one of the many thrills which had been mine since i came among the oyster pirates then what was worth whilemoney or thrills these men had no horror of squandering a nickel or many nickels  they were magnificently careless of money calling up eight men to drink whisky at ten cents a glass as french frank had done  why nelson had just spent sixty cents on beer for the two of us  which was it to be i was aware that i was making a grave decision  i was deciding between money and men between niggardliness and romance either i must throw overboard all my old values of money and look upon it as something to be flung about wastefully or i must throw overboard my comradeship with these men whose peculiar quirks made them like strong drink  i retraced my steps up the wharf to the last chance where nelson still stood outside  come on and have a beer i invited  again we stood at the bar and drank and talked but this time it was i who paid ten cents a whole hour of my labour at a machine for a drink of something i didnt want and which tasted rotten  but it wasnt difficult  i had achieved a concept  money no longer counted  it was comradeship that counted have another i said  and we had another and i paid for it  nelson with the wisdom of the skilled drinker said to the barkeeper make mine a small one johnny johnny nodded and gave him a glass that contained only a third as much as the glasses we had been drinking  yet the charge was the samefive cents  by this time i was getting nicely jingled so such extravagance didnt hurt me much  besides i was learning  there was more in this buying of drinks than mere quantity  i got my finger on it  there was a stage when the beer didnt count at all but just the spirit of comradeship of drinking together  and haanother thing i too could call for small beers and minimise by twothirds the detestable freightage with which comradeship burdened one  i had to go aboard to get some money i remarked casually as we drank in the hope nelson would take it as an explanation of why i had let him treat six consecutive times  oh well you didnt have to do that he answered  johnnyll trust a fellow like youwont you johnny  sure johnny agreed with a smile  how much you got down against me nelson queried  johnny pulled out the book he kept behind the bar found nelsons page and added up the account of several dollars  at once i became possessed with a desire to have a page in that book  almost it seemed the final badge of manhood  after a couple more drinks for which i insisted on paying nelson decided to go  we parted true comradely and i wandered down the wharf to the razzle dazzle  spider was just building the fire for supper  whered you get it he grinned up at me through the open companion  oh ive been with nelson i said carelessly trying to hide my pride  then an idea came to me  here was another one of them  now that i had achieved my concept i might as well practise it thoroughly  come on i said up to johnnys and have a drink  going up the wharf we met clam coming down  clam was nelsons partner and he was a fine brave handsome moustached man of thirtyeverything in short that his nickname did not connote  come on i said and have a drink he came  as we turned into the last chance there was pat the queens brother coming out  whats your hurry i greeted him  were having a drink  come on along ive just had one he demurred  what of itwere having one now i retorted  and pat consented to join us and i melted my way into his good graces with a couple of glasses of beer  oh i was learning things that afternoon about john barleycorn  there was more in him than the bad taste when you swallowed him  here at the absurd cost of ten cents a gloomy grouchy individual who threatened to become an enemy was made into a good friend  he became even genial his looks were kindly and our voices mellowed together as we talked waterfront and oysterbed gossip  small beer for me johnny i said when the others had ordered schooners  yes and i said it like the accustomed drinker carelessly casually as a sort of spontaneous thought that had just occurred to me looking back i am confident that the only one there who guessed i was a tyro at bardrinking was johnny heinhold  whered he get it i overheard spider confidentially ask johnny  oh hes been sousin here with nelson all afternoon was johnnys answer  i never let on that id heard but proud aye even the barkeeper was giving me a recommendation as a man  hes been sousin here with nelson all afternoon magic words the accolade delivered by a barkeeper with a beer glass  i remembered that french frank had treated johnny the day i bought the razzle dazzle  the glasses were filled and we were ready to drink have something yourself johnny i said with an air of having intended to say it all the time but of having been a trifle remiss because of the interesting conversation i had been holding with clam and pat  johnny looked at me with quick sharpness divining i am positive the strides i was making in my education and poured himself whisky from his private bottle  this hit me for a moment on my thrifty side  he had taken a tencent drink when the rest of us were drinking fivecent drinks but the hurt was only for a moment  i dismissed it as ignoble remembered my concept and did not give myself away  youd better put me down in the book for this i said when we had finished the drink  and i had the satisfaction of seeing a fresh page devoted to my name and a charge pencilled for a round of drinks amounting to thirty cents  and i glimpsed as through a golden haze a future wherein that page would be much charged and crossed off and charged again  i treated a second time around and then to my amazement johnny redeemed himself in that matter of the tencent drink  he treated us around from behind the bar and i decided that he had arithmetically evened things up handsomely  lets go around to the st louis house spider suggested when we got outside  pat who had been shovelling coal all day had gone home and clam had gone upon the reindeer to cook supper  so around spider and i went to the st louis housemy first visita huge barroom where perhaps fifty men mostly longshoremen were congregated  and there i met soup kennedy for the second time and bill kelley  and smith of the annie drifted inhe of the beltbuckled revolvers  and nelson showed up  and i met others including the vigy brothers who ran the place and chiefest of all joe goose with the wicked eyes the twisted nose and the flowered vest who played the harmonica like a roystering angel and went on the most atrocious tears that even the oakland waterfront could conceive of and admire  as i bought drinksothers treated as wellthe thought flickered across my mind that mammy jennie wasnt going to be repaid much on her loan out of that weeks earnings of the razzle dazzle  but what of it i thought or rather john barleycorn thought it for me  youre a man and youre getting acquainted with men  mammy jennie doesnt need the money as promptly as all that  she isnt starving  you know that  shes got other money in the bank  let her wait and pay her back gradually  and thus it was i learned another trait of john barleycorn  he inhibits morality  wrong conduct that it is impossible for one to do sober is done quite easily when one is not sober  in fact it is the only thing one can do for john barleycorns inhibition rises like a wall between ones immediate desires and longlearned morality  i dismissed my thought of debt to mammy jennie and proceeded to get acquainted at the trifling expense of some trifling money and a jingle that was growing unpleasant  who took me on board and put me to bed that night i do not know but i imagine it must have been spider     chapter x   and so i won my manhoods spurs  my status on the waterfront and with the oyster pirates became immediately excellent  i was looked upon as a good fellow as well as no coward  and somehow from the day i achieved that concept sitting on the stringerpiece of the oakland city wharf i have never cared much for money  no one has ever considered me a miser since while my carelessness of money is a source of anxiety and worry to some that know me  so completely did i break with my parsimonious past that i sent word home to my mother to call in the boys of the neighbourhood and give to them all my collections  i never even cared to learn what boys got what collections  i was a man now and i made a clean sweep of everything that bound me to my boyhood  my reputation grew  when the story went around the waterfront of how french frank had tried to run me down with his schooner and of how i had stood on the deck of the razzle dazzle a cocked doublebarrelled shotgun in my hands steering with my feet and holding her to her course and compelled him to put up his wheel and keep away the waterfront decided that there was something in me despite my youth  and i continued to show what was in me  there were the times i brought the razzle dazzle in with a bigger load of oysters than any other twoman craft there was the time when we raided far down in lower bay and mine was the only craft back at daylight to the anchorage off asparagus island there was the thursday night we raced for market and i brought the razzle dazzle in without a rudder first of the fleet and skimmed the cream of the friday morning trade and there was the time i brought her in from upper bay under a jib when scotty burned my mainsail  yes it was scotty of the idler adventure  irish had followed spider on board the razzle dazzle and scotty turning up had taken irishs place  but the things i did on the water only partly counted  what completed everything and won for me the title of prince of the oyster beds was that i was a good fellow ashore with my money buying drinks like a man i little dreamed that the time would come when the oakland waterfront which had shocked me at first would be shocked and annoyed by the devilry of the things i did  but always the life was tied up with drinking  the saloons are poor mens clubs  saloons are congregating places  we engaged to meet one another in saloons  we celebrated our good fortune or wept our grief in saloons  we got acquainted in saloons  can i ever forget the afternoon i met old scratch nelsons father  it was in the last chance  johnny heinhold introduced us  that old scratch was nelsons father was noteworthy enough  but there was more in it than that  he was owner and master of the scowschooner annie mine and some day i might ship as a sailor with him  still more he was romance  he was a blueeyed yellowhaired rawboned viking bigbodied and strongmuscled despite his age  and he had sailed the seas in ships of all nations in the old savage sailing days  i had heard many weird tales about him and worshipped him from a distance  it took the saloon to bring us together  even so our acquaintance might have been no more than a handgrip and a wordhe was a laconic old fellowhad it not been for the drinking  have a drink i said with promptitude after the pause which i had learned good form in drinking dictates  of course while we drank our beer which i had paid for it was incumbent on him to listen to me and to talk to me  and johnny like a true host made the tactful remarks that enabled us to find mutual topics of conversation  and of course having drunk my beer captain nelson must now buy beer in turn  this led to more talking and johnny drifted out of the conversation to wait on other customers  the more beer captain nelson and i drank the better we got acquainted in me he found an appreciative listener who by virtue of bookreading knew much about the sealife he had lived  so he drifted back to his wild young days and spun many a rare yarn for me while we downed beer treat by treat all through a blessed summer afternoon  and it was only john barleycorn that made possible that long afternoon with the old seadog  it was johnny heinhold who secretly warned me across the bar that i was getting pickled and advised me to take small beers  but as long as captain nelson drank large beers my pride forbade anything else than large beers  and not until the skipper ordered his first small beer did i order one for myself  oh when we came to a lingering fond farewell i was drunk  but i had the satisfaction of seeing old scratch as drunk as i  my youthful modesty scarcely let me dare believe that the hardened old buccaneer was even more drunk  and afterwards from spider and pat and clam and johnny heinhold and others came the tips that old scratch liked me and had nothing but good words for the fine lad i was  which was the more remarkable because he was known as a savage cantankerous old cuss who never liked anybody his very nickname scratch arose from a berserker trick of his in fighting of tearing off his opponents face  and that i had won his friendship all thanks were due to john barleycorn  i have given the incident merely as an example of the multitudinous lures and draws and services by which john barleycorn wins his followers     chapter xi   and still there arose in me no desire for alcohol no chemical demand in years and years of heavy drinking drinking did not beget the desire drinking was the way of the life i led the way of the men with whom i lived  while away on my cruises on the bay i took no drink along and while out on the bay the thought of the desirableness of a drink never crossed my mind  it was not until i tied the razzle dazzle up to the wharf and got ashore in the congregating places of men where drink flowed that the buying of drinks for other men and the accepting of drinks from other men devolved upon me as a social duty and a manhood rite  then too there were the times lying at the city wharf or across the estuary on the sandspit when the queen and her sister and her brother pat and mrs hadley came aboard  it was my boat i was host and i could only dispense hospitality in the terms of their understanding of it  so i would rush spider or irish or scotty or whoever was my crew with the can for beer and the demijohn for red wine  and again lying at the wharf disposing of my oysters there were dusky twilights when big policemen and plainclothes men stole on board  and because we lived in the shadow of the police we opened oysters and fed them to them with squirts of pepper sauce and rushed the growler or got stronger stuff in bottles  drink as i would i couldnt come to like john barleycorn  i valued him extremely well for his associations but not for the taste of him  all the time i was striving to be a man amongst men and all the time i nursed secret and shameful desires for candy  but i would have died before id let anybody guess it  i used to indulge in lonely debauches on nights when i knew my crew was going to sleep ashore  i would go up to the free library exchange my books buy a quarters worth of all sorts of candy that chewed and lasted sneak aboard the razzle dazzle lock myself in the cabin go to bed and lie there long hours of bliss reading and chewing candy  and those were the only times i felt that i got my real moneys worth  dollars and dollars across the bar couldnt buy the satisfaction that twentyfive cents did in a candy store  as my drinking grew heavier i began to note more and more that it was in the drinking bouts the purple passages occurred  drunks were always memorable  at such times things happened  men like joe goose dated existence from drunk to drunk  the longshoremen all looked forward to their saturday night drunk  we of the oyster boats waited until we had disposed of our cargoes before we got really started though a scattering of drinks and a meeting of a chance friend sometimes precipitated an accidental drunk  in ways the accidental drunks were the best  stranger and more exciting things happened at such times  as for instance the sunday when nelson and french frank and captain spink stole the stolen salmon boat from whisky bob and nicky the greek  changes had taken place in the personnel of the oyster boats  nelson had got into a fight with bill kelley on the annie and was carrying a bullethole through his left hand  also having quarrelled with clam and broken partnership nelson had sailed the reindeer his arm in a sling with a crew of two deepwater sailors and he had sailed so madly as to frighten them ashore  such was the tale of his recklessness they spread that no one on the waterfront would go out with nelson  so the reindeer crewless lay across the estuary at the sandspit  beside her lay the razzle dazzle with a burned mainsail and scotty and me on board  whisky bob had fallen out with french frank and gone on a raid up river with nicky the greek  the result of this raid was a brandnew columbia river salmon boat stolen from an italian fisherman  we oyster pirates were all visited by the searching italian and we were convinced from what we knew of their movements that whisky bob and nicky the greek were the guilty parties but where was the salmon boat  hundreds of greek and italian fishermen up river and down bay had searched every slough and tule patch for it when the owner despairingly offered a reward of fifty dollars our interest increased and the mystery deepened  one sunday morning old captain spink paid me a visit  the conversation was confidential  he had just been fishing in his skiff in the old alameda ferry slip  as the tide went down he had noticed a rope tied to a pile under water and leading downward  in vain he had tried to heave up what was fast on the other end  farther along to another pile was a similar rope leading downward and unheavable  without doubt it was the missing salmon boat  if we restored it to its rightful owner there was fifty dollars in it for us  but i had queer ethical notions about honour amongst thieves and declined to have anything to do with the affair  but french frank had quarrelled with whisky bob and nelson was also an enemy  poor whisky bobwithout viciousness goodnatured generous born weak raised poorly with an irresistible chemical demand for alcohol still prosecuting his vocation of bay pirate his body was picked up not long afterward beside a dock where it had sunk full of gunshot wounds  within an hour after i had rejected captain spinks proposal i saw him sail down the estuary on board the reindeer with nelson  also french frank went by on his schooner  it was not long ere they sailed back up the estuary curiously side by side  as they headed in for the sandspit the submerged salmon boat could be seen gunwales awash and held up from sinking by ropes fast to the schooner and the sloop  the tide was half out and they sailed squarely in on the sand grounding in a row with the salmon boat in the middle  immediately hans one of french franks sailors was into a skiff and pulling rapidly for the north shore  the big demijohn in the sternsheets told his errand  they couldnt wait a moment to celebrate the fifty dollars they had so easily earned  it is the way of the devotees of john barleycorn  when good fortune comes they drink  when they have no fortune they drink to the hope of good fortune  if fortune be ill they drink to forget it  if they meet a friend they drink  if they quarrel with a friend and lose him they drink  if their lovemaking be crowned with success they are so happy they needs must drink  if they be jilted they drink for the contrary reason  and if they havent anything to do at all why they take a drink secure in the knowledge that when they have taken a sufficient number of drinks the maggots will start crawling in their brains and they will have their hands full with things to do  when they are sober they want to drink and when they have drunk they want to drink more  of course as fellow comrades scotty and i were called in for the drinking  we helped to make a hole in that fifty dollars not yet received  the afternoon from just an ordinary common summer sunday afternoon became a gorgeous purple afternoon  we all talked and sang and ranted and bragged and ever french frank and nelson sent more drinks around  we lay in full sight of the oakland waterfront and the noise of our revels attracted friends  skiff after skiff crossed the estuary and hauled up on the sandspit while hans work was cut out for himever to row back and forth for more supplies of booze  then whisky bob and nicky the greek arrived sober indignant outraged in that their fellow pirates had raised their plant  french frank aided by john barleycorn orated hypocritically about virtue and honesty and despite his fifty years got whisky bob out on the sand and proceeded to lick him  when nicky the greek jumped in with a shorthandled shovel to whisky bobs assistance short work was made of him by hans  and of course when the bleeding remnants of bob and nicky were sent packing in their skiff the event must needs be celebrated in further carousal  by this time our visitors being numerous we were a large crowd compounded of many nationalities and diverse temperaments all aroused by john barleycorn all restraints cast off  old quarrels revived ancient hates flared up  fight was in the air  and whenever a longshoreman remembered something against a scowschooner sailor or vice versa or an oyster pirate remembered or was remembered a fist shot out and another fight was on  and every fight was made up in more rounds of drinks wherein the combatants aided and abetted by the rest of us embraced each other and pledged undying friendship  and of all times soup kennedy selected this time to come and retrieve an old shirt of his left aboard the reindeer from the trip he sailed with clam  he had espoused clams side of the quarrel with nelson also he had been drinking in the st louis house so that it was john barleycorn who led him to the sandspit in quest of his old shirt  few words started the fray  he locked with nelson in the cockpit of the reindeer and in the mixup barely escaped being brained by an iron bar wielded by irate french frankirate because a twohanded man had attacked a onehanded man  if the reindeer still floats the dent of the iron bar remains in the hardwood rail of her cockpit  but nelson pulled his bandaged hand bulletperforated out of its sling and held by us wept and roared his berserker belief that he could lick soup kennedy onehanded  and we let them loose on the sand  once when it looked as if nelson were getting the worst of it french frank and john barleycorn sprang unfairly into the fight  scotty protested and reached for french frank who whirled upon him and fell on top of him in a pummelling clinch after a sprawl of twenty feet across the sand  in the course of separating these two half a dozen fights started amongst the rest of us  these fights were finished one way or the other or we separated them with drinks while all the time nelson and soup kennedy fought on  occasionally we returned to them and gave advice such as when they lay exhausted in the sand unable to strike a blow throw sand in his eyes and they threw sand in each others eyes recuperated and fought on to successive exhaustions  and now of all this that is squalid and ridiculous and bestial try to think what it meant to me a youth not yet sixteen burning with the spirit of adventure fancyfilled with tales of buccaneers and searovers sacks of cities and conflicts of armed men and imaginationmaddened by the stuff i had drunk  it was life raw and naked wild and freethe only life of that sort which my birth in time and space permitted me to attain  and more than that  it carried a promise  it was the beginning  from the sandspit the way led out through the golden gate to the vastness of adventure of all the world where battles would be fought not for old shirts and over stolen salmon boats but for high purposes and romantic ends  and because i told scotty what i thought of his letting an old man like french frank get away with him we too brawled and added to the festivity of the sandspit  and scotty threw up his job as crew and departed in the night with a pair of blankets belonging to me  during the night while the oyster pirates lay stupefied in their bunks the schooner and the reindeer floated on the high water and swung about to their anchors  the salmon boat still filled with rocks and water rested on the bottom  in the morning early i heard wild cries from the reindeer and tumbled out in the chill grey to see a spectacle that made the waterfront laugh for days  the beautiful salmon boat lay on the hard sand squashed flat as a pancake while on it were perched french franks schooner and the reindeer  unfortunately two of the reindeers planks had been crushed in by the stout oak stem of the salmon boat  the rising tide had flowed through the hole and just awakened nelson by getting into his bunk with him  i lent a hand and we pumped the reindeer out and repaired the damage  then nelson cooked breakfast and while we ate we considered the situation  he was broke  so was i  the fifty dollars reward would never be paid for that pitiful mess of splinters on the sand beneath us he had a wounded hand and no crew  i had a burned main sail and no crew  what dye say you and me nelson queried  ill go you was my answer  and thus i became partners with young scratch nelson the wildest maddest of them all  we borrowed the money for an outfit of grub from johnny heinhold filled our waterbarrels and sailed away that day for the oysterbeds     chapter xii   nor have i ever regretted those months of mad devilry i put in with nelson  he could sail even if he did frighten every man that sailed with him  to steer to miss destruction by an inch or an instant was his joy  to do what everybody else did not dare attempt to do was his pride  never to reef down was his mania and in all the time i spent with him blow high or low the reindeer was never reefed  nor was she ever dry  we strained her open and sailed her open and sailed her open continually  and we abandoned the oakland waterfront and went wider afield for our adventures  and all this glorious passage in my life was made possible for me by john barleycorn  and this is my complaint against john barleycorn  here i was thirsting for the wild life of adventure and the only way for me to win to it was through john barleycorns mediation  it was the way of the men who lived the life  did i wish to live the life i must live it the way they did  it was by virtue of drinking that i gained that partnership and comradeship with nelson  had i drunk only the beer he paid for or had i declined to drink at all i should never have been selected by him as a partner  he wanted a partner who would meet him on the social side as well as the work side of life  i abandoned myself to the life and developed the misconception that the secret of john barleycorn lay in going on mad drunks rising through the successive stages that only an iron constitution could endure to final stupefaction and swinish unconsciousness  i did not like the taste so i drank for the sole purpose of getting drunk of getting hopelessly helplessly drunk  and i who had saved and scraped traded like a shylock and made junkmen weep i who had stood aghast when french frank at a single stroke spent eighty cents for whisky for eight men i turned myself loose with a more lavish disregard for money than any of them  i remember going ashore one night with nelson  in my pocket were one hundred and eighty dollars  it was my intention first to buy me some clothes after that some drinks  i needed the clothes  all i possessed were on me and they were as follows a pair of seaboots that providentially leaked the water out as fast as it ran in a pair of fiftycent overalls a fortycent cotton shirt and a souwester  i had no hat so i had to wear the souwester and it will be noted that i have listed neither underclothes nor socks  i didnt own any  to reach the stores where clothes could be bought we had to pass a dozen saloons  so i bought me the drinks first  i never got to the clothing stores  in the morning broke poisoned but contented i came back on board and we set sail  i possessed only the clothes i had gone ashore in and not a cent remained of the one hundred and eighty dollars  it might well be deemed impossible by those who have never tried it that in twelve hours a lad can spend all of one hundred and eighty dollars for drinks  i know otherwise  and i had no regrets  i was proud  i had shown them i could spend with the best of them  amongst strong men i had proved myself strong  i had clinched again as i had often clinched my right to the title of prince also my attitude may be considered in part as a reaction from my childhoods meagreness and my childhoods excessive toil possibly my inchoate thought was better to reign among boozefighters a prince than to toil twelve hours a day at a machine for ten cents an hour  there are no purple passages in machine toil  but if the spending of one hundred and eighty dollars in twelve hours isnt a purple passage then id like to know what is  oh i skip much of the details of my trafficking with john barleycorn during this period and shall only mention events that will throw light on john barleycorns ways  there were three things that enabled me to pursue this heavy drinking first a magnificent constitution far better than the average second the healthy openair life on the water and third the fact that i drank irregularly  while out on the water we never carried any drink along  the world was opening up to me  already i knew several hundred miles of the waterways of it and of the towns and cities and fishing hamlets on the shores  came the whisper to range farther  i had not found it yet there was more behind  but even this much of the world was too wide for nelson  he wearied for his beloved oakland waterfront and when he elected to return to it we separated in all friendliness  i now made the old town of benicia on the carquinez straits my headquarters  in a cluster of fishermens arks moored in the tules on the waterfront dwelt a congenial crowd of drinkers and vagabonds and i joined them  i had longer spells ashore between fooling with salmon fishing and making raids up and down bay and rivers as a deputy fish patrolman and i drank more and learned more about drinking  i held my own with any one drink for drink and often drank more than my share to show the strength of my manhood  when on a morning my unconscious carcass was disentangled from the nets on the dryingframes whither i had stupidly blindly crawled the night before and when the waterfront talked it over with many a giggle and laugh and another drink i was proud indeed  it was an exploit  and when i never drew a sober breath on one stretch for three solid weeks i was certain i had reached the top  surely in that direction one could go no farther  it was time for me to move on  for always drunk or sober at the back of my consciousness something whispered that this carousing and bayadventuring was not all of life  this whisper was my good fortune  i happened to be so made that i could hear it calling always calling out and away over the world  it was not canniness on my part  it was curiosity desire to know an unrest and a seeking for things wonderful that i seemed somehow to have glimpsed or guessed  what was this life for i demanded if this were all no there was something more away and beyond  and in relation to my much later development as a drinker this whisper this promise of the things at the back of life must be noted for it was destined to play a dire part in my more recent wrestlings with john barleycorn  but what gave immediacy to my decision to move on was a trick john barleycorn played mea monstrous incredible trick that showed abysses of intoxication hitherto undreamed  at one oclock in the morning after a prodigious drunk i was tottering aboard a sloop at the end of the wharf intending to go to sleep  the tides sweep through carquinez straits as in a millrace and the full ebb was on when i stumbled overboard  there was nobody on the wharf nobody on the sloop  i was borne away by the current  i was not startled  i thought the misadventure delightful  i was a good swimmer and in my inflamed condition the contact of the water with my skin soothed me like cool linen  and then john barleycorn played me his maniacal trick  some maundering fancy of going out with the tide suddenly obsessed me  i had never been morbid  thoughts of suicide had never entered my head  and now that they entered i thought it fine a splendid culminating a perfect rounding off of my short but exciting career  i who had never known girls love nor womans love nor the love of children who had never played in the wide joyfields of art nor climbed the starcool heights of philosophy nor seen with my eyes more than a pinpoints surface of the gorgeous world i decided that this was all that i had seen all lived all been all that was worth while and that now was the time to cease  this was the trick of john barleycorn laying me by the heels of my imagination and in a drugdream dragging me to death  oh he was convincing  i had really experienced all of life and it didnt amount to much  the swinish drunkenness in which i had lived for months this was accompanied by the sense of degradation and the old feeling of conviction of sin was the last and best and i could see for myself what it was worth  there were all the brokendown old bums and loafers i had bought drinks for  that was what remained of life  did i want to become like them a thousand times no and i wept tears of sweet sadness over my glorious youth going out with the tide  and who has not seen the weeping drunk the melancholic drunk they are to be found in all the barrooms if they can find no other listener telling their sorrows to the barkeeper who is paid to listen  the water was delicious  it was a mans way to die  john barleycorn changed the tune he played in my drinkmaddened brain  away with tears and regret  it was a heros death and by the heros own hand and will so i struck up my deathchant and was singing it lustily when the gurgle and splash of the currentriffles in my ears reminded me of my more immediate situation  below the town of benicia where the solano wharf projects the straits widen out into what bayfarers call the bight of turners shipyard i was in the shoretide that swept under the solano wharf and on into the bight  i knew of old the power of the suck which developed when the tide swung around the end of dead mans island and drove straight for the wharf  i didnt want to go through those piles  it wouldnt be nice and i might lose an hour in the bight on my way out with the tide  i undressed in the water and struck out with a strong singleoverhand stroke crossing the current at rightangles  nor did i cease until by the wharf lights i knew i was safe to sweep by the end  then i turned over and rested  the stroke had been a telling one and i was a little time in recovering my breath  i was elated for i had succeeded in avoiding the suck  i started to raise my deathchant againa purely extemporised farrago of a drugcrazed youth  dont singyet whispered john barleycorn  the solano runs all night  there are railroad men on the wharf  they will hear you and come out in a boat and rescue you and you dont want to be rescued i certainly didnt  what be robbed of my heros death never  and i lay on my back in the starlight watching the familiar wharflights go by red and green and white and bidding sad sentimental farewell to them each and all  when i was well clear in midchannel i sang again  sometimes i swam a few strokes but in the main i contented myself with floating and dreaming long drunken dreams  before daylight the chill of the water and the passage of the hours had sobered me sufficiently to make me wonder what portion of the straits i was in and also to wonder if the turn of the tide wouldnt catch me and take me back ere i had drifted out into san pablo bay  next i discovered that i was very weary and very cold and quite sober and that i didnt in the least want to be drowned  i could make out the selby smelter on the contra costa shore and the mare island lighthouse i started to swim for the solano shore but was too weak and chilled and made so little headway and at the cost of such painful effort that i gave it up and contented myself with floating now and then giving a stroke to keep my balance in the tiderips which were increasing their commotion on the surface of the water  and i knew fear  i was sober now and i didnt want to die  i discovered scores of reasons for living  and the more reasons i discovered the more liable it seemed that i was going to drown anyway  daylight after i had been four hours in the water found me in a parlous condition in the tiderips off mare island light where the swift ebbs from vallejo straits and carquinez straits were fighting with each other and where at that particular moment they were fighting the flood tide setting up against them from san pablo bay  a stiff breeze had sprung up and the crisp little waves were persistently lapping into my mouth and i was beginning to swallow salt water  with my swimmers knowledge i knew the end was near  and then the boat camea greek fisherman running in for vallejo and again i had been saved from john barleycorn by my constitution and physical vigour  and in passing let me note that this maniacal trick john barleycorn played me is nothing uncommon  an absolute statistic of the percentage of suicides due to john barleycorn would be appalling  in my case healthy normal young full of the joy of life the suggestion to kill myself was unusual but it must be taken into account that it came on the heels of a long carouse when my nerves and brain were fearfully poisoned and that the dramatic romantic side of my imagination drinkmaddened to lunacy was delighted with the suggestion  and yet the older more morbid drinkers more jaded with life and more disillusioned who kill themselves do so usually after a long debauch when their nerves and brains are thoroughly poisonsoaked     chapter xiii   so i left benicia where john barleycorn had nearly got me and ranged wider afield in pursuit of the whisper from the back of life to come and find  and wherever i ranged the way lay along alcoholdrenched roads men still congregated in saloons  they were the poormans clubs and they were the only clubs to which i had access  i could get acquainted in saloons  i could go into a saloon and talk with any man  in the strange towns and cities i wandered through the only place for me to go was the saloon  i was no longer a stranger in any town the moment i had entered a saloon  and right here let me break in with experiences no later than last year i harnessed four horses to a light trap took charmian along and drove for three months and a half over the wildest mountain parts of california and oregon  each morning i did my regular days work of writing fiction that completed i drove on through the middle of the day and the afternoon to the next stop  but the irregularity of occurrence of stoppingplaces coupled with widely varying road conditions made it necessary to plan the day before each days drive and my work  i must know when i was to start driving in order to start writing in time to finish my days output  thus on occasion when the drive was to be long i would be up and at my writing by five in the morning  on easier driving days i might not start writing till nine oclock  but how to plan as soon as i arrived in a town and put the horses up on the way from the stable to the hotel i dropped into the saloons first thing a drinkoh i wanted the drink but also it must not be forgotten that because of wanting to know things it was in this very way i had learned to want a drink  well the first thing a drink have something yourself to the barkeeper  and then as we drink my opening query about roads and stoppingplaces on ahead  let me see the barkeeper will say theres the road across tarwater divide  that used to be good  i was over it three years ago  but it was blocked this spring  say ill tell you what  ill ask jerry and the barkeeper turns and addresses some man sitting at a table or leaning against the bar farther along and who may be jerry or tom or bill  say jerry how about the tarwater road you was down to wilkins last week  and while bill or jerry or tom is beginning to unlimber his thinking and speaking apparatus i suggest that he join us in the drink  then discussions arise about the advisability of this road or that what the best stoppingplaces may be what running time i may expect to make where the best trout streams are and so forth in which other men join and which are punctuated with more drinks  two or three more saloons and i accumulate a warm jingle and come pretty close to knowing everybody in town all about the town and a fair deal about the surrounding country  i know the lawyers editors business men local politicians and the visiting ranchers hunters and miners so that by evening when charmian and i stroll down the main street and back she is astounded by the number of my acquaintances in that totally strange town  and thus is demonstrated a service john barleycorn renders a service by which he increases his power over men  and over the world wherever i have gone during all the years it has been the same  it may be a cabaret in the latin quarter a cafe in some obscure italian village a boozing ken in sailortown and it may be up at the club over scotch and soda but always it will be where john barleycorn makes fellowship that i get immediately in touch and meet and know  and in the good days coming when john barleycorn will have been banished out of existence along with the other barbarisms some other institution than the saloon will have to obtain some other congregating place of men where strange men and stranger men may get in touch and meet and know  but to return to my narrative  when i turned my back on benicia my way led through saloons  i had developed no moral theories against drinking and i disliked as much as ever the taste of the stuff  but i had grown respectfully suspicious of john barleycorn  i could not forget that trick he had played on meon me who did not want to die  so i continued to drink and to keep a sharp eye on john barleycorn resolved to resist all future suggestions of selfdestruction  in strange towns i made immediate acquaintances in the saloons  when i hoboed and hadnt the price of a bed a saloon was the only place that would receive me and give me a chair by the fire  i could go into a saloon and wash up brush my clothes and comb my hair  and saloons were always so damnably convenient  they were everywhere in my western country  i couldnt go into the dwellings of strangers that way  their doors were not open to me no seats were there for me by their fires  also churches and preachers i had never known  and from what i didnt know i was not attracted toward them  besides there was no glamour about them no haze of romance no promise of adventure  they were the sort with whom things never happened  they lived and remained always in the one place creatures of order and system narrow limited restrained  they were without greatness without imagination without camaraderie  it was the good fellows easy and genial daring and on occasion mad that i wanted to knowthe fellows generoushearted and handed and not rabbithearted  and here is another complaint i bring against john barleycorn  it is these good fellows that he getsthe fellows with the fire and the go in them who have bigness and warmness and the best of the human weaknesses  and john barleycorn puts out the fire and soddens the agility and when he does not more immediately kill them or make maniacs of them he coarsens and grossens them twists and malforms them out of the original goodness and fineness of their natures  ohand i speak out of later knowledgeheaven forefend me from the most of the average run of male humans who are not good fellows the ones cold of heart and cold of head who dont smoke drink or swear or do much of anything else that is brase and resentful and stinging because in their feeble fibres there has never been the stir and prod of life to well over its boundaries and be devilish and daring  one doesnt meet these in saloons nor rallying to lost causes nor flaming on the adventurepaths nor loving as gods own mad lovers  they are too busy keeping their feet dry conserving their heartbeats and making unlovely lifesuccesses of their spiritmediocrity  and so i draw the indictment home to john barleycorn  it is just those the good fellows the worth while the fellows with the weakness of too much strength too much spirit too much fire and flame of fine devilishness that he solicits and ruins  of course he ruins weaklings but with them the worst we breed i am not here concerned  my concern is that it is so much of the best we breed whom john barleycorn destroys and the reason why these best are destroyed is because john barleycorn stands on every highway and byway accessible lawprotected saluted by the policeman on the beat speaking to them leading them by the hand to the places where the good fellows and daring ones forgather and drink deep  with john barleycorn out of the way these daring ones would still be born and they would do things instead of perishing  always i encountered the camaraderie of drink  i might be walking down the track to the watertank to lie in wait for a passing freighttrain when i would chance upon a bunch of alkistiffs an alkistiff is a tramp who drinks druggists alcohol  immediately with greeting and salutation i am taken into the fellowship  the alcohol shrewdly blended with water is handed to me and soon i am caught up in the revelry with maggots crawling in my brain and john barleycorn whispering to me that life is big and that we are all brave and finefree spirits sprawling like careless gods upon the turf and telling the twobyfour cutanddried conventional world to go hang     chapter xiv   back in oakland from my wanderings i returned to the waterfront and renewed my comradeship with nelson who was now on shore all the time and living more madly than before  i too spent my time on shore with him only occasionally going for cruises of several days on the bay to help out on shorthanded scowschooners  the result was that i was no longer reinvigorated by periods of openair abstinence and healthy toil  i drank every day and whenever opportunity offered i drank to excess for i still laboured under the misconception that the secret of john barleycorn lay in drinking to bestiality and unconsciousness  i became pretty thoroughly alcoholsoaked during this period  i practically lived in saloons became a barroom loafer and worse  and right here was john barleycorn getting me in a more insidious though no less deadly way than when he nearly sent me out with the tide  i had a few months still to run before i was seventeen i scorned the thought of a steady job at anything i felt myself a pretty tough individual in a group of pretty tough men and i drank because these men drank and because i had to make good with them  i had never had a real boyhood and in this my precocious manhood i was very hard and woefully wise though i had never known girls love even i had crawled through such depths that i was convinced absolutely that i knew the last word about love and life  and it wasnt a pretty knowledge  without being pessimistic i was quite satisfied that life was a rather cheap and ordinary affair  you see john barleycorn was blunting me  the old stings and prods of the spirit were no longer sharp  curiosity was leaving me  what did it matter what lay on the other side of the world  men and women without doubt very much like the men and women i knew marrying and giving in marriage and all the petty run of petty human concerns and drinks too but the other side of the world was a long way to go for a drink  i had but to step to the corner and get all i wanted at joe vigys  johnny heinhold still ran the last chance  and there were saloons on all the corners and between the corners  the whispers from the back of life were growing dim as my mind and body soddened  the old unrest was drowsy  i might as well rot and die here in oakland as anywhere else  and i should have so rotted and died and not in very long order either at the pace john barleycorn was leading me had the matter depended wholly on him  i was learning what it was to have no appetite  i was learning what it was to get up shaky in the morning with a stomach that quivered with fingers touched with palsy and to know the drinkers need for a stiff glass of whisky neat in order to brace up  oh john barleycorn is a wizard dopester  brain and body scorched and jangled and poisoned return to be tuned up by the very poison that caused the damage  there is no end to john barleycorns tricks  he had tried to inveigle me into killing myself  at this period he was doing his best to kill me at a fairly rapid pace  but not satisfied with that he tried another dodge  he very nearly got me too and right there i learned a lesson about himbecame a wiser a more skilful drinker  i learned there were limits to my gorgeous constitution and that there were no limits to john barleycorn  i learned that in a short hour or two he could master my strong head my broad shoulders and deep chest put me on my back and with a devils grip on my throat proceed to choke the life out of me  nelson and i were sitting in the overland house  it was early in the evening and the only reason we were there was because we were broke and it was election time  you see in election time local politicians aspirants for office have a way of making the rounds of the saloons to get votes  one is sitting at a table in a dry condition wondering who is going to turn up and buy him a drink or if his credit is good at some other saloon and if its worth while to walk that far to find out when suddenly the saloon doors swing wide and enters a bevy of welldressed men themselves usually wide and exhaling an atmosphere of prosperity and fellowship  they have smiles and greetings for everybodyfor you without the price of a glass of beer in your pocket for the timid hobo who lurks in the corner and who certainly hasnt a vote but who may establish a lodginghouse registration  and do you know when these politicians swing wide the doors and come in with their broad shoulders their deep chests and their generous stomachs which cannot help making them optimists and masters of life why you perk right up  its going to be a warm evening after all and you know youll get a souse started at the very least  andwho knowsthe gods may be kind other drinks may come and the night culminate in glorious greatness  and the next thing you know you are lined up at the bar pouring drinks down your throat and learning the gentlemens names and the offices which they hope to fill  it was during this period when the politicians went their saloon rounds that i was getting bitter bits of education and having illusions puncturedi who had pored and thrilled over the railsplitter and from canal boy to president yes i was learning how noble politics and politicians are  well on this night broke thirsty but with the drinkers faith in the unexpected drink nelson and i sat in the overland house waiting for something to turn up especially politicians  and there entered joe goosehe of the unquenchable thirst the wicked eyes the crooked nose the flowered vest  come on fellowsfree boozeall you want of it  i didnt want you to miss it  where we wanted to know  come on  ill tell you as we go along  we havent a minute to lose and as we hurried up town joe goose explained its the hancock fire brigade  all you have to do is wear a red shirt and a helmet and carry a torch  theyre going down on a special train to haywards to parade  i think the place was haywards  it may have been san leandro or niles and to save me i cant remember whether the hancock fire brigade was a republican or a democratic organisation  but anyway the politicians who ran it were short of torchbearers and anybody who would parade could get drunk if he wanted to  the townll be wide open joe goose went on  booze itll run like water  the politicians have bought the stocks of the saloons  therell be no charge  all you got to do is walk right up and call for it  well raise hell  at the hall on eighth street near broadway we got into the firemens shirts and helmets were equipped with torches and growling because we werent given at least one drink before we started were herded aboard the train  oh those politicians had handled our kind before  at haywards there were no drinks either  parade first and earn your booze was the order of the night  we paraded  then the saloons were opened  extra barkeepers had been engaged and the drinkers jammed six deep before every drinkdrenched and unwiped bar  there was no time to wipe the bar nor wash glasses nor do anything save fill glasses  the oakland waterfront can be real thirsty on occasion  this method of jamming and struggling in front of the bar was too slow for us  the drink was ours  the politicians had bought it for us  wed paraded and earned it hadnt we so we made a flank attack around the end of the bar shoved the protesting barkeepers aside and helped ourselves to bottles  outside we knocked the necks of the bottles off against the concrete curbs and drank  now joe goose and nelson had learned discretion with straight whisky drunk in quantity  i hadnt  i still laboured under the misconception that one was to drink all he could getespecially when it didnt cost anything  we shared our bottles with others and drank a good portion ourselves while i drank most of all  and i didnt like the stuff  i drank it as i had drunk beer at five and wine at seven  i mastered my qualms and downed it like so much medicine  and when we wanted more bottles we went into other saloons where the free drink was flowing and helped ourselves  i havent the slightest idea of how much i drankwhether it was two quarts or five  i do know that i began the orgy with halfpint draughts and with no water afterward to wash the taste away or to dilute the whisky  now the politicians were too wise to leave the town filled with drunks from the waterfront of oakland  when train time came there was a roundup of the saloons  already i was feeling the impact of the whisky nelson and i were hustled out of a saloon and found ourselves in the very last rank of a disorderly parade  i struggled along heroically my correlations breaking down my legs tottering under me my head swimming my heart pounding my lungs panting for air  my helplessness was coming on so rapidly that my reeling brain told me i would go down and out and never reach the train if i remained at the rear of the procession  i left the ranks and ran down a pathway beside the road under broadspreading trees  nelson pursued me laughing  certain things stand out as in memories of nightmare  i remember those trees especially and my desperate running along under them and how every time i fell roars of laughter went up from the other drunks  they thought i was merely antic drunk  they did not dream that john barleycorn had me by the throat in a deathclutch  but i knew it  and i remember the fleeting bitterness that was mine as i realised that i was in a struggle with death and that these others did not know  it was as if i were drowning before a crowd of spectators who thought i was cutting up tricks for their entertainment  and running there under the trees i fell and lost consciousness  what happened afterward with one glimmering exception i had to be told nelson with his enormous strength picked me up and dragged me on and aboard the train  when he had got me into a seat i fought and panted so terribly for air that even with his obtuseness he knew i was in a bad way  and right there at any moment i know now i might have died  i often think it is the nearest to death i have ever been  i have only nelsons description of my behaviour to go by  i was scorching up burning alive internally in an agony of fire and suffocation and i wanted air  i madly wanted air  my efforts to raise a window were vain for all the windows in the car were screwed down nelson had seen drinkcrazed men and thought i wanted to throw myself out  he tried to restrain me but i fought on  i seized some mans torch and smashed the glass  now there were pronelson and antinelson factions on the oakland waterfront and men of both factions with more drink in them than was good filled the car  my smashing of the window was the signal for the antis  one of them reached for me and dropped me and started the fight of all of which i have no knowledge save what was told me afterward and a sore jaw next day from the blow that put me out  the man who struck me went down across my body nelson followed him and they say there were few unbroken windows in the wreckage of the car that followed as the freeforall fight had its course  this being knocked cold and motionless was perhaps the best thing that could have happened to me  my violent struggles had only accelerated my already dangerously accelerated heart and increased the need for oxygen in my suffocating lungs  after the fight was over and i came to i did not come to myself  i was no more myself than a drowning man is who continues to struggle after he has lost consciousness  i have no memory of my actions but i cried air air so insistently that it dawned on nelson that i did not contemplate selfdestruction  so he cleared the jagged glass from the windowledge and let me stick my head and shoulders out  he realised partially the seriousness of my condition and held me by the waist to prevent me from crawling farther out  and for the rest of the run in to oakland i kept my head and shoulders out fighting like a maniac whenever he tried to draw me inside  and here my one glimmering streak of true consciousness came  my sole recollection from the time i fell under the trees until i awoke the following evening is of my head out of the window facing the wind caused by the train cinders striking and burning and blinding me while i breathed with will  all my will was concentrated on breathingon breathing the air in the hugest lungfull gulps i could pumping the greatest amount of air into my lungs in the shortest possible time  it was that or death and i was a swimmer and diver and i knew it and in the most intolerable agony of prolonged suffocation during those moments i was conscious i faced the wind and the cinders and breathed for life  all the rest is a blank  i came to the following evening in a waterfront lodginghouse  i was alone  no doctor had been called in and i might well have died there for nelson and the others deeming me merely sleeping off my drunk had let me lie there in a comatose condition for seventeen hours  many a man as every doctor knows has died of the sudden impact of a quart or more of whisky  usually one reads of them so dying strong drinkers on account of a wager  but i didnt knowthen  and so i learned and by no virtue nor prowess but simply through good fortune and constitution  again my constitution had triumphed over john barleycorn  i had escaped from another deathpit dragged myself through another morass and perilously acquired the discretion that would enable me to drink wisely for many another year to come  heavens that was twenty years ago and i am still very much and wisely alive and i have seen much done much lived much in that intervening score of years and i shudder when i think how close a shave i ran how near i was to missing that splendid fifth of a century that has been mine  and oh it wasnt john barleycorns fault that he didnt get me that night of the hancock fire brigade     chapter xv   it was during the early winter of 1892 that i resolved to go to sea  my hancock fire brigade experience was very little responsible for this  i still drank and frequented saloonspractically lived in saloons  whisky was dangerous in my opinion but not wrong  whisky was dangerous like other dangerous things in the natural world  men died of whisky but then too fishermen were capsized and drowned hoboes fell under trains and were cut to pieces  to cope with winds and waves railroad trains and barrooms one must use judgment  to get drunk after the manner of men was all right but one must do it with discretion  no more quarts of whisky for me  what really decided me to go to sea was that i had caught my first vision of the deathroad which john barleycorn maintains for his devotees  it was not a clear vision however and there were two phases of it somewhat jumbled at the time  it struck me from watching those with whom i associated that the life we were living was more destructive than that lived by the average man  john barleycorn by inhibiting morality incited to crime  everywhere i saw men doing drunk what they would never dream of doing sober  and this wasnt the worst of it  it was the penalty that must be paid crime was destructive  saloonmates i drank with who were good fellows and harmless sober did most violent and lunatic things when they were drunk  and then the police gathered them in and they vanished from our ken  sometimes i visited them behind the bars and said goodbye ere they journeyed across the bay to put on the felons stripes  and time and again i heard the one explanation if i hadnt been drunk i wouldnt adone it  and sometimes under the spell of john barleycorn the most frightful things were donethings that shocked even my casehardened soul  the other phase of the deathroad was that of the habitual drunkards who had a way of turning up their toes without apparent provocation  when they took sick even with trifling afflictions that any ordinary man could pull through they just pegged out  sometimes they were found unattended and dead in their beds on occasion their bodies were dragged out of the water and sometimes it was just plain accident as when bill kelley unloading cargo while drunk had a finger jerked off which under the circumstances might just as easily have been his head  so i considered my situation and knew that i was getting into a bad way of living  it made toward death too quickly to suit my youth and vitality  and there was only one way out of this hazardous manner of living and that was to get out  the sealing fleet was wintering in san francisco bay and in the saloons i met skippers mates hunters boatsteerers and boatpullers  i met the sealhunter pete holt and agreed to be his boatpuller and to sign on any schooner he signed on and i had to have half a dozen drinks with pete holt there and then to seal our agreement  and at once awoke all my old unrest that john barleycorn had put to sleep  i found myself actually bored with the saloon life of the oakland waterfront and wondered what i had ever found fascinating in it  also with this deathroad concept in my brain i began to grow afraid that something would happen to me before sailing day which was set for some time in january  i lived more circumspectly drank less deeply and went home more frequently  when drinking grew too wild i got out  when nelson was in his maniacal cups i managed to get separated from him  on the 12th of january 1893 i was seventeen and the 20th of january i signed before the shipping commissioner the articles of the sophie sutherland a three topmast sealing schooner bound on a voyage to the coast of japan  and of course we had to drink on it  joe vigy cashed my advance note and pete holt treated and i treated and joe vigy treated and other hunters treated  well it was the way of men and who was i just turned seventeen that i should decline the way of life of these fine chesty mangrown men     chapter xvi   there was nothing to drink on the sophie sutherland and we had fiftyone days of glorious sailing taking the southern passage in the northeast trades to bonin islands  this isolated group belonging to japan had been selected as the rendezvous of the canadian and american sealing fleets  here they filled their waterbarrels and made repairs before starting on the hundred days harrying of the sealherd along the northern coasts of japan to behring sea  those fiftyone days of fine sailing and intense sobriety had put me in splendid fettle  the alcohol had been worked out of my system and from the moment the voyage began i had not known the desire for a drink  i doubt if i even thought once about a drink  often of course the talk in the forecastle turned on drink and the men told of their more exciting or humorous drunks remembering such passages more keenly with greater delight than all the other passages of their adventurous lives  in the forecastle the oldest man fat and fifty was louis  he was a broken skipper  john barleycorn had thrown him and he was winding up his career where he had begun it in the forecastle  his case made quite an impression on me  john barleycorn did other things beside kill a man he hadnt killed louis  he had done much worse  he had robbed him of power and place and comfort crucified his pride and condemned him to the hardship of the common sailor that would last as long as his healthy breath lasted which promised to be for a long time  we completed our run across the pacific lifted the volcanic peaks jungleclad of the bonin islands sailed in among the reefs to the landlocked harbour and let our anchor rumble down where lay a score or more of seagypsies like ourselves  the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land  aborigines in queer outrigger canoes and japanese in queerer sampans paddled about the bay and came aboard  it was my first foreign land i had won to the other side of the world and i would see all i had read in the books come true  i was wild to get ashore  victor and axel a swede and a norwegian and i planned to keep together and so well did we that for the rest of the cruise we were known as the three sports victor pointed out a pathway that disappeared up a wild canyon emerged on a steep bare lava slope and thereafter appeared and disappeared ever climbing among the palms and flowers  we would go over that path he said and we agreed and we would see beautiful scenery and strange native villages and find heaven alone knew what adventure at the end  and axel was keen to go fishing  the three of us agreed to that too  we would get a sampan and a couple of japanese fishermen who knew the fishing grounds and we would have great sport as for me i was keen for anything  and then our plans made we rowed ashore over the banks of living coral and pulled our boat up the white beach of coral sand  we walked across the fringe of beach under the cocoanutpalms and into the little town and found several hundred riotous seamen from all the world drinking prodigiously singing prodigiously dancing prodigiouslyand all on the main street to the scandal of a helpless handful of japanese police  victor and axel said that wed have a drink before we started on our long walk  could i decline to drink with these two chesty shipmates drinking together glass in hand put the seal on comradeship  it was the way of life  our teetotaler ownercaptain was laughed at and sneered at by all of us because of his teetotalism  i didnt in the least want a drink but i did want to be a good fellow and a good comrade  nor did louis case deter me as i poured the biting scorching stuff down my throat  john barleycorn had thrown louis to a nasty fall but i was young  my blood ran full and red i had a constitution of iron andwell youth ever grins scornfully at the wreckage of age  queer fierce alcoholic stuff it was that we drank  there was no telling where or how it had been manufacturedsome native concoction most likely  but it was hot as fire pale as water and quick as death with its kick  it had been filled into empty squareface bottles which had once contained holland gin and which still bore the fitting legend anchor brand it certainly anchored us  we never got out of the town we never went fishing in the sampan  and though we were there ten days we never trod that wild path along the lava cliffs and among the flowers  we met old acquaintances from other schooners fellows we had met in the saloons of san francisco before we sailed  and each meeting meant a drink and there was much to talk about and more drinks and songs to be sung and pranks and antics to be performed until the maggots of imagination began to crawl and it all seemed great and wonderful to me these lusty hardbitten searovers of whom i made one gathered in wassail on a coral strand  old lines about knights at table in the great banquet halls and of those above the salt and below the salt and of vikings feasting fresh from sea and ripe for battle came to me and i knew that the old times were not dead and that we belonged to that selfsame ancient breed  by midafternoon victor went mad with drink and wanted to fight everybody and everything  i have since seen lunatics in the violent wards of asylums that seemed to behave in no wise different from victors way save that perhaps he was more violent  axel and i interfered as peacemakers were roughed and jostled in the mixups and finally with infinite precaution and intoxicated cunning succeeded in inveigling our chum down to the boat and in rowing him aboard our schooner  but no sooner did victors feet touch the deck than he began to clean up the ship  he had the strength of several men and he ran amuck with it i remember especially one man whom he got into the chainboxes but failed to damage through inability to hit him  the man dodged and ducked and victor broke all the knuckles of both his fists against the huge links of the anchor chain  by the time we dragged him out of that his madness had shifted to the belief that he was a great swimmer and the next moment he was overboard and demonstrating his ability by floundering like a sick porpoise and swallowing much salt water  we rescued him and by the time we got him below undressed and into his bunk we were wrecks ourselves  but axel and i wanted to see more of shore and away we went leaving victor snoring  it was curious the judgment passed on victor by his shipmates drinkers themselves  they shook their heads disapprovingly and muttered a man like that oughtnt to drink now victor was the smartest sailor and besttempered shipmate in the forecastle  he was an allround splendid type of seaman his mates recognised his worth and respected him and liked him  yet john barleycorn metamorphosed him into a violent lunatic  and that was the very point these drinkers made  they knew that drinkand drink with a sailor is always excessivemade them mad but only mildly mad  violent madness was objectionable because it spoiled the fun of others and often culminated in tragedy  from their standpoint mild madness was all right  but from the standpoint of the whole human race is not all madness objectionable and is there a greater maker of madness of all sorts than john barleycorn  but to return  ashore snugly ensconced in a japanese house of entertainment axel and i compared bruises and over a comfortable drink talked of the afternoons happenings  we liked the quietness of that drink and took another  a shipmate dropped in several shipmates dropped in and we had more quiet drinks  finally just as we had engaged a japanese orchestra and as the first strains of the samisens and taikos were rising through the paperwalls came a wild howl from the street we recognised it  still howling disdaining doorways with bloodshot eyes and wildly waving muscular arms victor burst upon us through the fragile walls  the old amuck rage was on him and he wanted blood anybodys blood  the orchestra fled so did we  we went through doorways and we went through paperwallsanything to get away  and after the place was half wrecked and we had agreed to pay the damage leaving victor partly subdued and showing symptoms of lapsing into a comatose state axel and i wandered away in quest of a quieter drinkingplace  the main street was a madness  hundreds of sailors rollicked up and down  because the chief of police with his small force was helpless the governor of the colony had issued orders to the captains to have all their men on board by sunset  what to be treated in such fashion as the news spread among the schooners they were emptied  everybody came ashore  men who had had no intention of coming ashore climbed into the boats  the unfortunate governors ukase had precipitated a general debauch for all hands  it was hours after sunset and the men wanted to see anybody try to put them on board  they went around inviting the authorities to try to put them on board  in front of the governors house they were gathered thickest bawling seasongs circulating square faces and dancing uproarious virginia reels and oldcountry dances  the police including the reserves stood in little forlorn groups waiting for the command the governor was too wise to issue  and i thought this saturnalia was great it was like the old days of the spanish main come back  it was license it was adventure  and i was part of it a chesty searover along with all these other chesty searovers among the paper houses of japan  the governor never issued the order to clear the streets and axel and i wandered on from drink to drink  after a time in some of the antics getting hazy myself i lost him  i drifted along making new acquaintances downing more drinks getting hazier and hazier  i remember somewhere sitting in a circle with japanese fishermen kanaka boatsteerers from our own vessels and a young danish sailor fresh from cowboying in the argentine and with a penchant for native customs and ceremonials  and with due and proper and most intricate japanese ceremonial we of the circle drank saki pale mild and lukewarm from tiny porcelain bowls  and later i remember the runaway apprenticesboys of eighteen and twenty of middle class english families who had jumped their ships and apprenticeships in various ports of the world and drifted into the forecastles of the sealing schooners  they were healthy smoothskinned cleareyed and they were youngyouths like me learning the way of their feet in the world of men  and they were men  no mild saki for them but square faces illicitly refilled with corrosive fire that flamed through their veins and burst into conflagrations in their heads  i remember a melting song they sang the refrain of which was     tis but a little golden ring       i give it to thee with pride     wear it for your mothers sake       when you are on the tide   they wept over it as they sang it the graceless young scamps who had all broken their mothers prides and i sang with them and wept with them and luxuriated in the pathos and the tragedy of it and struggled to make glimmering inebriated generalisations on life and romance  and one last picture i have standing out very clear and bright in the midst of vagueness before and blackness afterward  wethe apprentices and iare swaying and clinging to one another under the stars  we are singing a rollicking sea song all save one who sits on the ground and weeps and we are marking the rhythm with waving square faces  from up and down the street come far choruses of seavoices similarly singing and life is great and beautiful and romantic and magnificently mad  and next after the blackness i open my eyes in the early dawn to see a japanese woman solicitously anxious bending over me  she is the port pilots wife and i am lying in her doorway  i am chilled and shivering sick with the aftersickness of debauch  and i feel lightly clad  those rascals of runaway apprentices  they have acquired the habit of running away  they have run away with my possessions  my watch is gone  my few dollars are gone  my coat is gone  so is my belt  and yes my shoes  and the foregoing is a sample of the ten days i spent in the bonin islands  victor got over his lunacy rejoined axel and me and after that we caroused somewhat more discreetly  and we never climbed that lava path among the flowers  the town and the square faces were all we saw  one who has been burned by fire must preach about the fire  i might have seen and healthily enjoyed a whole lot more of the bonin islands if i had done what i ought to have done  but as i see it it is not a matter of what one ought to do or ought not to do  it is what one does do that is the everlasting irrefragable fact  i did just what i did  i did what all those men did in the bonin islands  i did what millions of men over the world were doing at that particular point in time  i did it because the way led to it because i was only a human boy a creature of my environment and neither an anaemic nor a god  i was just human and i was taking the path in the world that men tookmen whom i admired if you please fullblooded men lusty breedy chesty men free spirits and anything but niggards in the way they foamed life away  and the way was open  it was like an uncovered well in a yard where children play  it is small use to tell the brave little boys toddling their way along into knowledge of life that they mustnt play near the uncovered well  theyll play near it  any parent knows that  and we know that a certain percentage of them the livest and most daring will fall into the well  the thing to dowe all know itis to cover up the well  the case is the same with john barleycorn  all the nosaying and nopreaching in the world will fail to keep men and youths growing into manhood away from john barleycorn when john barleycorn is everywhere accessible and where john barleycorn is everywhere the connotation of manliness and daring and greatspiritedness  the only rational thing for the twentiethcentury folk to do is to cover up the well to make the twentieth century in truth the twentieth century and to relegate to the nineteenth century and all the preceding centuries the things of those centuries the witchburnings the intolerances the fetiches and not least among such barbarisms  john barleycorn     chapter xvii   north we raced from the bonin islands to pick up the sealherd and north we hunted it for a hundred days into frosty mitten weather and into and through vast fogs which hid the sun from us for a week at a time  it was wild and heavy work without a drink or thought of drink  then we sailed south to yokohama with a big catch of skins in our salt and a heavy payday coming  i was eager to be ashore and see japan but the first day was devoted to ships work and not until evening did we sailors land  and here by the very system of things by the way life was organised and men transacted affairs john barleycorn reached out and tucked my arm in his  the captain had given money for us to the hunters and the hunters were waiting in a certain japanese public house for us to come and get it  we rode to the place in rickshaws  our own crowd had taken possession of it  drink was flowing  everybody had money and everybody was treating after the hundred days of hard toil and absolute abstinence in the pink of physical condition bulging with health overspilling with spirits that had long been pent by discipline and circumstance of course we would have a drink or two  and after that we would see the town  it was the old story  there were so many drinks to be drunk and as the warm magic poured through our veins and mellowed our voices and affections we knew it was no time to make invidious distinctionsto drink with this shipmate and to decline to drink with that shipmate  we were all shipmates who had been through stress and storm together who had pulled and hauled on the same sheets and tackles relieved one anothers wheels laid out side by side on the same jibboom when she was plunging into it and looked to see who was missing when she cleared and lifted  so we drank with all and all treated and our voices rose and we remembered a myriad kindly acts of comradeship and forgot our fights and wordy squabbles and knew one another for the best fellows in the world  well the night was young when we arrived in that public house and for all of that first night that public house was what i saw of japana drinkingplace which was very like a drinkingplace at home or anywhere else over the world  we lay in yokohama harbour for two weeks and about all we saw of japan was its drinkingplaces where sailors congregated  occasionally some one of us varied the monotony with a more exciting drunk  in such fashion i managed a real exploit by swimming off to the schooner one dark midnight and going soundly to sleep while the waterpolice searched the harbour for my body and brought my clothes out for identification  perhaps it was for things like that i imagined that men got drunk  in our little round of living what i had done was a noteworthy event  all the harbour talked about it  i enjoyed several days of fame among the japanese boatmen and ashore in the pubs  it was a redletter event  it was an event to be remembered and narrated with pride  i remember it today twenty years afterward with a secret glow of pride  it was a purple passage just as victors wrecking of the teahouse in the bonin islands and my being looted by the runaway apprentices were purple passages  the point is that the charm of john barleycorn was still a mystery to me i was so organically a nonalcoholic that alcohol itself made no appeal the chemical reactions it produced in me were not satisfying because i possessed no need for such chemical satisfaction  i drank because the men i was with drank and because my nature was such that i could not permit myself to be less of a man than other men at their favourite pastime  and i still had a sweet tooth and on privy occasions when there was no man to see bought candy and blissfully devoured it  we hove up anchor to a jolly chanty and sailed out of yokohama harbour for san francisco  we took the northern passage and with the stout west wind at our back made the run across the pacific in thirtyseven days of brave sailing  we still had a big payday coming to us and for thirtyseven days without a drink to addle our mental processes we incessantly planned the spending of our money  the first statement of each manever an ancient one in homewardbound forecastleswas no boardinghouse sharks in mine next in parentheses was regret at having spent so much money in yokohama  and after that each man proceeded to paint his favourite phantom  victor for instance said that immediately he landed in san francisco he would pass right through the waterfront and the barbary coast and put an advertisement in the papers  his advertisement would be for board and room in some simple workingclass family  then said victor i shall go to some dancingschool for a week or two just to meet and get acquainted with the girls and fellows  then ill get the run of the different dancing crowds and be invited to their homes and to parties and all that and with the money ive got i can last out till next january when ill go sealing again  no he wasnt going to drink  he knew the way of it particularly his way of it wine in wit out and his money would be gone in no time  he had his choice based on bitter experience between three days debauch among the sharks and harpies of the barbary coast and a whole winter of wholesome enjoyment and sociability and there wasnt any doubt of the way he was going to choose  said axel gunderson who didnt care for dancing and social functions ive got a good payday  now i can go home  it is fifteen years since ive seen my mother and all the family  when i pay off i shall send my money home to wait for me  then ill pick a good ship bound for europe and arrive there with another payday  put them together and ill have more money than ever in my life before  ill be a prince at home  you havent any idea how cheap everything is in norway  i can make presents to everybody and spend my money like what would seem to them a millionaire and live a whole year there before id have to go back to sea  the very thing im going to do declared red john  its three years since ive received a line from home and ten years since i was there things are just as cheap in sweden axel as in norway and my folks are real country folk and farmers  ill send my payday home and ship on the same ship with you for around the horn  well pick a good one  and as axel gunderson and red john painted the pastoral delights and festive customs of their respective countries each fell in love with the others home place and they solemnly pledged to make the journey together and to spend together six months in the ones swedish home and six months in the others norwegian home  and for the rest of the voyage they could hardly be pried apart so infatuated did they become with discussing their plans  long john was not a homebody  but he was tired of the forecastle  no boardinghouse sharks in his  he too would get a room in a quiet family and he would go to a navigation school and study to be a captain and so it went  each man swore that for once he would be sensible and not squander his money  no boardinghouse sharks no sailortown no drink was the slogan of our forecastle  the men became stingy  never was there such economy  they refused to buy anything more from the slopchest  old rags had to last and they sewed patch upon patch turning out what are called homewardbound patches of the most amazing proportions  they saved on matches even waiting till two or three were ready to light their pipes from the same match  as we sailed up the san francisco waterfront the moment the port doctors passed us the boardinghouse runners were alongside in whitehall boats  they swarmed on board each drumming for his own boardinghouse and each with a bottle of free whisky inside his shirt  but we waved them grandly and blasphemously away  we wanted none of their boardinghouses and none of their whisky  we were sober thrifty sailormen with better use for our money  came the paying off before the shipping commissioner  we emerged upon the sidewalk each with a pocketful of money  about us like buzzards clustered the sharks and harpies  and we looked at each other  we had been seven months together and our paths were separating  one last farewell rite of comradeship remained  oh it was the way the custom come on boys said our sailing master  there stood the inevitable adjacent saloon  there were a dozen saloons all around  and when we had followed the sailing master into the one of his choice the sharks were thick on the sidewalk outside  some of them even ventured inside but we would have nothing to do with them  there we stood at the long barthe sailing master the mate the six hunters the six boatsteerers and the five boatpullers  there were only five of the last for one of our number had been dropped overboard with a sack of coal at his feet between two snow squalls in a driving gale off cape jerimo  there were nineteen of us and it was to be our last drink together  with seven months of mens work in the world blow high blow low behind us we were looking on each other for the last time  we knew it for sailors ways go wide  and the nineteen of us drank the sailing masters treat  then the mate looked at us with eloquent eyes and called another round  we liked the mate just as well as the sailing master and we liked them both  could we drink with one and not the other  and pete holt my own hunter lost next year in the mary thomas with all hands called a round  the time passed the drinks continued to come on the bar our voices rose and the maggots began to crawl  there were six hunters and each insisted in the sacred name of comradeship that all hands drink with him just once  there were six boatsteerers and five boatpullers and the same logic held with them  there was money in all our pockets and our money was as good as any mans and our hearts were as free and generous  nineteen rounds of drinks  what more would john barleycorn ask in order to have his will with men they were ripe to forget their dearly cherished plans  they rolled out of the saloon and into the arms of the sharks and harpies  they didnt last long  from two days to a week saw the end of their money and saw them being carted by the boardinghouse masters on board outwardbound ships  victor was a fine body of a man and through a lucky friendship managed to get into the lifesaving service  he never saw the dancingschool nor placed his advertisement for a room in a workingclass family  nor did long john win to navigation school  by the end of the week he was a transient lumper on a river steamboat  red john and axel did not send their paydays home to the old country  instead and along with the rest they were scattered on board sailing ships bound for the four quarters of the globe where they had been placed by the boardinghouse masters and where they were working out advance money which they had neither seen nor spent  what saved me was that i had a home and people to go to  i crossed the bay to oakland and among other things took a look at the deathroad nelson was goneshot to death while drunk and resisting the officers his partner in that affair was lying in prison  whisky bob was gone old cole old smoudge and bob smith were gone  another smith he of the belted guns and the annie was drowned  french frank they said was lurking up river afraid to come down because of something he had done others were wearing the stripes in san quentin or folsom  big alec the king of the greeks whom i had known well in the old benicia days and with whom i had drunk whole nights through had killed two men and fled to foreign parts  fitzsimmons with whom i had sailed on the fish patrol had been stabbed in the lung through the back and had died a lingering death complicated with tuberculosis  and so it went a very lively and wellpatronised road and from what i knew of all of them john barleycorn was responsible with the sole exception of smith of the annie     chapter xviii   my infatuation for the oakland waterfront was quite dead  i didnt like the looks of it nor the life  i didnt care for the drinking nor the vagrancy of it and i wandered back to the oakland free library and read the books with greater understanding  then too my mother said i had sown my wild oats and it was time i settled down to a regular job  also the family needed the money  so i got a job at the jute millsa tenhour day at ten cents an hour  despite my increase in strength and general efficiency i was receiving no more than when i worked in the cannery several years before  but then there was a promise of a rise to a dollar and a quarter a day after a few months  and here so far as john barleycorn is concerned began a period of innocence  i did not know what it was to take a drink from month end to month end  not yet eighteen years old healthy and with labourhardened but unhurt muscles like any young animal i needed diversion excitement something beyond the books and the mechanical toil  i strayed into young mens christian associations  the life there was healthful and athletic but too juvenile  for me it was too late  i was not boy nor youth despite my paucity of years  i had bucked big with men  i knew mysterious and violent things  i was from the other side of life so far as concerned the young men i encountered in the ymca  i spoke another language possessed a sadder and more terrible wisdom when i come to think it over i realise now that i have never had a boyhood  at any rate the ymca young men were too juvenile for me too unsophisticated  this i would not have minded could they have met me and helped me mentally  but i had got more out of the books than they  their meagre physical experiences plus their meagre intellectual experiences made a negative sum so vast that it overbalanced their wholesome morality and healthful sports  in short i couldnt play with the pupils of a lower grade  all the clean splendid young life that was theirs was denied methanks to my earlier tutelage under john barleycorn  i knew too much too young  and yet in the good time coming when alcohol is eliminated from the needs and the institutions of men it will be the ymca and similar unthinkably better and wiser and more virile congregatingplaces that will receive the men who now go to saloons to find themselves and one another  in the meantime we live today here and now and we discuss today here and now  i was working ten hours a day in the jute mills  it was humdrum machine toil  i wanted life  i wanted to realise myself in other ways than at a machine for ten cents an hour  and yet i had had my fill of saloons  i wanted something new  i was growing up  i was developing unguessed and troubling potencies and proclivities  and at this very stage fortunately i met louis shattuck and we became chums  louis shattuck without one vicious trait was a real innocently devilish young fellow who was quite convinced that he was a sophisticated town boy  and i wasnt a town boy at all  louis was handsome and graceful and filled with love for the girls  with him it was an exciting and allabsorbing pursuit  i didnt know anything about girls  i had been too busy being a man  this was an entirely new phase of existence which had escaped me  and when i saw louis say goodbye to me raise his hat to a girl of his acquaintance and walk on with her side by side down the sidewalk i was made excited and envious  i too wanted to play this game  well theres only one thing to do said louis and that is you must get a girl  which is more difficult than it sounds  let me show you at the expense of a slight going aside  louis did not know girls in their home life he had the entree to no girls home  and of course i a stranger in this new world was similarly circumstanced  but further louis and i were unable to go to dancingschools or to public dances which were very good places for getting acquainted  we didnt have the money  he was a blacksmiths apprentice and was earning but slightly more than i we both lived at home and paid our way  when we had done this and bought our cigarettes and the inevitable clothes and shoes there remained to each of us for personal spending a sum that varied between seventy cents and a dollar for the week  we whacked this up shared it and sometimes loaned all of what was left of it when one of us needed it for some more gorgeous girladventure such as carfare out to blairs park and backtwenty cents bang just like that and icecream for twothirty cents or tamales in a tamaleparlour which came cheaper and which for two cost only twenty cents  i did not mind this money meagreness  the disdain i had learned for money from the oyster pirates had never left me  i didnt care overweeningly for it for personal gratification and in my philosophy i completed the circle finding myself as equable with the lack of a tencent piece as i was with the squandering of scores of dollars in calling all men and hangerson up to the bar to drink with me  but how to get a girl there was no girls home to which louis could take me and where i might be introduced to girls  i knew none  and louis several girls he wanted for himself and anyway in the very human nature of boys and girls ways he couldnt turn any of them over to me  he did persuade them to bring girlfriends for me but i found them weak sisters pale and ineffectual alongside the choice specimens he had  youll have to do like i did he said finally  i got these by getting them  youll have to get one the same way  and he initiated me  it must be remembered that louis and i were hard situated  we really had to struggle to pay our board and maintain a decent appearance  we met each other in the evening after the days work on the street corner or in a little candy store on a side street our sole frequentingplace  here we bought our cigarettes and occasionally a nickels worth of redhots oh yes louis and i unblushingly ate candyall we could get  neither of us drank  neither of us ever went into a saloon  but the girl  in quite primitive fashion as louis advised me i was to select her and make myself acquainted with her  we strolled the streets in the early evenings  the girls like us strolled in pairs  and strolling girls will look at strolling boys who look  and to this day in any town city or village in which i in my middle age find myself i look on with the eye trained of old experience and watch the sweet innocent game played by the strolling boys and girls who just must stroll when the spring and summer evenings call  the trouble was that in this arcadian phase of my history i who had come through casehardened from the other side of life was timid and bashful  again and again louis nerved me up  but i didnt know girls they were strange and wonderful to me after my precocious mans life  i failed of the bold front and the necessary forwardness when the crucial moment came  then louis would show me howa certain eloquent glance of eye a smile a daring a lifted hat a spoken word hesitancies giggles coy nervousnessesand behold louis acquainted and nodding me up to be introduced  but when we paired off to stroll along boy and girl together i noted that louis had invariably picked the goodlooker and left to me the little lame sister  i improved of course after experiences too numerous to enter upon so that there were divers girls to whom i could lift my hat and who would walk beside me in the early evenings  but girls love did not immediately come to me  i was excited interested and i pursued the quest  and the thought of drink never entered my mind  some of louis and my adventures have since given me serious pause when casting sociological generalisations  but it was all good and innocently youthful and i learned one generalisation biological rather than sociological namely that the colonels lady and judy ogrady are sisters under their skins  and before long i learned girls love all the dear fond deliciousness of it all the glory and the wonder  i shall call her haydee  she was between fifteen and sixteen  her little skirt reached her shoetops  we sat side by side in a salvation army meeting  she was not a convert nor was her aunt who sat on the other side of her and who visiting from the country where at that time the salvation army was not had dropped in to the meeting for half an hour out of curiosity  and louis sat beside me and observedi do believe he did no more than observe because haydee was not his style of girl  we did not speak but in that great halfhour we glanced shyly at each other and shyly avoided or as shyly returned and met each others glances more than several times  she had a slender oval face  her brown eyes were beautiful  her nose was a dream as was her sweetlipped petulanthinting mouth  she wore a tamoshanter and i thought her brown hair the prettiest shade of brown i had ever seen  and from that single experience of half an hour i have ever since been convinced of the reality of love at first sight  all too soon the aunt and haydee departed  this is permissible at any stage of a salvation army meeting  i was no longer interested in the meeting and after an appropriate interval of a couple of minutes or less started to leave with louis  as we passed out at the back of the hall a woman recognised me with her eyes arose and followed me  i shall not describe her  she was of my own kind and friendship of the old time on the waterfront  when nelson was shot he had died in her arms and she knew me as his one comrade  and she must tell me how nelson had died and i did want to know so i went with her across the width of life from dawning boys love for a brownhaired girl in a tamoshanter back to the old sad savagery i had known  and when i had heard the tale i hurried away to find louis fearing that i had lost my first love with the first glimpse of her  but louis was dependable  her name washaydee  he knew where she lived  each day she passed the blacksmiths shop where he worked going to or from the lafayette school  further he had seen her on occasion with ruth another schoolgirl and still further nita who sold us redhots at the candy store was a friend of ruth  the thing to do was to go around to the candy store and see if we could get nita to give a note to ruth to give to haydee  if this could be arranged all i had to do was write the note  and it so happened  and in stolen halfhours of meeting i came to know all the sweet madness of boys love and girls love  so far as it goes it is not the biggest love in the world but i do dare to assert that it is the sweetest  oh as i look back on it  never did girl have more innocent boylover than i who had been so wickedwise and violent beyond my years  i didnt know the first thing about girls  i who had been hailed prince of the oyster pirates who could go anywhere in the world as a man amongst men who could sail boats lay aloft in black and storm or go into the toughest hangouts in sailor town and play my part in any roughhouse that started or call all hands to the bari didnt know the first thing i might say or do with this slender little chit of a girlwoman whose scant skirt just reached her shoetops and who was as abysmally ignorant of life as i was or thought i was profoundly wise  i remember we sat on a bench in the starlight  there was fully a foot of space between us  we slightly faced each other our near elbows on the back of the bench and once or twice our elbows just touched  and all the time deliriously happy talking in the gentlest and most delicate terms that might not offend her sensitive ears i was cudgelling my brains in an effort to divine what i was expected to do  what did girls expect of boys sitting on a bench and tentatively striving to find out what love was  what did she expect me to do was i expected to kiss her did she expect me to try and if she did expect me and i didnt what would she think of me  ah she was wiser than ii know it nowthe little innocent girlwoman in her shoetop skirt  she had known boys all her life  she encouraged me in the ways a girl may  her gloves were off and in one hand and i remember lightly and daringly in mock reproof for something i had said how she tapped my lips with a tiny flirt of those gloves  i was like to swoon with delight  it was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to me  and i remember yet the faint scent that clung to those gloves and that i breathed in the moment they touched my lips  then came the agony of apprehension and doubt  should i imprison in my hand that little hand with the dangling scented gloves which had just tapped my lips should i dare to kiss her there and then or slip my arm around her waist or dared i even sit closer  well i didnt dare  i did nothing  i merely continued to sit there and love with all my soul  and when we parted that evening i had not kissed her  i do remember the first time i kissed her on another evening at partinga mighty moment when i took all my heart of courage and dared we never succeeded in managing more than a dozen stolen meetings and we kissed perhaps a dozen timesas boys and girls kiss briefly and innocently and wonderingly  we never went anywherenot even to a matinee  we once shared together five cents worth of redhots  but i have always fondly believed that she loved me  i know i loved her and i dreamed daydreams of her for a year and more and the memory of her is very dear     chapter xix   when i was with people who did not drink i never thought of drinking louis did not drink  neither he nor i could afford it but more significant than that we had no desire to drink  we were healthy normal nonalcoholic  had we been alcoholic we would have drunk whether or not we could have afforded it  each night after the days work washed up clothes changed and supper eaten we met on the street corner or in the little candy store  but the warm fall weather passed and on bitter nights of frost or damp nights of drizzle the street corner was not a comfortable meetingplace  and the candy store was unheated  nita or whoever waited on the counter between waitings lurked in a back livingroom that was heated  we were not admitted to this room and in the store it was as cold as outofdoors  louis and i debated the situation  there was only one solution the saloon the congregatingplace of men the place where men hobnobbed with john barleycorn  well do i remember the damp and draughty evening shivering without overcoats because we could not afford them that louis and i started out to select our saloon  saloons are always warm and comfortable  now louis and i did not go into this saloon because we wanted a drink  yet we knew that saloons were not charitable institutions  a man could not make a loungingplace of a saloon without occasionally buying something over the bar  our dimes and nickels were few  we could ill spare any of them when they were so potent in paying carfare for oneself and a girl  we never paid carfare when by ourselves being content to walk  so in this saloon we desired to make the most of our expenditure  we called for a deck of cards and sat down at a table and played euchre for an hour in which time louis treated once and i treated once to beerthe cheapest drink ten cents for two  prodigal how we grudged it  we studied the men who came into the place  they seemed all middleaged and elderly workmen most of them germans who flocked by themselves in oldacquaintance groups and with whom we could have only the slightest contacts  we voted against that saloon and went out cast down with the knowledge that we had lost an evening and wasted twenty cents for beer that we didnt want  we made several more tries on succeeding nights and at last found our way into the national a saloon on tenth and franklin  here was a more congenial crowd  here louis met a fellow or two he knew and here i met fellows i had gone to school with when a little lad in knee pants  we talked of old days and of what had become of this fellow and what that fellow was doing now and of course we talked it over drinks  they treated and we drank  then according to the code of drinking we had to treat  it hurt for it meant forty to fifty cents a clatter  we felt quite enlivened when the short evening was over but at the same time we were bankrupt  our weeks spending money was gone  we decided that that was the saloon for us and we agreed to be more circumspect thereafter in our drinkbuying  also we had to economise for the rest of the week  we didnt even have carfare  we were compelled to break an engagement with two girls from west oakland with whom we were attempting to be in love  they were to meet us up town the next evening and we hadnt the carfare necessary to take them home  like many others financially embarrassed we had to disappear for a time from the gay whirlat least until saturday night payday  so louis and i rendezvoused in a livery stable and with coats buttoned and chattering teeth played euchre and casino until the time of our exile was over  then we returned to the national saloon and spent no more than we could decently avoid spending for the comfort and warmth  sometimes we had mishaps as when one got stuck twice in succession in a fivehanded game of sancho pedro for the drinks  such a disaster meant anywhere between twentyfive to eighty cents just according to how many of the players ordered tencent drinks  but we could temporarily escape the evil effects of such disaster by virtue of an account we ran behind the bar of course this only set back the day of reckoning and seduced us into spending more than we would have spent on a cash basis  when i left oakland suddenly for the adventurepath the following spring i well remember i owed that saloonkeeper one dollar and seventy cents  long after when i returned he was gone  i still owe him that dollar and seventy cents and if he should chance to read these lines i want him to know that ill pay on demand  the foregoing incident of the national saloon i have given in order again to show the lure or draw or compulsion toward john barleycorn in society as at present organised with saloons on all the corners  louis and i were two healthy youths  we didnt want to drink  we couldnt afford to drink  and yet we were driven by the circumstance of cold and rainy weather to seek refuge in a saloon where we had to spend part of our pitiful dole for drink  it will be urged by some critics that we might have gone to the ymca to night school and to the social circles and homes of young people  the only reply is that we didnt that is the irrefragable fact  we didnt  and today at this moment there are hundreds of thousands of boys like louis and me doing just what louis and i did with john barleycorn warm and comfortable beckoning and welcoming tucking their arms in his and beginning to teach them his mellow ways     chapter xx   the jute mills failed of its agreement to increase my pay to a dollar and a quarter a day and i a freeborn american boy whose direct ancestors had fought in all the wars from the old prerevolutionary indian wars down exercised my sovereign right of free contract by quitting the job  i was still resolved to settle down and i looked about me  one thing was clear  unskilled labour didnt pay  i must learn a trade and i decided on electricity  the need for electricians was constantly growing  but how to become an electrician i hadnt the money to go to a technical school or university besides i didnt think much of schools i was a practical man in a practical world  also i still believed in the old myths which were the heritage of the american boy when i was a boy  a canal boy could become a president  any boy who took employment with any firm could by thrift energy and sobriety learn the business and rise from position to position until he was taken in as a junior partner after that the senior partnership was only a matter of time  very oftenso ran the myththe boy by reason of his steadiness and application married his employers daughter  by this time i had been encouraged to such faith in myself in the matter of girls that i was quite certain i would marry my employers daughter  there wasnt a doubt of it  all the little boys in the myths did it as soon as they were old enough  so i bade farewell for ever to the adventurepath and went out to the power plant of one of our oakland street railways  i saw the superintendent himself in a private office so fine that it almost stunned me  but i talked straight up  i told him i wanted to become a practical electrician that i was unafraid of work that i was used to hard work and that all he had to do was look at me to see i was fit and strong  i told him that i wanted to begin right at the bottom and work up that i wanted to devote my life to this one occupation and this one employment  the superintendent beamed as he listened  he told me that i was the right stuff for success and that he believed in encouraging american youth that wanted to rise  why employers were always on the lookout for young fellows like me and alas they found them all too rarely  my ambition was fine and worthy and he would see to it that i got my chance  and as i listened with swelling heart i wondered if it was his daughter i was to marry  before you can go out on the road and learn the more complicated and higher details of the profession he said you will of course have to work in the carhouse with the men who install and repair the motors by this time i was sure that it was his daughter and i was wondering how much stock he might own in the company  but he said as you yourself so plainly see you couldnt expect to begin as a helper to the carhouse electricians  that will come when you have worked up to it  you will really begin at the bottom  in the carhouse your first employment will be sweeping up washing the windows keeping things clean  and after you have shown yourself satisfactory at that then you may become a helper to the carhouse electricians  i didnt see how sweeping and scrubbing a building was any preparation for the trade of electrician but i did know that in the books all the boys started with the most menial tasks and by making good ultimately won to the ownership of the whole concern  when shall i come to work i asked eager to launch on this dazzling career  but said the superintendent as you and i have already agreed you must begin at the bottom  not immediately can you in any capacity enter the carhouse  before that you must pass through the engineroom as an oiler  my heart went down slightly and for the moment as i saw the road lengthen between his daughter and me then it rose again  i would be a better electrician with knowledge of steam engines  as an oiler in the great engineroom i was confident that few things concerning steam would escape me  heavens my career shone more dazzling than ever  when shall i come to work i asked gratefully  but said the superintendent you could not expect to enter immediately into the engineroom  there must be preparation for that and through the fireroom of course  come you see the matter clearly i know  and you will see that even the mere handling of coal is a scientific matter and not to be sneered at  do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn thus we learn the value of the coal we buy we know to a tee the last penny of cost of every item of production and we learn which firemen are the most wasteful which firemen out of stupidity or carelessness get the least out of the coal they fire the superintendent beamed again  you see how very important the little matter of coal is and by as much as you learn of this little matter you will become that much better a workmanmore valuable to us more valuable to yourself  now are you prepared to begin  any time i said valiantly  the sooner the better  very well he answered  you will come tomorrow morning at seven oclock  i was taken out and shown my duties  also i was told the terms of my employmenta tenhour day every day in the month including sundays and holidays with one day off each month with a salary of thirty dollars a month  it wasnt exciting  years before at the cannery i had earned a dollar a day for a tenhour day  i consoled myself with the thought that the reason my earning capacity had not increased with my years and strength was because i had remained an unskilled labourer  but it was different now  i was beginning to work for skill for a trade for career and fortune and the superintendents daughter  and i was beginning in the right wayright at the beginning  that was the thing  i was passing coal to the firemen who shovelled it into the furnaces where its energy was transformed into steam which in the engineroom was transformed into the electricity with which the electricians worked  this passing coal was surely the very beginningunless the superintendent should take it into his head to send me to work in the mines from which the coal came in order to get a completer understanding of the genesis of electricity for street railways  work i who had worked with men found that i didnt know the first thing about real work  a tenhour day i had to pass coal for the day and night shifts and despite working through the noonhour i never finished my task before eight at night  i was working a twelveto thirteenhour day and i wasnt being paid overtime as in the cannery  i might as well give the secret away right here  i was doing the work of two men  before me one mature ablebodied labourer had done the day shift and another equally mature ablebodied labourer had done the nightshift  they had received forty dollars a month each  the superintendent bent on an economical administration had persuaded me to do the work of both men for thirty dollars a month  i thought he was making an electrician of me  in truth and fact he was saving fifty dollars a month operating expenses to the company  but i didnt know i was displacing two men  nobody told me  on the contrary the superintendent warned everybody not to tell me  how valiantly i went at it that first day  i worked at top speed filling the iron wheelbarrow with coal running it on the scales and weighing the load then trundling it into the fireroom and dumping it on the plates before the fires  work i did more than the two men whom i had displaced  they had merely wheeled in the coal and dumped it on the plates  but while i did this for the day coal the night coal i had to pile against the wall of the fireroom  now the fireroom was small  it had been planned for a night coalpasser  so i had to pile the night coal higher and higher buttressing up the heap with stout planks  toward the top of the heap i had to handle the coal a second time tossing it up with a shovel  i dripped with sweat but i never ceased from my stride though i could feel exhaustion coming on  by ten oclock in the morning so much of my bodys energy had i consumed i felt hungry and snatched a thick doubleslice of bread and butter from my dinner pail  this i devoured standing grimed with coaldust my knees trembling under me  by eleven oclock in this fashion i had consumed my whole lunch  but what of it i realised that it would enable me to continue working through the noon hour  and i worked all the afternoon  darkness came on and i worked under the electric lights  the day fireman went off and the night fireman came on  i plugged away  at halfpast eight famished tottering i washed up changed my clothes and dragged my weary body to the car  it was three miles to where i lived and i had received a pass with the stipulation that i could sit down as long as there were no paying passengers in need of a seat  as i sank into a corner outside seat i prayed that no passenger might require my seat  but the car filled up and halfway in a woman came on board and there was no seat for her  i started to get up and to my astonishment found that i could not  with the chill wind blowing on me my spent body had stiffened into the seat  it took me the rest of the run in to unkink my complaining joints and muscles and get into a standing position on the lower step  and when the car stopped at my corner i nearly fell to the ground when i stepped off  i hobbled two blocks to the house and limped into the kitchen  while my mother started to cook i plunged into bread and butter but before my appetite was appeased or the steak fried i was sound asleep  in vain my mother strove to shake me awake enough to eat the meat  failing in this with the assistance of my father she managed to get me to my room where i collapsed dead asleep on the bed  they undressed me and covered me up  in the morning came the agony of being awakened  i was terribly sore and worst of all my wrists were swelling  but i made up for my lost supper eating an enormous breakfast and when i hobbled to catch my car i carried a lunch twice as big as the one the day before  work let any youth just turned eighteen try to outshovel two mangrown coalshovellers  work long before midday i had eaten the last scrap of my huge lunch  but i was resolved to show them what a husky young fellow determined to rise could do  the worst of it was that my wrists were swelling and going back on me  there are few who do not know the pain of walking on a sprained ankle  then imagine the pain of shovelling coal and trundling a loaded wheelbarrow with two sprained wrists  work more than once i sank down on the coal where no one could see me and cried with rage and mortification and exhaustion and despair that second day was my hardest and all that enabled me to survive it and get in the last of the night coal at the end of thirteen hours was the day fireman who bound both my wrists with broad leather straps  so tightly were they buckled that they were like slightly flexible plaster casts  they took the stresses and pressures which hitherto had been borne by my wrists and they were so tight that there was no room for the inflammation to rise in the sprains  and in this fashion i continued to learn to be an electrician  night after night i limped home fell asleep before i could eat my supper and was helped into bed and undressed  morning after morning always with huger lunches in my dinner pail i limped out of the house on my way to work  i no longer read my library books  i made no dates with the girls  i was a proper work beast  i worked and ate and slept while my mind slept all the time  the whole thing was a nightmare  i worked every day including sunday and i looked far ahead to my one day off at the end of a month resolved to lie abed all that day and just sleep and rest up  the strangest part of this experience was that i never took a drink nor thought of taking a drink  yet i knew that men under hard pressure almost invariably drank  i had seen them do it and in the past had often done it myself  but so sheerly nonalcoholic was i that it never entered my mind that a drink might be good for me  i instance this to show how entirely lacking from my makeup was any predisposition toward alcohol  and the point of this instance is that later on after more years had passed contact with john barleycorn at last did induce in me the alcoholic desire  i had often noticed the day fireman staring at me in a curious way  at last one day he spoke  he began by swearing me to secrecy  he had been warned by the superintendent not to tell me and in telling me he was risking his job  he told me of the day coalpasser and the night coalpasser and of the wages they had received  i was doing for thirty dollars a month what they had received eighty dollars for doing  he would have told me sooner the fireman said had he not been so certain that i would break down under the work and quit  as it was i was killing myself and all to no good purpose  i was merely cheapening the price of labour he argued and keeping two men out of a job  being an american boy and a proud american boy i did not immediately quit  this was foolish of me i know but i resolved to continue the work long enough to prove to the superintendent that i could do it without breaking down  then i would quit and he would realise what a fine young fellow he had lost  all of which i faithfully and foolishly did  i worked on until the time came when i got in the last of the night coal by six oclock  then i quit the job of learning electricity by doing more than two mens work for a boys wages went home and proceeded to sleep the clock around  fortunately i had not stayed by the job long enough to injure myselfthough i was compelled to wear straps on my wrists for a year afterward  but the effect of this work orgy in which i had indulged was to sicken me with work  i just wouldnt work  the thought of work was repulsive  i didnt care if i never settled down  learning a trade could go hang  it was a whole lot better to royster and frolic over the world in the way i had previously done  so i headed out on the adventurepath again starting to tramp east by beating my way on the railroads     chapter xxi   but behold as soon as i went out on the adventurepath i met john barleycorn again  i moved through a world of strangers and the act of drinking together made one acquainted with men and opened the way to adventures  it might be in a saloon with jingled townsmen or with a genial railroad man well lighted up and armed with pocket flasks or with a bunch of alki stiffs in a hangout  yes and it might be in a prohibition state such as iowa was in 1894 when i wandered up the main street of des moines and was variously invited by strangers into various blind pigsi remember drinking in barbershops plumbing establishments and furniture stores  always it was john barleycorn  even a tramp in those halcyon days could get most frequently drunk  i remember inside the prison at buffalo how some of us got magnificently jingled and how on the streets of buffalo after our release another jingle was financed with pennies begged on the maindrag  i had no call for alcohol but when i was with those who drank i drank with them  i insisted on travelling or loafing with the livest keenest men and it was just these live keen ones that did most of the drinking they were the more comradely men the more venturous the more individual  perhaps it was too much temperament that made them turn from the commonplace and humdrum to find relief in the lying and fantastic sureties of john barleycorn  be that as it may the men i liked best desired most to be with were invariably to be found in john barleycorns company  in the course of my tramping over the united states i achieved a new concept  as a tramp i was behind the scenes of societyaye and down in the cellar  i could watch the machinery work  i saw the wheels of the social machine go around and i learned that the dignity of manual labour wasnt what i had been told it was by the teachers preachers and politicians  the men without trades were helpless cattle  if one learned a trade he was compelled to belong to a union in order to work at his trade  and his union was compelled to bully and slug the employers unions in order to hold up wages or hold down hours  the employers unions likewise bullied and slugged  i couldnt see any dignity at all  and when a workman got old or had an accident he was thrown into the scrapheap like any wornout machine  i saw too many of this sort who were making anything but dignified ends of life  so my new concept was that manual labour was undignified and that it didnt pay  no trade for me was my decision and no superintendents daughters  and no criminality i also decided  that would be almost as disastrous as to be a labourer  brains paid not brawn and i resolved never again to offer my muscles for sale in the brawn market  brain and brain only would i sell  i returned to california with the firm intention of developing my brain this meant school education  i had gone through the grammar school long ago so i entered the oakland high school  to pay my way i worked as a janitor  my sister helped me too and i was not above mowing anybodys lawn or taking up and beating carpets when i had half a day to spare  i was working to get away from work and i buckled down to it with a grim realisation of the paradox  boy and girl love was left behind and along with it haydee and louis shattuck and the early evening strolls  i hadnt the time  i joined the henry clay debating society  i was received into the homes of some of the members where i met nice girls whose skirts reached the ground i dallied with little home clubs wherein we discussed poetry and art and the nuances of grammar  i joined the socialist local where we studied and orated political economy philosophy and politics  i kept half a dozen membership cards working in the free library and did an immense amount of collateral reading  and for a year and a half on end i never took a drink nor thought of taking a drink  i hadnt the time and i certainly did not have the inclination  between my janitorwork my studies and innocent amusements such as chess i hadnt a moment to spare  i was discovering a new world and such was the passion of my exploration that the old world of john barleycorn held no inducements for me  come to think of it i did enter a saloon  i went to see johnny heinhold in the last chance and i went to borrow money  and right here is another phase of john barleycorn  saloonkeepers are notoriously good fellows  on an average they perform vastly greater generosities than do business men  when i simply had to have ten dollars desperate with no place to turn i went to johnny heinhold  several years had passed since i had been in his place or spent a cent across his bar  and when i went to borrow the ten dollars i didnt buy a drink either  and johnny heinhold let me have the ten dollars without security or interest  more than once in the brief days of my struggle for an education i went to johnny heinhold to borrow money  when i entered the university i borrowed forty dollars from him without interest without security without buying a drink  and yetand here is the point the custom and the codein the days of my prosperity after the lapse of years i have gone out of my way by many a long block to spend across johnny heinholds bar deferred interest on the various loans  not that johnny heinhold asked me to do it or expected me to do it  i did it as i have said in obedience to the code i had learned along with all the other things connected with john barleycorn  in distress when a man has no other place to turn when he hasnt the slightest bit of security which a savagehearted pawnbroker would consider he can go to some saloonkeeper he knows  gratitude is inherently human  when the man so helped has money again depend upon it that a portion will be spent across the bar of the saloonkeeper who befriended him  why i recollect the early days of my writing career when the small sums of money i earned from the magazines came with tragic irregularity while at the same time i was staggering along with a growing familya wife children a mother a nephew and my mammy jennie and her old husband fallen on evil days  there were two places at which i could borrow money a barber shop and a saloon  the barber charged me five per cent per month in advance  that is to say when i borrowed one hundred dollars he handed me ninetyfive  the other five dollars he retained as advance interest for the first month  and on the second month i paid him five dollars more and continued so to do each month until i made a ten strike with the editors and lifted the loan  the other place to which i came in trouble was the saloon  this saloonkeeper i had known by sight for a couple of years  i had never spent my money in his saloon and even when i borrowed from him i didnt spend any money  yet never did he refuse me any sum i asked of him unfortunately before i became prosperous he moved away to another city and to this day i regret that he is gone  it is the code i have learned the right thing to do and the thing id do right now did i know where he is would be to drop in on occasion and spend a few dollars across his bar for old sakes sake and gratitude  this is not to exalt saloonkeepers  i have written it to exalt the power of john barleycorn and to illustrate one more of the myriad ways by which a man is brought in contact with john barleycorn until in the end he finds he cannot get along without him  but to return to the run of my narrative  away from the adventurepath up to my ears in study every moment occupied i lived oblivious to john barleycorns existence  nobody about me drank  if any had drunk and had they offered it to me i surely would have drunk  as it was when i had spare moments i spent them playing chess or going with nice girls who were themselves students or in riding a bicycle whenever i was fortunate enough to have it out of the pawnbrokers possession  what i am insisting upon all the time is this in me was not the slightest trace of alcoholic desire and this despite the long and severe apprenticeship i had served under john barleycorn  i had come back from the other side of life to be delighted with this arcadian simplicity of student youths and student maidens  also i had found my way into the realm of the mind and i was intellectually intoxicated  alas as i was to learn at a later period intellectual intoxication too has its katzenjammer     chapter xxii   three years was the time required to go through the high school  i grew impatient  also my schooling was becoming financially impossible  at such rate i could not last out and i did greatly want to go to the state university  when i had done a year of high school i decided to attempt a short cut  i borrowed the money and paid to enter the senior class of a cramming joint or academy  i was scheduled to graduate right into the university at the end of four months thus saving two years  and how i did cram i had two years new work to do in a third of a year for five weeks i crammed until simultaneous quadratic equations and chemical formulas fairly oozed from my ears  and then the master of the academy took me aside  he was very sorry but he was compelled to give me back my tuition fee and to ask me to leave the school  it wasnt a matter of scholarship  i stood well in my classes and did he graduate me into the university he was confident that in that institution i would continue to stand well  the trouble was that tongues were gossiping about my case  what in four months accomplished two years work it would be a scandal and the universities were becoming severer in their treatment of accredited prep schools  he couldnt afford such a scandal therefore i must gracefully depart  i did  and i paid back the borrowed money and gritted my teeth and started to cram by myself  there were three months yet before the university entrance examinations  without laboratories without coaching sitting in my bedroom i proceeded to compress that two years work into three months and to keep reviewed on the previous years work  nineteen hours a day i studied  for three months i kept this pace only breaking it on several occasions  my body grew weary my mind grew weary but i stayed with it  my eyes grew weary and began to twitch but they did not break down  perhaps toward the last i got a bit dotty  i know that at the time i was confident i had discovered the formula for squaring the circle but i resolutely deferred the working of it out until after the examinations  then i would show them  came the several days of the examinations during which time i scarcely closed my eyes in sleep devoting every moment to cramming and reviewing and when i turned in my last examination paper i was in full possession of a splendid case of brainfag  i didnt want to see a book  i didnt want to think or to lay eyes on anybody who was liable to think  there was but one prescription for such a condition and i gave it to myselfthe adventurepath  i didnt wait to learn the result of my examinations  i stowed a roll of blankets and some cold food into a borrowed whitehall boat and set sail  out of the oakland estuary i drifted on the last of an early morning ebb caught the first of the flood up bay and raced along with a spanking breeze  san pablo bay was smoking and the carquinez straits off the selby smelter were smoking as i picked up ahead and left astern the old landmarks i had first learned with nelson in the unreefer reindeer  benicia showed before me  i opened the bight of turners shipyard rounded the solano wharf and surged along abreast of the patch of tules and the clustering fishermens arks where in the old days i had lived and drunk deep  and right here something happened to me the gravity of which i never dreamed for many a long year to come  i had had no intention of stopping at benicia  the tide favoured the wind was fair and howlingglorious sailing for a sailor  bull head and army points showed ahead marking the entrance to suisun bay which i knew was smoking  and yet when i laid eyes on those fishing arks lying in the waterfront tules without debate on the instant i put down my tiller came in on the sheet and headed for the shore  on the instant out of the profound of my brainfag i knew what i wanted  i wanted to drink  i wanted to get drunk  the call was imperative  there was no uncertainty about it  more than anything else in the world my frayed and frazzled mind wanted surcease from weariness in the way it knew surcease would come  and right here is the point  for the first time in my life i consciously deliberately desired to get drunk  it was a new a totally different manifestation of john barleycorns power  it was not a body need for alcohol  it was a mental desire  my overworked and jaded mind wanted to forget  and here the point is drawn to its sharpest  granted my prodigious brainfag nevertheless had i never drunk in the past the thought would never have entered my mind to get drunk now  beginning with physical intolerance for alcohol for years drinking only for the sake of comradeship and because alcohol was everywhere on the adventurepath i had now reached the stage where my brain cried out not merely for a drink but for a drunk  and had i not been so long used to alcohol my brain would not have so cried out  i should have sailed on past bull head and in the smoking white of suisun bay and in the wine of wind that filled my sail and poured through me i should have forgotten my weary brain and rested and refreshed it  so i sailed in to shore made all fast and hurried up among the arks charley le grant fell on my neck  his wife lizzie folded me to her capacious breast  billy murphy and joe lloyd and all the survivors of the old guard got around me and their arms around me  charley seized the can and started for jorgensens saloon across the railroad tracks that meant beer  i wanted whisky so i called after him to bring a flask  many times that flask journeyed across the railroad tracks and back more old friends of the old free and easy times dropped in fishermen greeks and russians and french  they took turns in treating and treated all around in turn again  they came and went but i stayed on and drank with all  i guzzled  i swilled  i ran the liquor down and joyed as the maggots mounted in my brain  and clam came in nelsons partner before me handsome as ever but more reckless half insane burning himself out with whisky  he had just had a quarrel with his partner on the sloop gazelle and knives had been drawn and blows struck and he was bent on maddening the fever of the memory with more whisky  and while we downed it we remembered nelson and that he had stretched out his great shoulders for the last long sleep in this very town of benicia and we wept over the memory of him and remembered only the good things of him and sent out the flask to be filled and drank again  they wanted me to stay over but through the open door i could see the brave wind on the water and my ears were filled with the roar of it and while i forgot that i had plunged into the books nineteen hours a day for three solid months charley le grant shifted my outfit into a big columbia river salmon boat  he added charcoal and a fishermans brazier a coffee pot and frying pan and the coffee and the meat and a black bass fresh from the water that day  they had to help me down the rickety wharf and into the salmon boat likewise they stretched my boom and sprit until the sail set like a board  some feared to set the sprit but i insisted and charley had no doubts  he knew me of old and knew that i could sail as long as i could see  they cast off my painter  i put the tiller up filled away before it and with dizzy eyes checked and steadied the boat on her course and waved farewell  the tide had turned and the fierce ebb running in the teeth of a fiercer wind kicked up a stiff upstanding sea  suisun bay was white with wrath and sealump  but a salmon boat can sail and i knew how to sail a salmon boat  so i drove her into it and through it and across and maundered aloud and chanted my disdain for all the books and schools cresting seas filled me a foot or so with water but i laughed at it sloshing about my feet and chanted my disdain for the wind and the water  i hailed myself a master of life riding on the back of the unleashed elements and john barleycorn rode with me  amid dissertations on mathematics and philosophy and spoutings and quotations i sang all the old songs learned in the days when i went from the cannery to the oyster boats to be a piratesuch songs as black lulu flying cloud treat my daughter kindily the boston burglar come all you rambling gambling men i wisht i was a little bird shenandoah and ranzo boys ranzo  hours afterward in the fires of sunset where the sacramento and the san joaquin tumble their muddy floods together i took the new york cutoff skimmed across the smooth landlocked water past black diamond on into the san joaquin and on to antioch where somewhat sobered and magnificently hungry i laid alongside a big potato sloop that had a familiar rig  here were old friends aboard who fried my black bass in olive oil  then too there was a meaty fishermans stew delicious with garlic and crusty italian bread without butter and all washed down with pint mugs of thick and heady claret  my salmon boat was asoak but in the snug cabin of the sloop dry blankets and a dry bunk were mine and we lay and smoked and yarned of old days while overhead the wind screamed through the rigging and taut halyards drummed against the mast     chapter xxiii   my cruise in the salmon boat lasted a week and i returned ready to enter the university  during the weeks cruise i did not drink again  to accomplish this i was compelled to avoid looking up old friends for as ever the adventurepath was beset with john barleycorn  i had wanted the drink that first day and in the days that followed i did not want it my tired brain had recuperated  i had no moral scruples in the matter i was not ashamed nor sorry because of that first days orgy at benicia and i thought no more about it returning gladly to my books and studies  long years were to pass ere i looked back upon that day and realised its significance  at the time and for a long time afterward i was to think of it only as a frolic  but still later in the slough of brainfag and intellectual weariness i was to remember and know the craving for the anodyne that resides in alcohol  in the meantime after this one relapse at benicia i went on with my abstemiousness primarily because i didnt want to drink  and next i was abstemious because my way led among books and students where no drinking was  had i been out on the adventurepath i should as a matter of course have been drinking  for that is the pity of the adventurepath which is one of john barleycorns favourite stamping grounds  i completed the first half of my freshman year and in january of 1897 took up my courses for the second half  but the pressure from lack of money plus a conviction that the university was not giving me all that i wanted in the time i could spare for it forced me to leave  i was not very disappointed  for two years i had studied and in those two years what was far more valuable i had done a prodigious amount of reading then too my grammar had improved  it is true i had not yet learned that i must say it is i but i no longer was guilty of a double negative in writing though still prone to that error in excited speech  i decided immediately to embark on my career  i had four preferences first music second poetry third the writing of philosophic economic and political essays and fourth and last and least fiction writing  i resolutely cut out music as impossible settled down in my bedroom and tackled my second third and fourth choices simultaneously heavens how i wrote  never was there a creative fever such as mine from which the patient escaped fatal results  the way i worked was enough to soften my brain and send me to a madhouse  i wrote i wrote everythingponderous essays scientific and sociological short stories humorous verse verse of all sorts from triolets and sonnets to blank verse tragedy and elephantine epics in spenserian stanzas  on occasion i composed steadily day after day for fifteen hours a day  at times i forgot to eat or refused to tear myself away from my passionate outpouring in order to eat  and then there was the matter of typewriting  my brotherinlaw owned a machine which he used in the daytime  in the night i was free to use it  that machine was a wonder  i could weep now as i recollect my wrestlings with it  it must have been a first model in the year one of the typewriter era  its alphabet was all capitals  it was informed with an evil spirit  it obeyed no known laws of physics and overthrew the hoary axiom that like things performed to like things produce like results  ill swear that machine never did the same thing in the same way twice  again and again it demonstrated that unlike actions produce like results  how my back used to ache with it prior to that experience my back had been good for every violent strain put upon it in a none too gentle career  but that typewriter proved to me that i had a pipestem for a back  also it made me doubt my shoulders  they ached as with rheumatism after every bout  the keys of that machine had to be hit so hard that to one outside the house it sounded like distant thunder or some one breaking up the furniture  i had to hit the keys so hard that i strained my first fingers to the elbows while the ends of my fingers were blisters burst and blistered again  had it been my machine id have operated it with a carpenters hammer  the worst of it was that i was actually typing my manuscripts at the same time i was trying to master that machine  it was a feat of physical endurance and a brain storm combined to type a thousand words and i was composing thousands of words every day which just had to be typed for the waiting editors  oh between the writing and the typewriting i was well aweary  i had brain and nerve fag and body fag as well and yet the thought of drink never suggested itself  i was living too high to stand in need of an anodyne  all my waking hours except those with that infernal typewriter were spent in a creative heaven  and along with this i had no desire for drink because i still believed in many thingsin the love of all men and women in the matter of man and woman love in fatherhood in human justice in artin the whole host of fond illusions that keep the world turning around  but the waiting editors elected to keep on waiting  my manuscripts made amazing roundtrip records between the pacific and the atlantic  it might have been the weirdness of the typewriting that prevented the editors from accepting at least one little offering of mine  i dont know and goodness knows the stuff i wrote was as weird as its typing  i sold my hardbought school books for ridiculous sums to secondhand bookmen  i borrowed small sums of money wherever i could and suffered my old father to feed me with the meagre returns of his failing strength  it didnt last long only a few weeks when i had to surrender and go to work  yet i was unaware of any need for the drink anodyne  i was not disappointed  my career was retarded that was all  perhaps i did need further preparation  i had learned enough from the books to realise that i had only touched the hem of knowledges garment  i still lived on the heights  my waking hours and most of the hours i should have used for sleep were spent with the books     chapter xxiv   out in the country at the belmont academy i went to work in a small perfectly appointed steam laundry  another fellow and myself did all the work from sorting and washing to ironing the white shirts collars and cuffs and the fancy starch of the wives of the professors  we worked like tigers especially as summer came on and the academy boys took to the wearing of duck trousers  it consumes a dreadful lot of time to iron one pair of duck trousers  and there were so many pairs of them  we sweated our way through long sizzling weeks at a task that was never done and many a night while the students snored in bed my partner and i toiled on under the electric light at steam mangle or ironing board  the hours were long the work was arduous despite the fact that we became past masters in the art of eliminating waste motion  and i was receiving thirty dollars a month and boarda slight increase over my coalshovelling and cannery days at least to the extent of board which cost my employer little we ate in the kitchen but which was to me the equivalent of twenty dollars a month  my robuster strength of added years my increased skill and all i had learned from the books were responsible for this increase of twenty dollars  judging by my rate of development i might hope before i died to be a night watchman for sixty dollars a month or a policeman actually receiving a hundred dollars with pickings  so relentlessly did my partner and i spring into our work throughout the week that by saturday night we were frazzled wrecks  i found myself in the old familiar workbeast condition toiling longer hours than the horses toiled thinking scarcely more frequent thoughts than horses think  the books were closed to me  i had brought a trunkful to the laundry but found myself unable to read them  i fell asleep the moment i tried to read and if i did manage to keep my eyes open for several pages i could not remember the contents of those pages  i gave over attempts on heavy study such as jurisprudence political economy and biology and tried lighter stuff such as history  i fell asleep  i tried literature and fell asleep  and finally when i fell asleep over lively novels i gave up  i never succeeded in reading one book in all the time i spent in the laundry  and when saturday night came and the weeks work was over until monday morning i knew only one desire besides the desire to sleep and that was to get drunk  this was the second time in my life that i had heard the unmistakable call of john barleycorn  the first time it had been because of brainfag  but i had no overworked brain now  on the contrary all i knew was the dull numbness of a brain that was not worked at all  that was the trouble  my brain had become so alert and eager so quickened by the wonder of the new world the books had discovered to it that it now suffered all the misery of stagnancy and inaction  and i the long time intimate of john barleycorn knew just what he promised memaggots of fancy dreams of power forgetfulness anything and everything save whirling washers revolving mangles humming centrifugal wringers and fancy starch and interminable processions of duck trousers moving in steam under my flying iron  and thats it  john barleycorn makes his appeal to weakness and failure to weariness and exhaustion  he is the easy way out  and he is lying all the time  he offers false strength to the body false elevation to the spirit making things seem what they are not and vastly fairer than what they are  but it must not be forgotten that john barleycorn is protean  as well as to weakness and exhaustion does he appeal to too much strength to superabundant vitality to the ennui of idleness  he can tuck in his arm the arm of any man in any mood  he can throw the net of his lure over all men  he exchanges new lamps for old the spangles of illusion for the drabs of reality and in the end cheats all who traffic with him  i didnt get drunk however for the simple reason that it was a mile and a half to the nearest saloon  and this in turn was because the call to get drunk was not very loud in my ears  had it been loud i would have travelled ten times the distance to win to the saloon  on the other hand had the saloon been just around the corner i should have got drunk  as it was i would sprawl out in the shade on my one day of rest and dally with the sunday papers  but i was too weary even for their froth  the comic supplement might bring a pallid smile to my face and then i would fall asleep  although i did not yield to john barleycorn while working in the laundry a certain definite result was produced  i had heard the call felt the gnaw of desire yearned for the anodyne  i was being prepared for the stronger desire of later years  and the point is that this development of desire was entirely in my brain  my body did not cry out for alcohol  as always alcohol was repulsive to my body  when i was bodily weary from shovelling coal the thought of taking a drink had never flickered into my consciousness when i was brainwearied after taking the entrance examinations to the university i promptly got drunk  at the laundry i was suffering physical exhaustion again and physical exhaustion that was not nearly so profound as that of the coalshovelling  but there was a difference when i went coalshovelling my mind had not yet awakened  between that time and the laundry my mind had found the kingdom of the mind  while shovelling coal my mind was somnolent  while toiling in the laundry my mind informed and eager to do and be was crucified  and whether i yielded to drink as at benicia or whether i refrained as at the laundry in my brain the seeds of desire for alcohol were germinating     chapter xxv   after the laundry my sister and her husband grubstaked me into the klondike  it was the first gold rush into that region the early fall rush of 1897  i was twentyone years old and in splendid physical condition  i remember at the end of the twentyeightmile portage across chilcoot from dyea beach to lake linderman i was packing up with the indians and outpacking many an indian  the last pack into linderman was three miles  i backtripped it four times a day and on each forward trip carried one hundred and fifty pounds  this means that over the worst trails i daily travelled twentyfour miles twelve of which were under a burden of one hundred and fifty pounds  yes i had let career go hang and was on the adventurepath again in quest of fortune  and of course on the adventurepath i met john barleycorn  here were the chesty men again rovers and adventurers and while they didnt mind a grub famine whisky they could not do without whisky went over the trail while the flour lay cached and untouched by the trailside  as good fortune would have it the three men in my party were not drinkers  therefore i didnt drink save on rare occasions and disgracefully when with other men  in my personal medicine chest was a quart of whisky  i never drew the cork till six months afterward in a lonely camp where without anaesthetics a doctor was compelled to operate on a man  the doctor and the patient emptied my bottle between them and then proceeded to the operation  back in california a year later recovering from scurvy i found that my father was dead and that i was the head and the sole breadwinner of a household  when i state that i had passed coal on a steamship from behring sea to british columbia and travelled in the steerage from there to san francisco it will be understood that i brought nothing back from the klondike but my scurvy  times were hard  work of any sort was difficult to get  and work of any sort was what i had to take for i was still an unskilled labourer  i had no thought of career  that was over and done with  i had to find food for two mouths beside my own and keep a roof over our headsyes and buy a winter suit my one suit being decidedly summery  i had to get some sort of work immediately  after that when i had caught my breath i might think about my future  unskilled labour is the first to feel the slackness of hard times and i had no trades save those of sailor and laundryman  with my new responsibilities i didnt dare go to sea and i failed to find a job at laundrying  i failed to find a job at anything  i had my name down in five employment bureaux  i advertised in three newspapers  i sought out the few friends i knew who might be able to get me work but they were either uninterested or unable to find anything for me  the situation was desperate  i pawned my watch my bicycle and a mackintosh of which my father had been very proud and which he had left to me  it was and is my sole legacy in this world  it had cost fifteen dollars and the pawnbroker let me have two dollars on it  andoh yesa waterfront comrade of earlier years drifted along one day with a dress suit wrapped in newspapers  he could give no adequate explanation of how he had come to possess it nor did i press for an explanation  i wanted the suit myself  no not to wear  i traded him a lot of rubbish which being unpawnable was useless to me  he peddled the rubbish for several dollars while i pledged the dresssuit with my pawnbroker for five dollars  and for all i know the pawnbroker still has the suit  i had never intended to redeem it  but i couldnt get any work  yet i was a bargain in the labour market i was twentytwo years old weighed one hundred and sixtyfive pounds stripped every pound of which was excellent for toil and the last traces of my scurvy were vanishing before a treatment of potatoes chewed raw  i tackled every opening for employment  i tried to become a studio model but there were too many finebodied young fellows out of jobs  i answered advertisements of elderly invalids in need of companions  and i almost became a sewing machine agent on commission without salary  but poor people dont buy sewing machines in hard times so i was forced to forgo that employment  of course it must be remembered that along with such frivolous occupations i was trying to get work as wop lumper and roustabout  but winter was coming on and the surplus labour army was pouring into the cities  also i who had romped along carelessly through the countries of the world and the kingdom of the mind was not a member of any union  i sought odd jobs  i worked days and halfdays at anything i could get  i mowed lawns trimmed hedges took up carpets beat them and laid them again  further i took the civil service examinations for mail carrier and passed first  but alas there was no vacancy and i must wait  and while i waited and in between the odd jobs i managed to procure i started to earn ten dollars by writing a newspaper account of a voyage i had made in an open boat down the yukon of nineteen hundred miles in nineteen days  i didnt know the first thing about the newspaper game but i was confident id get ten dollars for my article  but i didnt  the first san francisco newspaper to which i mailed it never acknowledged receipt of the manuscript but held on to it  the longer it held on to it the more certain i was that the thing was accepted  and here is the funny thing  some are born to fortune and some have fortune thrust upon them  but in my case i was clubbed into fortune and bitter necessity wielded the club  i had long since abandoned all thought of writing as a career  my honest intention in writing that article was to earn ten dollars  and that was the limit of my intention it would help to tide me along until i got steady employment  had a vacancy occurred in the post office at that time i should have jumped at it  but the vacancy did not occur nor did a steady job and i employed the time between odd jobs with writing a twentyonethousandword serial for the youths companion  i turned it out and typed it in seven days  i fancy that was what was the matter with it for it came back  it took some time for it to go and come and in the meantime i tried my hand at short stories  i sold one to the overland monthly for five dollars  the black cat gave me forty dollars for another  the overland monthly offered me seven dollars and a half pay on publication for all the stories i should deliver  i got my bicycle my watch and my fathers mackintosh out of pawn and rented a typewriter also i paid up the bills i owed to the several groceries that allowed me a small credit  i recall the portuguese groceryman who never permitted my bill to go beyond four dollars  hopkins another grocer could not be budged beyond five dollars  and just then came the call from the post office to go to work  it placed me in a most trying predicament  the sixtyfive dollars i could earn regularly every month was a terrible temptation  i couldnt decide what to do  and ill never be able to forgive the postmaster of oakland i answered the call and i talked to him like a man  i frankly told him the situation  it looked as if i might win out at writing  the chance was good but not certain  now if he would pass me by and select the next man on the eligible list and give me a call at the next vacancy  but he shut me off with then you dont want the position  but i do i protested  dont you see if you will pass me over this time  if you want it you will take it he said coldly  happily for me the cursed brutality of the man made me angry  very well i said  i wont take it     chapter xxvi   having burned my ship i plunged into writing  i am afraid i always was an extremist  early and late i was at itwriting typing studying grammar studying writing and all the forms of writing and studying the writers who succeeded in order to find out how they succeeded  i managed on five hours sleep in the twentyfour and came pretty close to working the nineteen waking hours left to me  my light burned till two and three in the morning which led a good neighbour woman into a bit of sentimental sherlockholmes deduction  never seeing me in the daytime she concluded that i was a gambler and that the light in my window was placed there by my mother to guide her erring son home  the trouble with the beginner at the writing game is the long dry spells when there is never an editors cheque and everything pawnable is pawned  i wore my summer suit pretty well through that winter and the following summer experienced the longest dryest spell of all in the period when salaried men are gone on vacation and manuscripts lie in editorial offices until vacation is over  my difficulty was that i had no one to advise me  i didnt know a soul who had written or who had ever tried to write  i didnt even know one reporter  also to succeed at the writing game i found i had to unlearn about everything the teachers and professors of literature of the high school and university had taught me  i was very indignant about this at the time though now i can understand it  they did not know the trick of successful writing in the years 1895 and 1896  they knew all about snow bound and sartor resartus but the american editors of 1899 did not want such truck  they wanted the 1899 truck and offered to pay so well for it that the teachers and professors of literature would have quit their jobs could they have supplied it  i struggled along stood off the butcher and the grocer pawned my watch and bicycle and my fathers mackintosh and i worked  i really did work and went on short commons of sleep  critics have complained about the swift education one of my characters martin eden achieved  in three years from a sailor with a common school education i made a successful writer of him  the critics say this is impossible  yet i was martin eden  at the end of three working years two of which were spent in high school and the university and one spent at writing and all three in studying immensely and intensely i was publishing stories in magazines such as the atlantic monthly was correcting proofs of my first book issued by houghton mifflin co was selling sociological articles to cosmopolitan and mcclures had declined an associate editorship proffered me by telegraph from new york city and was getting ready to marry  now the foregoing means work especially the last year of it when i was learning my trade as a writer  and in that year running short on sleep and tasking my brain to its limit i neither drank nor cared to drink so far as i was concerned alcohol did not exist  i did suffer from brainfag on occasion but alcohol never suggested itself as an ameliorative  heavens editorial acceptances and cheques were all the amelioratives i needed  a thin envelope from an editor in the mornings mail was more stimulating than half a dozen cocktails  and if a cheque of decent amount came out of the envelope such incident in itself was a whole drunk  furthermore at that time in my life i did not know what a cocktail was i remember when my first book was published several alaskans who were members of the bohemian club entertained me one evening at the club in san francisco  we sat in most wonderful leather chairs and drinks were ordered  never had i heard such an ordering of liqueurs and of highballs of particular brands of scotch  i didnt know what a liqueur or a highball was and i didnt know that scotch meant whisky  i knew only poor mens drinks the drinks of the frontier and of sailortowncheap beer and cheaper whisky that was just called whisky and nothing else  i was embarrassed to make a choice and the steward nearly collapsed when i ordered claret as an afterdinner drink     chapter xxvii   as i succeeded with my writing my standard of living rose and my horizon broadened  i confined myself to writing and typing a thousand words a day including sundays and holidays and i still studied hard but not so hard as formerly  i allowed myself five and onehalf hours of actual sleep  i added this halfhour because i was compelled  financial success permitted me more time for exercise  i rode my wheel more chiefly because it was permanently out of pawn and i boxed and fenced walked on my hands jumped high and broad put the shot and tossed the caber and went swimming  and i learned that more sleep is required for physical exercise than for mental exercise  there were tired nights bodily when i slept six hours and on occasion of very severe exercise i actually slept seven hours  but such sleep orgies were not frequent there was so much to learn so much to be done that i felt wicked when i slept seven hours  and i blessed the man who invented alarm clocks  and still no desire to drink  i possessed too many fine faiths was living at too keen a pitch  i was a socialist intent on saving the world and alcohol could not give me the fervours that were mine from my ideas and ideals  my voice on account of my successful writing had added weight or so i thought  at any rate my reputation as a writer drew me audiences that my reputation as a speaker never could have drawn i was invited before clubs and organisations of all sorts to deliver my message  i fought the good fight and went on studying and writing and was very busy  up to this time i had had a very restricted circle of friends  but now i began to go about  i was invited out especially to dinner and i made many friends and acquaintances whose economic lives were easier than mine had been  and many of them drank  in their own houses they drank and offered me drink  they were not drunkards any of them  they just drank temperately and i drank temperately with them as an act of comradeship and accepted hospitality  i did not care for it neither wanted it nor did not want it and so small was the impression made by it that i do not remember my first cocktail nor my first scotch highball  well i had a house  when one is asked into other houses he naturally asks others into his house  behold the rising standard of living having been given drink in other houses i could expect nothing else of myself than to give drink in my own house  so i laid in a supply of beer and whisky and table claret  never since that has my house not been well supplied  and still through all this period i did not care in the slightest for john barleycorn  i drank when others drank and with them as a social act  and i had so little choice in the matter that i drank whatever they drank  if they elected whisky then whisky it was for me  if they drank root beer or sarsaparilla i drank root beer or sarsaparilla with them and when there were no friends in the house why i didnt drink anything  whisky decanters were always in the room where i wrote and for months and years i never knew what it was when by myself to take a drink  when out at dinner i noticed the kindly genial glow of the preliminary cocktail  it seemed a very fitting and gracious thing  yet so little did i stand in need of it with my own high intensity and vitality that i never thought it worth while to have a cocktail before my own meal when i ate alone  on the other hand i well remember a very brilliant man somewhat older than i who occasionally visited me  he liked whisky and i recall sitting whole afternoons in my den drinking steadily with him drink for drink until he was mildly lighted up and i was slightly aware that i had drunk some whisky  now why did i do this i dont know save that the old schooling held the training of the old days and nights glass in hand with men the drinking ways of drink and drinkers  besides i no longer feared john barleycorn  mine was that most dangerous stage when a man believes himself john barleycorns master  i had proved it to my satisfaction in the long years of work and study  i could drink when i wanted refrain when i wanted drink without getting drunk and to cap everything i was thoroughly conscious that i had no liking for the stuff  during this period i drank precisely for the same reason i had drunk with scotty and the harpooner and with the oyster piratesbecause it was an act that men performed with whom i wanted to behave as a man  these brilliant ones these adventurers of the mind drank  very well  there was no reason i should not drink with themi who knew so confidently that i had nothing to fear from john barleycorn  and the foregoing was my attitude of mind for years  occasionally i got well jingled but such occasions were rare  it interfered with my work and i permitted nothing to interfere with my work  i remember when spending several months in the east end of london during which time i wrote a book and adventured much amongst the worst of the slum classes that i got drunk several times and was mightily wroth with myself because it interfered with my writing  yet these very times were because i was out on the adventurepath where john barleycorn is always to be found  then too with the certitude of long training and unholy intimacy there were occasions when i engaged in drinking bouts with men  of course this was on the adventurepath in various parts of the world and it was a matter of pride  it is a queer manpride that leads one to drink with men in order to show as strong a head as they  but this queer manpride is no theory  it is a fact  for instance a wild band of young revolutionists invited me as the guest of honour to a beer bust  it is the only technical beer bust i ever attended  i did not know the true inwardness of the affair when i accepted  i imagined that the talk would be wild and high that some of them might drink more than they ought and that i would drink discreetly but it seemed these beer busts were a diversion of these highspirited young fellows whereby they whiled away the tedium of existence by making fools of their betters  as i learned afterward they had got their previous guest of honour a brilliant young radical unskilled in drinking quite pipped  when i found myself with them and the situation dawned on me up rose my queer manpride  id show them the young rascals  id show them who was husky and chesty who had the vitality and the constitution the stomach and the head who could make most of a swine of himself and show it least  these unlicked cubs who thought they could outdrink me  you see it was an endurance test and no man likes to give another best faugh it was steam beer  i had learned more expensive brews  not for years had i drunk steam beer but when i had i had drunk with men and i guessed i could show these youngsters some ability in beerguzzling  and the drinking began and i had to drink with the best of them  some of them might lag but the guest of honour was not permitted to lag  and all my austere nights of midnight oil all the books i had read all the wisdom i had gathered went glimmering before the ape and tiger in me that crawled up from the abysm of my heredity atavistic competitive and brutal lustful with strength and desire to outswine the swine  and when the session broke up i was still on my feet and i walked erect unswayingwhich was more than can be said of some of my hosts  i recall one of them in indignant tears on the street corner weeping as he pointed out my sober condition  little he dreamed the iron clutch born of old training with which i held to my consciousness in my swimming brain kept control of my muscles and my qualms kept my voice unbroken and easy and my thoughts consecutive and logical  yes and mixed up with it all i was privily agrin  they hadnt made a fool of me in that drinking bout  and i was proud of myself for the achievement  darn it i am still proud so strangely is man compounded  but i didnt write my thousand words next morning  i was sick poisoned it was a day of wretchedness  in the afternoon i had to give a public speech  i gave it and i am confident it was as bad as i felt  some of my hosts were there in the front rows to mark any signs on me of the night before  i dont know what signs they marked but i marked signs on them and took consolation in the knowledge that they were just as sick as i  never again i swore  and i have never been inveigled into another beer bust  for that matter that was my last drinking bout of any sort  oh i have drunk ever since but with more wisdom more discretion and never in a competitive spirit  it is thus that the seasoned drinker grows seasoned  to show that at this period in my life drinking was wholly a matter of companionship i remember crossing the atlantic in the old teutonic  it chanced at the start that i chummed with an english cable operator and a younger member of a spanish shipping firm  now the only thing they drank was horses necka long soft cool drink with an apple peel or an orange peel floating in it  and for that whole voyage i drank horses necks with my two companions  on the other hand had they drunk whisky i should have drunk whisky with them  from this it must not be concluded that i was merely weak  i didnt care  i had no morality in the matter  i was strong with youth and unafraid and alcohol was an utterly negligible question so far as i was concerned     chapter xxviii   not yet was i ready to tuck my arm in john barleycorns  the older i got the greater my success the more money i earned the wider was the command of the world that became mine and the more prominently did john barleycorn bulk in my life  and still i maintained no more than a nodding acquaintance with him  i drank for the sake of sociability and when alone i did not drink  sometimes i got jingled but i considered such jingles the mild price i paid for sociability  to show how unripe i was for john barleycorn when at this time i descended into my slough of despond i never dreamed of turning to john barleycorn for a helping hand  i had life troubles and heart troubles which are neither here nor there in this narrative  but combined with them were intellectual troubles which are indeed germane  mine was no uncommon experience  i had read too much positive science and lived too much positive life  in the eagerness of youth i had made the ancient mistake of pursuing truth too relentlessly  i had torn her veils from her and the sight was too terrible for me to stand  in brief i lost my fine faiths in pretty well everything except humanity and the humanity i retained faith in was a very stark humanity indeed  this long sickness of pessimism is too well known to most of us to be detailed here  let it suffice to state that i had it very bad  i meditated suicide coolly as a greek philosopher might  my regret was that there were too many dependent directly upon me for food and shelter for me to quit living  but that was sheer morality  what really saved me was the one remaining illusionthe people  the things i had fought for and burned my midnight oil for had failed me successi despised it  recognitionit was dead ashes  society men and women above the ruck and the muck of the waterfront and the forecastlei was appalled by their unlovely mental mediocrity  love of womanit was like all the rest  moneyi could sleep in only one bed at a time and of what worth was an income of a hundred porterhouses a day when i could eat only one art culturein the face of the iron facts of biology such things were ridiculous the exponents of such things only the more ridiculous  from the foregoing it can be seen how very sick i was  i was born a fighter  the things i had fought for had proved not worth the fight remained the people  my fight was finished yet something was left still to fight forthe people  but while i was discovering this one last tie to bind me to life in my extremity in the depths of despond walking in the valley of the shadow my ears were deaf to john barleycorn  never the remotest whisper arose in my consciousness that john barleycorn was the anodyne that he could lie me along to live  one way only was uppermost in my thoughtmy revolver the crashing eternal darkness of a bullet  there was plenty of whisky in the housefor my guests  i never touched it  i grew afraid of my revolverafraid during the period in which the radiant flashing vision of the people was forming in my mind and will  so obsessed was i with the desire to die that i feared i might commit the act in my sleep and i was compelled to give my revolver away to others who were to lose it for me where my subconscious hand might not find it  but the people saved me  by the people was i handcuffed to life  there was still one fight left in me and here was the thing for which to fight  i threw all precaution to the winds threw myself with fiercer zeal into the fight for socialism laughed at the editors and publishers who warned me and who were the sources of my hundred porterhouses a day and was brutally careless of whose feelings i hurt and of how savagely i hurt them  as the wellbalanced radicals charged at the time my efforts were so strenuous so unsafe and unsane so ultrarevolutionary that i retarded the socialist development in the united states by five years  in passing i wish to remark at this late date that it is my fond belief that i accelerated the socialist development in the united states by at least five minutes  it was the people and no thanks to john barleycorn who pulled me through my long sickness  and when i was convalescent came the love of woman to complete the cure and lull my pessimism asleep for many a long day until john barleycorn again awoke it  but in the meantime i pursued truth less relentlessly refraining from tearing her last veils aside even when i clutched them in my hand  i no longer cared to look upon truth naked  i refused to permit myself to see a second time what i had once seen  and the memory of what i had that time seen i resolutely blotted from my mind  and i was very happy  life went well with me i took delight in little things  the big things i declined to take too seriously  i still read the books but not with the old eagerness  i still read the books today but never again shall i read them with that old glory of youthful passion when i harked to the call from over and beyond that whispered me on to win to the mystery at the back of life and behind the stars  the point of this chapter is that in the long sickness that at some time comes to most of us i came through without any appeal for aid to john barleycorn  love socialism the peoplehealthful figments of mans mindwere the things that cured and saved me  if ever a man was not a born alcoholic i believe that i am that man  and yetwell let the succeeding chapters tell their tale for in them will be shown how i paid for my previous quarter of a century of contact with everaccessible john barleycorn     chapter xxix   after my long sickness my drinking continued to be convivial  i drank when others drank and i was with them  but imperceptibly my need for alcohol took form and began to grow  it was not a body need  i boxed swam sailed rode horses lived in the open an arrantly healthful life and passed life insurance examinations with flying colours  in its inception now that i look back upon it this need for alcohol was a mental need a nerve need a goodspirits need  how can i explain  it was something like this  physiologically from the standpoint of palate and stomach alcohol was as it had always been repulsive  it tasted no better than beer did when i was five than bitter claret did when i was seven  when i was alone writing or studying i had no need for it  buti was growing old or wise or both or senile as an alternative  when i was in company i was less pleased less excited with the things said and done  erstwhile worthwhile fun and stunts seemed no longer worth while and it was a torment to listen to the insipidities and stupidities of women to the pompous arrogant sayings of the little halfbaked men  it is the penalty one pays for reading the books too much or for being oneself a fool  in my case it does not matter which was my trouble  the trouble itself was the fact  the condition of the fact was mine  for me the life and light and sparkle of human intercourse were dwindling  i had climbed too high among the stars or maybe i had slept too hard yet i was not hysterical nor in any way overwrought  my pulse was normal  my heart was an amazement of excellence to the insurance doctors  my lungs threw the said doctors into ecstasies  i wrote a thousand words every day  i was punctiliously exact in dealing with all the affairs of life that fell to my lot  i exercised in joy and gladness  i slept at night like a babe  but  well as soon as i got out in the company of others i was driven to melancholy and spiritual tears  i could neither laugh with nor at the solemn utterances of men i esteemed ponderous asses nor could i laugh nor engage in my oldtime lightsome persiflage with the silly superficial chatterings of women who underneath all their silliness and softness were as primitive direct and deadly in their pursuit of biological destiny as the monkeys women were before they shed their furry coats and replaced them with the furs of other animals  and i was not pessimistic  i swear i was not pessimistic  i was merely bored  i had seen the same show too often listened too often to the same songs and the same jokes  i knew too much about the box office receipts  i knew the cogs of the machinery behind the scenes so well that the posing on the stage and the laughter and the song could not drown the creaking of the wheels behind  it doesnt pay to go behind the scenes and see the angelvoiced tenor beat his wife  well id been behind and i was paying for it  or else i was a fool  it is immaterial which was my situation  the situation is what counts and the situation was that social intercourse for me was getting painful and difficult  on the other hand it must be stated that on rare occasions on very rare occasions i did meet rare souls or fools like me with whom i could spend magnificent hours among the stars or in the paradise of fools  i was married to a rare soul or a fool who never bored me and who was always a source of new and unending surprise and delight  but i could not spend all my hours solely in her company  nor would it have been fair nor wise to compel her to spend all her hours in my company  besides i had written a string of successful books and society demands some portion of the recreative hours of a fellow that writes books  and any normal man of himself and his needs demands some hours of his fellow men  and now we begin to come to it  how to face the social intercourse game with the glamour gone john barleycorn  the ever patient one had waited a quarter of a century and more for me to reach my hand out in need of him  his thousand tricks had failed thanks to my constitution and good luck but he had more tricks in his bag  a cocktail or two or several i found cheered me up for the foolishness of foolish people  a cocktail or several before dinner enabled me to laugh wholeheartedly at things which had long since ceased being laughable  the cocktail was a prod a spur a kick to my jaded mind and bored spirits  it recrudesced the laughter and the song and put a lilt into my own imagination so that i could laugh and sing and say foolish things with the liveliest of them or platitudes with verve and intensity to the satisfaction of the pompous mediocre ones who knew no other way to talk  a poor companion without a cocktail i became a very good companion with one  i achieved a false exhilaration drugged myself to merriment  and the thing began so imperceptibly that i old intimate of john barleycorn never dreamed whither it was leading me  i was beginning to call for music and wine soon i should be calling for madder music and more wine  it was at this time i became aware of waiting with expectancy for the predinner cocktail  i wanted it and i was conscious that i wanted it i remember while warcorresponding in the far east of being irresistibly attracted to a certain home  besides accepting all invitations to dinner i made a point of dropping in almost every afternoon  now the hostess was a charming woman but it was not for her sake that i was under her roof so frequently  it happened that she made by far the finest cocktail procurable in that large city where drinkmixing on the part of the foreign population was indeed an art  up at the club down at the hotels and in other private houses no such cocktails were created  her cocktails were subtle  they were masterpieces  they were the least repulsive to the palate and carried the most kick and yet i desired her cocktails only for sociabilitys sake to key myself to sociable moods  when i rode away from that city across hundreds of miles of ricefields and mountains and through months of campaigning and on with the victorious japanese into manchuria i did not drink  several bottles of whisky were always to be found on the backs of my packhorses  yet i never broached a bottle for myself never took a drink by myself and never knew a desire to take such a drink oh if a white man came into my camp i opened a bottle and we drank together according to the way of men just as he would open a bottle and drink with me if i came into his camp  i carried that whisky for social purposes and i so charged it up in my expense account to the newspaper for which i worked  only in retrospect can i mark the almost imperceptible growth of my desire  there were little hints then that i did not take little straws in the wind that i did not see little incidents the gravity of which i did not realise  for instance for some years it had been my practice each winter to cruise for six or eight weeks on san francisco bay  my stout sloop yacht the spray had a comfortable cabin and a coal stove  a korean boy did the cooking and i usually took a friend or so along to share the joys of the cruise  also i took my machine along and did my thousand words a day  on the particular trip i have in mind cloudesley and toddy came along  this was toddys first trip  on previous trips cloudesley had elected to drink beer so i had kept the yacht supplied with beer and had drunk beer with him  but on this cruise the situation was different  toddy was so nicknamed because of his diabolical cleverness in concocting toddies  so i brought whisky alonga couple of gallons  alas  many another gallon i bought for cloudesley and i got into the habit of drinking a certain hot toddy that actually tasted delicious going down and that carried the most exhilarating kick imaginable  i liked those toddies  i grew to look forward to the making of them  we drank them regularly one before breakfast one before dinner one before supper and a final one when we went to bed  we never got drunk  but i will say that four times a day we were very genial  and when in the middle of the cruise toddy was called back to san francisco on business cloudesley and i saw to it that the korean boy mixed toddies regularly for us according to formula  but that was only on the boat  back on the land in my house i took no before breakfast eyeopener no bedgoing nightcap  and i havent drunk hot toddies since and that was many a year ago  but the point is i liked those toddies  the geniality of which they were provocative was marvellous  they were eloquent proselyters for john barleycorn in their own small insidious way  they were tickles of the something destined to grow into daily and deadly desire  and i didnt know never dreamedi who had lived with john barleycorn for so many years and laughed at all his unavailing attempts to win me     chapter xxx   part of the process of recovering from my long sickness was to find delight in little things in things unconnected with books and problems in play in games of tag in the swimming pool in flying kites in fooling with horses in working out mechanical puzzles  as a result i grew tired of the city  on the ranch in the valley of the moon i found my paradise  i gave up living in cities  all the cities held for me were music the theatre and turkish baths  and all went well with me  i worked hard played hard and was very happy  i read more fiction and less fact  i did not study a tithe as much as i had studied in the past  i still took an interest in the fundamental problems of existence but it was a very cautious interest for i had burned my fingers that time i clutched at the veils of truth and wrested them from her  there was a bit of lie in this attitude of mine a bit of hypocrisy but the lie and the hypocrisy were those of a man desiring to live  i deliberately blinded myself to what i took to be the savage interpretation of biological fact  after all i was merely forswearing a bad habit forgoing a bad frame of mind  and i repeat i was very happy  and i add that in all my days measuring them with cold considerative judgment this was far and away beyond all other periods the happiest period of my life  but the time was at hand rhymeless and reasonless so far as i can see when i was to begin to pay for my score of years of dallying with john barleycorn  occasionally guests journeyed to the ranch and remained a few days  some did not drink  but to those who did drink the absence of all alcohol on the ranch was a hardship  i could not violate my sense of hospitality by compelling them to endure this hardship  i ordered in a stockfor my guests  i was never interested enough in cocktails to know how they were made so i got a barkeeper in oakland to make them in bulk and ship them to me  when i had no guests i didnt drink  but i began to notice when i finished my mornings work that i was glad if there were a guest for then i could drink a cocktail with him  now i was so clean of alcohol that even a single cocktail was provocative of pitch  a single cocktail would glow the mind and tickle a laugh for the few minutes prior to sitting down to table and starting the delightful process of eating  on the other hand such was the strength of my stomach of my alcoholic resistance that the single cocktail was only the glimmer of a glow the faintest tickle of a laugh  one day a friend frankly and shamelessly suggested a second cocktail  i drank the second one with him  the glow was appreciably longer and warmer the laughter deeper and more resonant  one does not forget such experiences sometimes i almost think that it was because i was so very happy that i started on my real drinking  i remember one day charmian and i took a long ride over the mountains on our horses  the servants had been dismissed for the day and we returned late at night to a jolly chafingdish supper  oh it was good to be alive that night while the supper was preparing the two of us alone in the kitchen  i personally was at the top of life  such things as the books and ultimate truth did not exist  my body was gloriously healthy and healthily tired from the long ride  it had been a splendid day  the night was splendid  i was with the woman who was my mate picnicking in gleeful abandon  i had no troubles  the bills were all paid and a surplus of money was rolling in on me  the future everwidened before me  and right there in the kitchen delicious things bubbled in the chafingdish our laughter bubbled and my stomach was keen with a most delicious edge of appetite  i felt so good that somehow somewhere in me arose an insatiable greed to feel better  i was so happy that i wanted to pitch my happiness even higher  and i knew the way  ten thousand contacts with john barleycorn had taught me  several times i wandered out of the kitchen to the cocktail bottle and each time i left it diminished by one mans size cocktail  the result was splendid  i wasnt jingled i wasnt lighted up but i was warmed i glowed my happiness was pyramided  munificent as life was to me i added to that munificence  it was a great hourone of my greatest  but i paid for it long afterwards as you will see one does not forget such experiences and in human stupidity cannot be brought to realise that there is no immutable law which decrees that same things shall produce same results  for they dont else would the thousandth pipe of opium be provocative of similar delights to the first else would one cocktail instead of several produce an equivalent glow after a year of cocktails  one day just before i ate midday dinner after my mornings writing was done when i had no guest i took a cocktail by myself  thereafter when there were no guests i took this daily predinner cocktail  and right there john barleycorn had me  i was beginning to drink regularly  i was beginning to drink alone  and i was beginning to drink not for hospitalitys sake not for the sake of the taste but for the effect of the drink  i wanted that daily predinner cocktail  and it never crossed my mind that there was any reason i should not have it  i paid for it  i could pay for a thousand cocktails each day if i wanted  and what was a cocktailone cocktailto me who on so many occasions for so many years had drunk inordinate quantities of stiffer stuff and been unharmed  the programme of my ranch life was as follows each morning at eightthirty having been reading or correcting proofs in bed since four or five i went to my desk  odds and ends of correspondence and notes occupied me till nine and at nine sharp invariably i began my writing by eleven sometimes a few minutes earlier or later my thousand words were finished  another halfhour at cleaning up my desk and my days work was done so that at eleventhirty i got into a hammock under the trees with my mailbag and the morning newspaper  at twelvethirty i ate dinner and in the afternoon i swam and rode  one morning at eleventhirty before i got into the hammock i took a cocktail  i repeated this on subsequent mornings of course taking another cocktail just before i ate at twelvethirty  soon i found myself seated at my desk in the midst of my thousand words looking forward to that eleventhirty cocktail  at last now i was thoroughly conscious that i desired alcohol  but what of it i wasnt afraid of john barleycorn  i had associated with him too long  i was wise in the matter of drink  i was discreet  never again would i drink to excess  i knew the dangers and the pitfalls of john barleycorn the various ways by which he had tried to kill me in the past  but all that was past long past  never again would i drink myself to stupefaction  never again would i get drunk  all i wanted and all i would take was just enough to glow and warm me to kick geniality alive in me and put laughter in my throat and stir the maggots of imagination slightly in my brain  oh i was thoroughly master of myself and of john barleycorn     chapter xxxi   but the same stimulus to the human organism will not continue to produce the same response  by and by i discovered there was no kick at all in one cocktail  one cocktail left me dead  there was no glow no laughter tickle  two or three cocktails were required to produce the original effect of one  and i wanted that effect  i drank my first cocktail at eleventhirty when i took the mornings mail into the hammock and i drank my second cocktail an hour later just before i ate  i got into the habit of crawling out of the hammock ten minutes earlier so as to find time and decency for two more cocktails ere i ate  this became schedulethree cocktails in the hour that intervened between my desk and dinner  and these are two of the deadliest drinking habits regular drinking and solitary drinking  i was always willing to drink when any one was around  i drank by myself when no one was around  then i made another step  when i had for guest a man of limited drinking calibre i took two drinks to his oneone drink with him the other drink without him and of which he did not know i stole that other drink and worse than that i began the habit of drinking alone when there was a guest a man a comrade with whom i could have drunk  but john barleycorn furnished the extenuation  it was a wrong thing to trip a guest up with excess of hospitality and get him drunk  if i persuaded him with his limited calibre into drinking up with me id surely get him drunk  what could i do but steal that every second drink or else deny myself the kick equivalent to what he got out of half the number  please remember as i recite this development of my drinking that i am no fool no weakling  as the world measures such things i am a successi dare to say a success more conspicuous than the success of the average successful man and a success that required a pretty fair amount of brains and will power  my body is a strong body  it has survived where weaklings died like flies  and yet these things which i am relating happened to my body and to me  i am a fact  my drinking is a fact  my drinking is a thing that has happened and is no theory nor speculation and as i see it it but lays the emphasis on the power of john barleycorna savagery that we still permit to exist a deadly institution that lingers from the mad old brutal days and that takes its heavy toll of youth and strength and high spirit and of very much of all of the best we breed  to return  after a boisterous afternoon in the swimming pool followed by a glorious ride on horseback over the mountains or up or down the valley of the moon i found myself so keyed and splendid that i desired to be more highly keyed to feel more splendid  i knew the way  a cocktail before supper was not the way  two or three at the very least was what was needed  i took them  why not it was living  i had always dearly loved to live  this also became part of the daily schedule  then too i was perpetually finding excuses for extra cocktails  it might be the assembling of a particularly jolly crowd a touch of anger against my architect or against a thieving stonemason working on my barn the death of my favourite horse in a barbed wire fence or news of good fortune in the morning mail from my dealings with editors and publishers  it was immaterial what the excuse might be once the desire had germinated in me  the thing was i wanted alcohol  at last after a score and more of years of dallying and of not wanting now i wanted it and my strength was my weakness  i required two three or four drinks to get an effect commensurate with the effect the average man got out of one drink  one rule i observed  i never took a drink until my days work of writing a thousand words was done  and when done the cocktails reared a wall of inhibition in my brain between the days work done and the rest of the day of fun to come  my work ceased from my consciousness  no thought of it flickered in my brain till next morning at nine oclock when i sat at my desk and began my next thousand words  this was a desirable condition of mind to achieve  i conserved my energy by means of this alcoholic inhibition  john barleycorn was not so black as he was painted  he did a fellow many a good turn and this was one of them  and i turned out work that was healthful and wholesome and sincere  it was never pessimistic  the way to life i had learned in my long sickness  i knew the illusions were right and i exalted the illusions oh i still turn out the same sort of work stuff that is clean alive optimistic and that makes toward life  and i am always assured by the critics of my superabundant and abounding vitality and of how thoroughly i am deluded by these very illusions i exploit  and while on this digression let me repeat the question i have repeated to myself ten thousand times  why did i drink  what need was there for it i was happy  was it because i was too happy i was strong  was it because i was too strong did i possess too much vitality i dont know why i drank  i cannot answer though i can voice the suspicion that ever grows in me  i had been in toofamiliar contact with john barleycorn through too many years  a lefthanded man by long practice can become a righthanded man  had i a nonalcoholic by long practice become an alcoholic  i was so happy  i had won through my long sickness to the satisfying love of woman  i earned more money with less endeavour  i glowed with health  i slept like a babe  i continued to write successful books and in sociological controversy i saw my opponents confuted with the facts of the times that daily reared new buttresses to my intellectual position from days end to days end i never knew sorrow disappointment nor regret  i was happy all the time  life was one unending song  i begrudged the very hours of blessed sleep because by that much was i robbed of the joy that would have been mine had i remained awake  and yet i drank  and john barleycorn all unguessed by me was setting the stage for a sickness all his own  the more i drank the more i was required to drink to get an equivalent effect  when i left the valley of the moon and went to the city and dined out a cocktail served at table was a wan and worthless thing there was no predinner kick in it  on my way to dinner i was compelled to accumulate the kicktwo cocktails three and if i met some fellows four or five or six it didnt matter within several  once i was in a rush  i had no time decently to accumulate the several drinks  a brilliant idea came to me  i told the barkeeper to mix me a double cocktail  thereafter whenever i was in a hurry i ordered double cocktails  it saved time  one result of this regular heavy drinking was to jade me  my mind grew so accustomed to spring and liven by artificial means that without artificial means it refused to spring and liven  alcohol became more and more imperative in order to meet people in order to become sociably fit i had to get the kick and the hit of the stuff the crawl of the maggots the genial brain glow the laughter tickle the touch of devilishness and sting the smile over the face of things ere i could join my fellows and make one with them  another result was that john barleycorn was beginning to trip me up  he was thrusting my long sickness back upon me inveigling me into again pursuing truth and snatching her veils away from her tricking me into looking reality stark in the face  but this came on gradually  my thoughts were growing harsh again though they grew harsh slowly  sometimes warning thoughts crossed my mind  where was this steady drinking leading but trust john barleycorn to silence such questions come on and have a drink and ill tell you all about it is his way and it works  for instance the following is a case in point and one which john barleycorn never wearied of reminding me  i had suffered an accident which required a ticklish operation  one morning a week after i had come off the table i lay on my hospital bed weak and weary  the sunburn of my face what little of it could be seen through a scraggly growth of beard had faded to a sickly yellow  my doctor stood at my bedside on the verge of departure  he glared disapprovingly at the cigarette i was smoking  thats what you ought to quit he lectured  it will get you in the end  look at me  i looked  he was about my own age broadshouldered deepchested eyes sparkling and ruddycheeked with health  a finer specimen of manhood one would not ask  i used to smoke he went on  cigars  but i gave even them up  and look at me  the man was arrogant and rightly arrogant with conscious wellbeing and within a month he was dead  it was no accident  half a dozen different bugs of long scientific names had attacked and destroyed him the complications were astonishing and painful and for days before he died the screams of agony of that splendid manhood could be heard for a block around  he died screaming  you see said john barleycorn  he took care of himself  he even stopped smoking cigars  and thats what he got for it  pretty rotten eh but the bugs will jump  theres no forefending them  your magnificent doctor took every precaution yet they got him  when the bug jumps you cant tell where it will land  it may be you  look what he missed  will you miss all i can give you only to have a bug jump on you and drag you down there is no equity in life  its all a lottery  but i put the lying smile on the face of life and laugh at the facts  smile with me and laugh  youll get yours in the end but in the meantime laugh  its a pretty dark world  i illuminate it for you  its a rotten world when things can happen such as happened to your doctor theres only one thing to do take another drink and forget it  and of course i took another drink for the inhibition that accompanied it  i took another drink every time john barleycorn reminded me of what had happened  yet i drank rationally intelligently  i saw to it that the quality of the stuff was of the best  i sought the kick and the inhibition and avoided the penalties of poor quality and of drunkenness it is to be remarked in passing that when a man begins to drink rationally and intelligently that he betrays a grave symptom of how far along the road he has travelled  but i continued to observe my rule of never taking my first drink of the day until the last word of my thousand words was written  on occasion however i took a days vacation from my writing  at such times since it was no violation of my rule i didnt mind how early in the day i took that first drink  and persons who have never been through the drinking game wonder how the drinking habit grows     chapter xxxii   when the snark sailed on her long cruise from san francisco there was nothing to drink on board  or rather we were all of us unaware that there was anything to drink nor did we discover it for many a month this sailing with a dry boat was malice aforethought on my part  i had played john barleycorn a trick  and it showed that i was listening ever so slightly to the faint warnings that were beginning to arise in my consciousness  of course i veiled the situation to myself and excused myself to john barleycorn  and i was very scientific about it  i said that i would drink only while in ports  during the dry seastretches my system would be cleansed of the alcohol that soaked it so that when i reached a port i should be in shape to enjoy john barleycorn more thoroughly  his bite would be sharper his kick keener and more delicious  we were twentyseven days on the traverse between san francisco and honolulu  after the first day out the thought of a drink never troubled me  this i take to show how intrinsically i am not an alcoholic sometimes during the traverse looking ahead and anticipating the delightful lanai luncheons and dinners of hawaii i had been there a couple of times before i thought naturally of the drinks that would precede those meals  i did not think of those drinks with any yearning with any irk at the length of the voyage  i merely thought they would be nice and jolly part of the atmosphere of a proper meal  thus once again i proved to my complete satisfaction that i was john barleycorns master  i could drink when i wanted refrain when i wanted therefore i would continue to drink when i wanted  some five months were spent in the various islands of the hawaiian group being ashore i drank  i even drank a bit more than i had been accustomed to drink in california prior to the voyage  the people in hawaii seemed to drink a bit more on the average than the people in more temperate latitudes  i do not intend the pun and can awkwardly revise the statement to latitudes more remote from the equator yet hawaii is only subtropical  the deeper i got into the tropics the deeper i found men drank the deeper i drank myself  from hawaii we sailed for the marquesas  the traverse occupied sixty days  for sixty days we never raised land a sail nor a steamer smoke but early in those sixty days the cook giving an overhauling to the galley made a find  down in the bottom of a deep locker he found a dozen bottles of angelica and muscatel  these had come down from the kitchen cellar of the ranch along with the homepreserved fruits and jellies  six months in the galley heat had effected some sort of a change in the thick sweet winebranded it i imagine  i took a taste  delicious and thereafter once each day at twelve oclock after our observations were worked up and the snarks position charted i drank half a tumbler of the stuff  it had a rare kick to it it warmed the cockles of my geniality and put a fairer face on the truly fair face of the sea  each morning below sweating out my thousand words i found myself looking forward to that twelve oclock event of the day  the trouble was i had to share the stuff and the length of the traverse was doubtful  i regretted that there were not more than a dozen bottles and when they were gone i even regretted that i had shared any of it  i was thirsty for the alcohol and eager to arrive in the marquesas  so it was that i reached the marquesas the possessor of a real mans size thirst  and in the marquesas were several white men a lot of sickly natives much magnificent scenery plenty of trade rum an immense quantity of absinthe but neither whisky nor gin  the trade rum scorched the skin off ones mouth  i know because i tried it  but i had ever been plastic and i accepted the absinthe  the trouble with the stuff was that i had to take such inordinate quantities in order to feel the slightest effect  from the marquesas i sailed with sufficient absinthe in ballast to last me to tahiti where i outfitted with scotch and american whisky and thereafter there were no dry stretches between ports  but please do not misunderstand  there was no drunkenness as drunkenness is ordinarily understoodno staggering and rolling around no befuddlement of the senses  the skilled and seasoned drinker with a strong constitution never descends to anything like that  he drinks to feel good to get a pleasant jingle and no more than that  the things he carefully avoids are the nausea of overdrinking the aftereffect of overdrinking the helplessness and loss of pride of overdrinking  what the skilled and seasoned drinker achieves is a discreet and canny semiintoxication  and he does it by the twelvemonth around without any apparent penalty  there are hundreds of thousands of men of this sort in the united states today in clubs hotels and in their own homesmen who are never drunk and who though most of them will indignantly deny it are rarely sober  and all of them fondly believe as i fondly believed that they are beating the game  on the seastretches i was fairly abstemious but ashore i drank more  i seemed to need more anyway in the tropics  this is a common experience for the excessive consumption of alcohol in the tropics by white men is a notorious fact  the tropics is no place for whiteskinned men  their skinpigment does not protect them against the excessive white light of the sun  the ultraviolet rays and other highvelocity and invisible rays from the upper end of the spectrum rip and tear through their tissues just as the xray ripped and tore through the tissues of so many experimenters before they learned the danger  white men in the tropics undergo radical changes of nature  they become savage merciless  they commit monstrous acts of cruelty that they would never dream of committing in their original temperate climate  they become nervous irritable and less moral  and they drink as they never drank before  drinking is one form of the many forms of degeneration that set in when white men are exposed too long to too much white light the increase of alcoholic consumption is automatic  the tropics is no place for a long sojourn  they seem doomed to die anyway and the heavy drinking expedites the process  they dont reason about it  they just do it  the sun sickness got me despite the fact that i had been in the tropics only a couple of years  i drank heavily during this time but right here i wish to forestall misunderstanding  the drinking was not the cause of the sickness nor of the abandonment of the voyage  i was strong as a bull and for many months i fought the sun sickness that was ripping and tearing my surface and nervous tissues to pieces  all through the new hebrides and the solomons and up among the atolls on the line during this period under a tropic sun rotten with malaria and suffering from a few minor afflictions such as biblical leprosy with the silvery skin i did the work of five men  to navigate a vessel through the reefs and shoals and passages and unlighted coasts of the coral seas is a mans work in itself  i was the only navigator on board  there was no one to check me up on the working out of my observations nor with whom i could advise in the ticklish darkness among uncharted reefs and shoals  and i stood all watches there was no seaman on board whom i could trust to stand a mates watch i was mate as well as captain  twentyfour hours a day were the watches i stood at sea catching catnaps when i might  third i was doctor and let me say right here that the doctors job on the snark at that time was a mans job  all on board suffered from malariathe real tropical malaria that can kill in three months  all on board suffered from perforating ulcers and from the maddening itch of ngaringari  a japanese cook went insane from his too numerous afflictions  one of my polynesian sailors lay at deaths door with blackwater fever  oh yes it was a full mans job and i dosed and doctored and pulled teeth and dragged my patients through mild little things like ptomaine poisoning  fourth i was a writer  i sweated out my thousand words a day every day except when the shock of fever smote me or a couple of nasty squalls smote the snark in the morning  fifth i was a traveller and a writer eager to see things and to gather material into my notebooks and sixth i was master and owner of the craft that was visiting strange places where visitors are rare and where visitors are made much of  so here i had to hold up the social end entertain on board be entertained ashore by planters traders governors captains of war vessels kinkyheaded cannibal kings and prime ministers sometimes fortunate enough to be clad in cotton shifts  of course i drank  i drank with my guests and hosts  also i drank by myself  doing the work of five men i thought entitled me to drink alcohol was good for a man who overworked  i noted its effect on my small crew when breaking their backs and hearts at heaving up anchor in forty fathoms they knocked off gasping and trembling at the end of half an hour and had new life put into them by stiff jolts of rum  they caught their breaths wiped their mouths and went to it again with a will  and when we careened the snark and had to work in the water to our necks between shocks of fever i noted how raw trade rum helped the work along  and here again we come to another side of manysided john barleycorn  on the face of it he gives something for nothing  where no strength remains he finds new strength  the wearied one rises to greater effort for the time being there is an actual accession of strength  i remember passing coal on an ocean steamer through eight days of hell during which time we coalpassers were kept to the job by being fed with whisky  we toiled half drunk all the time  and without the whisky we could not have passed the coal  this strength john barleycorn gives is not fictitious strength  it is real strength  but it is manufactured out of the sources of strength and it must ultimately be paid for and with interest  but what weary human will look so far ahead he takes this apparently miraculous accession of strength at its face value  and many an overworked business and professional man as well as a harried common labourer has travelled john barleycorns death road because of this mistake     chapter xxxiii   i went to australia to go into hospital and get tinkered up after which i planned to go on with the voyage  and during the long weeks i lay in hospital from the first day i never missed alcohol  i never thought about it  i knew i should have it again when i was on my feet  but when i regained my feet i was not cured of my major afflictions  naamans silvery skin was still mine  the mysterious sunsickness which the experts of australia could not fathom still ripped and tore my tissues malaria still festered in me and put me on my back in shivering delirium at the most unexpected moments compelling me to cancel a double lecture tour which had been arranged  so i abandoned the snark voyage and sought a cooler climate  the day i came out of hospital i took up drinking again as a matter of course  i drank wine at meals  i drank cocktails before meals  i drank scotch highballs when anybody i chanced to be with was drinking them  i was so thoroughly the master of john barleycorn i could take up with him or let go of him whenever i pleased just as i had done all my life  after a time for cooler climate i went down to southermost tasmania in fortythree south  and i found myself in a place where there was nothing to drink  it didnt mean anything  i didnt drink  it was no hardship i soaked in the cool air rode horseback and did my thousand words a day save when the fever shock came in the morning  and for fear that the idea may still lurk in some minds that my preceding years of drinking were the cause of my disabilities i here point out that my japanese cabin boy nakata still with me was rotten with fever as was charmian who in addition was in the slough of a tropical neurasthenia that required several years of temperate climates to cure and that neither she nor nakata drank or ever had drunk  when i returned to hobart town where drink was obtainable i drank as of old  the same when i arrived back in australia  on the contrary when i sailed from australia on a tramp steamer commanded by an abstemious captain i took no drink along and had no drink for the fortythree days passage  arrived in ecuador squarely under the equatorial sun where the humans were dying of yellow fever smallpox and the plague i promptly drank againevery drink of every sort that had a kick in it  i caught none of these diseases  neither did charmian nor nakata who did not drink  enamoured of the tropics despite the damage done me i stopped in various places and was a long while getting back to the splendid temperate climate of california  i did my thousand words a day travelling or stopping over suffered my last faint fever shock saw my silvery skin vanish and my suntorn tissues healthily knit again and drank as a broadshouldered chesty man may drink     chapter xxxiv   back on the ranch in the valley of the moon i resumed my steady drinking  my programme was no drink in the morning first drinktime came with the completion of my thousand words  then between that and the midday meal were drinks numerous enough to develop a pleasant jingle  again in the hour preceding the evening meal i developed another pleasant jingle  nobody ever saw me drunk for the simple reason that i never was drunk  but i did get a jingle twice each day and the amount of alcohol i consumed every day if loosed in the system of one unaccustomed to drink would have put such a one on his back and out  it was the old proposition  the more i drank the more i was compelled to drink in order to get an effect  the time came when cocktails were inadequate  i had neither the time in which to drink them nor the space to accommodate them  whisky had a more powerful jolt  it gave quicker action with less quantity  bourbon or rye or cunningly aged blends constituted the premidday drinking  in the late afternoon it was scotch and soda  my sleep always excellent now became not quite so excellent  i had been accustomed to read myself back asleep when i chanced to awake  but now this began to fail me  when i had read two or three of the small hours away and was as wide awake as ever i found that a drink furnished the soporific effect  sometimes two or three drinks were required  so short a period of sleep then intervened before early morning rising that my system did not have time to work off the alcohol  as a result i awoke with mouth parched and dry with a slight heaviness of head and with a mild nervous palpitation in the stomach  in fact i did not feel good  i was suffering from the morning sickness of the steady heavy drinker  what i needed was a pickmeup a bracer  trust john barleycorn once he has broken down a mans defences so it was a drink before breakfast to put me right for breakfastthe old poison of the snake that has bitten one another custom begun at this time was that of the pitcher of water by the bedside to furnish relief to my scorched and sizzling membranes  i achieved a condition in which my body was never free from alcohol  nor did i permit myself to be away from alcohol  if i travelled to outoftheway places i declined to run the risk of finding them dry  i took a quart or several quarts along in my grip  in the past i had been amazed by other men guilty of this practice  now i did it myself unblushingly  and when i got out with the fellows i cast all rules by the board  i drank when they drank what they drank and in the same way they drank  i was carrying a beautiful alcoholic conflagration around with me  the thing fed on its own heat and flamed the fiercer  there was no time in all my waking time that i didnt want a drink  i began to anticipate the completion of my daily thousand words by taking a drink when only five hundred words were written  it was not long until i prefaced the beginning of the thousand words with a drink  the gravity of this i realised too well  i made new rules  resolutely i would refrain from drinking until my work was done  but a new and most diabolical complication arose  the work refused to be done without drinking  it just couldnt be done  i had to drink in order to do it i was beginning to fight now  i had the craving at last and it was mastering me  i would sit at my desk and dally with pad and pen but words refused to flow  my brain could not think the proper thoughts because continually it was obsessed with the one thought that across the room in the liquor cabinet stood john barleycorn  when in despair i took my drink at once my brain loosened up and began to roll off the thousand words  in my town house in oakland i finished the stock of liquor and wilfully refused to purchase more  it was no use because unfortunately there remained in the bottom of the liquor cabinet a case of beer  in vain i tried to write  now beer is a poor substitute for strong waters besides i didnt like beer yet all i could think of was that beer so singularly accessible in the bottom of the cabinet  not until i had drunk a pint of it did the words begin to reel off and the thousand were reeled off to the tune of numerous pints  the worst of it was that the beer caused me severe heartburn but despite the discomfort i soon finished off the case  the liquor cabinet was now bare  i did not replenish it  by truly heroic perseverance i finally forced myself to write the daily thousand words without the spur of john barleycorn  but all the time i wrote i was keenly aware of the craving for a drink  and as soon as the mornings work was done i was out of the house and away downtown to get my first drink  merciful goodnessif john barleycorn could get such sway over me a nonalcoholic what must be the sufferings of the true alcoholic battling against the organic demands of his chemistry while those closest to him sympathise little understand less and despise and deride him     chapter xxxv   but the freight has to be paid  john barleycorn began to collect and he collected not so much from the body as from the mind  the old long sickness which had been purely an intellectual sickness recrudesced the old ghosts long laid lifted their heads again  but they were different and more deadly ghosts  the old ghosts intellectual in their inception had been laid by a sane and normal logic  but now they were raised by the white logic of john barleycorn and john barleycorn never lays the ghosts of his raising  for this sickness of pessimism caused by drink one must drink further in quest of the anodyne that john barleycorn promises but never delivers  how to describe this white logic to those who have never experienced it it is perhaps better first to state how impossible such a description is take hasheesh land for instance the land of enormous extensions of time and space  in past years i have made two memorable journeys into that far land  my adventures there are seared in sharpest detail on my brain yet i have tried vainly with endless words to describe any tiny particular phase to persons who have not travelled there  i use all the hyperbole of metaphor and tell what centuries of time and profounds of unthinkable agony and horror can obtain in each interval of all the intervals between the notes of a quick jig played quickly on the piano  i talk for an hour elaborating that one phase of hasheesh land and at the end i have told them nothing  and when i cannot tell them this one thing of all the vastness of terrible and wonderful things i know i have failed to give them the slightest concept of hasheesh land  but let me talk with some other traveller in that weird region and at once am i understood  a phrase a word conveys instantly to his mind what hours of words and phrases could not convey to the mind of the nontraveller  so it is with john barleycorns realm where the white logic reigns  to those untravelled there the travellers account must always seem unintelligible and fantastic  at the best i may only beg of the untravelled ones to strive to take on faith the narrative i shall relate  for there are fatal intuitions of truth that reside in alcohol  philip sober vouches for philip drunk in this matter  there seem to be various orders of truth in this world  some sorts of truth are truer than others  some sorts of truth are lies and these sorts are the very ones that have the greatest usevalue to life that desires to realise and live  at once o untravelled reader you see how lunatic and blasphemous is the realm i am trying to describe to you in the language of john barleycorns tribe  it is not the language of your tribe all of whose members resolutely shun the roads that lead to death and tread only the roads that lead to life  for there are roads and roads and of truth there are orders and orders  but have patience  at least through what seems no more than verbal yammerings you may perchance glimpse faint far vistas of other lands and tribes  alcohol tells truth but its truth is not normal  what is normal is healthful  what is healthful tends toward life  normal truth is a different order and a lesser order of truth  take a dray horse through all the vicissitudes of its life from first to last somehow in unguessably dim ways it must believe that life is good that the drudgery in harness is good that death no matter how blindinstinctively apprehended is a dread giant that life is beneficent and worth while that in the end with fading life it will not be knocked about and beaten and urged beyond its sprained and spavined best that old age even is decent dignified and valuable though old age means a ribby scarecrow in a hawkers cart stumbling a step to every blow stumbling dizzily on through merciless servitude and slow disintegration to the endthe end the apportionment of its parts of its subtle flesh its pink and springy bone its juices and ferments and all the sensateness that informed it to the chicken farm the hidehouse the gluerendering works and the bonemeal fertiliser factory  to the last stumble of its stumbling end this dray horse must abide by the mandates of the lesser truth that is the truth of life and that makes life possible to persist  this dray horse like all other horses like all other animals including man is lifeblinded and sensestruck  it will live no matter what the price  the game of life is good though all of life may be hurt and though all lives lose the game in the end  this is the order of truth that obtains not for the universe but for the live things in it if they for a little space will endure ere they pass  this order of truth no matter how erroneous it may be is the sane and normal order of truth the rational order of truth that life must believe in order to live  to man alone among the animals has been given the awful privilege of reason  man with his brain can penetrate the intoxicating show of things and look upon the universe brazen with indifference toward him and his dreams  he can do this but it is not well for him to do it  to live and live abundantly to sting with life to be alive which is to be what he is it is good that man be lifeblinded and sensestruck what is good is true  and this is the order of truth lesser though it be that man must know and guide his actions by with unswerving certitude that it is absolute truth and that in the universe no other order of truth can obtain  it is good that man should accept at face value the cheats of sense and snares of flesh and through the fogs of sentiency pursue the lures and lies of passion  it is good that he shall see neither shadows nor futilities nor be appalled by his lusts and rapacities  and man does this  countless men have glimpsed that other and truer order of truth and recoiled from it  countless men have passed through the long sickness and lived to tell of it and deliberately to forget it to the end of their days  they lived  they realised life for life is what they were  they did right  and now comes john barleycorn with the curse he lays upon the imaginative man who is lusty with life and desire to live  john barleycorn sends his white logic the argent messenger of truth beyond truth the antithesis of life cruel and bleak as interstellar space pulseless and frozen as absolute zero dazzling with the frost of irrefragable logic and unforgettable fact  john barleycorn will not let the dreamer dream the liver live  he destroys birth and death and dissipates to mist the paradox of being until his victim cries out as in the city of dreadful night our lifes a cheat our death a black abyss and the feet of the victim of such dreadful intimacy take hold of the way of death     chapter xxxvi   back to personal experiences and the effects in the past of john barleycorns white logic on me  on my lovely ranch in the valley of the moon brainsoaked with many months of alcohol i am oppressed by the cosmic sadness that has always been the heritage of man  in vain do i ask myself why i should be sad  my nights are warm  my roof does not leak  i have food galore for all the caprices of appetite  every creature comfort is mine  in my body are no aches nor pains  the good old fleshmachine is running smoothly on  neither brain nor muscle is overworked  i have land money power recognition from the world a consciousness that i do my meed of good in serving others a mate whom i love children that are of my own fond flesh  i have done and am doing what a good citizen of the world should do  i have built houses many houses and tilled many a hundred acres  and as for trees have i not planted a hundred thousand everywhere from any window of my house i can gaze forth upon these trees of my planting standing valiantly erect and aspiring toward the sun  my life has indeed fallen in pleasant places  not a hundred men in a million have been so lucky as i  yet with all this vast good fortune am i sad  and i am sad because john barleycorn is with me  and john barleycorn is with me because i was born in what future ages will call the dark ages before the ages of rational civilisation  john barleycorn is with me because in all the unwitting days of my youth john barleycorn was accessible calling to me and inviting me on every corner and on every street between the corners  the pseudocivilisation into which i was born permitted everywhere licensed shops for the sale of soulpoison the system of life was so organised that i and millions like me was lured and drawn and driven to the poison shops  wander with me through one mood of the myriad moods of sadness into which one is plunged by john barleycorn  i ride out over my beautiful ranch between my legs is a beautiful horse  the air is wine  the grapes on a score of rolling hills are red with autumn flame  across sonoma mountain wisps of sea fog are stealing  the afternoon sun smoulders in the drowsy sky  i have everything to make me glad i am alive  i am filled with dreams and mysteries  i am all sun and air and sparkle  i am vitalised organic  i move i have the power of movement i command movement of the live thing i bestride  i am possessed with the pomps of being and know proud passions and inspirations  i have ten thousand august connotations  i am a king in the kingdom of sense and trample the face of the uncomplaining dust  and yet with jaundiced eye i gaze upon all the beauty and wonder about me and with jaundiced brain consider the pitiful figure i cut in this world that endured so long without me and that will again endure without me  i remember the men who broke their hearts and their backs over this stubborn soil that now belongs to me  as if anything imperishable could belong to the perishable  these men passed  i too shall pass  these men toiled and cleared and planted gazed with aching eyes while they rested their labourstiffened bodies on these same sunrises and sunsets at the autumn glory of the grape and at the fogwisps stealing across the mountain  and they are gone  and i know that i too shall some day and soon be gone  gone i am going now  in my jaw are cunning artifices of the dentists which replace the parts of me already gone  never again will i have the thumbs of my youth  old fights and wrestlings have injured them irreparably  that punch on the head of a man whose very name is forgotten settled this thumb finally and for ever  a slipgrip at catchascatchcan did for the other  my lean runners stomach has passed into the limbo of memory  the joints of the legs that bear me up are not so adequate as they once were when in wild nights and days of toil and frolic i strained and snapped and ruptured them  never again can i swing dizzily aloft and trust all the proud quick that is i to a single ropeclutch in the driving blackness of storm  never again can i run with the sleddogs along the endless miles of arctic trail  i am aware that within this disintegrating body which has been dying since i was born i carry a skeleton that under the rind of flesh which is called my face is a bony noseless deaths head  all of which does not shudder me  to be afraid is to be healthy  fear of death makes for life  but the curse of the white logic is that it does not make one afraid  the worldsickness of the white logic makes one grin jocosely into the face of the noseless one and to sneer at all the phantasmagoria of living  i look about me as i ride and on every hand i see the merciless and infinite waste of natural selection  the white logic insists upon opening the longclosed books and by paragraph and chapter states the beauty and wonder i behold in terms of futility and dust  about me is murmur and hum and i know it for the gnatswarm of the living piping for a little space its thin plaint of troubled air  i return across the ranch  twilight is on and the hunting animals are out  i watch the piteous tragic play of life feeding on life  here is no morality  only in man is morality and man created ita code of action that makes toward living and that is of the lesser order of truth yet all this i knew before in the weary days of my long sickness  these were the greater truths that i so successfully schooled myself to forget the truths that were so serious that i refused to take them seriously and played with gently oh so gently as sleeping dogs at the back of consciousness which i did not care to waken  i did but stir them and let them lie  i was too wise too wicked wise to wake them  but now white logic willynilly wakes them for me for white logic most valiant is unafraid of all the monsters of the earthly dream  let the doctors of all the schools condemn me white logic whispers as i ride along  what of it i am truth  you know it  you cannot combat me  they say i make for death  what of it it is truth  life lies in order to live  life is a perpetual lietelling process  life is a mad dance in the domain of flux wherein appearances in mighty tides ebb and flow chained to the wheels of moons beyond our ken  appearances are ghosts  life is ghost land where appearances change transfuse permeate each the other and all the others that are that are not that always flicker fade and pass only to come again as new appearances as other appearances  you are such an appearance composed of countless appearances out of the past  all an appearance can know is mirage  you know mirages of desire  these very mirages are the unthinkable and incalculable congeries of appearances that crowd in upon you and form you out of the past and that sweep you on into dissemination into other unthinkable and incalculable congeries of appearances to people the ghost land of the future  life is apparitional and passes  you are an apparition  through all the apparitions that preceded you and that compose the parts of you you rose gibbering from the evolutionary mire and gibbering you will pass on interfusing permeating the procession of apparitions that will succeed you  and of course it is all unanswerable and as i ride along through the evening shadows i sneer at that great fetish which comte called the world  and i remember what another pessimist of sentiency has uttered transient are all  they being born must die and being dead are glad to be at rest  but here through the dusk comes one who is not glad to be at rest  he is a workman on the ranch an old man an immigrant italian  he takes his hat off to me in all servility because forsooth i am to him a lord of life  i am food to him and shelter and existence  he has toiled like a beast all his days and lived less comfortably than my horses in their deepstrawed stalls  he is labourcrippled  he shambles as he walks one shoulder is twisted higher than the other  his hands are gnarled claws repulsive horrible  as an apparition he is a pretty miserable specimen  his brain is as stupid as his body is ugly  his brain is so stupid that he does not know he is an apparition the white logic chuckles to me  he is sensedrunk  he is the slave of the dream of life  his brain is filled with superrational sanctions and obsessions  he believes in a transcendent overworld  he has listened to the vagaries of the prophets who have given to him the sumptuous bubble of paradise  he feels inarticulate selfaffinities with selfconjured nonrealities  he sees penumbral visions of himself titubating fantastically through days and nights of space and stars beyond the shadow of any doubt he is convinced that the universe was made for him and that it is his destiny to live for ever in the immaterial and supersensuous realms he and his kind have builded of the stuff of semblance and deception  but you who have opened the books and who share my awful confidenceyou know him for what he is brother to you and the dust a cosmic joke a sport of chemistry a garmented beast that arose out of the ruck of screaming beastliness by virtue and accident of two opposable great toes  he is brother as well to the gorilla and the chimpanzee  he thumps his chest in anger and roars and quivers with cataleptic ferocity  he knows monstrous atavistic promptings and he is composed of all manner of shreds of abysmal and forgotten instincts  yet he dreams he is immortal i argue feebly  it is vastly wonderful for so stupid a clod to bestride the shoulders of time and ride the eternities  pah is the retort  would you then shut the books and exchange places with this thing that is only an appetite and a desire a marionette of the belly and the loins  to be stupid is to be happy i contend  then your ideal of happiness is a jellylike organism floating in a tideless tepid twilight sea eh  oh the victim cannot combat john barleycorn  one step removed from the annihilating bliss of buddhas nirvana the white logic adds  oh well heres the house  cheer up and take a drink  we know we illuminated you and i all the folly and the farce  and in my bookwalled den the mausoleum of the thoughts of men i take my drink and other drinks and roust out the sleeping dogs from the recesses of my brain and hallo them on over the walls of prejudice and law and through all the cunning labyrinths of superstition and belief  drink says the white logic  the greeks believed that the gods gave them wine so that they might forget the miserableness of existence  and remember what heine said  well do i remember that flaming jews with the last breath all is done joy love sorrow macaroni the theatre limetrees raspberry drops the power of human relations gossip the barking of dogs champagne  your clear white light is sickness i tell the white logic  you lie  by telling too strong a truth he quips back  alas yes so topsyturvy is existence i acknowledge sadly  ah well liu ling was wiser than you the white logic girds  you remember him  i nod my headliu ling a hard drinker one of the group of bibulous poets who called themselves the seven sages of the bamboo grove and who lived in china many an ancient century ago  it was liu ling prompts the white logic who declared that to a drunken man the affairs of this world appear but as so much duckweed on a river  very well  have another scotch and let semblance and deception become duckweed on a river  and while i pour and sip my scotch i remember another chinese philosopher chuang tzu who four centuries before christ challenged this dreamland of the world saying how then do i know but that the dead repent of having previously clung to life  those who dream of the banquet wake to lamentation and sorrow  those who dream of lamentation and sorrow wake to join the hunt  while they dream they do not know that they dream  some will even interpret the very dream they are dreaming and only when they awake do they know it was a dream  fools think they are awake now and flatter themselves they know if they are really princes or peasants  confucius and you are both dreams and i who say you are dreamsi am but a dream myself  once upon a time i chuang tzu dreamt i was a butterfly fluttering hither and thither to all intents and purposes a butterfly  i was conscious only of following my fancies as a butterfly and was unconscious of my individuality as a man  suddenly i awaked and there i lay myself again  now i do not know whether i was then a man dreaming i was a butterfly or whether i am now a butterfly dreaming i am a man     chapter xxxvii   come says the white logic and forget these asian dreamers of old time  fill your glass and let us look at the parchments of the dreamers of yesterday who dreamed their dreams on your own warm hills  i pore over the abstract of title of the vineyard called tokay on the rancho called petaluma  it is a sad long list of the names of men beginning with manuel micheltoreno one time mexican governor commanderinchief and inspector of the department of the californias who deeded ten square leagues of stolen indian land to colonel don mariano guadalupe vallejo for services rendered his country and for moneys paid by him for ten years to his soldiers  immediately this musty record of mans land lust assumes the formidableness of a battlethe quick struggling with the dust  there are deeds of trust mortgages certificates of release transfers judgments foreclosures writs of attachment orders of sale tax liens petitions for letters of administration and decrees of distribution  it is like a monster ever unsubdued this stubborn land that drowses in this indian summer weather and that survives them all the men who scratched its surface and passed  who was this james king of william so curiously named the oldest surviving settler in the valley of the moon knows him not  yet only sixty years ago he loaned mariano g vallejo eighteen thousand dollars on security of certain lands including the vineyard yet to be and to be called tokay  whence came peter oconnor and whither vanished after writing his little name of a day on the woodland that was to become a vineyard appears louis csomortanyi a name to conjure with  he lasts through several pages of this record of the enduring soil  comes old american stock thirsting across the great american desert mulebacking across the isthmus windjamming around the horn to write brief and forgotten names where ten thousand generations of wild indians are equally forgottennames like halleck hastings swett tait denman tracy grimwood carlton temple  there are no names like those today in the valley of the moon  the names begin to appear fast and furiously flashing from legal page to legal page and in a flash vanishing  but ever the persistent soil remains for others to scrawl themselves across  come the names of men of whom i have vaguely heard but whom i have never known  kohler and frohlingwho built the great stone winery on the vineyard called tokay but who built upon a hill up which other vineyardists refused to haul their grapes  so kohler and frohling lost the land the earthquake of 1906 threw down the winery and i now live in its ruins  la mottehe broke the soil planted vines and orchards instituted commercial fish culture built a mansion renowned in its day was defeated by the soil and passed  and my name of a day appears  on the site of his orchards and vineyards of his proud mansion of his very fish ponds i have scrawled myself with half a hundred thousand eucalyptus trees  cooper and greenlawon what is called the hill ranch they left two of their dead little lillie and little david who rest today inside a tiny square of handhewn palings  also cooper and greenlaw in their time cleared the virgin forest from three fields of forty acres  today i have those three fields sown with canada peas and in the spring they shall be ploughed under for green manure  haskaa dim legendary figure of a generation ago who went back up the mountain and cleared six acres of brush in the tiny valley that took his name  he broke the soil reared stone walls and a house and planted apple trees  and already the site of the house is undiscoverable the location of the stone walls may be deduced from the configuration of the landscape and i am renewing the battle putting in angora goats to browse away the brush that has overrun haskas clearing and choked haskas apple trees to death  so i too scratch the land with my brief endeavour and flash my name across a page of legal script ere i pass and the page grows musty  dreamers and ghosts the white logic chuckles  but surely the striving was not altogether vain i contend  it was based on illusion and is a lie  a vital lie i retort  and pray what is a vital lie but a lie the white logic challenges come  fill your glass and let us examine these vital liars who crowd your bookshelves  let us dabble in william james a bit  a man of health i say  from him we may expect no philosophers stone but at least we will find a few robust tonic things to which to tie  rationality gelded to sentiment the white logic grins  at the end of all his thinking he still clung to the sentiment of immortality  facts transmuted in the alembic of hope into terms of faith  the ripest fruit of reason the stultification of reason  from the topmost peak of reason james teaches to cease reasoning and to have faith that all is well and will be wellthe old oh ancient old acrobatic flip of the metaphysicians whereby they reasoned reason quite away in order to escape the pessimism consequent upon the grim and honest exercise of reason  is this flesh of yours you or is it an extraneous something possessed by you your bodywhat is it a machine for converting stimuli into reactions  stimuli and reactions are remembered  they constitute experience  then you are in your consciousness these experiences  you are at any moment what you are thinking at that moment  your i is both subject and object it predicates things of itself and is the things predicated  the thinker is the thought the knower is what is known the possessor is the things possessed  after all as you know well man is a flux of states of consciousness a flow of passing thoughts each thought of self another self a myriad thoughts a myriad selves a continual becoming but never being a willofthewisp flitting of ghosts in ghostland  but this man will not accept of himself  he refuses to accept his own passing  he will not pass  he will live again if he has to die to do it  he shuffles atoms and jets of light remotest nebulae drips of water prickpoints of sensation slimeoozings and cosmic bulks all mixed with pearls of faith love of woman imagined dignities frightened surmises and pompous arrogances and of the stuff builds himself an immortality to startle the heavens and baffle the immensities  he squirms on his dunghill and like a child lost in the dark among goblins calls to the gods that he is their younger brother a prisoner of the quick that is destined to be as free as theymonuments of egotism reared by the epiphenomena dreams and the dust of dreams that vanish when the dreamer vanishes and are no more when he is not  it is nothing new these vital lies men tell themselves muttering and mumbling them like charms and incantations against the powers of night the voodoos and medicine men and the devildevil doctors were the fathers of metaphysics  night and the noseless one were ogres that beset the way of light and life  and the metaphysicians would win by if they had to tell lies to do it  they were vexed by the brazen law of the ecclesiast that men die like the beasts of the field and their end is the same their creeds were their schemes their religions their nostrums their philosophies their devices by which they halfbelieved they would outwit the noseless one and the night  boglights vapours of mysticism psychic overtones soul orgies wailings among the shadows weird gnosticisms veils and tissues of words gibbering subjectivisms gropings and maunderings ontological fantasies panpsychic hallucinationsthis is the stuff the phantasms of hope that fills your bookshelves  look at them all the sad wraiths of sad mad men and passionate rebelsyour schopenhauers your strindbergs your tolstois and nietzsches  come  your glass is empty  fill and forget  i obey for my brain is now well acrawl with the maggots of alcohol and as i drink to the sad thinkers on my shelves i quote richard hovey     abstain not life and love like night and day     offer themselves to us on their own terms     not ours  accept their bounty while ye may     before we be accepted by the worms   i will cap you cries the white logic  no i answer while the maggots madden me  i know you for what you are and i am unafraid  under your mask of hedonism you are yourself the noseless one and your way leads to the night  hedonism has no meaning it too is a lie at best the cowards smug compromise  now will i cap you the white logic breaks in     but if you would not this poor life fulfil     lo you are free to end it when you will     without the fear of waking after death   and i laugh my defiance for now and for the moment i know the white logic to be the archimpostor of them all whispering his whispers of death  and he is guilty of his own unmasking with his own genial chemistry turning the tables on himself with his own maggots biting alive the old illusions resurrecting and making to sound again the old voice from beyond of my youth telling me again that still are mine the possibilities and powers which life and the books had taught me did not exist  and the dinner gong sounds to the reversed bottom of my glass  jeering at the white logic i go out to join my guests at table and with assumed seriousness to discuss the current magazines and the silly doings of the worlds day whipping every trick and ruse of controversy through all the paces of paradox and persiflage  and when the whim changes it is most easy and delightfully disconcerting to play with the respectable and cowardly bourgeois fetishes and to laugh and epigram at the flitting godghosts and the debaucheries and follies of wisdom  the clowns the thing the clown if one must be a philosopher let him be aristophanes  and no one at the table thinks i am jingled  i am in fine fettle that is all  i tire of the labour of thinking and when the table is finished start practical jokes and set all playing at games which we carry on with bucolic boisterousness  and when the evening is over and goodnight said i go back through my bookwalled den to my sleeping porch and to myself and to the white logic which undefeated has never left me  and as i fall to fuddled sleep i hear youth crying as harry kemp heard it     i heard youth calling in the night     gone is my former worlddelight     for there is naught my feet may stay     the morn suffuses into day     it dare not stand a moment still     but must the world with light fulfil     more evanescent than the rose     my sudden rainbow comes and goes     plunging bright ends across the sky     yea i am youth because i die     chapter xxxviii   the foregoing is a sample roaming with the white logic through the dusk of my soul  to the best of my power i have striven to give the reader a glimpse of a mans secret dwelling when it is shared with john barleycorn  and the reader must remember that this mood which he has read in a quarter of an hour is but one mood of the myriad moods of john barleycorn and that the procession of such moods may well last the clock around through many a day and week and month  my alcoholic reminiscences draw to a close  i can say as any strong chesty drinker can say that all that leaves me alive today on the planet is my unmerited luckthe luck of chest and shoulders and constitution  i dare to say that a not large percentage of youths in the formative stage of fifteen to seventeen could have survived the stress of heavy drinking that i survived between my fifteenth and seventeenth years that a not large percentage of men could have punished the alcohol i have punished in my manhood years and lived to tell the tale  i survived through no personal virtue but because i did not have the chemistry of a dipsomaniac and because i possessed an organism unusually resistant to the ravages of john barleycorn  and surviving i have watched the others die not so lucky down all the long sad road  it was my unmitigated and absolute good fortune good luck chance call it what you will that brought me through the fires of john barleycorn my life my career my joy in living have not been destroyed  they have been scorched it is true like the survivors of forlorn hopes they have by unthinkably miraculous ways come through the fight to marvel at the tally of the slain  and like such a survivor of old red war who cries out let there be no more war so i cry out let there be no more poisonfighting by our youths  the way to stop war is to stop it  the way to stop drinking is to stop it  the way china stopped the general use of opium was by stopping the cultivation and importation of opium  the philosophers priests and doctors of china could have preached themselves breathless against opium for a thousand years and the use of opium so long as opium was ever accessible and obtainable would have continued unabated we are so made that is all  we have with great success made a practice of not leaving arsenic and strychnine and typhoid and tuberculosis germs lying around for our children to be destroyed by  treat john barleycorn the same way  stop him  dont let him lie around licensed and legal to pounce upon our youth  not of alcoholics nor for alcoholics do i write but for our youths for those who possess no more than the adventurestings and the genial predispositions the social manimpulses which are twisted all awry by our barbarian civilisation which feeds them poison on all the corners  it is the healthy normal boys now born or being born for whom i write  it was for this reason more than any other and more ardently than any other that i rode down into the valley of the moon all ajingle and voted for equal suffrage  i voted that women might vote because i knew that they the wives and mothers of the race would vote john barleycorn out of existence and back into the historical limbo of our vanished customs of savagery  if i thus seem to cry out as one hurt please remember that i have been sorely bruised and that i do dislike the thought that any son or daughter of mine or yours should be similarly bruised  the women are the true conservators of the race  the men are the wastrels the adventurelovers and gamblers and in the end it is by their women that they are saved  about mans first experiment in chemistry was the making of alcohol and down all the generations to this day man has continued to manufacture and drink it  and there has never been a day when the women have not resented mans use of alcohol though they have never had the power to give weight to their resentment  the moment women get the vote in any community the first thing they proceed to do is to close the saloons  in a thousand generations to come men of themselves will not close the saloons  as well expect the morphine victims to legislate the sale of morphine out of existence  the women know  they have paid an incalculable price of sweat and tears for mans use of alcohol  ever jealous for the race they will legislate for the babes of boys yet to be born and for the babes of girls too for they must be the mothers wives and sisters of these boys  and it will be easy  the only ones that will be hurt will be the topers and seasoned drinkers of a single generation  i am one of these and i make solemn assurance based upon long traffic with john barleycorn that it wont hurt me very much to stop drinking when no one else drinks and when no drink is obtainable  on the other hand the overwhelming proportion of young men are so normally nonalcoholic that never having had access to alcohol they will never miss it  they will know of the saloon only in the pages of history and they will think of the saloon as a quaint old custom similar to bullbaiting and the burning of witches     chapter xxxix   of course no personal tale is complete without bringing the narrative of the person down to the last moment  but mine is no tale of a reformed drunkard  i was never a drunkard and i have not reformed  it chanced some time ago that i made a voyage of one hundred and fortyeight days in a windjammer around the horn  i took no private supply of alcohol along and though there was no day of those one hundred and fortyeight days that i could not have got a drink from the captain i did not take a drink  i did not take a drink because i did not desire a drink  no one else drank on board  the atmosphere for drinking was not present and in my system there was no organic need for alcohol  my chemistry did not demand alcohol  so there arose before me a problem a clear and simple problem this is so easy why not keep it up when you get back on land  i weighed this problem carefully  i weighed it for five months in a state of absolute noncontact with alcohol  and out of the data of past experience i reached certain conclusions  in the first place i am convinced that not one man in ten thousand or in a hundred thousand is a genuine chemical dipsomaniac  drinking as i deem it is practically entirely a habit of mind  it is unlike tobacco or cocaine or morphine or all the rest of the long list of drugs  the desire for alcohol is quite peculiarly mental in its origin  it is a matter of mental training and growth and it is cultivated in social soil  not one drinker in a million began drinking alone  all drinkers begin socially and this drinking is accompanied by a thousand social connotations such as i have described out of my own experience in the first part of this narrative  these social connotations are the stuff of which the drink habit is largely composed  the part that alcohol itself plays is inconsiderable when compared with the part played by the social atmosphere in which it is drunk  the human is rarely born these days who without long training in the social associations of drinking feels the irresistible chemical propulsion of his system toward alcohol  i do assume that such rare individuals are born but i have never encountered one  on this long fivemonths voyage i found that among all my bodily needs not the slightest shred of a bodily need for alcohol existed  but this i did find my need was mental and social  when i thought of alcohol the connotation was fellowship  when i thought of fellowship the connotation was alcohol  fellowship and alcohol were siamese twins they always occurred linked together  thus when reading in my deck chair or when talking with others practically any mention of any part of the world i knew instantly aroused the connotation of drinking and good fellows  big nights and days and moments all purple passages and freedoms thronged my memory  venice stares at me from the printed page and i remember the cafe tables on the sidewalks  the battle of santiago some one says and i answer yes ive been over the ground but i do not see the ground nor kettle hill nor the peace tree  what i see is the cafe venus on the plaza of santiago where one hot night i drank and talked with a dying consumptive  the east end of london i read or some one says and first of all under my eyelids leap the visions of the shining pubs and in my ears echo the calls for two of bitter and three of scotch the latin quarterat once i am in the student cabarets bright faces and keen spirits around me sipping cool welldripped absinthe while our voices mount and soar in latin fashion as we settle god and art and democracy and the rest of the simple problems of existence  in a pampero off the river plate we speculate if we are disabled of running in to buenos ayres the paris of america and i have visions of bright congregating places of men of the jollity of raised glasses and of song and cheer and the hum of genial voices  when we have picked up the northeast trades in the pacific we try to persuade our dying captain to run for honolulu and while i persuade i see myself again drinking cocktails on the cool lanais and fizzes out at waikiki where the surf rolls in  some one mentions the way wild ducks are cooked in the restaurants of san francisco and at once i am transported to the light and clatter of many tables where i gaze at old friends across the golden brims of longstemmed rhinewine glasses  and so i pondered my problem  i should not care to revisit all these fair places of the world except in the fashion i visited them before glass in hand  there is a magic in the phrase  it means more than all the words in the dictionary can be made to mean  it is a habit of mind to which i have been trained all my life  it is now part of the stuff that composes me  i like the bubbling play of wit the chesty laughs the resonant voices of men when glass in hand they shut the grey world outside and prod their brains with the fun and folly of an accelerated pulse  no i decided i shall take my drink on occasion  with all the books on my shelves with all the thoughts of the thinkers shaded by my particular temperament i decided coolly and deliberately that i should continue to do what i had been trained to want to do  i would drinkbut oh more skilfully more discreetly than ever before  never again would i be a peripatetic conflagration  never again would i invoke the white logic i had learned how not to invoke him  the white logic now lies decently buried alongside the long sickness neither will afflict me again  it is many a year since i laid the long sickness away his sleep is sound  and just as sound is the sleep of the white logic  and yet in conclusion i can well say that i wish my forefathers had banished john barleycorn before my time  i regret that john barleycorn flourished everywhere in the system of society in which i was born else i should not have made his acquaintance and i was long trained in his acquaintance
