of critics likewise i really dont want to convince anybody it is quite in opposition to my whole nature i dont intend my books for the generality of readers i count it a mistake of our mistaken democracy that every man who can read print is allowed to believe that he can read all that is printed i count it a misfortune that serious books are exposed in the public market like slaves exposed naked for sale but there we are since we live in an age of mistaken democracy we must go through with it  i warn the generality of readers that this present book will seem to them only a rather more revolting mass of wordy nonsense than the last i would warn the generality of critics to throw it in the waste paper basket without more ado  as for the limited few in whom one must perforce find an answerer i may as well say straight off that i stick to the solar plexus that statement alone i hope will thin their numbers considerably  finally to the remnants of a remainder in order to apologize for the sudden lurch into cosmology or cosmogony in this book i wish to say that the whole thing hangs inevitably together i am not a scientist i am an amateur of amateurs as one of my critics said you either believe or you dont  i am not a proper arch√¶ologist nor an anthropologist nor an ethnologist i am no scholar of any sort but i am very grateful to scholars for their sound work i have found hints suggestions for what i say here in all kinds of scholarly books from the yoga and plato and st john the evangel and the early greek philosophers like herakleitos down to fraser and his golden bough and even freud and frobenius even then i only remember hintsand i proceed by intuition this leaves you quite free to dismiss the whole wordy mass of revolting nonsense without a qualm  only let me say that to my mind there is a great field of science which is as yet quite closed to us i refer to the science which proceeds in terms of life and is established on data of living experience and of sure intuition call it subjective science if you like our objective science of modern knowledge concerns itself only with phenomena and with phenomena as regarded in their causeandeffect relationship i have nothing to say against our science it is perfect as far as it goes but to regard it as exhausting the whole scope of human possibility in knowledge seems to me just puerile our science is a science of the dead world even biology never considers life but only mechanistic functioning and apparatus of life  i honestly think that the great pagan world of which egypt and greece were the last living terms the great pagan world which preceded our own era once had a vast and perhaps perfect science of its own a science in terms of life in our era this science crumbled into magic and charlatanry but even wisdom crumbles  i believe that this great science previous to ours and quite different in constitution and nature from our science once was universal established all over the thenexisting globe i believe it was esoteric invested in a large priesthood just as mathematics and mechanics and physics are defined and expounded in the same way in the universities of china or bolivia or london or moscow today so it seems to me in the great world previous to ours a great science and cosmology were taught esoterically in all countries of the globe asia polynesia america atlantis and europe belts suggestion of the geographical nature of this previous world seems to me most interesting in the period which geologists call the glacial period the waters of the earth must have been gathered up in a vast body on the higher places of our globe vast worlds of ice and the seabeds of today must have been comparatively dry so that the azores rose up mountainous from the plain of atlantis where the atlantic now washes and the easter isles and the marquesas and the rest rose lofty from the marvelous great continent of the pacific  in that world men lived and taught and knew and were in one complete correspondence over all the earth men wandered back and forth from atlantis to the polynesian continent as men now sail from europe to america the interchange was complete and knowledge science was universal over the earth cosmopolitan as it is today  then came the melting of the glaciers and the world flood the refugees from the drowned continents fled to the high places of america europe asia and the pacific isles and some degenerated naturally into cave men neolithic and paleolithic creatures and some retained their marvelous innate beauty and lifeperfection as the south sea islanders and some wandered savage in africa and some like druids or etruscans or chaldeans or amerindians or chinese refused to forget but taught the old wisdom only in its halfforgotten symbolic forms more or less forgotten as knowledge remembered as ritual gesture and mythstory  and so the intense potency of symbols is part at least memory and so it is that all the great symbols and myths which dominate the world when our history first begins are very much the same in every country and every people the great myths all relate to one another and so it is that these myths now begin to hypnotize us again our own impulse towards our own scientific way of understanding being almost spent and so besides myths we find the same mathematic figures cosmic graphs which remain among the aboriginal peoples in all continents mystic figures and signs whose true cosmic or scientific significance is lost yet which continue in use for purposes of conjuring or divining  if my reader finds this bosh and abracadabra all right for him only i have no more regard for his little crowings on his own little dunghill myself i am not so sure that i am one of the oneandonlies i like the wide world of centuries and vast agesmammoth worlds beyond our day and mankind so wonderful in his distances his history that has no beginning yet always the pomp and the magnificence of human splendor unfolding through the earths changing periods floods and fire and convulsions and icearrest intervene between the great glamorous civilizations of mankind but nothing will ever quench humanity and the human potentiality to evolve something magnificent out of a renewed chaos  i do not believe in evolution but in the strangeness and rainbowchange of everrenewed creative civilizations  so much then for my claim to remarkable discoveries i believe i am only trying to stammer out the first terms of a forgotten knowledge but i have no desire to revive dead kings or dead sages it is not for me to arrange fossils and decipher hieroglyphic phrases i couldnt do it if i wanted to but then i can do something else the soul must take the hint from the relics our scientists have so marvelously gathered out of the forgotten past and from the hint develop a new living utterance the spark is from dead wisdom but the fire is life  and as an examplea very simple oneof how a scientist of the most innocent modern sort may hint at truths which when stated he would laugh at as fantastic nonsense let us quote a word from the already oldfashioned golden bough it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak  exactly the fire which resided in the tree of life that is life itself so we must read it must have appeared to the ancient aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from lifewhich is what the early greek philosophers were always saying and which still seems to me the real truth the clue to the cosmos instead of life being drawn from the sun it is the emanation from life itself that is from all the living plants and creatures which nourish the sun  of course my dear critic the ancient aryans were just dodderingthe old duffers or babbling the babes but as for me i have some respect for my ancestors and believe they had more up their sleeve than just the marvel of the unborn me  one last weary little word this pseudophilosophy of minepollyanalytics as one of my respected critics might sayis deduced from the novels and poems not the reverse the novels and poems come unwatched out of ones pen and then the absolute need which one has for some sort of satisfactory mental attitude towards oneself and things in general makes one try to abstract some definite conclusions from ones experiences as a writer and as a man the novels and poems are pure passionate experience these pollyanalytics are inferences made afterwards from the experience  and finally it seems to me that even art is utterly dependent on philosophy or if you prefer it on a metaphysic the metaphysic or philosophy may not be anywhere very accurately stated and may be quite unconscious in the artist yet it is a metaphysic that governs men at the time and is by all men more or less comprehended and lived men live and see according to some gradually developing and gradually withering vision this vision exists also as a dynamic idea or metaphysicexists first as such then it is unfolded into life and art our vision our belief our metaphysic is wearing woefully thin and the art is wearing absolutely threadbare we have no future neither for our hopes nor our aims nor our art it has all gone gray and opaque  weve got to rip the old veil of a vision across and find what the heart really believes in after all and what the heart really wants for the next future and weve got to put it down in terms of belief and of knowledge and then go forward again to the fulfillment in life and art  rip the veil of the old vision across and walk through the rent and if i try to do thiswell why not if i try to write down what i seewhy not if a publisher likes to print the bookall right and if anybody wants to read it let him but why anybody should read one single word if he doesnt want to i dont see unless of course he is a critic who needs to scribble a dollars worth of words no matter how  taormina  october 8 1921     fantasia of the unconscious  chapter i  introduction   let us start by making a little apology to psychoanalysis it wasnt fair to jeer at the psychoanalytic unconscious or perhaps it was fair to jeer at the psychoanalytic unconscious which is truly a negative quantity and an unpleasant menagerie what was really not fair was to jeer at psychoanalysis as if freud had invented and described nothing but an unconscious in all his theory  the unconscious is not of course the clue to the freudian theory the real clue is sex a sexual motive is to be attributed to all human activity  now this is going too far we are bound to admit than an element of sex enters into all human activity but so does an element of greed and of many other things we are bound to admit that into all human relationships particularly adult human relationships a large element of sex enters we are thankful that freud has insisted on this we are thankful that freud pulled us somewhat to earth out of all our clouds of superfineness what freud says is always partly true and half a loaf is better than no bread  but really there is the other half of the loaf all is not sex and a sexual motive is not to be attributed to all human activities we know it without need to argue  sex surely has a specific meaning sex means the being divided into male and female and the magnetic desire or impulse which puts male apart from female in a negative or sundering magnetism but which also draws male and female together in a long and infinitely varied approach towards the critical act of coition sex without the consummating act of coition is never quite sex in human relationships just as a eunuch is never quite a man that is to say the act of coition is the essential clue to sex  now does all life work up to the one consummating act of coition in one direction it does and it would be better if psychoanalysis plainly said so in one direction all life works up to the one supreme moment of coition let us all admit it sincerely  but we are not confined to one direction only or to one exclusive consummation was the building of the cathedrals a working up towards the act of coition was the dynamic impulse sexual no the sexual element was present and important but not predominant the same in the building of the panama canal the sexual impulse in its widest form was a very great impulse towards the building of the panama canal but there was something else of even higher importance and greater dynamic power  and what is this other greater impulse it is the desire of the human male to build a world not to build a world for you dear but to build up out of his own self and his own belief and his own effort something wonderful not merely something useful something wonderful even the panama canal would never have been built simply to let ships through it is the pure disinterested craving of the human male to make something wonderful out of his own head and his own self and his own souls faith and delight which starts everything going this is the prime motivity and the motivity of sex is subsidiary to this often directly antagonistic  that is the essentially religious or creative motive is the first motive for all human activity the sexual motive comes second and there is a great conflict between the interests of the two at all times  what we want to do is to trace the creative or religious motive to its source in the human being keeping in mind always the near relationship between the religious motive and the sexual the two great impulses are like man and wife or father and son it is no use putting one under the feet of the other  the great desire today is to deny the religious impulse altogether or else to assert its absolute alienity from the sexual impulse the orthodox religious world says faugh to sex whereupon we thank freud for giving them tit for tat but the orthodox scientific world says fie to the religious impulse the scientist wants to discover a cause for everything and there is no cause for the religious impulse freud is with the scientists jung dodges from his university gown into a priests surplice till we dont know where we are we prefer freuds sex to jungs libido or bergsons elan vital sex has at least some definite reference though when freud makes sex accountable for everything he as good as makes it accountable for nothing  we refuse any cause whether it be sex or libido or elan vital or ether or unit of force or perpetuum mobile or anything else but also we feel that we cannot like moses perish on the top of our present ideal pisgah or take the next step into thin air there we are at the top of our pisgah of ideals crying excelsior and trying to clamber up into the clouds that is if we are idealists with the religious impulse rampant in our breasts if we are scientists we practice aeroplane flying or eugenics or disarmament or something equally absurd  the promised land if it be anywhere lies away beneath our feet no more prancing upwards no more uplift no more little excelsiors crying worldbrotherhood and international love and leagues of nations idealism and materialism amount to the same thing on top of pisgah and the space is very crowded were all cornered on our mountain top climbing up one another and standing on one anothers faces in our scream of excelsior  to your tents o israel brethren let us go down we will descend the way to our precious canaan lies obviously downhill an end of uplift downhill to the land of milk and honey the blood will soon be flowing faster than either but we cant help that we cant help it if canaan has blood in its veins instead of pure milk and honey  if it is a question of origins the origin is always the same whatever we say about it so is the cause let that be a comfort to us if we want to talk about god well we can please ourselves god has been talked about quite a lot and he doesnt seem to mind why we should take it so personally is a problem likewise if we wish to have a tea party with the atom let us or with the wriggling little unit of energy or the ether or the libido or the elan vital or any other cause only dont let us have sex for tea weve all got too much of it under the table and really for my part i prefer to keep mine there no matter what the freudians say about me  but it is tiring to go to any more tea parties with the origin or the cause or even the lord let us pronounce the mystic om from the pit of the stomach and proceed  theres not a shadow of doubt about it the first cause is just unknowable to us and wed be sorry if it wasnt whether its god or the atom all i say is om  the first business of every faith is to declare its ignorance i dont know where i come fromnor where i exit to i dont know the origins of life nor the goal of death i dont know how the two parent cells which are my biological origin became the me which i am i dont in the least know what those two parent cells were the chemical analysis is just a farce and my father and mother were just vehicles and yet i must say since ive got to know about the two cells im glad i do know  the moses of science and the aaron of idealism have got the whole bunch of us here on top of pisgah its a tight squeeze and well be falling very very foul of one another in five minutes unless some of us climb down but before leaving our eminence let us have a look round and get our bearings  they say that way lies the new jerusalem of universal love and over there the happy valley of indulgent pragmatism and there quite near is the chirpy land of the vitalists and in those dark groves the home of successful analysis surnamed psycho and over those blue hills the supermen are prancing about though you cant see them and there is besantheim and there is eddyhowe and there on that queer little tableland is wilsonia and just round the corner is rabindranathopolis  but lord i cant see anything help me heaven to a telescope for i see blank nothing  im not going to try any more im going to sit down on my posterior and sluther full speed down this pisgah even if it cost me my trouser seat so hoaway we go  in the beginningthere never was any beginning but let it pass weve got to make a start somehow in the very beginning of all things time and space and cosmos and being in the beginning of all these was a little living creature but i dont know even if it was little in the beginning was a living creature its plasm quivering and its lifepulse throbbing this little creature died as little creatures always do but not before it had had young ones when the daddy creature died it fell to pieces and that was the beginning of the cosmos its little body fell down to a speck of dust which the young ones clung to because they must cling to something its little breath flew asunder the hotness and brightness of the little beasti beg your pardon i mean the radiant energy from the corpse flew away to the right hand and seemed to shine warm in the air while the clammy energy from the body flew away to the left hand and seemed dark and cold and so the first little master was dead and done for and instead of his little living body there was a speck of dust in the middle which became the earth and on the right hand was a brightness which became the sun rampaging with all the energy that had come out of the dead little master and on the left hand a darkness which felt like an unrisen moon and that was how the lord created the world except that i know nothing about the lord so i shouldnt mention it  but i forgot the soul of the little master it probably did a bit of flying as welland then came back to the young ones it seems most natural that way  which is my account of the creation and i mean by it that life is not and never was anything but living creatures thats what life is and will be just living creatures no matter how large you make the capital l out of living creatures the material cosmos was made out of the death of living creatures when their little living bodies fell dead and fell asunder into all sorts of matter and forces and energies sun moons stars and worlds so you got the universe where you got the living creature from that first one dont ask me he was just there but he was a little person with a soul of his own he wasnt life with a capital l  if you dont believe me then dont ill even give you a little song to sing      if it be not true to me     what care i how true it be    thats the kind of man i really like chirping his insouciance and i chirp back      though it be not true to thee     its gay and gospel truth to me    the living live and then die they pass away as we know to dust and to oxygen and nitrogen and so on but what we dont know and what we might perhaps know a little more is how they pass away direct into life itselfthat is direct into the living that is how many dead souls fly over our untidiness like swallows and build under the eaves of the living how many dead souls like swallows twitter and breed thoughts and instincts under the thatch of my hair and the eaves of my forehead i dont know but i believe a good many and i hope they have a good time and i hope not too many are bats  i am sorry to say i believe in the souls of the dead i am almost ashamed to say that i believe the souls of the dead in some way re√´nter and pervade the souls of the living so that life is always the life of living creatures and death is always our affair this bit i admit is bordering on mysticism im sorry because i dont like mysticism it has no trousers and no trousers seat na pas de quoi and i should feel so uncomfortable if i put my hand behind me and felt an absolute blank  meanwhile a long thin brown caterpillar keeps on pretending to be a dead thin beechtwig on a little bough at my feet he had got his hind feet and his fore feet on the twig and his body looped up like an arch in the air between when a fly walked up the twig and began to mount the arch of the imitator not having the least idea that it was on a gentlemans coattails the caterpillar shook his stern and the fly made off as if it had seen a ghost the dead twig and the live twig now remain equally motionless enjoying their different ways and when with this very pencil i push the head of the caterpillar off from the twig he remains on his tail arched forward in air and oscillating unhappily like some tiny pendulum ticking ticking ticking in midair arched away from his planted tail till at last after a long minute and a half he touches the twig again and subsides into twigginess the only thing is the dead beechtwig cant pretend to be a wagging caterpillar yet how the two commune howeverwe have our exits and our entrances and one man in his time plays many parts more than he dreams of poor darling and i am entirely at a loss for a moral  well then we are born i suppose thats a safe statement and we become at once conscious if we werent so before nem con and our little baby body is a little functioning organism a little developing machine or instrument or organ and our little baby mind begins to stir with all our wonderful psychical beginnings and so we are in bud  but it wont do it is too much of a pisgah sight we overlook too much descendez cher mo√Øse vous voyez trop loin you see too far all at once dear moses too much of a birdseye view across the promised land to the shore come down and walk across old fellow and you wont see all that milk and honey and grapes the size of ducks eggs all the dear little budding infant with its tender virginal mind and various clouds of glory instead of a napkin not at all my dear chap no such luck of a promised land  climb down pisgah and go to jericho allons there is no road yet but we are all aarons with rods of our own     chapter ii  the holy family   we are all very pleased with mr einstein for knocking that eternal axis out of the universe the universe isnt a spinning wheel it is a cloud of bees flying and veering round thank goodness for that for we were getting drunk on the spinning wheel  so that now the universe has escaped from the pin which was pushed through it like an impaled fly vainly buzzing now that the multiple universe flies its own complicated course quite free and hasnt got any hub we can hope also to escape  we wont be pinned down either we have no one law that governs us for me there is only one law i am i and that isnt a law its just a remark one is one but one is not all alone there are other stars buzzing in the center of their own isolation and there is no straight path between them there is no straight path between you and me dear reader so dont blame me if my words fly like dust into your eyes and grit between your teeth instead of like music into your ears i am i but also you are you and we are in sad need of a theory of human relativity we need it much more than the universe does the stars know how to prowl round one another without much damage done but you and i dear reader in the first conviction that you are me and that i am you owing to the oneness of mankind why we are always falling foul of one another and chewing each others fur  you are not me dear reader so make no pretentions to it dont get alarmed if i say things it isnt your sacred mouth which is opening and shutting as for the profanation of your sacred ears just apply a little theory of relativity and realize that what i say is not what you hear but something uttered in the midst of my isolation and arriving strangely changed and travelworn down the long curve of your own individual circumambient atmosphere i may say bob but heaven alone knows what the goose hears and you may be sure that a red rag is to a bull something far more mysterious and complicated than a socialists necktie  so i hope now i have put you in your place dear reader sit you like watts hope on your own little blue globe and ill sit on mine and we wont bump into one another if we can help it you can twang your old hopeful lyre it may be music to you so i dont blame you it is a terrible wowing in my ears but that may be something in my individual atmosphere some strange deflection as your music crosses the space between us certainly i never hear the concert of world regeneration and hope revived again without getting a sort of lockjaw my teeth go so keen on edge from the twanging harmony still the worldregenerators may really be quite excellent performers on their own jewsharps blame the edginess of my teeth  now i am going to launch words into space so mind your cosmic eye  as i said in my small but naturally immortal book psychoanalysis and the unconscious theres more in it than meets the eye theres more in you dear reader than meets the eye what dont you believe it do you think youre as obvious as a poached egg on a piece of toast like the poor lunatic not a bit of it dear reader youve got a solar plexus and a lumbar ganglion not far from your liver and im going to tell everybody nothing brings a man home to himself like telling everybody and i will drive you home to yourself do you hear youve been poaching in my private atmospheric grounds long enough identifying yourself with me and me with everybody a nice row thered be in heaven if aldebaran caught sirius by the tail and said look here youre not to look so green you damm dogstar its an offense against starregulations  which reminds me that the arabs say the shooting stars meteorites are starry stones which the angels fling at the poaching demons whom they catch sight of prowling too near the palisades of heaven i must say i like arab angels my heaven would coruscate like a catherine wheel with whitehot starstones away you dog you prowling curgot him under the left earhole gabriel see him see him michael that hopeful blue devil land him one biff on your bottom you hoper  but i wish the arabs wouldnt entice me or you dear reader provoke me to this i feel with you dear reader as i do with a deafman when he pushes his vulcanite ear his listening machine towards my mouth i want to shout down the telephone earhole all kinds of improper things to see what effect they will have on the stupid dear face at the end of the coil of wire after all words must be very different after theyve trickled round and round a long wire coil whatever becomes of them and i who am a bit deaf myself and may in the end have a deafmachine to poke at my friends it ill becomes me to be so unkind yet thats how i feel so there we are  help me to be serious dear reader  in that little book psychoanalysis and the unconscious i tried rather wistfully to convince you dear reader that you had a solar plexus and a lumbar ganglion and a few other things i dont know why i took the trouble if a fellow doesnt believe hes got a nose the best way to convince him is gently to waft a little pepper into his nostrils and there was i painting my own nose purple and wistfully inviting you to look and believe no more though  youve got first and foremost a solar plexus dear reader and the solar plexus is a great nerve center which lies behind your stomach i cant be accused of impropriety or untruth because any book of science or medicine which deals with the nervesystem of the human body will show it to you quite plainly so dont wriggle or try to look spiritual because willynilly youve got a solar plexus dear reader among other things im writing a good sound science book which theres no gainsaying  now your solar plexus most gentle of readers is where you are you it is your first and greatest and deepest center of consciousness if you want to know how conscious and when conscious i must refer you to that little book psychoanalysis and the unconscious  at your solar plexus you are primarily conscious there behind you stomach there you have the profound and pristine conscious awareness that you are you dont say you havent i know you have you might as well try to deny the nose on your face there is your first and deepest seat of awareness there you are triumphantly aware of your own individual existence in the universe absolutely there is the keep and central stronghold of your triumphantlyconscious self there you are and you know it so stick out your tummy gaily my dear with a me voil√† with a here i am with an ecco mi with a da bin ich there you are dearie  but not only a triumphant awareness that there you are an exultant awareness also that outside this quiet gate this navel lies a whole universe on which you can lay tribute ahaat birth you closed the central gate for ever too dangerous to leave it open too near the quick but there are other gates there are eyes and mouths and ears and nostrils besides the two lower gates of the passionate body and the closed but not locked gates of the breasts many gates and besides the actual gates the marvelous wireless communication between the great center and the surrounding or contiguous world  authorized science tells you that this first great plexus this allpotent nervecenter of consciousness and dynamic lifeactivity is a sympathetic center from the solar plexus as from your castlekeep you look around and see the fair lands smiling the corn and fruit and cattle of your increase the cottages of your dependents and the halls of your beloveds from the solar plexus you know that all the world is yours and all is goodly  this is the great center where in the womb your life first sparkled in individuality this is the center that drew the gestating maternal bloodstream upon you in the ninemonths lurking drew it on you for your increase this is the center whence the navelstring broke but where the invisible string of dynamic consciousness like a dark electric current connecting you with the rest of life will never break until you die and depart from corporate individuality  they say by the way that doctors now perform a little operation on the born baby so that no more navel shows no more bellybuttons dear reader lucky i caught you this generation before the doctors had saved your appearances yet caro mio whether it shows or not there you once had immediate connection with the maternal bloodstream and because the male nucleus which derived from the father still lies sparkling and potent within the solar plexus therefore that great nervecenter of you still has immediate knowledge of your father a subtler but still vital connection we call it the tie of blood so be it it is a tie of blood but much more definite than we imagine for true it is that the one bright male germ which went to your begetting was drawn from the blood of the father and true it is that that same bright male germ lies unquenched and unquenchable at the center of you within the famous solar plexus and furthermore true is it that this unquenched fatherspark within you sends forth vibrations and dark currents of vital activity all the time connecting direct with your father you will never be able to get away from it while you live  the connection with the mother may be more obvious is there not your ostensible navel where the rupture between you and her took place but because the motherchild relation is more plausible and flagrant is that any reason for supposing it deeper more vital more intrinsic not a bit because if the large parent mothergerm still lives and acts vividly and mysteriously in the great fused nucleus of your solar plexus does the smaller brilliant malespark that derived from your father act any less vividly by no means it is differentit is less ostensible it may be even in magnitude smaller but it may be even more vivid even more intrinsic so beware how you deny the fatherquick of yourself you may be denying the most intrinsic quick of all  in the same way it follows that since brothers and sisters have the same father and mother therefore in every brother and sister there is a direct communication such as can never happen between strangers the parent nuclei do not die within the new nucleus they remain there marvelous naked sparkling dynamic lifecenters nodes wellheads of vivid life itself therefore in every individual the parent nuclei live and give direction connection blood connection we call it with the rest of the family it is blood connection for the fecundating nuclei are the very sparkessence of the blood and while life lives the parent nuclei maintain their own centrality and dynamic effectiveness within the solar plexus of the child so that every individual has mother and father both sparkling within himself  but this is rather a preliminary truth than an intrinsic truth the intrinsic truth of every individual is the new unit of unique individuality which emanates from the fusion of the parent nuclei this is the incalculable and intangible holy ghost each timeeach individual his own holy ghost when at the moment of conception the two parent nuclei fuse to form a new unit of life then takes place the great mystery of creation a new individual appearsnot the result of the fusion merely something more the quality of individuality cannot be derived the new individual in his singleness of self is a perfectly new whole he is not a permutation and combination of old elements transferred through the parents no he is something underived and utterly unprecedented unique a new soul  this quality of pure individuality is however only the one supreme quality it consummates all other qualities but does not consume them all the others are there all the time and only at his maximum does an individual surpass all his derivative elements and become purely himself and most people never get there in his own pure individuality a man surpasses his father and mother and is utterly unknown to them woman what have i to do with thee but this does not alter the fact that within him lives the motherquick and the fatherquick and that though in his wholeness he is rapt away beyond the old motherfather connections they are still there within him consummated but not consumed nor does it alter the fact that very few people surpass their parents nowadays and attain any individuality beyond them most men are halfborn slaves the little soul they are born with just atrophies and merely the organism emanates the new self the new soul the new swells into manhood like big potatoes  so there we are but considering man at his best he is at the start faced with the great problem at the very start he has to undertake his tripartite being the mother within him the father within him and the holy ghost the self which he is supposed to consummate and which mostly he doesnt  and there it is a hard physiological fact at the moment of our conception the father nucleus fuses with the mother nucleus and the wonder emanates the new self the new soul the new individual cell but in the new individual cell the fathergerm and the mothergerm do not relinquish their identity there they remain still incorporated and never extinguished and so the bloodstream of race is one stream for ever but the moment the mystery of pure individual newness ceased to be enacted and fulfilled the bloodstream would dry up and be finished mankind would die out  let us go back then to the solar plexus there sparkle the included mothergerm and fathergerm giving us direct immediate bloodbonds family connection the connection is as direct and as subtle as between the marconi stations two great wireless stations a family if you like is a group of wireless stations all adjusted to the same or very much the same vibration all the time they quiver with the interchange there is one long endless flow of vitalistic communication between members of one family a long strange rapport a sort of lifeunison it is a ripple of life through many bodies as through one body but all the time there is the jolt the rupture of individualism the individual asserting himself beyond all ties or claims the highest goal for every man is the goal of pure individual being but it is a goal you cannot reach by the mere rupture of all ties a child isnt born by being torn from the womb when it is born by natural process that is rupture enough but even then the ties are not broken they are only subtilized  from the solar plexus first of all pass the great vitalistic communications between child and parents the first interplay of primal premental knowledge and sympathy it is a great subtle interplay and from this interplay the child is built up body and psyche impelled from the primal conscious center in the abdomen the child seeks the mother seeks the breast opens a blind mouth and gropes for the nipple not mentally directed and yet certainly directed directed from the dark premind center of the solar plexus from this center the child seeks the mother knows hence the true mindlessness of the pristine healthy mother she does not need to think mentally to know she knows so profoundly and actively at the great abdominal lifecenter  but if the child thus seeks the mother does it then know the mother alone to an infant the mother is the whole universe yet the child needs more than the mother it needs as well the presence of men the vibration from the present body of the man there may not be any actual palpable connection but from the great voluntary center in the man pass unknowable communications and unreliable nourishment of the stream of manly blood rays which we cannot see and which so far we have refused to know but none the less essential quickening dark rays which pass from the great dark abdominal lifecenter in the father to the corresponding center in the child and these rays these vibrations are not like the mothervibrations far far from it they do not need the actual contact the handling and the caressing on the contrary the true male instinct is to avoid physical contact with a baby it may not need even actual presence but present or absent there should be between the baby and the father that strange intangible communication that strange pull and circuit such as the magnetic pole exercises upon a needle a vitalistic pull and flow which lays all the lifeplasm of the baby into the line of vital quickening strength knowing and any lack of this vital circuit this vital interchange between father and child man and child means an inevitable impoverishment to the infant  the child exists in the interplay of two great lifewaves the womanly and the male in appearance the mother is everything in truth the father has actively very little part it does not matter much if he hardly sees his child yet see it he should sometimes and touch it sometimes and renew with it the connection the lifecircuit not allow it to lapse and so vitally starve his child  but remember dear reader please that there is not the slightest need for you to believe me or even read me remember its just your own affair dont implicate me     chapter iii  plexuses planes and so on   the primal consciousness in man is premental and has nothing to do with cognition it is the same as in the animals and this premental consciousness remains as long as we live the powerful root and body of our consciousness the mind is but the last flower the cul de sac  the first seat of our primal consciousnesses the solar plexus the great nervecenter situated behind the stomach from this center we are first dynamically conscious for the primal consciousness is always dynamic and never like mental consciousness static thought let us say what we will about its magic powers is instrumental only the souls finest instrument for the business of living thought is just a means to action and living but life and action take rise actually at the great centers of dynamic consciousness  the solar plexus the greatest and most important center of our dynamic consciousness is a sympathetic center at this main center of your firstmind we know as we can never mentally know primarily we know each man each living creature knows profoundly and satisfactorily and without question that i am i this root of all knowledge and being is established in the solar plexus it is dynamic premental knowledge such as cannot be transferred into thought do not ask me to transfer the premental dynamic knowledge into thought it cannot be done the knowledge that i am i can never be thought only known  this being the very first term of our lifeknowledge a knowledge established physically and psychically the moment the two parent nuclei fused at the moment of the conception it remains integral as a piece of knowledge in every subsequent nucleus derived from this one original but yet the original nucleus formed from the two parent nuclei at our conception remains always primal and central and is always the original fount and home of the first and supreme knowledge that i am i this original nucleus is embodied in the solar plexus  but the original nucleus divides the first division as science knows is a division of recoil from the perfect oneing of the two parent nuclei in the eggcell results a recoil or new assertion that which was perfect one now divides again and in the recoil becomes again two  this second nucleus the nucleus born of recoil is the nuclear origin of all the great nuclei of the voluntary system which are the nuclei of assertive individualism and it remains central in the adult human body as it was in the eggcell in the adult human body the first nucleus of independence firstborn from the great original nucleus of our conception lies always established in the lumbar ganglion here we have our positive center of independence in a multifarious universe  at the solar plexus the dynamic knowledge is this that i am i the solar plexus is the center of all the sympathetic system the great prime knowledge is sympathetic in nature i am i in vital centrality i am i the vital center of all things i am i the clew to the whole all is one with me it is the one identity  but at the lumbar ganglion which is the center of separate identity the knowledge is of a different mode though the term is the same at the lumbar ganglion i know that i am i in distinction from a whole universe which is not as i am this is the first tremendous flash of knowledge of singleness and separate identity i am i not because i am at one with all the universe but because i am other than all the universe it is my distinction from all the rest of things which makes me myself because i am set utterly apart and distinguished from all that is the rest of the universe therefore i am i and this root of our knowledge in separateness lies rooted all the time in the lumbar ganglion it is the second term of our dynamic psychic existence  it is from the great sympathetic center of the solar plexus that the child rejoices in the mother and in its own blissful centrality its unison with the as yet unknown universe look at the pictures of madonna and child and you will even see it it is from this center that it draws all things unto itself winningly drawing love for the soul and actively drawing in milk the same center controls the great intake of love and of milk of psychic and of physical nourishment  and it is from the great voluntary center of the lumbar ganglion that the child asserts its distinction from the mother the single identity of its own existence and its power over its surroundings from this center issues the violent little pride and lustiness which kicks with glee or crows with tiny exultance in its own being or which claws the breast with a savage little rapacity and an incipient masterfulness of which every mother is aware this incipient mastery this sheer joy of a young thing in its own single existence the marvelous playfulness of early youth and the roguish mockery of the mothers love as well as the bursts of temper and rage all belong to infancy and all this flashes spontaneously must flash spontaneously from the first great center of independence the powerful lumbar ganglion great dynamic center of all the voluntary system of all the spirit of pride and joy in independent existence and it is from this center too that the milk is urged away down the infant bowels urged away towards excretion the motion is the same but here it applies to the material not to the vital relation it is from the lumbar ganglion that the dynamic vibrations are emitted which thrill from the stomach and bowels and promote the excremental function of digestion it is the solar plexus which controls the assimilatory function in digestion  so in the first division of the eggcell is set up the first plane of psychic and physical life remaining radically the same throughout the whole existence of the individual the two original nuclei of the eggcell remain the same two original nuclei within the corpus of the adult individual their psychic and their physical dynamic is the same in the solar plexus and lumbar ganglion as in the two nuclei of the eggcell the first great division in the egg remains always the same the unchanging great division in the psychic and the physical structure the unchanging great division in knowledge and function it is a division into polarized duality psychical and physical of the human being it is the great vertical division of the eggcell and of the nature of man  then this division having taken place there is a new thrill of conjunction or collision between the divided nuclei and at once the second birth takes place the two nuclei now split horizontally there is a horizontal division across the whole eggcell and the nuclei are now four two above and two below but those below retain their original nature those above are new in nature and those above correspond again to those below  in the developed child the great horizontal division of the eggcell resulting in four nuclei this remains the same the horizontal divisionwall is the diaphragm the two upper nuclei are the two great nervecenters the cardiac plexus and the thoracic ganglion we have again a sympathetic center primal in activity and knowledge and a corresponding voluntary center in the center of the breast the cardiac plexus acts as the great sympathetic mode of new dynamic activity new dynamic consciousness and near the spine by the wall of the shoulders the thoracic ganglion acts as the powerful voluntary center of separateness and power in the same vertical line as the lumbar ganglion but horizontally so different  now we must change our whole feeling we must put off the deep way of understanding which belongs to the lower body of our nature and transfer ourselves into the upper plane where being and functioning are different  at the cardiac plexus there in the center of the breast we have now a new great sun of knowledge and being here there is no more of self here there is no longer the dark exultant knowledge that i am i a change has come here i know no more of myself here i am not here i only know the delightful revelation that you are you the wonder is no longer within me my own dark centrifugal exultant self the wonder is without me the wonder is outside me and i can no longer exult and know myself the dark central sun of the universe now i look with wonder with tenderness with joyful yearning towards that which is outside me beyond me not me behold that which was once negative has now become the only positive the other being is now the great positive reality i myself am as nothing positivity has changed places  if we want to see the portrayed look then we must turn to the north to the fair wondering blueeyed infants of the northern masters they seem so frail so innocent and wondering touching outwards to the mystery they are not the same as the southern child nor the opposite their whole life mystery is different instead of consummating all things within themselves as the dark little southern infants do the northern jesuschildren reach out delicate little hands of wondering innocence towards delicate flowerreverential mothers compare a botticelli madonna with all her wounded and abnegating sensuality with a hans memling madonna whose soul is pure and only reverential beyond me is the mystery and the glory says the northern mother let me have no self let me only seek that which is allpure allwonderful but the southern mother says this is mine this is mine this is my child my wonder my master my lord my scourge my own  from the cardiac plexus the child goes forth in bliss it seeks the revelation of the unknown it wonderingly seeks the mother it opens its small hands and spreads its small fingers to touch her and bliss bliss bliss it meets the wonder in midair and in midspace it finds the loveliness of the mothers face it opens and shuts its little fingers with bliss it laughs the wonderful selfless laugh of pure babybliss in the first ecstasy of finding all its treasure groping upon it and finding it in the dark it opens wide childwide eyes to see to see but it cannot see it is puzzled it wrinkles its face but when the mother puts her face quite near and laughs and coos then the baby trembles with an ecstasy of love the glamour the wonder the treasure beyond the great uplift of rapture all this surges from that first center of the breast the sun of the breast the cardiac plexus  and from the same center acts the great function of the heart and breath ah the aspiration the aspiration like a hope like a yearning constant and unfailing with which we take in breath when we breathe when we take in breath it is not as when we take in food when we breathe in we aspire we yearn towards the heaven of air and light and when the heart dilates to draw in the stream of dark blood it opens its arms as to a beloved it dilates with reverent joy as a host opening his doors to an honored guest whom he delights to serve opening his doors to the wonder which comes to him from beyond and without which he were nothing  so it is that our heart dilates our lungs expand they are bidden by that great and mysterious impulse from the cardiac plexus which bids them seek the mystery and the fulfillment of the beyond they seek the beyond the air of the sky the hot blood from the dark underworld and so we live  and then they relax they contract they are driven by the opposite motion from the powerful voluntary center of the thoracic ganglion that which was drawn in was invited is now relinquished allowed to go forth negatively not positively dismissed but relinquished  there is a wonderful complementary duality between the voluntary and the sympathetic activity on the same plane but between the two planes upper and lower there is a further dualism still more startling perhaps between the dark glowing first term of knowledge at the solar plexus i am i all is one in me and the first term of volitional knowledge i am myself and these others are not as i amthere is a world of difference but when the world changes again and on the upper plane we realize the wonder of other things the difference is almost shattering the thoracic ganglion is a ganglion of power when the child in its delicate bliss seeks the mother and finds her and is added on to her then it fulfills itself in the great upper sympathetic mode but then it relinquishes her it ceases to be aware of her and if she tries to force its love to play upon her again like light revealing her to herself then the child turns away or it will lie and look at her with the strange odd curious look of knowledge like a little imp who is spying her out this is the curious look that many mothers cannot bear involuntarily it arouses a sort of hate in themthe look of scrutinizing curiosity apart and as it were studying balancing them up yet it is a look which comes into every childs eyes it is the reaction of the great voluntary plexus between the shoulders the mother is suddenly set apart as an object of curiosity coldly sometimes dreamily sometimes puzzled sometimes mockingly observed  again if a mother neglect her child it cries it weeps for her love and attention its pitiful lament is one of the forms of compulsion from the upper center this insistence on pity on love is quite different from the rageous weeping which is compulsion from the lower center below the diaphragm again some children just drop everything they can lay hands on over the edge of their crib or their table they drop everything out of sight and then they look up with a curious look of negative triumph this is again a form of recoil from the upper center the obliteration of the thing which is outside and here a child is acting quite differently from the child who joyously smashes the desire to smash comes from the lower centers  we can quite well recognize the will exerted from the lower center we call it headstrong temper and masterfulness but the peculiar will of the upper centerthe sort of nervous critical objectivity the deliberate forcing of sympathy the play upon pity and tenderness the plaintive bullying of love or the benevolent bullying of lovethese we dont care to recognize they are the extravagance of spiritual will but in its true harmony the thoracic ganglion is a center of happier activity of real eager curiosity of the delightful desire to pick things to pieces and the desire to put them together again the desire to find out and the desire to invent all this arises on the upper plane at the volitional center of the thoracic ganglion     chapter iv  trees and babies and papas and mamas   oh damn the miserable baby with its complicated pingpong table of an unconscious im sure dear reader youd rather have to listen to the brat howling in its crib than to me expounding its plexuses as for mixing those babies up id mix him up like a shot if id anything to mix him with unfortunately hes my own anatomical specimen of a pickled rabbit so theres nothing to be done with the bits  but he gets on my nerves i come out solemnly with a pencil and an exercise book and take my seat in all gravity at the foot of a large firtree and wait for thoughts to come gnawing like a squirrel on a nut but the nuts hollow  i think there are too many trees they seem to crowd round and stare at me and i feel as if they nudged one another when im not looking i can feel them standing there and they wont let me get on about the baby this morning just their cussedness i felt they encouraged me like a harem of wonderful silent wives yesterday  it is half rainy toothe wood so damp and still and so secret in the remote morning air morning with rain in the sky and the forest subtly brooding and me feeling no bigger than a peabug between the roots of my fir the trees seem so much bigger than me so much stronger in life prowling silent around i seem to feel them moving and thinking and prowling and they overwhelm me ah well the only thing is to give way to them  it is the edge of the black forestsometimes the rhine far off on its rhine plain like a bit of magnesium ribbon but not today today only trees and leaves and vegetable presences huge straight firtrees and big beechtrees sending rivers of roots into the ground and cuckoos like noise falling in drops off the leaves and me a fool sitting by a grassy woodroad with a pencil and a book hoping to write more about that baby  never mind i listen again for noises and i smell the damp moss the looming trees so straight and i listen for their silence big tallbodied trees with a certain magnificent cruelty about them or barbarity i dont know why i should say cruelty their magnificent strong round bodies it almost seems i can hear the slow powerful sap drumming in their trunks great fullblooded trees with strange treeblood in them soundlessly drumming  trees that have no hands and faces no eyes yet the powerful sapscented blood roaring up the great columns a vast individual life and an overshadowing will the will of a tree something that frightens you  suppose you want to look a tree in the face you cant it hasnt got a face you look at the strong body of a trunk you look above you into the matted bodyhair of twigs and boughs you see the soft green tips but there are no eyes to look into you cant meet its gaze you keep on looking at it in part and parcel  its no good looking at a tree to know it the only thing is to sit among the roots and nestle against its strong trunk and not bother thats how i write all about these planes and plexuses between the toes of a tree forgetting myself against the great ankle of the trunk and then as a rule as a squirrel is stroked into its wickedness by the faceless magic of a tree so am i usually stroked into forgetfulness and into scribbling this book my treebook really  i come so well to understand treeworship all the old aryans worshiped the tree my ancestors the tree of life the tree of knowledge well one is bound to sprout out some time or other chip of the old aryan block i can so well understand treeworship and fear the deepest motive  naturally this marvelous vast individual without a face without lips or eyes or heart this towering creature that never had a face here am i between his toes like a peabug and him noiselessly overreaching me and i feel his great bloodjet surging and he has no eyes but he turns two ways he thrusts himself tremendously down to the middle earth where dead men sink in darkness in the damp dense undersoil and he turns himself about in high air whereas we have eyes on one side of our head only and only grow upwards  plunging himself down into the black humus with a roots gushing zest where we can only rot dead and his tips in high air where we can only look up to so vast and powerful and exultant in his two directions and all the time he has no face no thought only a huge savage thoughtless soul where does he even keep his soulwhere does anybody  a huge plunging tremendous soul i would like to be a tree for a while the great lust of roots rootlust and no mind at all he towers and i sit and feel safe i like to feel him towering round me i used to be afraid i used to fear their lust their rushing black lust but now i like it i worship it i always felt them huge primeval enemies but now they are my only shelter and strength i lose myself among the trees i am so glad to be with them in their silent intent passion and their great lust they feed my soul but i can understand that jesus was crucified on a tree  and i can so well understand the romans their terror of the bristling hercynian wood yet when you look from a height down upon the rolling of the forestthis black forestit is as suave as a rolling oily sea inside only it bristles horrific and it terrified the romans  the romans they too seem very near nearer than hindenburg or foch or even napoleon when i look across the rhine plain it is rome and the legionaries of the rhine that my soul notices it must have been wonderful to come from south italy to the shores of this sealike forest this dark moist forest with its enormously powerful intensity of tree life now i know coming myself from rockdry sicily open to the day  the romans and the greeks found everything human everything had a face and a human voice men spoke and their fountains piped an answer  but when the legions crossed the rhine they found a vast impenetrable life which had no voice they met the faceless silence of the black forest this huge huge wood did not answer when they called its silence was too crude and massive and the soldiers shrank shrank before the trees that had no faces and no answer a vast array of nonhuman life darkly selfsufficient and bristling with indomitable energy the hercynian wood not to be fathomed the enormous power of these collective trees stronger in their somber life even than rome  no wonder the soldiers were terrified no wonder they thrilled with horror when deep in the woods they found the skulls and trophies of their dead comrades upon the trees the trees had devoured them silently in mouthfuls and left the white bones bones of the mindful romansand savage preconscious trees indomitable the true german has something of the sap of trees in his veins even now and a sort of pristine savageness like trees helpless but most powerful under all his mentality he is a treesoul and his gods are not human his instinct still is to nail skulls and trophies to the sacred tree deep in the forest the tree of life and death tree of good and evil tree of abstraction and of immense mindless life tree of everything except the spirit spirituality  but after bonedry sicily and after the gibbering of myriad people all rattling their personalities i am glad to be with the profound indifference of faceless trees their rudimentariness cannot know why we care for the things we care for they have no faces no minds and bowels only deep lustful roots stretching in earth and vast lissome life in air and primeval individuality you can sacrifice the whole of your spirituality on their altar still you can nail your skull on their limbs they have no skulls no minds nor faces they cant make eyes of love at you their vast life dispenses with all this but they will live you down  the normal life of one of these big trees is about a hundred years so the herr baron told me  one of the few places that my soul will haunt when i am dead will be this among the trees here near ebersteinburg where i have been alone and written this book i cant leave these trees they have taken some of my soul                                       excuse my digression gentle reader at first i left it out thinking we might not see wood for trees but it doesnt much matter what we see its nice just to look round anywhere  so there are two planes of being and consciousness and two modes of relation and of function we will call the lower plane the sensual the upper the spiritual the terms may be unwise but we can think of no other  please read that again dear reader youll be a bit dazzled coming out of the wood  it is obvious that from the time a child is born or conceived it has a permanent relation with the outer universe relation in the two modes not one mode only there are two ways of love two ways of activity and independence and there needs some sort of equilibrium between the two modes in the same way in physical function there is eating and drinking and excrementation on the lower plane and respiration and heartbeat on the upper plane  now the equilibrium to be established is fourfold there must be a true equilibrium between what we eat and what we reject again by excretion likewise between the systole and diastole of the heart the inspiration and expiration of our breathing suffice to say the equilibrium is never quite perfect most people are either too fat or too thin too hot or too cold too slow or too quick there is no such thing as an actual norm a living norm a norm is merely an abstraction not a reality  the same on the psychical plane we either love too much or impose our will too much are too spiritual or too sensual there is not and cannot be any actual norm of human conduct all depends first on the unknown inward need within the very nuclear centers of the individual himself and secondly on his circumstance some men must be too spiritual some must be too sensual some must be too sympathetic and some must be too proud we have no desire to say what men ought to be we only wish to say there are all kinds of ways of being and there is no such thing as human perfection no man can be anything more than just himself in genuine living relation to all his surroundings but that which i am when i am myself will certainly be anathema to those who hate individual integrity and want to swarm and that which i being myself am in myself may make the hair bristle with rage on a man who is also himself but very different from me then let it bristle and if mine bristle back again then let us if we must fly at one another like two enraged men it is how it should be weve got to learn to live from the center of our own responsibility only and let other people do the same  to return to the child however and his development on his two planes of consciousness there is all the time a direct dynamic connection between child and mother child and father also from the start it is a connection on two planes the upper and lower from the lower sympathetic center the profound intake of love or vibration from the living corespondent outside from the upper sympathetic center the outgoing of devotion and the passionate vibration of given love given attention the two sympathetic centers are always or should always be counterbalanced by their corresponding voluntary centers from the great voluntary ganglion of the lower plane the child is selfwilled independent and masterful  in the activity of this center a boy refuses to be kissed and pawed about maintaining his proud independence like a little wild animal from this center he likes to command and to receive obedience from this center likewise he may be destructive and defiant and reckless determined to have his own way at any cost  from this center too he learns to use his legs the motion of walking like the motion of breathing is twofold first a sympathetic cleaving to the earth with the foot then the voluntary rejection the spurning the kicking away the exultance in power and freedom  from the upper voluntary center the child watches persistently wilfully for the attention of the mother to be taken notice of to be caressed in short to exist in and through the mothers attention from this center too he coldly refuses to notice the mother when she insists on too much attention this cold refusal is different from the active rejection of the lower center it is passive but cold and negative it is the great force of our day from the ganglion of the shoulders also the child breathes and his heart beats from the same center he learns the first use of his arms in the gesture of sympathy from the upper plane he embraces his mother with his arms in the motion of curiosity or interest which derives from the thoracic ganglion he spreads his fingers touches feels explores in the motion of rejection he drops an undesired object deliberately out of sight  and then when the four centers of what we call the first field of consciousness are fully active then it is that the eyes begin to gather their sight the mouth to speak the ears to awake to their intelligent hearings all as a result of the great fourfold activity of the first dynamic field of consciousness and then also as a result the mind wakens to its impressions and to its incipient control for at first the control is nonmental even noncerebral the brain acts only as a sort of switchboard  the business of the father in all this incipient childdevelopment is to stand outside as a final authority and make the necessary adjustments where there is too much sympathy then the great voluntary centers of the spine are weak the child tends to be delicate then the father by instinct supplies the roughness the sternness which stiffens in the child the centers of resistance and independence right from the very earliest days often for a mere infant it is the fathers fierce or stern presence the vibration of his voice which starts the frictional and independent activity of the great voluntary ganglion and gives the first impulse to the independence which later on is life itself  but on the other hand the father from his distance supports protects nourishes his child and it is ultimately on the remote but powerful fatherlove that the infant rests in a rest which is beyond motherlove for in the male the dominant centers are naturally the volitional centers centers of responsibility authority and care  it is the fathers business again to maintain some sort of equilibrium between the two modes of love in his infant a mother may wish to bring up her child from the lovely upper centers only from the centers of the breast in the mode of what we call pure or spiritual love then the child will be all gentle all tender and tenderradiant always enfolded with gentleness and forbearance always shielded from grossness or pain or roughness now the fathers instinct is to be rough and crude goodnaturedly brutal with the child calling the deeper centers the sensual centers into play what do you want my watch well you cant have it do you see because its mine not a lot of explanations of the you see darling no such nonsenseor if a child wails unnecessarily for its mother the father must be the check stop your noise you little brat what ails you you whiner and if children be too sensitive too sympathetic then it will do the child no harm if the father occasionally throws the cat out of the window or kicks the dog or raises a storm in the house storms there must be and if the child is old enough and robust enough it can occasionally have its bottom soundly spankedby the father if the mother refuses to perform that most necessary duty for a childs bottom is made occasionally to be spanked the vibration of the spanking acts direct upon the spinal nervesystem there is a direct reciprocity and reaction the spanker transfers his wrath to the great willcenters in the child and these willcenters react intensely are vivified and educated  on the other hand given a mother who is too generally hard or indifferent then it rests with the father to provide the delicate sympathy and the refined discipline then the father must show the tender sensitiveness of the upper mode the sad thing today is that so few mothers have any deep bowels of loveor even the breast of love what they have is the benevolent spiritual will the will of the upper self but the will is not love and benevolence in a parent is a poison it is bullying in these circumstances the father must give delicate adjustment and above all some warm native love from the richer sensual self  the question of corporal punishment is important it is no use roughly smacking a shrinking sensitive child and yet if a child is too shrinking too sensitive it may do it a world of good cheerfully to spank its posterior not brutally not cruelly but with real sound goodnatured exasperation and let the adult take the full responsibility half humorously without apology or explanation let us avoid selfjustification at all costs real corporal punishments apply to the sensual plane the refined punishments of the spiritual mode are usually much more indecent and dangerous than a good smack the pained but resigned disapprobation of a mother is usually a very bad thing much worse than the fathers shouts of rage and sendings to bed and no dessert for a week and so on are crueller and meaner than a bang on the head when a parent gives his boy a beating there is a living passionate interchange but in these refined punishments the parent suffers nothing and the child is deadened the bullying of the refined benevolent spiritual will is simply vitriol to the soul yet parents administer it with all the righteousness of virtue and good intention sparing themselves perfectly  the point is here if a child makes you so that you really want to spank it soundly then soundly spank the brat but know all the time what you are doing and always be responsible for your anger never be ashamed of it and never surpass it the flashing interchange of anger between parent and child is part of the responsible relationship necessary to growth again if a child offends you deeply so that you really cant communicate with it any more then while the hurt is deep switch off your connection from the child cut off your correspondence your vital communion and be alone but never persist in such a state beyond the time when your deep hurt dies down the only rule is do what you really impulsively wish to do but always act on your own responsibility sincerely and have the courage of your own strong emotion they enrichen the childs soul  for a childs primary education depends almost entirely on its relation to its parents brothers and sisters between mother and child father and child the law is this i the mother am myself alone the child is itself alone but there exists between us a vital dynamic relation for which i being the conscious one am basically responsible so as far as possible there must be in me no departure from myself lest i injure the preconscious dynamic relation i must absolutely act according to my own true spontaneous feeling but moreover i must also have wisdom for myself and for my child always always the deep wisdom of responsibility and always a brave responsibility for the souls own spontaneity lovewhat is love wed better get a new idea love is in all generous impulseeven a good spanking but wisdom is something else a deep collectedness in the soul a deep abiding by my own integral being which makes me responsible not for the child but for my certain duties towards the child and for maintaining the dynamic flow between the child and myself as genuine as possible that is to say not perverted by ideals or by my will  most fatal most hateful of all things is bullying but what is bullying it is a desire to superimpose my own will upon another person sensual bullying of course is fairly easily detected what is more dangerous is ideal bullying bullying people into what is ideally good for them i embrace for example an ideal and i seek to enact this ideal in the person of another this is ideal bullying a mother says that life should be all love all delicacy and forbearance and gentleness and she proceeds to spin a hateful sticky web of permanent forbearance gentleness hushedness around her naturally passionate and hasty child this so foils the child as to make him half imbecile or criminal i may have ideals if i likeeven of love and forbearance and meekness but i have no right to ask another to have these ideals and to impose any ideals upon a child as it grows is almost criminal it results in impoverishment and distortion and subsequent deficiency in our day most dangerous is the love and benevolence ideal it results in neurasthenia which is largely a dislocation or collapse of the great voluntary centers a derangement of the will it is in us an insistence upon the one lifemode only the spiritual mode it is a suppression of the great lower centers and a living a sort of halflife almost entirely from the upper centers thence since we live terribly and exhaustively from the upper centers there is a tendency now towards pthisis and neurasthenia of the heart the great sympathetic center of the breast becomes exhausted the lungs burnt by the overinsistence of one way of life become diseased the heart strained in one mode of dilation retaliates the powerful lower centers are no longer fully active particularly the great lumbar ganglion which is the clue to our sensual passionate pride and independence this ganglion is atrophied by suppression and it is this ganglion which holds the spine erect so weakchested roundshouldered we stoop hollowly forward on ourselves it is the result of the allfamous love and charity ideal an ideal now quite dead in its sympathetic activity but still fixed and determined in its voluntary action  let us beware and beware and beware of having a high ideal for ourselves but particularly let us beware of having an ideal for our children so doing we damn them all we can have is wisdom and wisdom is not a theory it is a state of soul it is the state wherein we know our wholeness and the complicate manifold nature of our being it is the state wherein we know the great relations which exist between us and our near ones and it is the state which accepts full responsibility first for our own souls and then for the living dynamic relations wherein we have our being it is no use expecting the other person to know each must know for himself but nowadays men have even a stunt of pretending that children and idiots alone know best this is a pretty piece of sophistry and criminal cowardice trying to dodge the liferesponsibility which no man or woman can dodge without disaster  the only thing is to be direct if a child has to swallow castoroil then say child youve got to swallow this castoroil it is necessary for your inside i say so because it is true so open your mouth why try coaxing and logic and tricks with children children are more sagacious than we are they twig soon enough if there is a flaw in our own intention and our own true spontaneity and they play up to our bit of falsity till there is hell to pay  you love mother dont you dearjust a piece of indecent trickery of the spiritual will the great emotions like love are unspoken speaking them is a sign of an indecent bullying will  poor pussy you must love poor pussy  what cant what sickening cant an appeal to love based on false pity thats the way to inculcate a filthy pharisaic conceit into a childif the child illtreats the cat say  stop mauling that cat its got its own life to live so let it live it then if the brat persists give tit for tat  what you pull the cats tail then ill pull your nose to see how you like it and give his nose a proper hard pinch  children must pull the cats tail a little children must steal the sugar sometimes they must occasionally spoil just the things one doesnt want them to spoil and they must occasionally tell storiestell a lie circumstances and life are such that we must all sometimes tell a lie just as we wear trousers because we dont choose that everybody shall see our nakedness morality is a delicate act of adjustment on the souls part not a rule or a prescription beyond a certain point the child shall not pull the cats tail or steal the sugar or spoil the furniture or tell lies but im afraid you cant fix this certain souls humor and so it must if at a sudden point you fly into a temper and thoroughly beat the boy for hardly touching the catwell thats life all youve got to say to him is there thatll serve you for all the times you have pulled her tail and hurt her and he will feel outraged and so will you but what does it matter children have an infinite understanding of the souls passionate variabilities and forgive even a real injustice if it was spontaneous and not intentional they know we arent perfect what they dont forgive us is if we pretend we are or if we bully     chapter v  the five senses   science is wretched in its treatment of the human body as a sort of complex mechanism made up of numerous little machines working automatically in a rather unsatisfactory relation to one another the body is the total machine the various organs are the included machines and the whole thing given a start at birth or at conception trundles on by itself the only god in the machine the human will or intelligence is absolutely at the mercy of the machine  such is the orthodox view soul when it is allowed an existence at all sits somewhat vaguely within the machine never defined if anything goes wrong with the machine why the soul is forgotten instantly we summon the archmechanic of our day the medicineman and a marvelous earnest fraud he is doing his best he is really wonderful as a mechanic of the human system but the life within us fails more and more while we marvelously tinker at the engines doctors are not to blame  it is obvious that even considering the human body as a very delicate and complex machine you cannot keep such a machine running for one day without most exact central control still more is it impossible to consider the automatic evolution of such a machine when did any machine even a single spinningwheel automatically evolve itself there was a god in the machine before the machine existed  so there we are with the human body there must have been and must be a central god in the machine of each animate corpus the little soul of the beetle makes the beetle toddle the little soul of the homo sapiens sets him on his two feet dont ask me to define the soul you might as well ask a bicycle to define the young damsel who so whimsically and so godlike pedals her way along the highroad a young lady skeltering off on her bicycle to meet her young manwhy what could the bicycle make of such a mystery if you explained it till doomsday yet the bicycle wouldnt be spinning from streatham to croydon by itself  so we may as well settle down to the little god in the machine we may as well call it the individual soul and leave it there its as far as the bicycle would ever get if it had to define mademoiselle but be sure the bicycle would not deny the existence of the young miss who seats herself in the saddle not like us who try to pretend there is no one in the saddle why even the sun would no more spin without a rider than would a cyclepedal but since we have innumerable planets to reckon with in the spinning we must not begin to define the rider in terms of our own exclusive planet nevertheless rider there is even a rider of the manywheeled universe  but let us leave the universe alone it is too big a bauble for merevenonsat the start of me there is me there is a mysterious little entity which is my individual self the god who builds the machine and then makes his gay excursion of seventy years within it now we are talking at the moment about the machine for the moment we are the bicycle and not the featherbrained cyclist so that all we can do is to define the cyclist in terms of ourself a bicycle could say here upon my leather saddle rests a strange and animated force which i call the force of gravity as being the one great force which controls my universe and yet on second thoughts i must modify myself this great force of gravity is not always in the saddle sometimes it just is not thereand i lean strangely against a wall i have been even known to turn upside down with my wheels in the air spun by the same mysterious miss so that i must introduce a theory of relativity however mostly when i am awake and alive she is in the saddle or it is in the saddle the mysterious force and when it is in the saddle then two subsidiary forces plunge and claw upon my two pedals plunge and claw with inestimable power and at the same time a kind and mysterious force sways my headstock sways most incalculably and governs my whole motion this force is not a driving force but a subtle directing force beneath whose grip my bright steel body is flexible as a dipping highroad then let me not forget the sudden clutch of arrest upon my hurrying wheels oh this is pain to me while i am rushing forward surpassing myself in an √©lan vital suddenly the awful check grips my back wheel or my front wheel or both suddenly there is a fearful arrest my soul rushes on before my body i feel myself strained torn back my fibers groan then perhaps the tension relaxes  so the bicycle will continue to babble about itself and it will inevitably wind up with a philosophy oh if only the great and divine force rested for ever upon my saddle and if only the mysterious will which sways my steering gear remained in place for ever then my pedals would revolve of themselves and never cease and no hideous brake should tear the perpetuity of my motions then oh then i should be immortal i should leap through the world for ever and spin to infinity till i was identified with the dizzy and timeless cyclerace of the stars and the great sun  poor old bicycle the very thought is enough to start a philanthropic society for the prevention of cruelty to bicycles  well then our human body is the bicycle and our individual and incomprehensible self is the rider thereof and seeing that the universe is another bicycle riding full tilt we are bound to suppose a rider for that also but we neednt say what sort of rider when i see a cockroach scuttling across the floor and turning up its tail i stand affronted and think a rum sort of rider you must have youve no business to have such a rider do you hearand when i hear the monotonous and plaintive cuckoo in the june woods i think who the devil made that clockand when i see a politician making a fiery speech on a platform and the crowd gawping i think lord save metheyve all got riders but holy moses you could never guess what was comingand so i shouldnt like myself to start guessing about the rider of the universe i am all too flummoxed by the masquerade in the tourney round about me  we ourselves then wisdom like charity begins at home weve each of us got a rider in the saddle an individual soul mostly it cant ride and cant steer so mankind is like squadrons of bicycles running amok we should every one fall off if we didnt ride so thick that we hold each other up horrid nightmare  as for myself i have a horror of riding en bloc so i grind away uphill and sweat my guts out as they say  well wellmy body is my bicycle the whole middle of me is the saddle where sits the rider of my soul and my front wheel is the cardiac plane and my back wheel is the solar plexus and the brakes are the voluntary ganglia and the steering gear is my head and the right and left pedals are the right and left dynamics of the body in some way corresponding to the sympathetic and voluntary division  so that now i know more or less how my rider rides me and from what centers controls me that is i know the points of vital contact between my rider and my machine between my invisible and my visible self i dont attempt to say what is my rider a bicycle might as well try to define its young miss by wriggling its handlebars and ringing its bell  however having more or less determined the four primary motions we can see the further unfolding in a child the solar plexus and the cardiac plexus with corresponding voluntary ganglia are awake and active from these centers develop the great functions of the body  as we have seen it is the solar plexus with the lumbar ganglion which controls the great dynamic system the functioning of the liver and the kidneys any excess in the sympathetic dynamism tends to accelerate the action of the liver to cause fever and constipation any collapse of the sympathetic dynamism causes an√¶mia the sudden stimulating of the voluntary center may cause diarrhoea and so on but all this depends so completely on the polarized flow between the individual and the correspondent between the child and mother child and father child and sisters or brothers or teacher or circumambient universe that it is impossible to lay down laws unless we state particulars nevertheless the whole of the great organs of the lower body are controlled from the two lower centers and these organs work well or ill according as there is a true dynamic psychic activity at the two primary centers of consciousness by a true dynamic psychic activity we mean an activity which is true to the individual himself to his own peculiar soulnature and a dynamic psychic activity means a dynamic polarity between the individual himself and other individuals concerned in his living or between him and his immediate surroundings human physical geographical  on the upper plane the lungs and heart are controlled from the cardiac plane and the thoracic ganglion any excess in the sympathetic mode from the upper centers tends to burn the lungs with oxygen weaken them with stress and cause consumption so it is just criminal to make a child too loving no child should be induced to love too much it means derangement and death at last  but beyond the primary physiological functionand it is the business of doctors to discover the relation between the functioning of the primary organs and the dynamic psychic activity at the four primary consciousnesscentersbeyond these physical functions there are the activities which are halfpsychic halffunctional such as the five senses  of the five senses four have their functioning in the faceregion the fifth the sense of touch is distributed all over the body but all have their roots in the four great primary centers of consciousness from the constellation of your nervenodes from the great field of your poles the nerves run out in every direction ending on the surface of the body inwardly this is an inextricable ramification and communication  and yet the body is planned out in areas there is a definite areacontrol from the four centers on the back the sense of touch is not acute there the voluntary centers act in resistance but in the front of the body the breast is one great field of sympathetic touch the belly is another on these two fields the stimulus of touch is quite different has a quite different psychic quality and psychic result the breasttouch is the fine alertness of quivering curiosity the bellytouch is a deep thrill of delight and avidity correspondingly the hands and arms are instruments of superb delicate curiosity and deliberate execution through the elbows and the wrists flows the dynamic psychic current and a dislocation in the current between two individuals will cause a feeling of dislocation at the wrists and elbows on the lower plane the legs and feet are instruments of unfathomable gratifications and repudiations the thighs the knees the feet are intensely alive with lovedesire darkly and superbly drinking in the lovecontact blindly or they are the great centers of resistance kicking repudiating sudden flushing of great general sympathetic desire will make a man feel weak at the knees hatred will harden the tension of the knees like steel and grip the feet like talons thus the fields of touch are four two sympathetic fields in front of the body from the throat to the feet two resistant fields behind from the neck to the heels  there are two fields of touch however where the distribution is not so simple the face and the buttocks neither in the face nor in the buttocks is there one single mode of sense communication  the face is of course the great window of the self the great opening of the self upon the world the great gateway the lower body has its own gates of exit but the bulk of our communication with all the outer universe goes on through the face  and every one of the windows or gates of the face has its direct communication with each of the four great centers of the first field of consciousness take the mouth with the sense of taste the mouth is primarily the gate of the two chief sensual centers it is the gateway to the belly and the loins through the mouth we eat and we drink in the mouth we have the sense of taste at the lips too we kiss and the kiss of the mouth is the first sensual connection  in the mouth also are the teeth and the teeth are the instruments of our sensual will the growth of the teeth is controlled entirely from the two great sensual centers below the diaphragm but almost entirely from the one center the voluntary center the growth and the life of the teeth depend almost entirely on the lumbar ganglion during the growth of the teeth the sympathetic mode is held in abeyance there is a sort of arrest there is pain there is diarrhoea there is misery for the baby  and we in our age have no rest with our teeth our mouths are too small for many ages we have been suppressing the avid negroid sensual will we have been converting ourselves into ideal creatures all spiritually conscious and active dynamically only on one plane the upper spiritual plane our mouth has contracted our teeth have become soft and unquickened where in us are the sharp and vivid teeth of the wolf keen to defend and devour if we had them more we should be happier where are the white negroid teeth where in our little pinched mouths they have no room we are sympathyrotten and spiritrotten and idearotten we have forfeited our flashing sensual power and we have false teeth in our mouths in the same way the lips of our sensual desire go thinner and more meaningless in the compression of our upper will and our ideadriven impulse let us break the conscious selfconscious loveideal and we shall grow strong resistant teeth once more and the teething of our young will not be the hell it is  teething is strictly the period when the voluntary center of the lower plane first comes into full activity and takes for a time the precedence  so the mouth is the great sensual gate to the lower body but let us not forget it is also a gate by which we breathe the gate through which we speak and go impalpably forth to our object the gate at which we can kiss the pinched delicate spiritual kiss therefore although the main sensual gate of entrance to the lower body it has its reference also to the upper body  taste the sense of taste is an intake of a pure communication between us and a body from the outside world it contains the element of touch and in this it refers to the cardiac plexus but taste qu√¢ taste refers purely to the solar plexus  and then smell the nostrils are the great gate from the wide atmosphere of heaven to the lungs the extreme sigh of yearning we catch through the mouth but the delicate nose advances always into the air our palpable communicator with the infinite air thus it has its first delicate root in the cardiac plexus the root of its intake and the root of the delicateproud exhalation rejection is in the thoracic ganglion but the nostrils have their other function of smell here the delicate nerveends run direct from the lower centers from the solar plexus and the lumbar ganglion or even deeper there is the refined sensual intake when a scent is sweet there is the sensual repudiation when a scent is unsavoury and just as the fullness of the lips and the shape of the mouth depend on the development from the lower or the upper centers the sensual or the spiritual so does the shape of the nose depend on the direct control of the deepest centers of consciousness a perfect nose is perhaps the result of a balance in the four modes but what is a perfect nosewe only know that a short snub nose goes with an oversympathetic nature not proud enough while a long nose derives from the center of the upper will the thoracic ganglion our great center of curiosity and benevolent or objective control a thick squat nose is the sensualsympathetic nose and the high arched nose the sensual voluntary nose having the curve of repudiation as when we turn up our nose from a bad smell but also the proud curve of haughtiness and subjective authority the nose is one of the greatest indicators of character that is to say it almost inevitably indicates the mode of predominant dynamic consciousness in the individual the predominant primary center from which he liveswhen savages rub noses instead of kissing they are exchanging a more sensitive and a deeper sensual salute than our liptouch  the eyes are the third great gateway of the psyche here the soul goes in and out of the body as a bird flying forth and coming home but the root of conscious vision is almost entirely in the breast when i go forth from my own eyes in delight to dwell upon the world which is beyond me outside me then i go forth from wide open windows through which shows the full and living lambent darkness of my present inward self i go forth and i leave the lovely open darkness of my sensient self revealed when i go forth in the wonder of vision to dwell upon the beloved or upon the wonder of the world i go from the center of the glad breast through the eyes and who will may look into the full soft darkness of me rich with my undiscovered presence but if i am displeased then hard and cold my self stands in my eyes and refuses any communication any sympathy but merely stares outwards it is the motion of cold objectivity from the thoracic ganglion or from the same center of will cold but intense my eyes may watch with curiosity as a cat watches a fly it may be into my curiosity will creep an element of warm gladness in the wonder which i am beholding outside myself or it may be that my curiosity will be purely and simply the cold almost cruel curiosity of the upper will directed from the ganglion of the shoulders such as is the acute attention of an experimental scientist  the eyes have however their sensual root as well but this is hard to transfer into language as all our vision our modern northern vision is in the upper mode of actual seeing  there is a sensual way of beholding there is the dark desirous look of a savage who apprehends only that which has direct reference to himself that which stirs a certain dark yearning within his lower self then his eye is fathomless blackness but there is the dark eye which glances with a certain fire and has no depth there is a keen quick vision which watches which beholds but which never yields to the object outside as a cat watching its prey the dark glancing look which knows the strangeness the danger of its object the need to overcome the object the eye which is not wide open to study to learn but which powerfully proudly or cautiously glances and knows the terror or the pure desirability of strangeness in the object it beholds the savage is all in all in himself that which he sees outside he hardly notices or he sees as something odd something automatically desirable something lustfully desirable or something dangerous what we call vision that he has not  we must compare the look in a horses eye with the look in a cows the eye of the cow is soft velvety receptive she stands and gazes with the strangest intent curiosity she goes forth from herself in wonder the root of her vision is in her yearning breast the same one hears when she moos the same massive weight of passion is in a bulls breast the passion to go forth from himself his strength is in his breast his weapons are on his head the wonder is always outside him  but the horses eye is bright and glancing his curiosity is cautious full of terror or else aggressive and frightening for the object the root of his vision is in his belly in the solar plexus and he fights with his teeth and his heels the sensual weapons  both these animals however are established in the sympathetic mode the life mode in both is sensitively sympathetic or preponderantly sympathetic those animals which like cats wolves tigers hawks chiefly live from the great voluntary centers these animals are in our sense of the word almost visionless sight in them is sharpened or narrowed down to a point the object of prey it is exclusive they see no more than this and thus they see unthinkably far unthinkably keenly  most animals however smell what they see vision is not very highly developed they know better by the more direct contact of scent  and vision in us becomes faulty because we proceed too much in one mode we see too much we attend too much the dark glancing sightlessness of the intent savage the narrowed vision of the cat the single point of vision of the hawkthese we do not know any more we live far too much from the sympathetic centers without the balance from the voluntary mode and we live far far too much from the upper sympathetic center and voluntary center in an endless objective curiosity sight is the least sensual of all the senses and we strain ourselves to see see seeeverything everything through the eye in one mode of objective curiosity there is nothing inside us we stare endlessly at the outside so our eyes begin to fail to retaliate on us we go shortsighted almost in selfprotection  hearing the last and perhaps the deepest of the senses and here there is no choice in every other faculty we have the power of rejection we have a choice of vision we can if we choose see in the terms of the wonderful beyond the world of light into which we go forth in joy to lose ourselves in it or we can see as the egyptians saw in the terms of their own dark souls seeing the strangeness of the creature outside the gulf between it and them but finally its existence in terms of themselves they saw according to their own unchangeable idea subjectively they did not go forth from themselves to seek the wonder outside  those are the two chief ways of sympathetic vision we call our way the objective the egyptian the subjective but objective and subjective are words that depend absolutely on your starting point spiritual and sensual are much more descriptive terms  but there are of course also the two ways of volitional vision we can see with the endless modern critical sight analytic and at last deliberately ugly or we can see as the hawk sees the one concentrated spot where beats the lifeheart of our prey  in the four modes of sight we have some choice we have some choice to refuse tastes or smells or touch in hearing we have the minimum of choice sound acts direct upon the great affective centers we may voluntarily quicken our hearing or make it dull but we have really no choice of what we hear our will is eliminated sound acts direct almost automatically upon the affective centers and we have no power of going forth from the ear we are always and only recipient  nevertheless sound acts upon us in various ways according to the four primary poles of consciousness the singing of birds acts almost entirely upon the centers of the breast birds which live by flight impelled from the strong consciousactivity of the breast and shoulders have become for us symbols of the spirit the upper mode of consciousness their legs have become idle almost insentient twigs only the tail flirts from the center of the sensual will  but their singing acts direct upon the upper or spiritual centers in us so does almost all our music which is all christian in tendency but modern music is analytical critical and it has discovered the power of ugliness like our martial music it is of the upper plane like our martial songs our fifes and our brassbands these act direct upon the thoracic ganglion time was however when music acted upon the sensual centers direct we hear it still in savage music and in the roll of drums and in the roaring of lions and in the howling of cats and in some voices still we hear the deeper resonance of the sensual mode of consciousness but the tendency is for everything to be brought on to the upper plane whilst the lower plane is just worked automatically from the upper     chapter vi  first glimmerings of mind   we can now see what is the true goal of education for a child it is the full and harmonious development of the four primary modes of consciousness always with regard to the individual nature of the child  the goal is not ideal the aim is not mental consciousness we want effectual human beings not conscious ones the final aim is not to know but to be there never was a more risky motto than that know thyself youve got to know yourself as far as possible but not just for the sake of knowing youve got to know yourself so that you can at last be yourself be yourself is the last motto  the whole field of dynamic and effectual consciousness is always premental nonmental not even the most knowing man that ever lived would know how he would be feeling next week whether some new and utterly shattering impulse would have arisen in him and laid his nicelyconceived self in ruins it is the impulse we have to live by not the ideals or the idea but we have to know ourselves pretty thoroughly before we can break the automatism of ideals and conventions the savage in a state of nature is one of the most conventional of creatures so is a child only through fine delicate knowledge can we recognize and release our impulses now our whole aim has been to force each individual to a maximum of mental control and mental consciousness our poor little plans of children are put into horrible forcingbeds called schools and the young idea is there forced to shoot it shoots poor thing like a potato in a warm cellar one mass of pallid sickly ideas and ideals and no root no life the ideas shoot hard enough in our sad offspring but they shoot at the expense of life itself never was such a mistake mental consciousness is a purely individual affair some men are born to be highly and delicately conscious but for the vast majority much mental consciousness is simply a catastrophe a blight it just stops their living  our business at the present is to prevent at all cost the young idea from shooting the ideal mind the brain has become the vampire of modern life sucking up the blood and the life there is hardly an original thought or original utterance possible to us all is sickly repetition of stale stale ideas  let all schools be closed at once keep only a few technical training establishments nothing more let humanity lie fallow for two generations at least let no child learn to read unless it learns by itself out of its own individual persistent desire  that is my serious admonition gentle reader but i am not so flighty as to imagine you will pay any heed but if i thought you would i should feel my hope surge up and if you dont pay any heed calamity will at length shut your schools for you sure enough  the process of transfer from the primary consciousness to recognized mental consciousness is a mystery like every other transfer yet it follows its own laws and here we begin to approach the confines of orthodox psychology upon which we have no desire to trespass but this we can say the degree of transfer from primary to mental consciousness varies with every individual but in most individuals the natural degree is very low  the process of transfer from primary consciousness is called sublimation the sublimating of the potential body of knowledge with the definite reality of the idea and with this process we have identified all education the very derivation of the latin word education shows us of course it should mean the leading forth of each nature to its fullness but with us fools that we are it is the leading forth of the primary consciousness the potential or dynamic consciousness into mental consciousness which is finite and static now before we set out so gayly to lead our children en bloc out of the dynamic into the static way of consciousness let us consider a moment what we are doing  a child in the womb can have no idea of the mother i think orthodox psychology will allow us so much and yet the child in the womb must be dynamically conscious of the mother otherwise how could it maintain a definite and progressively developing relation to her  this consciousness however is utterly nonideal nonmental purely dynamic a matter of dynamic polarized intercourse of vital vibrations as an exchange of wireless messages which are never translated from the pulserhythm into speech because they have no need to be it is a dynamic polarized intercourse between the great primary nuclei in the foetus and the corresponding nuclei in the dynamic maternal psyche  this form of consciousness is established at conception and continues long after birth nay it continues all life long but the particular interchange of dynamic consciousness between mother and child suffers no interruption at birth it continues almost the same the child has no conception whatsoever of the mother it cannot see her for its eye has no focus it can hear her because hearing needs no transmission into concept but it has no oral notion of sounds it knows her but only by a form of vital dynamic correspondence a sort of magnetic interchange the idea does not intervene at all  gradually however the dark shadow of our object begins to loom in the formless mind of the infant the idea of the mother is as it were gradually photographed on the cerebral plasm it begins with the faintest shadowbut the figure is gradually developed through years of experience it is never quite completed  how does the figure of the mother gradually develop as a conception in the child mind it develops as the result of the positive and negative reaction from the primary centers of consciousness from the first great center of sympathy the child is drawn to a lovely oneing with the mother from the first great center of will comes the independent selfassertion which locates the mother as something outside something objective and as a result of this twofold notion a twofold increase in the child first the dynamic establishment of the individual consciousness in the infant and then the first shadow of a mental conception of the mother in the infant brain the development of the original mind in every child and every man always and only follows from the dual fulfillment in the dynamic consciousness  but mark further each time after the fourfold interchange between two dynamic polarized lives there results a development in the individuality and a sublimation into consciousness both simultaneously in each party and this dual development causes at once a diminution in the dynamic polarity between the two parties that is as its individuality and its mental concept of the mother develop in the child there is a corresponding waning of the dynamic relation between the child and the mother and this is the natural progression of all love as we have said before the accomplishment of individuality never finally exhausts the dynamic flow between parents and child in the same way a child can never have a finite conception of either of its parents it can have a very much more finite finished conception of its aunts or its friends the portrait of the parent can never be quite completed in the mind of the son or daughter as long as time lasts it must be left unfinished  nevertheless the inevitable photography of time upon the mental plasm does print at last a very substantial portrait of the parent a very wellfilled concept in the child mind and the nearer a conception comes towards finality the nearer does the dynamic relation out of which this concept has arisen draw to a close to know is to lose when i have a finished mental concept of a beloved or a friend then the love and the friendship is dead it falls to the level of an acquaintance as soon as i have a finished mental conception a full idea even of myself then dynamically i am dead to know is to die  but knowledge and death are part of our natural development only of course most things can never be known by us in full which means we do never absolutely die even to our parents so that jesus question to his mother woman what have i to do with theewhile expressing a major truth still has an exaggerated sound which comes from its denial of the minor truth  this progression from dynamic relationship towards a finished individuality and a finished mental concept is carried on from the four great primary centers through the correspondence medium of all the senses and sensibilities first of all the child knows the mother only through touchperfect and immediate contact and yet from the moment of conception the eggcell repudiated complete adhesion and even communication and asserted its individual integrity the child in the womb perfect a contact though it may have with the mother is all the time also dynamically polarized against this contact from the first moment this relation in touch has a dual polarity and no doubt a dual mode it is a fourfold interchange of consciousness the moment the eggcell has made its two spontaneous divisions  as soon as the child is born there is a real severance the contact of touch is interrupted it now becomes occasional only true the dynamic flow between mother and child is not severed when simple physical contact is missing though mother and child may not touch still the dynamic flow continues between them the mother knows her child feels her bowels and her breast drawn to it even if it be a hundred miles away but if the severance continue long the dynamic flow begins to die both in mother and child it wanes fairly quicklyand perhaps can never be fully revived the dynamic relation between parent and child may fairly easily fall into quiescence a static condition  for a full dynamic relationship it is necessary that there be actual contact the nerves run from the four primary dynamos and end with live ends all over the body and it is necessary to bring the live ends of the nerves of the child into contact with the live ends of corresponding nerves in the mother so that a pure circuit is established wherever a pure circuit is established there occurs a pure development in the individual creation and this is inevitably accompanied by sensation and sensation is the first term of mental knowledge  so from the field of the breast and arms the upper circuit and from the field of the knees and feet and belly the lower circuit  and then the moment a child is born the face is alive and the face communicates direct with both planes of primary consciousness the moment a child is born it begins to grope for the breast and suddenly a new great circuit is established the four poles all working at once as the child sucks there is the profound desirousness of the lower center of sympathy and the superior avidity of the center of will and at the same time the cleaving yearning to the nipple and the tiny curiosity of lips and gums the nipple of the mothers breast is one of the great gates of the body hence of the living psyche in the nipple terminate vivid nerves which flash their very powerful vibrations through the mouth of the child and deep into its four great poles of being and knowing even the nipples of the man are gateways to the great dynamic flow still gateways  touch taste and smell are now active in the baby and these senses socalled are strictly sensations they are the first term of the childs mental knowledge and on these three cerebral reactions the foundation of the future mind is laid  the moment there is a perfect polarized circuit between the first four poles of dynamic consciousness at that moment does the mind the terminal station flash into cognition the first cognition is merely sensation sensation and the remembrance of sensation being the first element in all knowing and in all conception  the circuit of touch taste and smell must be well established before the eyes begin actually to see all mental knowledge is built up of sensation and of memory it is the continually recurring sensation of the touch of the mother which forms the basis of the first conception of the mother after that the gradually discriminated taste of the mother and scent of the mother till gradually sight and hearing develop and largely usurp the first three senses as medium of correspondence and of knowledge  and while of course the sensational knowledge is being secreted in the brain in some much more mysterious way the living individuality of the child is being developed in the four first nuclei the four great nervecenters of the primary field of consciousness and being  as time goes on the child learns to see the mother at first he sees her face as a blur and though he knows her knows her by a direct glow of communication as if her face were a warm glowing lifelamp which rejoiced him but gradually as the circuit of touch taste and smell become powerfully established gradually as the individual develops in the child and so retreats towards isolation gradually as the child stands more immune from the mother the circuit of correspondence extends and the eyes now communicate across space the ears begin to discriminate sounds last of all develops discriminate hearing  now gradually the picture of the mother is transferred to the childs mind and the sound of the first babywords is imprinted and as the child learns to discriminate visually objectively between the mother and the nurse he learns to choose and becomes individually free and still the dynamic correspondence is not finished it only changes its circuit  while the brain is registering sensations the four dynamic centers are coming into perfect relation or rather as we see the reverse is the case as the dynamic centers come into perfect relation the mind registers and remembers sensations and begins consciously to know but the great field of activity is still and always the dynamic field when a child learns to walk it learns almost entirely from the solar plexus and the lumbar ganglion the cardiac plexus and the thoracic ganglion balancing the upper body  there is a perfected circuit of polarity the two lower centers are the positive the two upper the negative poles and so the child strikes out with his feet for the earth presses and strikes away again from the earth the two upper centers meanwhile corresponding implicitly in the balance of the upper body it is a chain of spontaneous activity in the four primary centers establishing a circuit through the whole body but the positive poles are the lower centers and the brain has probably nothing at all to do with it even the desire to walk is not born in the brain but in the primary nuclei  the same with the use of the hands and arms it means the establishment of a pure circuit between the four centers the two upper poles now being the positive the lower the negative poles and the hands the live end of the wire again the brain is not concerned probably even in the first deliberate grasping of an object the brain is not concerned not until there is an element of recognition and sensationmemory  all our primal activity originates and circulates purely in the four great nerve centers all our active desire our genuine impulse our love our hope our yearning everything originates mysteriously at these four great centers or wellheads of our existence everything vital and dynamic the mind can only register that which results from the emanation of the dynamic impulse and the collision or communion of this impulse with its object  so now we see that we can never know ourselves knowledge is to consciousness what the signpost is to the traveler just an indication of the way which has been traveled before knowledge is not even in direct proportion to being there may be great knowledge of chemistry in a man who is a rather poor being and those who know even in wisdom like solomon are often at the end of the matter of living not at the beginning as a matter of fact david did the living the dynamic achievement to solomon was left the consummation and the finish and the dying down  yet we must know if only in order to learn not to know the supreme lesson of human consciousness is to learn how not to know that is how not to interfere that is how to live dynamically from the great source and not statically like machines driven by ideas and principles from the head or automatically from one fixed desire at last knowledge must be put into its true place in the living activity of man and we must know deeply in order even to do that  so a new conception of the meaning of education  education means leading out the individual nature in each man and woman to its true fullness you cant do that by stimulating the mind to pump education into the mind is fatal that which sublimates from the dynamic consciousness into the mental consciousness has alone any value this in most individuals is very little indeed so that most individuals under a wise government would be most carefully protected from all vicious attempts to inject extraneous ideas into them every extraneous idea which has no inherent root in the dynamic consciousness is as dangerous as a nail driven into a young tree for the mass of people knowledge must be symbolical mythical dynamic this means you must have a higher responsible conscious class and then in varying degrees the lower classes varying in their degree of consciousness symbols must be true from top to bottom but the interpretation of the symbols must rest degree after degree in the higher responsible conscious classes to those who cannot divest themselves again of mental consciousness and definite ideas mentality and ideas are death nails through their hands and feet     chapter vii  first steps in education   the first process of education is obviously not a mental process when a mother talks to a baby she is not encouraging its little mind to think when she is coaxing her child to walk she is not making a theoretic exposition of the science of equilibration she crouches before the child at a little distance and spreads her hands come babycome to mother come baby walk yes walk walk to mother come along a little walk to its mother come come then why yes a pretty baby oh he can toddle yesyesno dont be frightened a dear nocome to mother and she catches his little pinafore by the tipand the infant lurches forward there there a beautiful walk a beautiful walker yes walked all the way to mother baby did yes he did  now who will tell me that this talk has any rhyme or reason not a spark of reason yet a real rhyme or rhythm much more important the song and the urge of the mothers voice plays direct on the affective centers of the child a wonderful stimulus and tuition the words hardly matter true this constant repetition in the end forms a mental association at the moment they have no mental significance at all for the baby but they ring with a strange palpitating music in his fluttering soul and lift him into motion  and this is the way to educate children the instinctive way of mothers there should be no effort made to teach children to think to have ideas only to lift them and urge them into dynamic activity the voice of dynamic sound not the words of understanding damn understanding gestures and touch and expression of the face not theory never have ideas about childrenand never have ideas for them  if we are going to teach children we must teach them first to move and not by rule or mental dictation horror but by playing and teasing and anger and amusement a child must learn to move blithe and free and proud it must learn the fullness of spontaneous motion and this it can only learn by continuous reaction from all the centers through all the emotions a child must learn to contain itself it must learn to sit still if need be part of the first phase of education is the learning to stay still and be physically selfcontained then a child must learn to be alone and to adventure alone and to play alone any peevish clinging should be quite roughly rebuffed from the very first day throw a child back on its own resourceseven a little cruelly sometimes but dont neglect it dont have a negative attitude to it play with it tease it and roll it over as a dog her puppy mock it when it is too timorous laugh at it scold it when it really bothers youfor a child must learn not to bother another personand when it makes you genuinely angry spank it soundly but always remember that it is a single little soul by itself and that the responsibility for the wise warm relationship is yours the adults  then always watch its deportment above all things encourage a straight backbone and proud shoulders above all things despise a slovenly movement an ugly bearing and unpleasing manner and make a mock of petulance and of too much timidity  we are imbeciles to start bothering about love and so forth in a child forget utterly that there is such a thing as emotional reciprocity but never forget your own honor as an adult individual towards a small individual it is a question of honor not of love  a tree grows straight when it has deep roots and is not too stifled love is a spontaneous thing coming out of the spontaneous effectual soul as a deliberate principle it is an unmitigated evil also morality which is based on ideas or on an ideal is an unmitigated evil a child which is proud and free in its movements in all its deportment will be quite as moral as need be honor is an instinct a superb instinct which should be kept keenly alive immorality vice crime these come from a suppression or a collapse at one or other of the great primary centers if one of these centers fails to maintain its true polarity then there is a physical or psychic derangement or both and viciousness or crime are the result of a derangement in the primary system pure morality is only an instinctive adjustment which the soul makes in every circumstance adjusting one thing to another livingly delicately sensitively there can be no law therefore at every cost and charge keep the first four centers alive and alert active and vivid in reaction and then you need fear no perversion what we have done in our era is first we have tried as far as possible to suppress or subordinate the two sensual centers we have so unduly insisted on and exaggerated the upper spiritual or selfless modethe living in the other person and through the other personthat we have caused already a dangerous overbalance in the natural psyche  to correct this we go one worse and try to rule ourselves more and more by the old ideas of sympathy and benevolence we think that love and benevolence will cure anything whereas love and benevolence are our poison poison to the giver and still more poison to the receiver poison only because there is practically no spontaneous love left in the world it is all will the fatal lovewill and insatiable morbid curiosity the pure sympathetic mode of love long ago broke down there is now only deadly exaggerated volition  this is also why general education should be suppressed as soon as possible we have fallen into a state of fixed deadly will everything we do and say to our children in school tends simply to fix in them the same deadly will under the pretence of pure love our idealism is the clue to our fixed will love beauty benevolence progress these are the words we use but the principle we evoke is a principle of barren sanctified compulsion of all life we want to put all life under compulsion how to outwit the nerves for exampleand therefore to save the children as far as possible elementary education should be stopped at once  no child should be sent to any sort of public institution before the age of ten years if i could but advise i would advise that this notice should be sent through the length and breadth of the land       parents the state can no longer be responsible for the      mind and character of your children from the first day of      the coming year all schools will be closed for an      indefinite period fathers see that your boys are trained      to be men mothers see that your daughters are trained to      be women       all schools will shortly be converted either into public      workshops or into gymnasia no child will be admitted into      the workshops under ten years of age active training in      primitive modes of fighting and gymnastics will be      compulsory for all boys over ten years of age       all girls over ten years of age must attend at one domestic      workshop all girls over ten years of age may in addition      attend at one workshop of skilled labor or of technical      industry or of art admission for three months probation       all boys over ten years of age must attend at one workshop      of domestic crafts and at one workshop of skilled labor or      of technical industry or of art a boy may choose with his      parents consent his school of labor or technical industry      or art but the directors reserve the right to transfer him      to a more suitable department if necessary after a three      months probation       it is the intention of this state to form a body of active      energetic citizens the danger of a helpless presumptuous      newspaperreading population is universally recognized       all elementary education is left in the hands of the      parents save such as is necessary to the different branches      of industry       schools of mental culture are free to all individuals over      fourteen years of age       universities are free to all who obtain the first culture      degree  the fact is our process of universal education is today so uncouth so psychologically barbaric that it is the most terrible menace to the existence of our race we seize hold of our children and by parrotcompulsion we force into them a set of mental tricks by unnatural and unhealthy compulsion we force them into a certain amount of cerebral activity and then after a few years with a certain number of windmills in their heads we turn them loose like so many inferior don quixotes to make a mess of life all that they have learnt in their heads has no reference at all to their dynamic souls the windmills spin and spin in a wind of words dulcinea del toboso beckons round every corner and our nation of inferior quixotes jumps on and off tramcars trains bicycles motorcars buses in one mad chase of the divine dulcinea who is all the time chewing chocolates and feeling very very bored it is no use telling the poor devils to stop they read in the newspapers about more dulcineas and more chivalry due to them and more horrid persons who injure the fair fame of these bored females and round they skelter after their own tails that is when they are not forced to grind out their lives for a wage though work is the only thing that prevents our masses from going quite mad  to tell the truth ideas are the most dangerous germs mankind has ever been injected with they are introduced into the brain by injection in schools and by means of newspapers and then we are done for  an idea which is merely introduced into the brain and started spinning there like some outrageous insect is the cause of all our misery today instead of living from the spontaneous centers we live from the head we chew chew chew at some theory some idea we grind grind grind in our mental consciousness till we are beside ourselves our primary affective centers our centers of spontaneous being are so utterly ground round and automatized that they squeak in all stages of disharmony and incipient collapse we are a peopleand not we aloneof idiots imbeciles and epileptics and we dont even know we are raving  and all is due directly and solely to that hateful germ we call the ideal the ideal is always evil no matter what ideal it be no idea should ever be raised to a governing throne  this does not mean that man should immediately cut off his head and try to develop a pair of eyes in his breasts but it does mean this that an idea is just the final concrete or registered result of living dynamic interchange and reactions that no idea is ever perfectly expressed until its dynamic cause is finished and that to continue to put into dynamic effect an already perfected idea means the nullification of all living activity the substitution of mechanism and all the resultant horrors of ennui ecstasy neurasthenia and a collapsing psyche  the whole tree of our idea of life and living is dead then let us leave off hanging ourselves and our children from its branches like medlars  the idea the actual idea must rise ever fresh ever displaced like the leaves of a tree from out of the quickness of the sap and according to the forever incalculable effluence of the great dynamic centers of life the tree of life is a gay kind of tree that is forever dropping its leaves and budding out afresh quite different ones if the last lot were thistle leaves the next lot may be vine you never can tell with the tree of life  so we come back to that precious child who costs us such a lot of ink by what right i ask you are we going to inject into him our own diseasegerms of ideas and infallible motives by the right of the diseased who want to infect everybody  there are few few people in whom the living impulse and reaction develops and sublimates into mental consciousness there are all kinds of trees in the forest but few of them indeed bear the apples of knowledge the modern world insists however that every individual shall bear the apples of knowledge so we go through the forest of mankind cut back every tree and try to graft it into an appletree a nice wood of monsters we make by so doing  it is not the nature of most men to know and to understand and to reason very far therefore why should they make a pretense of it it is the nature of some few men to reason then let them reason those whose nature it is to be rational will instinctively ask why and wherefore and wrestle with themselves for an answer but why every tom dick and harry should have the why and wherefore of the universe rammed into him and should be allowed to draw the conclusion hence that he is the ideal person and responsible for the universe i dont know it is a lie anywayfor neither the whys nor the wherefores are his own and he is but a parrot with his nut of a universe  why should we cram the mind of a child with facts that have nothing to do with his own experiences and have no relation to his own dynamic activity let us realize that every extraneous idea effectually introduced into a mans mind is a direct obstruction of his dynamic activity every idea which is introduced from outside into a mans mind and which does not correspond to his own dynamic nature is a fatal stumblingblock for that man is a cause of arrest for his true individual activity and a derangement to his psychic being  for instance if i teach a man the idea that all men are equal now this idea has no foundation in experience but is logically deduced from certain ethical or philosophic principles but there is a disease of idealism in the world and we all are born with it particularly teachers are born with it so they seize on the idea of equality and proceed to instil it with what result your man is no longer a man living his own life from his own spontaneous centers he is a theoretic imbecile trying to frustrate and dislocate all life  it is the death of all life to force a pure idea into practice life must be lived from the deep selfresponsible spontaneous centers of every individual in a vital nonideal circuit of dynamic relation between individuals the passions or desires which are thoughtborn are deadly any particular mode of passion or desire which receives an exclusive ideal sanction at once becomes poisonous  if this is true for men it is much more true for women teach a woman to act from an idea and you destroy her womanhood for ever make a woman selfconscious and her soul is barren as a sandbag why were we driven out of paradise why did we fall into this gnawing disease of unappeasable dissatisfaction not because we sinned ah no all the animals in paradise enjoyed the sensual passion of coition not because we sinned but because we got our sex into our head  when eve ate that particular apple she became aware of her own womanhood mentally and mentally she began to experiment with it she has been experimenting ever since so has man to the rage and horror of both of them  these sexual experiments are really anathema but once a woman is sexually selfconscious what is she to do there it is she is born with the disease of her own selfconsciousness as was her mother before her she is bound to experiment and try one idea after another in the long run always to her own misery she is bound to have fixed one and then another idea of herself herself as woman first she is the noble spouse of a notquitesonoble male then a mater dolorosa then a ministering angel then a competent social unit a member of parliament or a lady doctor or a platform speaker and all the while as a side show she is the isolde of some tristan or the guinevere of some lancelot or the fata morgana of all menin her own idea she cant stop having an idea of herself she cant get herself out of her own head and there she is functioning away from her own head and her own consciousness of herself and her own automatic selfwill till the whole man and woman game has become just a hell and men with any backbone would rather kill themselves than go on with itor kill somebody else  yet we are going to inculcate more and more selfconsciousness teach every little mary to be more and more a nice little mary out of her own head and every little joseph to theorize himself up to the scratch  and the point lies here there will have to come an end every race which has become selfconscious and ideabound in the past has perished and then it has all started afresh in a different way with another race and man has never learnt any better we are really far far more lifestupid than the dead greeks or the lost etruscans our day is pretty short and closing fast we can pass and another race can follow later  but there is another alternative we still have in us the power to discriminate between our own idealism our own selfconscious will and that other reality our own true spontaneous self certainly we are so overloaded and diseased with ideas that we cant get well in a minute but we can set our faces stubbornly against the disease once we recognize it the disease of love the disease of spirit the disease of niceness and benevolence and feeling good on our own behalf and good on somebody elses behalf pah it is all a gangrene we can retreat upon the proud isolate self and remain there alone like lepers till we are cured of this ghastly white disease of selfconscious idealism  and we really can make a move on our childrens behalf we really can refrain from thrusting our children any more into those hotbeds of the selfconscious disease schools we really can prevent their eating much more of the tissues of leprosy newspapers and books for a time there should be no compulsory teaching to read and write at all the great mass of humanity should never learn to read and writenever  and instead of this gnawing gnawing disease of mental consciousness and awful unhealthy craving for stimulus and for action we must substitute genuine action the war was really not a bad beginning but we went out under the banners of idealism and now the men are home again the virus is more active than ever rotting their very souls  the mass of the people will never mentally understand but they will soon instinctively fall into line  let us substitute action all kinds of action for the mass of people in place of mental activity even twelve hours work a day is better than a newspaper at four in the afternoon and a grievance for the rest of the evening but particularly let us take care of the children at all cost try to prevent a girls mind from dwelling on herself make her act work play assume a rule over her girlhood let her learn the domestic arts in their perfection let us even artificially set her to spin and weave anything to keep her busy to prevent her reading and becoming selfconscious let us awake as soon as possible to the repulsive machine quality of machinemade things they smell of death and let us insist that the home is sacred the hearth and the very things of the home then keep the girls apart from any familiarity or being pals with the boys the nice clean intimacy which we now so admire between the sexes is sterilizing it makes neuters later on no deep magical sexlife is possible  the same with the boys first and foremost establish a rule over them a proud harsh manly rule make them know that at every moment they are in the shadow of a proud strong adult authority let them be soldiers but as individuals not machine units there are wars in the future great wars which not machines will finally decide but the free indomitable life spirit no more wars under the banners of the ideal and in the spirit of sacrifice but wars in the strength of individual men and then pure individualistic training to fight and preparation for a whole new way of life a new society put money into its place and science and industry the leaders must stand for life and they must not ask the simple followers to point out the direction when the leaders assume responsibility they relieve the followers forever of the burden of finding a way relieved of this hateful incubus of responsibility for general affairs the populace can again become free and happy and spontaneous leaving matters to their superiors no newspapersthe mass of the people never learning to read the evolving once more of the great spontaneous gestures of life  we cant go on as we are poor nerveworn creatures fretting our lives away and hating to die because we have never lived the secret is to commit into the hands of the sacred few the responsibility which now lies like torture on the mass let the few the leaders be increasingly responsible for the whole and let the mass be free free save for the choice of leaders  leadersthis is what mankind is craving for  but men must be prepared to obey body and soul once they have chosen the leader and let them choose the leader for lifes sake only  begin thenthere is a beginning     chapter viii  education and sex in man woman and child   the one thing we have to avoid then even while we carry on our own old process of education is this development of the powers of socalled selfexpression in a child let us beware of artificially stimulating his selfconsciousness and his socalled imagination all that we do is to pervert the child into a ghastly state of selfconsciousness making him affectedly try to show off as we wish him to show off the moment the least little trace of selfconsciousness enters in a child goodby to everything except falsity  much better just pound away at the abc and simple arithmetic and so on the modern methods do make children sharp give them a sort of slick finesse but it is the beginning of the mischief it ends in the great unrest of a nervous hysterical proletariat begin to teach a child of five to understand to understand the sun and moon and daisy and the secrets of procreation bless your soul understanding all the wayand when the child is twenty hell have a hysterical understanding of his own invented grievance and theres an end of him understanding is the devil  a child mustnt understand things he must have them his own way his vision isnt ours when a boy of eight sees a horse he doesnt see the correct biological object we intend him to see he sees a big living presence of no particular shape with hair dangling from its neck and four legs if he puts two eyes in the profile he is quite right because he does not see with optical photographic vision the image on his retina is not the image of his consciousness the image on his retina just does not go into him his unconsciousness is filled with a strong dark vague prescience of a powerful presence a twoeyed fourlegged longmaned presence looming imminent  and to force the boy to see a correct oneeyed horseprofile is just like pasting a placard in front of his vision it simply kills his inward seeing we dont want him to see a proper horse the child is not a little camera he is a small vital organism which has direct dynamic rapport with the objects of the outer universe he perceives from his breast and his abdomen with deepsunken realism the elemental nature of the creature so that to this day a noahs ark tree is more real than a corot tree or a constable tree and a flat noahs ark cow has a deeper vital reality than even a cuyp cow  the mode of vision is not one and final the mode of vision is manifold and the optical image is a mere vibrating blur to a childand indeed to a passionate adult in this vibrating blur the soul sees its own true correspondent it sees in a cow horns and squareness and a long tail it sees for a horse a mane and a long face round nose and four legs and in each case a darkly vital presence now horns and squareness and a long thin oxtail these are the fearful and wonderful elements of the cowform which the dynamic soul perfectly perceives the idealimage is just outside nature for a childsomething false in a picture a child wants elemental recognition and not correctness or expression or least of all what we call understanding the child distorts inevitably and dynamically but the dynamic abstraction is more than mental if a huge eye sits in the middle of the cheek in a childs drawing this shows that the deep dynamic consciousness of the eye its relative exaggeration is the lifetruth even if it is a scientific falsehood  on the other hand what on earth is the good of saying to a child the world is a flattened sphere like an orange it is simply pernicious you had much better say the world is a poached egg in a frying pan that might have some dynamic meaning the only thing about the flattened orange is that the child just sees this orange disporting itself in blue air and never bothers to associate it with the earth he treads on and yet it would be so much better for the mass of mankind if they never heard of the flattened sphere they should never be told that the earth is round it only makes everything unreal to them they are balked in their impression of the flat good earth they cant get over this sphere business they live in a fog of abstraction and nothing is anything save for purposes of abstraction the earth is a great plain with hills and valleys why force abstractions and kill the reality when theres no need  as for children will we never realize that their abstractions are never based on observations but on subjective exaggerations if there is an eye in the face the face is all eye it is the child soul which cannot get over the mystery of the eye if there is a tree in a landscape the landscape is all tree always this partial focus the attempt to make a child focus for a whole viewwhich is really a generalization and an adult abstractionis simply wicked yet the first thing we do is to set a child making reliefmaps in clay for example of his own district imbecility he has not even the faintest impression of the total hill on which his home stands a steepness going up to a doorand front garden railingsand perhaps windows thats the lot  the top and bottom of it is that it is a crime to teach a child anything at all schoolwise it is just evil to collect children together and teach them through the head it causes absolute starvation in the dynamic centers and sterile substitute of brain knowledge is all the gain the children of the middle classes are so vitally impoverished that the miracle is they continue to exist at all the children of the lower classes do better because they escape into the streets but even the children of the proletariat are now infected  and of course as my critics point out under all the schoolsmarm and newspapercant man is today as savage as a cannibal and more dangerous the living dynamic self is denaturalized instead of being educated  we talk about educationleading forth the natural intelligence of a child but ours is just the opposite of leading forth it is a ramming in of brain facts through the head and a consequent distortion suffocation and starvation of the primary centers of consciousness a nice day of reckoning weve got in front of us  let us lead forth by all means but let us not have mental knowledge before us as the goal of the leading much less let us make of it a vicious circle in which we lead the unhappy childmind like a cow in a ring at a fair we dont want to educate children so that they may understand understanding is a fallacy and a vice in most people i dont even want my child to know much less to understand i dont want my child to know that five fives are twentyfive any more than i want my child to wear my hat or my boots i dont want my child to know if he wants five fives let him count them on his fingers as for his little mind give it a rest and let his dynamic self be alert he will ask why often enough but he more often asks why the sun shines or why men have mustaches or why grass is green than anything sensible most of a childs questions are and should be unanswerable they are not questions at all they are exclamations of wonder they are remarks halfsceptically addressed when a child says why is grass green he half implies is it really green or is it just taking me in and we solemnly begin to prate about chlorophyll oh imbeciles idiots inexcusable owls  the whole of a childs development goes on from the great dynamic centers and is basically nonmental to introduce mental activity is to arrest the dynamic activity and stultify true dynamic development by the age of twentyone our young people are helpless hopeless selfless floundering mental entities with nothing in front of them because they have been starved from the roots systematically for twentyone years and fed through the head they have had all their mental excitements sex and everything all through the head and when it comes to the actual thing why theres nothing in it blas√© the affective centers have been exhausted from the head  before the age of fourteen children should be taught only to move to act to do and they should be taught as little as possible even of this adults simply cannot and do not know any more what the mode of childish intelligence is adults always interfere they always force the adult mental mode therefore children must be preserved from adult instructions  make a child workyes make it do little jobs keep a fine and delicate and fierce discipline so that the little jobs are performed as perfectly as is consistent with the childs nature make the child alert proud and becoming in its movements make it know very definitely that it shall not and must not trespass on other peoples privacy or patience teach it songs tell it tales but never instruct it schoolwise and mostly leave it alone send it away to be with other children and to get in and out of mischief and in and out of danger forget your child altogether as much as possible  all this is the active and strenuous business of parents and must not be shelved off on to strangers it is the business of parents mentally to forget but dynamically never to forsake their children  it is no use expecting parents to know why schools are closed and why they the parents must be quite responsible for their own children during the first ten years if it is quite useless to expect parents to understand a theory of relativity much less will they understand the development of the dynamic consciousness but why should they understand it is the business of very few to understand and for the mass it is their business to believe and not to bother but to be honorable and humanly to fulfill their human responsibilities to give active obedience to their leaders and to possess their own souls in natural pride  some must understand why a child is not to be mentally educated some must have a faint inkling of the processes of consciousness during the first fourteen years some must know what a child beholds when it looks at a horse and what it means when it says why is grass green the answer to this question by the way is because it is  the interplay of the four dynamic centers follows no one conceivable law mental activity continues according to a law of corelation but there is no logical or rational corelation in the dynamic consciousness it pulses on inconsequential and it would be impossible to determine any sequence out of the very lack of sequence in dynamic consciousness does the individual himself develop the dynamic abstraction of a childs precepts follows no mental law and even no law which can ever be mentally propounded and this is why it is utterly pernicious to set a child making a clay reliefmap of its own district or to ask a child to draw conclusions from given observations dynamically a child draws no conclusions all things still remain dynamically possible a conclusion drawn is a nail in the coffin of a childs developing being let a child make a clay landscape if it likes but entirely according to its own fancy and without conclusions drawn only let the landscape be vividly madealways the discipline of the souls full attention oh but where are the factory chimneysor elsewhy have you left out the gasworks or do you call that sloppy thing a church the particular focus should be vivid and the record in some way true the soul must give earnest attention that is all  and so actively disciplined the child develops for the first ten years we need not be afraid of letting children see the passions and reactions of adult life only we must not strain the sympathies of a child in any direction particularly the direction of love and pity nor must we introduce the fallacy of right and wrong spontaneous distaste should take the place of right and wrong and least of all must there be a cry you see dear you dont understand when you are older a childs sagacity is better than an adult understanding anyhow  of course it is ten times criminal to tell young children facts about sex or to implicate them in adult relationships a child has a strong evanescent sex consciousness it instinctively writes impossible words on back walls but this is not a fully conscious mental act it is a kind of dream actquite natural the childs curious shadowy indecent sexknowledge is quite in the course of nature and does nobody any harm at all adults had far better not notice it but if a child sees a cockerel tread a hen or two dogs coupling well and good it should see these things only without comment let nothing be exaggeratedly hidden by instinct let us preserve the decent privacies but if a child occasionally sees its parent nude taking a bath all the better or even sitting in the w c exaggerated secrecy is bad but indecent exposure is also very bad but worst of all is dragging in the mental consciousness of these shadowy dynamic realities  in the same way to talk to a child about an adult is vile let adults keep their adult feelings and communications for people of their own age but if a child sees its parents violently quarrel all the better there must be storms and a childs dynamic understanding is far deeper and more penetrating than our sophisticated interpretation but never make a child a party to adult affairs never drag the child in refuse its sympathy on such occasions always treat it as if it had no business to hear even if it is present and must hear truly it has no business mentally to hear and the dynamic soul will always weigh things up and dispose of them properly if there be no interference of adult comment or adult desire for sympathy it is despicable for any one parent to accept a childs sympathy against the other parent and the one who received the sympathy is always more contemptible than the one who is hated  of course so many children are born today unnaturally mentally awake and alive to adult affairs that there is nothing left but to tell them everything crudely or else much better to say ah get out you know too much you make me sick  to return to the question of sex a child is born sexed a child is either male or female in the whole of its psyche and physique is either male or female every single living cell is either male or female and will remain either male or female as long as life lasts and every single cell in every male child is male and every cell in every female child is female the talk about a third sex or about the indeterminate sex is just to pervert the issue  biologically it is true the rudimentary formation of both sexes is found in every individual that doesnt mean that every individual is a bit of both or either ad lib after a sufficient period of idealism men become hopelessly selfconscious that is the great affective centers no longer act spontaneously but always wait for control from the head this always breeds a great fluster in the psyche and the poor selfconscious individual cannot help posing and posturing our ideal has taught us to be gentle and wistful rather girlish and yielding and very yielding in our sympathies in fact many young men feel so very like what they imagine a girl must feel that hence they draw the conclusion that they must have a large share of female sex inside them false conclusion  these girlish men have often today the finest maleness once it is put to the test how is it then that they feel and look so girlish it is largely a question of the direction of the polarized flow our ideal has taught us to be so loving and so submissive and so yielding in our sympathy that the mode has become automatic in many men now in what we will call the natural mode man has his positivity in the volitional centers and women in the sympathetic in fulfilling the christian love ideal however men have reversed this man has assumed the gentle allsympathetic r√¥le and woman has become the energetic party with the authority in her hands the male is the sensitive sympathetic nature the woman the active effective authoritative so that the male acts as the passive or recipient pole of attraction the female as the active positive exertive pole in human relations which is a reversal of the old flow the woman is now the initiator man the responder they seem to play each others parts but man is purely male playing womans part and woman is purely female however manly the gulf between heliogabalus or the most womanly man on earth and the most manly woman is just the same as ever just the same old gulf between the sexes the man is male the woman is female only they are playing one anothers parts as they must at certain periods the dynamic polarity has swung around  if we look a little closer we can define this positive and negative business better as a matter of fact positive and negative passive and active cuts both ways if the man as thinker and doer is active or positive and the woman negative then on the other hand as the initiator of emotion of feeling and of sympathetic understanding the woman is positive the man negative the man may be the initiator in action but the woman is initiator in emotion the man has the initiative as far as voluntary activity goes and the woman the initiative as far as sympathetic activity goes in love it is the woman naturally who loves the man who is loved in love woman is the positive man the negative it is woman who asks in love and man who answers in life the reverse is the case in knowing and in doing man is positive and woman negative man initiates and woman lives up to it  naturally this nicely arranged order of things may be reversed action and utterance which are male are polarized against feeling emotion which are female and which is positive which negative was man the eternal protagonist born of woman from her womb of fathomless emotion or was woman with her deep womb of emotion born from the rib of active man the first created man the doer the knower the original in being is he lord of life or is woman the great mother who bore us from the womb of love is she the supreme goddess  this is the question of all time and as long as man and woman endure so will the answer be given first one way then the other man as the utterer usually claims that eve was created out of his spare rib from the field of the creative upper dynamic consciousness that is but woman as soon as she gets a word in points to the fact that man inevitably poor darling is the issue of his mothers womb so the battle rages  but some men always agree with the woman some men always yield to woman the creative positivity and in certain periods such as the present the majority of men concur in regarding woman as the source of life the first term in creation woman the mother the prime being  and then the whole polarity shifts over man still remains the doer and thinker but he is so only in the service of emotional and procreative woman his highest moment is now the emotional moment when he gives himself up to the woman when he forms the perfect answer for her great emotional and procreative asking all his thinking all his activity in the world only contributes to this great moment when he is fulfilled in the emotional passion of the woman the birth of rebirth as whitman calls it in his consummation in the emotional passion of a woman man is reborn which is quite true  and there is the point at which we all now stick life thought and activity all are devoted truly to the great end of woman wife and mother  man has now entered on to his negative mode now his consummation is in feeling not in action now his activity is all of the domestic order and all his thought goes to proving that nothing matters except that birth shall continue and woman shall rock in the nest of this globe like a bird who covers her eggs in some tall tree man is the fetcher the carrier the sacrifice the crucified and the reborn of woman  this being so the whole tendency of his nature changes instead of being assertive and rather insentient he becomes wavering and sensitive he begins to have as many feelingsnay more than a woman his heroism is all in altruistic endurance he worships pity and tenderness and weakness even in himself in short he takes on very largely the original r√¥le of woman woman meanwhile becomes the fearless inwardly relentless determined positive party she grips the responsibility the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world nay she makes man discover that cradles should not be rocked in order that her hands may be left free she is now a queen of the earth and inwardly a fearsome tyrant she keeps pity and tenderness emblazoned on her banners but god help the man whom she pities ultimately she tears him to bits  therefore we see the reversal of the old poles man becomes the emotional party woman the positive and active man begins to show strong signs of the peculiarly strong passive sex desire the desire to be taken which is considered characteristic of woman man begins to have all the feelings of womanor all the feelings which he attributed to woman he becomes more feminine than woman ever was and worships his own femininity calling it the highest in short he begins to exhibit all signs of sexual complexity he begins to imagine he really is half female and certainly woman seems very male so the hermaphrodite fallacy revives again  but it is all a fallacy man in the midst of all his effeminacy is still male and nothing but male and woman though she harangue in parliament or patrol the streets with a helmet on her head is still completely female they are only playing each others r√¥les because the poles have swung into reversion the compass is reversed but that doesnt mean that the north pole has become the south pole or that each is a bit of both  of course a woman should stick to her own natural emotional positivity but then man must stick to his own positivity of being of action disinterested nondomestic male action which is not devoted to the increase of the female once man vacates his camp of sincere passionate positivity in disinterested being his supreme responsibility to fulfill his own profoundest impulses with reference to none but god or his own soul not taking woman into count at all in this primary responsibility to his own deepest soul once man vacates this strong citadel of his own genuine not spurious divinity then in comes woman picks up the scepter and begins to conduct a ragtime band  man remains man however he may put on wistfulness and tenderness like petticoats and sensibilities like pearl ornaments your sensitive little bigeyed boy so much more gentle and loving than his harder sister is male for all that believe me perhaps evilly male so mothers may learn to their cost and wives still more  of course there should be a great balance between the sexes man in the daytime must follow his own souls greatest impulse and give himself to lifework and risk himself to death it is not woman who claims the highest in man it is a mans own religious soul that drives him on beyond woman to his supreme activity for his highest man is responsible to god alone he may not pause to remember that he has a life to lose or a wife and children to leave he must carry forward the banner of life though seven worlds perish with all the wives and mothers and children in them hence jesus woman what have i to do with thee every man that lives has to say it again to his wife or mother once he has any work or mission in hand that comes from his soul  but again no man is a blooming marvel for twentyfour hours a day jesus or napoleon or any other of them ought to have been man enough to be able to come home at teatime and put his slippers on and sit under the spell of his wife for there you are the woman has her world her positivity the world of love of emotion of sympathy and it behooves every man in his hour to take off his shoes and relax and give himself up to his woman and her world not to give up his purpose but to give up himself for a time to her who is his mateand so it is one detests the clockwork kant and the petitbourgeois napoleon divorcing his josephine for a hapsburgor even jesus with his woman what have i to do with theehe might have added just nowthey were all failures     chapter ix  the birth of sex   the last chapter was a chapter of semidigression we now return to the straight course is the straightness none too evident ah well its a matter of relativity a child is born with one sex only and remains always single in his sex there is no intermingling only a great change of r√¥les is possible but man in the female r√¥le is still male  sexthat is to say maleness and femalenessis present from the moment of birth and in every act or deed of every child but sex in the real sense of dynamic sexual relationship this does not exist in a child and cannot exist until puberty and after true children have a sort of sex consciousness little boys and little girls may even commit indecencies together and still it is nothing vital it is a sort of shadow activity a sort of dreamactivity it has no very profound effect  but still boys and girls should be kept apart as much as possible that they may have some sort of respect and fear for the gulf that lies between them in nature and for the great strangeness which each has to offer the other finally we are all wrong when we say there is no vital difference between the sexes there is every difference every bit every cell in a boy is male every cell is female in a woman and must remain so women can never feel or know as men do and in the reverse men can never feel and know dynamically as women do man acting in the passive or feminine polarity is still man and he doesnt have one single unmanly feeling and women when they speak and write utter not one single word that men have not taught them men learn their feelings from women women learn their mental consciousness from men and so it will ever be meanwhile women live forever by feeling and men live forever from an inherent sense of purpose feeling is an end in itself this is unspeakable truth to a woman and never true for one minute to a man when man in the epicurean spirit embraces feeling he makes himself a martyr to itlike maupassant or oscar wilde woman will never understand the depth of the spirit of purpose in man his deeper spirit and man will never understand the sacredness of feeling to woman each will play at the others game but they will remain apart  the whole mode the whole everything is really different in man and woman therefore we should keep boys and girls apart that they are pure and virgin in themselves on mixing with one another in becoming familiar in being pals they lose their own male and female integrity and they lose the treasure of the future the vital sex polarity the dynamic magic of life for the magic and the dynamism rests on otherness  for actual sex is a vital polarity and a polarity which rouses into action as we know at puberty  and how as we know a child lives from the great field of dynamic consciousness established between the four poles of the dynamic psyche two great poles of sympathy two great poles of will the solar plexus and the lumbar ganglion great nervecenters below the diaphragm act as the dynamic origin of all consciousness in man and are immediately polarized by the other two nervecenters the cardiac plexus and the thoracic ganglion above the diaphragm at these four poles the whole flow both within the individual and from without him of dynamic consciousness and dynamic creative relationship is centered these four first poles constitute the first field of dynamic consciousness for the first twelve or fourteen years of the life of every child  and then a change takes place it takes place slowly gradually and inevitably utterly beyond our provision or control the living soul is unfolding itself in another great metamorphosis  what happens in the biological psyche is that deeper centers of consciousness and function come awake deep in the lower body the great sympathetic center the hypogastric plexus has been acting all the time in a kind of dreamautomatism balanced by its corresponding voluntary center the sacral ganglion at the age of twelve these two centers begin slowly to rumble awake with a deep reverberant force that changes the whole constitution of the life of the individual  and as these two centers the sympathetic center of the deeper abdomen and the voluntary center of the loins gradually sparkle into wakeful conscious activity their corresponding poles are roused in the upper body in the region of the throat and neck the socalled cervical plexuses and the cervical ganglia dawn into activity  we have now another field of dawning dynamic consciousness that will extend far beyond the first and now various things happen to us first of all actual sex establishes its strange and troublesome presence within us this is the massive wakening of the lower body and then in the upper body the breasts of a woman begin to develop her throat changes its form and in the man the voice breaks the beard begins to grow round the lips and on to the throat there are the obvious physiological changes resulting from the gradual bursting into free activity of the hypogastric plexus and the sacral ganglion in the lower body and of the cervical plexuses and ganglia of the neck in the upper body  why the growth of hair should start at the lower and upper sympathetic regions we cannot say perhaps for protection perhaps to preserve these powerful yet supersensitive nodes from the inclemency of changes in temperature which might cause a derangement perhaps for the sake of protective warning as hair warns when it is touched perhaps for a screen against various dynamic vibrations and as a receiver of other suited dynamic vibrations it may be that even the hair of the head acts as a sensitive vibrationmedium for conveying currents of physical and vitalistic activity to and from the brain and perhaps from the centers of intense vital surcharge hair springs as a sort of annunciation or declaration like a crest of lifeassertion perhaps all these things and perhaps others  but with the bursting awake of the four new poles of dynamic consciousness and being change takes place in everything the features now begin to take individual form the limbs develop out of the soft round matrix of childform the body resolves itself into distinctions a strange creative change in being has taken place the child before puberty is quite another thing from the child after puberty strange indeed is this new birth this rising from the sea of childhood into a new being it is a resurrection which we fear  and now a new world a new heaven and a new earth now new relationships are formed the old ones retire from their prominence now mother and father inevitably give way before masters and mistresses brothers and sisters yield to friends this is the period of schw√§rmerei of young adoration and of real initial friendships a child before puberty has playmates after puberty he has friends and enemies  a whole new field of passional relationship and the old bonds relaxing the old love retreating the father and mother bonds now relax though they never break the family love wanes though it never dies  it is the hour of the stranger let the stranger now enter the soul  and it is the first hour of true individuality the first hour of genuine responsible solitariness a child knows the abyss of forlornness but an adolescent alone knows the strange pain of growing into his own isolation of individuality  all this change is an agony and a bliss it is a cataclysm and a new world it is our most serious hour perhaps and yet we cannot be responsible for it  now sex comes into active being until puberty sex is submerged nascent incipient only after puberty it is a tremendous factor  what is sex really we can never say satisfactorily but we know so much we know that it is a dynamic polarity between human beings and a circuit of force always flowing the psychoanalyst is right so far there can be no vivid relation between two adult individuals which does not consist in a dynamic polarized flow of vitalistic force or magnetism or electricity call it what you will between these two people yet is this dynamic flow inevitably sexual in nature  this is the moot point for psychoanalysis but let us look at sex in its obvious manifestation the sexual relation between man and woman consummates in the act of coition now what is the act of coition we know its functional purpose of procreation but after all our experience and all our poetry and novels we know that the procreative purpose of sex is to the individual man and woman just a sideshow to the individual the act of coition is a great psychic experience a vital experience of tremendous importance on this vital individual experience the life and very being of the individual largely depends  but what is the experience untellable only we know something we know that in the act of coition the blood of the individual man acutely surcharged with intense vital electricitywe know no word so say electricity by analogyrises to a culmination in a tremendous magnetic urge towards the magnetic blood of the female the whole of the living blood in the two individuals forms a field of intense polarized magnetic attraction so the two poles must be brought into contact in the act of coition the two seas of blood in the two individuals rocking and surging towards contact as near as possible clash into a oneness a great flash of interchange occurs like an electric spark when two currents meet or like lightning out of the densely surcharged clouds there is a lightning flash which passes through the blood of both individuals there is a thunder of sensation which rolls in diminishing crashes down the nerves of eachand then the tension passes  the two individuals are separate again but are they as they were before is the air the same after a thunderstorm as before no the air is as it were new fresh tingling with newness so is the blood of man and woman after successful coition after a false coition like prostitution there is not newness but a certain disintegration  but after coition the actual chemical constitution of the blood is so changed that usually sleep intervenes to allow the time for chemical biological readjustment through the whole system  so the blood is changed and renewed refreshed almost recreated like the atmosphere after thunder out of the newness of the living blood pass the new strange waves which beat upon the great dynamic centers of the nerves primarily upon the hypogastric plexus and the sacral ganglion from these centers rise new impulses new vision new being rising like aphrodite from the foam of the new tide of blood and so individual life goes on  perhaps then we will allow ourselves to say what in psychic individual reality is the act of coition it is the bringing together of the surcharged electric blood of the male with the polarized electric blood of the female with the result of a tremendous flashing interchange which alters the constitution of the blood and the very quality of being in both  and this surely is sex but is this the whole of sex that is the question  after coition we say the blood is renewed we say that from the new finely sparkling blood new thrills pass into the great affective centers of the lower body new thrills of feeling of impulse of energyand what about these new thrills  now a new story the new thrills are passed on to the great upper centers of the dynamic body the individual polarity now changes within the individual system the upper centers cardiac plexus and cervical plexuses thoracic ganglion and cervical ganglia now assume positivity these the upper polarized centers have now the positive r√¥le to play the solar and the hypogastric plexuses the lumbar and the sacral ganglia these have the submissive negative r√¥le for the time being  and what then what now that the upper centers are finely active in positivity now it is a different story now there is new vision in the eyes new hearing in the ears new voice in the throat and speech on the lips now the new song rises the brain tingles to new thought the heart craves for new activity  the heart craves for new activity for new collective activity that is for a new polarized connection with other beings other men  is this new craving for polarized communion with others this craving for a new unison is it sexual like the original craving for the woman not at all the whole polarity is different now the positive poles are the poles of the breast and shoulders and throat the poles of activity and full consciousness men being themselves made new after the act of coition wish to make the world new a new passionate polarity springs up between men who are bent on the same activity the polarity between man and woman sinks to passivity it is now daytime and time to forget sex time to be busy making a new world  is this new polarity this new circuit of passion between comrades and coworkers is this also sexual it is a vivid circuit of polarized passion is it hence sex  it is not because what are the poles of positive connectionthe upper busy poles what is the dynamic contacta unison in spirit in understanding and a pure commingling in one great work a mingling of the individual passion into one great purpose now this is also a grand consummation for men this mingling of many with one great impassioned purpose but is this sex knowing what sex is can we call this other also sex we cannot  this meeting of many in one great passionate purpose is not sex and should never be confused with sex it is a great motion in the opposite direction and i am sure that the ultimate greatest desire in men is this desire for great purposive activity when man loses his deep sense of purposive creative activity he feels lost and is lost when he makes the sexual consummation the supreme consummation even in his secret soul he falls into the beginnings of despair when he makes woman or the woman and child the great center of life and of lifesignificance he falls into the beginnings of despair  man must bravely stand by his own soul his own responsibility as the creative vanguard of life and he must also have the courage to go home to his woman and become a perfect answer to her deep sexual call but he must never confuse his two issues primarily and supremely man is always the pioneer of life adventuring onward into the unknown alone with his own temerarious dauntless soul woman for him exists only in the twilight by the camp fire when day has departed evening and the night are hers  the psychoanalysts driving us back to the sexual consummation always do us infinite damage  we have to break away back to the great unison of manhood in some passionate purpose now this is not like sex sex is always individual a man has his own sex nobody elses and sexually he goes as a single individual he can mingle only singly so that to make sex a general affair is just a perversion and a lie you cant get people and talk to them about their sex as if it were a common interest  we have got to get back to the great purpose of manhood a passionate unison in actively making a world this is a real commingling of many and in such a commingling we forfeit the individual in the commingling of sex we are alone with one partner it is an individual affair there is no superior or inferior but in the commingling of a passionate purpose each individual sacredly abandons his individual in the living faith of his soul he surrenders his individuality to the great urge which is upon him he may have to surrender his name his fame his fortune his life everything but once a man in the integrity of his own individual soul believes he surrenders his own individuality to his belief and becomes one of a united body he knows what he does he makes the surrender honorably in agreement with his own souls deepest desire but he surrenders and remains responsible for the purity of his surrender  but what if he believes that his sexual consummation is his supreme consummation then he serves the great purpose to which he pledges himself only as long as it pleases him after which he turns it down and goes back to sex with sex as the one accepted prime motive the world drifts into despair and anarchy  of all countries america has most to fear from anarchy even from one single moments lapse into anarchy the old nations are organically fixed into classes but america not you can shake europe to atoms and yet peasants fall back to peasantry artisans to industrial labor upper classes to their controlinevitably but can you say the same of america  america must not lapse for one single moment into anarchy it would be the end of her she must drift no nearer to anarchy she is near enough  well then americans must make a choice it is a choice between belief in mans creative spontaneous soul and mans automatic power of production and reproduction it is a choice between serving man or woman it is a choice between yielding the soul to a leader leaders or yielding only to the woman wife mistress or mother  the great collective passion of belief which brings men together comrades and coworkers passionately obeying their soulchosen leader or leaders this is not a sex passion not in any sense sex holds any two people together but it tends to disintegrate society unless it is subordinated to the great dominating male passion of collective purpose  but when the sex passion submits to the great purposive passion then you have fulness and no great purposive passion can endure long unless it is established upon the fulfillment in the vast majority of individuals of the true sexual passion no great motive or ideal or social principle can endure for any length of time unless based upon the sexual fulfillment of the vast majority of individuals concerned  it cuts both ways assert sex as the predominant fulfillment and you get the collapse of living purpose in man you get anarchy assert purposiveness as the one supreme and pure activity of life and you drift into barren sterility like our business life of today and our political life you become sterile you make anarchy inevitable and so there you are you have got to base your great purposive activity upon the intense sexual fulfillment of all your individuals that was how egypt endured but you have got to keep your sexual fulfillment even then subordinate just subordinate to the great passion of purpose subordinate by a hairs breadth only but still by that hairs breadth subordinate  perhaps we can see now a little betterto go back to the childwhere freud is wrong in attributing a sexual motive to all human activity it is obvious there is no real sexual motive in a child for example the great sexual centers are not even awake true even in a child of three rudimentary sex throws strange shadows on the wall in its approach from the distance but these are only an uneasy intrusion from the asyetuncreated unready biological centers the great sexual centers of the hypogastric plexus and the immensely powerful sacral ganglion are slowly prepared developed in a kind of prenatal gestation during childhood before puberty but even an unborn child kicks in the womb so do the great sexcenters give occasional blind kicks in a child it is part of the phenomenon of childhood but we must be most careful not to charge these rather unpleasant apparitions or phenomena against the individual boy or girl we must be very careful not to drag the matter into mental consciousness shoo it away reprimand it with a pah and a faugh and a bit of contempt but do not get into any heat or any fear do not startle a passional attention drive the whole thing away like the shadow it is and be very careful not to drive it into the consciousness be very careful to plant no seed of burning shame or horror throw over it merely the cold water of contemptuous indifference dismissal  after puberty a child may as well be told the simple and necessary facts of sex as things stand the parent may as well do it but briefly coldly and with as cold a dismissal as possiblelook here youre not a child any more you know it dont you youre going to be a man and you know what that means it means youre going to marry a woman later on and get children you know it and i know it but in the meantime leave yourself alone i know youll have a lot of bother with yourself and your feelings i know what is happening to you and i know you get excited about it but you neednt other men have all gone through it so dont you go creeping off by yourself and doing things on the sly it wont do you any goodi know what youll do because weve all been through it i know the thing will keep coming on you at night but remember that i know remember and remember that i want you to leave yourself alone i know what it is i tell you ive been through it all myself youve got to go through these years before you find a woman you want to marry and whom you can marry i went through them myself and got myself worked up a good deal more than was good for metry to contain yourself always try to contain yourself and be a man thats the only thing always try and be manly and quiet in yourself remember i know what it is ive been the same in the same state that you are in and probably ive behaved more foolishly and perniciously than ever you will so come to me if anything really bothers you and dont feel sly and secret i do know just what youve got and what you havent ive been as bad and perhaps worse than you and the only thing i want of you is to be manly try and be manly and quiet in yourself  that is about as much as a father can say to a boy at puberty you have to be very careful what you do especially if you are a parent to translate sex into mental ideas is vile to make a scientific fact of it is death  as a matter of fact there should be some sort of initiation into true adult consciousness boys should be taken away from their mothers and sisters as much as possible at adolescence they should be given into some real manly charge and there should be some actual initiation into sex life perhaps like the savages who make the boy die again symbolically and pull him forth through some narrow aperture to be born again and make him suffer and endure terrible hardships to make a great dynamic effect on the consciousness a terrible dynamic sense of change in the very being in short a long violent initiation from which the lad emerges emaciated but cut off forever from childhood entered into the serious responsible pale of manhood and with his whole consciousness convulsed by a great change as his dynamic psyche actually is convulsedand something in the same way to initiate girls into womanhood  there should be the intense dynamic reaction the physical suffering and the physical realization sinking deep into the soul changing the soul for ever sex should come upon us as a terrible thing of suffering and privilege and mystery a mysterious metamorphosis come upon us and a new terrible power given us and a new responsibility tellingwhats the good of tellingthe mystery the terror and the tremendous power of sex should never be explained away the mass of mankind should never be acquainted with the scientific biological facts of sex never the mystery must remain in its dark secrecy and its dark powerful dynamism the reality of sex lies in the great dynamic convulsions in the soul and as such it should be realized a great creativeconvulsive seizure upon the soulto make it a matter of testtube mixtures chemical demonstrations and trashy lockandkey symbols is just blasting even more sickening is the line you see dear one day youll love a man as i love daddy more than anything else in the whole world and then dear i hope youll marry him because if you do youll be happy and i want you to be happy my love and so i hope youll marry the man you really love kisses the childand then darling there will come a lot of things you know nothing about now youll want to have a dear little baby wont you darling your own dear little baby and your husbands as well because itll be his too you know that dont you dear it will be born from both of you and you dont know how do you well it will come from right inside you dear out of your own inside you came out of mothers inside etc etc  but i suppose theres really nothing else to be done given the world and society as weve got them now the mother is doing her best  but it is all wrong it is wrong to make sex appear as if it were part of the deardarlinglove smarm the spiritual love it is even worse to take the scientific testtube line it all kills the great effective dynamism of life and substitutes the mere ash of mental ideas and tricks  the scientific fact of sex is no more sex than a skeleton is a man yet youd think twice before you stock a skeleton in front of a lad and said you see my boy this is what you are when you come to know yourselfand the ideal loveydovey explanation of sex as something wonderful and extra loveydovey a billandcoo process of obtaining a sweet little babyor else god made us so that we must do this to bring another dear little baby to lifewell it just makes one sick it is disastrous to the deep sexual life but perhaps that is what we want  when humanity comes to its senses it will realize what a fearful sodom apple our understanding is what terrible mouths and stomachs full of bitter ash weve all got and then we shall take away knowledge and understanding and lock them up along with the rest of poisons to be administered in small doses only by competent people  we have almost poisoned the mass of humanity to death with understanding the period of actual death and raceextermination is not far off we could have produced the same barrenness and frenzy of nothingness in people perhaps by dinning it into them that every man is just a charnelhouse skeleton of unclean bones our understanding our science and idealism have produced in people the same strange frenzy of selfrepulsion as if they saw their own skulls each time they looked in the mirror a man is a thing of scientific causeandeffect and biological process draped in an ideal is he no wonder he sees the skeleton grinning through the flesh  our leaders have not loved men they have loved ideas and have been willing to sacrifice passionate men on the altars of the blooddrinking everashthirsty ideal has president wilson or karl marx or bernard shaw ever felt one hot bloodpulse of love for the working man the halfconscious deluded working man never each of these leaders has wanted to abstract him away from his own blood and being into some foul methuselah or abstraction of a man  and me there is no danger of the working man ever reading my books so i shant hurt him that way but oh i would like to save him alive in his living spontaneous original being i cant help it it is my passionate instinct  i would like him to give me back the responsibility for general affairs a responsibility which he cant acquit and which saps his life i would like him to give me back the responsibility for the future i would like him to give me back the responsibility for thought for direction i wish we could take hope and belief together i would undertake my share of the responsibility if he gave me his belief  i would like him to give me back books and newspapers and theories and i would like to give him back in return his old insouciance and rich original spontaneity and fullness of life     chapter x  parent love   in the serious hour of puberty the individual passes into his second phase of accomplishment but there cannot be a perfect transition unless all the activity is in full play in all the first four poles of the psyche childhood is a chrysalis from which each must extricate himself and the struggling youth or maid cannot emerge unless by the energy of all powers he can never emerge if the whole mass of the world and the tradition of love hold him back  now we come to the greater peril of our particular form of idealism it is the idealism of love and of the spirit the idealism of yearning outgoing love of pure sympathetic communion and understanding and this idealism recognizes as the highest earthly love the love of mother and child  and what does this mean it means for every delicately brought up child indeed for all the children who matter a steady and persistent pressure upon the upper sympathetic centers and a steady and persistent starving of the lower centers particularly the great voluntary center of the lower body the center of sensual manly independence of exultation in the sturdy defiant self willfulness and masterfulness and pride this center is steadily suppressed the warm swift sensual self is steadily and persistently denied damped weakened throughout all the period of childhood and by sensual we do not mean greedy or ugly we mean the deeper more impulsive reckless nature life must be always refined and superior love and happiness must be the watchword the willful critical element of the spiritual mode is never absent the silent if forbearing disapproval and distaste is always ready vile bullying forbearance  with what result the center of upper sympathy is abnormally inflamedly excited and the centers of will are so deranged that they operate in jerks and spasms the true polarity of the sympatheticvoluntary system within the child is so disturbed as to be almost deranged then we have an exaggerated sensitiveness alternating with a sort of helpless fury and we have delicate frail children with nerves or with strange whims and we have the strange cold obstinacy of the spiritual will cold as hell fixed in a child  then one parent usually the mother is the object of blind devotion whilst the other parent usually the father is an object of resistance the child is taught however that both parents should be loved and only loved and that love gentleness pity charity and all higher emotions these alone are genuine feelings all the rest are false to be rejected  with what result the upper centers are developed to a degree of unnatural acuteness and reactionor again they fall numbed and barren and then between parents and children a painfully false relation grows up a relation as of two adults either of two pure lovers or of two loveappearing people who are really trying to bully one another instead of leaving the child with its own limited but deep and incomprehensible feelings the parent hopelessly involved in the sympathetic mode of selfless love and spiritual lovewill stimulates the child into a consciousness which does not belong to it on the one plane and robs it of its own spontaneous consciousness and freedom on the other plane  and this is the fatality long before puberty by an exaggeration and an intensity of spiritual love from the parents the second centers of sympathy are artificially aroused into response and there is an irreparable disaster instead of seeing as a child should see through a glass darkly the child now opens premature eyes of sympathetic cognition instead of knowing in part as it should know it begins at a fearfully small age to know in full the cervical plexuses and the cervical ganglia which should only begin to awake after adolescence these centers of the higher dynamic sympathy and cognition are both artificially stimulated by the adult personal loveemotion and lovewill into response in a quite young child sometimes even in an infant this is a holy obscenity  our particular mode of idealism causes us to suppress as far as possible the sensual centers to make them negative the whole of the activity is concentrated as far as possible in the upper or spiritual centers the centers of the breast and throat which we will call the centers of dynamic cognition in contrast to the centers of sensual comprehension below the diaphragm  and then a child arrives at puberty with its upper nature already roused into precocious action the child nowadays is almost invariably precocious in understanding in the north spiritually precocious so that by the time it arrives at adolescence it already has experienced the extended sympathetic reactions which should have lain utterly dark and it has experienced these extended reactions with whom with the parent or parents  which is man devouring his own offspring for to the parents belongs once and for all the dynamic reaction on the first plane of consciousness only the reaction and relationship at the first four poles of dynamic consciousness when the second the farther plane of consciousness rouses into action the relationship is with strangers all human instinct and all ethnology will prove this to us what sexinstinct there is in a child is always adverse to the parents  but also the parents are all too quick they all proceed to swallow their children before the children can get out of their clutches and even if parents do send away their children at the age of pubertyto school or elsewhereit is not much good the mischief has been done before for the first twelve years the parents and the whole community forcibly insist on the childs living from the upper centers only and particularly the upper sympathetic centers without the balance of the warm deep sensual self parents and community alike insist on rousing an adult sympathetic response and a mental answer in the childschools sundayschools books homeinfluenceall works in this one pernicious way but it is the home the parents that work most effectively and intensely there is the most intimate mesh of love lovebullying and understanding in which a child is entangled  so that a child arrives at the age of puberty already stripped of its childhoods darkness bound and delivered over instead of waking now to a whole new field of consciousness a whole vast and wonderful new dynamic impulse towards new connections it finds itself fatally bound puberty accomplishes itself the hour of sex strikes but there is your child bound helpless you have already aroused in it the dynamic response to your own insatiable lovewill you have already established between your child and yourself the dynamic relation in the further plane of consciousness you have got your child as sure as if you had woven its flesh again with your own you have done what it is vicious for any parent to do you have established between your child and yourself the bond of adult love the love of man for man woman for woman or man for woman all your tenderness your cherishing will not excuse you it only deepens your guilt you have established between your child and yourself the bond of further sympathy i do not speak of sex i speak of pure sympathy sacred love the parents establish between themselves and their child the bond of the higher love the further spiritual love the sympathy of the adult soul  and this is fatal it is a sort of incest it is a dynamic spiritual incest more dangerous than sensual incest because it is more intangible and less instinctively repugnant but let psychoanalysis fall into what discredit it may it has done us this great service of proving to us that the intense upper sympathy indeed the dynamic relation either of lovewill or lovesympathy between parent and child upon the upper plane inevitably involves us in a conclusion of incest  for although it is our aim to establish a purely spiritual dynamic relation on the upper plane only yet because of the inevitable polarity of the human psychic system we shall arouse at the same time a dynamic sensual activity on the lower plane the deeper sensual plane we may be as pure as angels and yet being human this will and must inevitably happen when mrs ruskin said that john ruskin should have married his mother she spoke the truth he was married to his mother for in spite of all our intention all our creed all our purity all our desire and all our will once we arouse the dynamic relation in the upper higher plane of love we inevitably evoke a dynamic consciousness on the lower deeper plane of sensual love and then what  of course parents can reply that their love however intense is pure and has absolutely no sensual element maybeand maybe not but admit that it is so it does not help the intense excitement of the upper centers of sympathy willynilly arouses the lower centers it arouses them to activity even if it denies them any expression or any polarized connection our psyche is so framed that activity aroused on one plane provokes activity on the corresponding plane automatically so the intense pure loverelation between parent and child inevitably arouses the lower centers in the child the centers of sex now the deeper sensual centers once aroused should find response from the sensual body of some other some friend or lover the response is impossible between parent and child myself i believe that biologically there is radical sexaversion between parent and child at the deeper sensual centers the sensual circuit cannot adjust itself spontaneously between the two  so what have you child and parent intensely linked in adult lovesympathy and lovewill on the upper plane and in the child the deeper sensual centers aroused but finding no correspondent no objective no polarized connection with another person there they are the powerful centers of sex acting spasmodically without balance they must be polarized somehow so they are polarized to the active upper centers within the child and you get an introvert  this is how introversion begins the lower sexual centers are aroused they find no sympathy no connection no response from outside no expression they are dynamically polarized by the upper centers within the individual that is the whole of the sexual or deeper sensual flow goes on upwards in the individual to his own upper from his own lower centers the upper centers hold the lower in positive polarity the flow goes on upwards there must be some reaction and so you get first and foremost selfconsciousness an intense consciousness in the upper self of the lower self this is the first disaster then you get the upper body exploiting the lower body you get the hands exploiting the sensual body in feeling fingering and in masturbation you get a pornographic longing with regard to the self you get the obscene post cards which most youths possess you get the absolute lust for dirty stories which so many men have and you get various mild sex perversions such as masturbation and so on  what does all this mean it means that the activity of the lower psyche and lower body is polarized by the upper body eyes and ears want to gather sexual activity and knowledge the mind becomes full of sex and always in an introvert of his own sex if we examine the apparent extroverts like the flaunting italian we shall see the same thing it is his own sex which obsesses him  and today what have we but this almost inevitably we find in a child now an intense precocious secret sexual preoccupation the upper self is rabidly engaged in exploiting the lower self a child and its own roused inflamed sex its own shame and masturbation its own cruel secret sexual excitement and sex curiosity this is the greatest tragedy of our day the child does not so much want to act as to know the thought of actual sex connection is usually repulsive there is an aversion from the normal coition act but the craving to feel to see to taste to know mentally in the head this is insatiable anything so that the sensation and experience shall come through the upper channels this is the secret of our introversion and our perversion today anything rather than spontaneous direct action from the sensual self anything rather than the merely normal passion introduce any trick any idea any mental element you can into sex but make it an affair of the upper consciousness the mind and eyes and mouth and fingers this is our vice our dirt our disease  and the adult and the ideal are to blame but the tragedy of our children in their inflamed solitary sexual excitement distresses us beyond any blame  it is time to drop the word love and more than time to drop the ideal of love every frenzied individual is told to find fulfillment in love so he tries whereas there is no fulfillment in love half of our fulfillment comes through love through strong sensual love but the central fulfillment for a man is that he possess his own soul in strength within him deep and alone the deep rich aloneness reached and perfected through love and the passing beyond any further quest of love  this central fullness of selfpossession is our goal if goal there be any but there are two great ways of fulfillment the first the way of fulfillment through complete love complete passionate deep love and the second the greater the fulfillment through the accomplishment of religious purpose the souls earnest purpose we work the love way falsely from the upper self and work it to death the second way of active unison in strong purpose and in faith this we only sneer at  but to return to the child and the parent the coming to the fulfillment of single aloneness through love is made impossible for us by the ideal the monomania of more love at the very √¢ge dangereuse when a woman should be accomplishing her own fulfillment into maturity and rich quiescence she turns rabidly to seek a new lover at the very crucial time when she should be coming to a state of pure equilibrium and rest with her husband she turns rabidly against rest or peace or equilibrium or husband in any shape or form and demands more love more love a new sort of lover one who will understand her and as often as not she turns to her son  it is true a woman reaches her goal of fulfillment through feeling but through being understood she reaches nowhere unless the lover understands what a vice it is for a woman to get herself and her sex into her head a woman reaches her fulfillment through love deep sensual love and exquisite sensitive communion but once she reaches the point of fulfillment she should not break off to ask for more excitements she should take the beauty of maturity and peace and quiet faithfulness upon her  this she wont do however unless the man her husband goes on beyond her when a man approaches the beginning of maturity and the fulfillment of his individual self about the age of thirtyfive then is not his time to come to rest on the contrary deeply fulfilled through marriage and at one with his own soul he must now undertake the responsibility for the next step into the future he must now give himself perfectly to some further purpose some passionate purposive activity till a man makes the great resolution of aloneness and singleness of being till he takes upon himself the silence and central appeasedness of maturity and then after this assumes a sacred responsibility for the next purposive step into the future there is no rest the great resolution of aloneness and appeasedness and the further deep assumption of responsibility in purposethis is necessary to every parent every father every husband at a certain point if the resolution is never made the responsibility never embraced then the lovecraving will run on into frenzy and lay waste to the family in the woman particularly the lovecraving will run on to frenzy and disaster  seeking seeking the fulfillment in the deep passional self diseased with selfconsciousness and sex in the head foiled by the very loving weakness of the husband who has not the courage to withdraw into his own stillness and singleness and put the wife under the spell of his fulfilled decision the unhappy woman beats about for her insatiable satisfaction seeking whom she may devour and usually she turns to her child here she provokes what she wants here in her own son who belongs to her she seems to find the last perfect response for which she is craving he is a medium to her she provokes from him her own answer so she throws herself into a last great love for her son a final and fatal devotion that which would have been the richness and strength of her husband and is poison to her boy the husband irresolute never accepting his own higher responsibility bows and accepts and the fatal round of introversion and complex starts once more if man will never accept his own ultimate being his final aloneness and his last responsibility for life then he must expect woman to dash from disaster to disaster rootless and uncontrolled  on revient toujours √† son premier amour it sounds like a cynicism today as if we really meant on ne revient jamais √† son premier amour but as a matter of fact a man never leaves his first love once the love is established he may leave his first attempt at love once a man establishes a full dynamic communication at the deeper and the higher centers with a woman this can never be broken but sex in the head breaks down and half circuits break down once the full circuit is established however this can never break down  nowadays alas we start off selfconscious with sex in the head we find a woman who is the same we marry because we are pals the sex is a rather nasty fiasco we keep up a pretense of palsand nice love sex spins wilder in the head than ever there is either a family of children whom the dissatisfied parents can devote themselves to thereby perverting the miserable little creatures or else there is a divorce and at the great dynamic centers nothing has happened at all blank nothing there has been no vital interchange at all in the whole of this beautiful marriage affair  establish between yourself and another individual a dynamic connection at only two of the four further poles and you will have the devil of a job to break the connection especially if it be the first connection you have made especially if the other individual be the first in the field  this is the case of the parents parents are first in the field of the childs further consciousness they are criminal trespassers in that field but that makes no matter they are first in the field they establish a dynamic connection between the two upper centers the centers of the throat the centers of the higher dynamic sympathy and cognition they establish this circuit and break it if you can very often not even death can break it  and as we see the establishment of the upper loveandcognition circuit inevitably provokes the lower sexsensual centers into action even though there be no correspondence on the sensual plane between the two individuals concerned then see what happens if you want to see the real desirable wifespirit look at a mother with her boy of eighteen how she serves him how she stimulates him how her true female self is his is wifesubmissive to him as never never it could be to a husband this is the quiescent flowering love of a mature woman it is the very flower of a womans love sexually asking nothing asking nothing of the beloved save that he shall be himself and that for his living he shall accept the gift of her love this is the perfect flower of married love which a husband should put in his cap as he goes forward into the future in his supreme activity for the husband it is a great pledge and a blossom for the son also it seems wonderful the woman now feels for the first time as a true wife might feel and her feeling is towards her son  or instead of mother and son read father and daughter  and then what the son gets on swimmingly for a time till he is faced with the actual fact of sex necessity he gleefully inherits his adolescence and the world at large without an obstacle in his way mothersupported motherloved everything comes to him in glamour he feels he sees wondrous much understands a whole heaven motherstimulated think of the power which a mature woman thus infuses into her boy he flares up like a flame in oxygen no wonder they say geniuses mostly have great mothers they mostly have sad fates  and thenand then with this glamorous youth what is he actually to do with his sensual sexual self bury it or make an effort with a stranger for he is taught even by his mother that his manhood must not forego sex yet he is linked up in ideal love already the best he will ever know  no woman will give to a stranger that which she gives to her son her father or her brother that beautiful and glamorous submission which is truly the wifesubmission to a stranger a husband a woman insists on being queen goddess mistress the positive the adored the first and foremost and the one and only this she will not ask from her near bloodkin of her bloodkin there is always one she will love devotedly  and so the charming young girl who adores her father or one of her brothers is sought in marriage by the attractive young man who loves his mother devotedly and a pretty business the marriage is we cant think of it of course they may be good pals its the only thing left  and there we are the game is spoilt before it is begun within the circle of the family owing to our creed of insatiable love intense adult sympathies are provoked in quite young children in italy the italian stimulates adult sexconsciousness and sexsympathy in his child almost deliberately but with us it is usually spiritual sympathy and spiritual criticism the adult experiences are provoked the adult devotional sympathies are linked up prematurely as far as the child is concerned we have the heartwringing spectacle of intense parentchild love a love intense as the love of man and woman but not sexual or else the great brothersister devotion and thus the great loveexperience which should lie in the future is forestalled within the family the lovebond forms quickly without the shocks and ruptures inevitable between strangers and so it is easiest intensestand seems the best it seems the highest you will not easily get a man to believe that his carnal love for the woman he has made his wife is as high a love as that he felt for his mother or sister  the cream is licked off from life before the boy or the girl is twenty afterwardsrepetition disillusion and barrenness  and the causealways the same that parents will not make the great resolution to come to rest within themselves to possess their own souls in quiet and fullness the man has not the courage to withdraw at last into his own souls stillness and aloneness and then passionately and faithfully to strive for the living future the woman has not the courage to give up her hopeless insistence on love and her endless demand for love demand of being loved she has not the greatness of soul to relinquish her own selfassertion and believe in the man who believes in himself and in his own souls effortsif there are any such men nowadays which is very doubtful  alas alas the future your son who has tasted the real beauty of wiferesponse in his mother or sister your daughter who adores her brother and who marries some womans son they are so charming to look at such a lovely couple and at first it is all such a good game such good sport then each one begins to fret for the beauty of the lost nonsexual partial relationship the sexual part of marriage has proved soso empty while that other loveliest thingthe poignant touch of devotion felt for mother or father or brotherwhy this is missing altogether the best is missing the rest isnt worth much ah well such is life settle down to it and bring up the children carefully to more of the samethe futureyouve had all your good days by the time youre twenty  and i ask you what good will psychoanalysis do you in this state of affairs introduce an extra sexmotive to excite you for a bit and make you feel how thrillingly immoral things really are and thenit all goes flat again father complex mother complex incest dreams pah when weve had the little excitement out of them we shall forget them as we have forgotten so many other catchwords and we shall be just where we were before unless we are worse with more sex in the head and more introversion only more brazen     chapter xi  the vicious circle   here is a very vicious circle and how to get out of it in the first place we have to break the loveideal once and for all love as we see is not the only dynamic taking love in its greatest sense and making it embrace every form of sympathy every flow from the great sympathetic centers of the human body still it is not the whole of the dynamic flow it is only the onehalf there is always the other voluntary flow to reckon with the intense motion of independence and singleness of self the pride of isolation and the profound fulfillment through power  the very first thing of all to be recognized is the danger of idealism it is the one besetting sin of the human race it means the fall into automatism mechanism and nullity  we know that life issues spontaneously at the great nodes of the psyche the great nervecenters at first these are four only then after puberty they become eight later there may still be an extension of the dynamic consciousness a further polarization but eight is enough at the moment  first at four and then at eight dynamic centers of the human body the human nervous system life starts spontaneously into being the soul bursts day by day into fresh impulses fresh desire fresh purpose at these our polar centers and from these dynamic generative centers issue the vital currents which put us into connection with our object we have really no will and no choice in the first place it is our soul which acts within us day by day unfolding us according to our own nature  from the objective circuits and from the subjective circuits which establish and fulfill themselves at the first four centers of consciousness we derive our first being our childbeing and also our first mind our childmind by the objective circuits we mean those circuits which are established between the self and some external object mother father sister cat dog bird or even tree or plant or even further still some particular place some particular inanimate object a knife or a chair or a cap or a doll or a wooden horse for we must insist that every object which really enters effectively into our lives does so by direct connection if i love my mother it is because there is established between me and her a direct powerful circuit of vital magnetism call it what you will but a direct flow of dynamic vital interchange and intercourse i will not call this vital flow a force because it depends on the incomprehensible initiative and control of the individual soul or self force is that which is directed only from some universal will or law life is always individual and therefore never controlled by one law one god and therefore since the living really sway the universe even if unknowingly therefore there is no one universal law even for the physical forces because we insist that even the sun depends for its heartbeat its respiration its pivotal motion on the beating hearts of men and beast on the dynamic of the soulimpulse in individual creatures it is from the aggregate heartbeat of living individuals of we know not how many or what sort of worlds that the sun rests stable  which may be dismissed as metaphysics although it is quite as valid or even as demonstrable as newtons law of gravitation which law still remains a law even if not quite so absolute as heretofore  but this is a digression the argument is that between an individual and any external object with which he has an affective connection there exists a definite vital flow as definite and concrete as the electric current whose polarized circuit sets our tramcars running and our lamps shining or our marconi wires vibrating whether this object be human or animal or plant or quite inanimate there is still a circuit my dog my canary has a polarized connection with me nay the very cells in the ashtree i loved as a child had a dynamic vibratory connection with the nuclei in my own centers of primary consciousness and further still the boots i have worn are so saturated with my own magnetism my own vital activity that if anyone else wear them i feel it is a trespass almost as if another man used my hand to knock away a fly i doubt very much if a bloodhound when it takes a scent smells in our sense of the word it receives at the infinitely sensitive telegraphic center of the dogs nostrils the vital vibration which remains in the inanimate object from the individual with whom the object was associated i should like to know if a dog would trace a pair of quite new shoes which had merely been dragged at the end of a string that is does he follow the smell of the leather itself or the vibration track of the individual whose vitality is communicated to the leather  so there is a definite vibratory rapport between a man and his surroundings once he definitely gets into contact with these surroundings any particular locality any house which has been lived in has a vibration a transferred vitality of its own this is either sympathetic or antipathetic to the succeeding individual in varying degree but certain it is that the inhabitants who live at the foot of etna will always have a certain pitch of lifevibration antagonistic to the pitch of vibration even of a palermitan in some measure and old houses are saturated with human presence at last to a degree of indecency unbearable and tradition in its most elemental sense means the continuing of the same peculiar pitch of vital vibration  such is the objective dynamic flow between the psychic poles of the individual and the substance of the external object animate or inanimate the subjective dynamic flow is established between the four primary poles within the individual every dynamic connection begins from one or the other of the sympathetic centers is or should be almost immediately polarized from the corresponding voluntary center then a complete flow is set up in one plane but this always rouses the activity on the other corresponding plane more or less intense there is a whole field of consciousness established with positive polarity of the first plane negative polarity of the second which being so a whole fourfold field of dynamic consciousness now working within the individual direct cognition takes place the mind begins to know and to strive to know  the business of the mind is first and foremost the pure joy of knowing and comprehending the pure joy of consciousness the second business is to act as medium as interpreter as agent between the individual and his object the mind should not act as a director or controller of the spontaneous centers these the soul alone must control the soul being that forever unknowable reality which causes us to rise into being there is continual conflict between the soul which is for ever sending forth incalculable impulses and the psyche which is conservative and wishes to persist in its old motions and the mind which wishes to have freedom that is spasmodic ideadriven control mind and conservative psyche and the incalculable soul these three are a trinity of powers in every human being but there is something even beyond these it is the individual in his pure singleness in his totality of consciousness in his oneness of being the holy ghost which is with us after our pentecost and which we may not deny when i say to myself i am wrong knowing with sudden insight that i am wrong then this is the whole self speaking the holy ghost it is no piece of mental inference it is not just the soul sending forth a flash it is my whole being speaking in one voice soul and mind and psyche transfigured into oneness this voice of my being i may never deny when at last in all my storms my whole self speaks then there is a pause the soul collects itself into pure silence and isolationperhaps after much pain the mind suspends its knowledge and waits the psyche becomes strangely still and then after the pause there is fresh beginning a new life adjustment conscience is the beings consciousness when the individual is conscious in toto when he knows in full it is something which includes and which far surpasses mental consciousness every man must live as far as he can by his own souls conscience but not according to any ideal to submit the conscience to a creed or an idea or a tradition or even an impulse is our ruin  to make the mind the absolute ruler is as good as making a cooks touristinterpreter a king and a god because he can speak several languages and make an arab understand that an englishman wants fish for supper and to make an ideal a ruling principle is about as stupid as if a bunch of travelers should never cease giving each other and their dragoman sixpence because the dragomans main idea of virtue is the virtue of sixpencegiving in the same way we know we cannot live purely by impulse neither can we live solely by tradition we must live by all three ideal impulse and tradition each in its hour but the real guide is the pure conscience the voice of the self in its wholeness the holy ghost  we have fallen now into the mistake of idealism man always falls into one of the three mistakes in china it is tradition and in the south seas it seems to have been impulse ours is idealism each of the three modes is a true lifemode but any one alone or dominant brings us to destruction we must depend on the wholeness of our being ultimately only on that which is our holy ghost within us whereas in an ideal of love and benevolence we have tried to automatize ourselves into little loveengines always stoked with the sorrows or beauties of other people so that we can get up steam of charity or righteous wrath a great trick is to pour on the fire the oil of our indignation at somebody elses wickedness and then when weve got up steam like hell back the engine and run bish smash against the belly of the offender because he said he didnt want to love any more we hate him for evermore and try to run over him every bit of him with our lovetanks and all the time we yell at him will you deny love you villain will you and by the time he faintly squeaks i want to be loved i want to be loved we have got so used to running over him with our lovetanks that we dont feel in a hurry to leave off      sois mon fr√®re ou je te tue     sois mon fr√®re ou je me tue  there are the two parrotthreats of love on which our loving centuries have run as on a pair of railwaylines excuse me if i want to get out of the train excuse me if i cant get up any lovesteam any more my boilers are burst  we have made a mistake laying down love like the permanent way of a great emotional transport system there we are however running on wheels on the lines of our love and of course we have only two directions forwards and backwards onward christian soldiers towards the great terminus where bottles of sterilized milk for the babies are delivered at the bedroom windows by noiseless aeroplanes each morn where the science of dentistry is so perfect that teeth are planted in a mans mouth without his knowing it where twilight sleep is so delicious that every woman longs for her next confinement and where nobody ever has to do anything except turn a handle now and then in a spirit of universal love that is the forward direction of the englishspeaking race the germans unwisely backed their engine we have a city of light but instead of lying ahead it lies direct behind us so reverse engines reverse engines and away away to our city where the sterilized milk is delivered by noiseless aeroplanes at the very precise minute when our great doctors of the fatherland have diagnosed that it is good for you where the teeth are not only so painlessly planted that they grow like living rock but where their composition is such that the friction of eating stimulates the cells of the jawbone and develops the superman strength of will which makes us gods and where not only is twilight sleep serene but into the sleeper are inculcated the most useful and instructive dreams calculated to perfect the character of the young citizen at this crucial period and to enlighten permanently the mind of the happy mother with regard to her new duties towards her child and towards our great fatherland  here you see we are on the railway with new jerusalem ahead and new jerusalem away behind us but of course it was very wrong of the germans to reverse their engines and cause one long collision all along the line why should we go their way to the new jerusalem when of course they might so easily have kept on going our way and now theres wreckage all along the line but clear the way is our mottoor make the germans clear it because get on we will  meanwhile we sit rather in the cold waiting for the train to get a start people keep on signaling with green lights and red lights and its all very bewildering  as for me im off im damned if ill be shunted along any more and im thrice damned if ill go another yard towards that sterilized new jerusalem either forwards or backwards new jerusalem may rot if it waits for me im not going  so goodby there we leave humanity encamped in an appalling mess beside the railwaysmash of love sitting down however and having not a bad time some of em feeding themselves fat on the plunder others further down the line with mouths green from eating grass but all grossly stupidly automatically gabbling about getting the loveservice running again the trains booked for the new jerusalem well on the way once more and occasionally a good engine gives a screech of love and something seems to be about to happen and sometimes there is enough steam to set the indignationwhistles whistling but never any more will there be enough lovesteam to get the system properly running it is done  goodby then you may have laid your line from one end to the other of the infinite but still theres plenty of hinterland ill go goodby ach it will be so nice to be alone not to hear you not to see you not to smell you humanity i wish you no ill but wisdom goodby  to be alone with ones own soul not to be alone without my own soul mind you but to be alone with ones own soul this and the joy of it is the real goal of love my own soul and myself not my ego my conceit of myself but my very soul to be at one in my own self not to be questing any more not to be yearning seeking hoping desiring aspiring but to pause and be alone  and to have ones own gentle spouse by ones side of course to dig one in the ribs occasionally because really being alone in peace means being two people together two people who can be silent together and not conscious of one another outwardly me in my silence she in hers and the balance the equilibrium the pure circuit between us with occasional lapses of course digs in the ribs if one gets too vague or selfsufficient  they say it is better to travel than to arrive its not been my experience at least the journey of love has been rather a lacerating if wellworthit journey but to come at last to a nice place under the trees with your amiable spouse who has at last learned to hold her tongue and not to bother about rights and wrongs her own particularly and then to pitch a camp and cook your rabbit and eat him and to possess your own soul in silence and to feel all the clamor lapse that is the best i know  i think it is terrible to be young the ecstasies and agonies of love the agonies and ecstasies of fear and doubt and dropbydrop fulfillment realization the awful process of human relationships love and marital relationships especially because we all make a very very bad start today with our idea of love in our head and our sex in our head as well all the fight till one is bled of ones selfconsciousness and sexinthehead all the bitterness of the conflict with this devil of an amiable spouse who has got herself so stuck in her own head it is terrible to be youngbut one fights ones way through it till one is cleaned the selfconsciousness and sexidea burned out of one cauterized out bit by bit and the self whole again and at last free  the best thing i have known is the stillness of accomplished marriage when one possesses ones own soul in silence side by side with the amiable spouse and has left off craving and raving and being only half ones self but i must say i know a great deal more about the craving and raving and sore ribs than about the accomplishment and i must confess that i feel this selfsame accomplishment of the fulfilled being is only a preparation for new responsibilities ahead new unison in effort and conflict the effort to make with other men a little new way into the future and to break through the hedge of the many  butto your tents my israel and to that precious baby youve left slumbering there what i meant to say was in each phase of life you have a great circuit of human relationship to establish and fulfill in childhood it is the circuit of family love established at the first four consciousness centers and gradually fulfilling itself completing itself at adolescence the first circuit of family love should be completed dynamically finished and then it falls into quiescence after puberty family love should fall quiescent in a child the love never breaks it continues static and basic the basis of the emotional psyche the foundation of the self it is like the moon when the moon at last subsides into her eternal orbit round the earth she travels in her orbit so inevitably that she forgets and becomes unaware she only knits her brows over the earths greater aberrations in space  the circuit of parental love once fulfilled is not done away with but only established into silence the child is then free to establish the new connections in which he surpasses his parents and let us repeat parents should never try to establish adult relations of sympathy or interest or anything else between themselves and their children the attempt to do so only deranges the deep primary circuit which is the dynamic basis of our living it is a clambering upwards only by means of a broken foundation parents should remain parents children children for ever and the great gulf preserved between the two honor thy father and thy mother should always be a leading commandment but this can only take place when father and mother keep their true parental distances dignity reserve and limitation as soon as father and mother try to become the friends and companions of their children they break the root of life they rupture the deepest dynamic circuit of living they derange the whole flow of life for themselves and their children  for let us reiterate and reiterate you cannot mingle and confuse the various modes of dynamic love if you try you produce horrors you cannot plant the heart below the diaphragm or put an ocular eye in the navel no more can you transfer parent love into friend love or adult love parent love is established at the great primary centers where man is father and child playmate and brother but where he cannot be comrade or lover comrade and lover this is the dynamic activity of the further centers the second four centers and these second four centers must be active in the parent their intense circuit established even if not fulfilled long before the child is born the circuit of friendship of personal companionship of sexual love must needs be established before the child is begotten or at least before it attains to adolescence these circuits of the extended field are already fully established in the parent before the centers of correspondence in the child are even formed when therefore the four great centers of the extended consciousness arouses in a child at adolescence they must needs seek a strange complement a foreign conjunction  not only is this the case but the actual dynamic impulse of the new life which rouses at puberty is alien to the original dynamic flow the new wavelength by no means corresponds the new vibration by no means harmonizes force the two together and you cause a terrible frictional excitement and jarring it is this instinctive recognition of the different dynamic vibrations from different centers in different modes and in different directions of positive and negative which lies at the base of savage taboo after puberty members of one family should be taboo to one another there should be the most definite limits to the degree of contact and mothersinlaw should be taboo to their daughters husbands and fathersinlaw to their sons wives we must again begin to learn the great laws of the first dynamic lifecircuits these laws we now make havoc of and consequently we make havoc of our own soul psyche mind and health  this book is written primarily concerning the childs consciousness it is not intended to enter the field of the postpuberty consciousness but yet the dynamic relation of the child is established so directly with the physical and psychical soul of the parent that to get any inkling of dynamic childconsciousness we must understand something of parentconsciousness  we assert that the parentchild lovemode excludes the possibility of the manandwoman or friendandfriend love mode we assert that the polarity of the first four poles is inconsistent with the polarity of the second four poles nay between the two great fields is a certain dynamic opposition resistance even antipathy so that in the natural course of life there is no possibility of confusing parent love and adult love  but we are mental creatures and with the explosive and mechanistic aid of ideas we can pervert the whole psyche only however in a destructive degree not in a positive or constructive  let us return then in the ordinary course of development by the time that the child is born and grown to puberty the whole dynamic soul of the mother is engaged first with the children and second on the further higher plane with the husband and with her own friends so that when the child reaches adolescence it must inevitably cast abroad for connection  but now let us remember the actual state of affairs today when the poles are reversed between the sexes the woman is now the responsible party the lawgiver the culturebearer she is the conscious guide and director of the man she bears his soul between her two hands and her sex is just a function or an instrument of power this being so the man is really the servant and the fount of emotion love and otherwise  which is all very well while the fun lasts but like all perverted processes it is exhaustive and like the fun wears out leaving an exhaustion and an irritation each looks on the other as a perverter of life almost invariably a married woman as she passes the age of thirty conceives a dislike or a contempt of her husband or a pity which is too near contempt particularly if he be a good husband a true modern and he for his part though just as jarred inside himself resents only the fact that he is not loved as he ought to be  then starts a new game the woman even the most virtuous looks abroad for new sympathy she will have a new manfriend if nothing more but as a rule she has got something more she has got her children  a relation between mother and child today is practically never parental it is personalwhich means it is critical and deliberate and adult in provocation the mother in her new r√¥le of idealist and lifemanager never practically for one single moment gives her child the unthinking response from the deep dynamic centers no she gives it what is good for it she shoves milk in its mouth as the clock strikes she shoves it to sleep when the milk is swallowed and she shoves it ideally through baths and massage promenades and practice till the little organism develops like a mushroom to stand on its own feet then she continues her ideal shoving of it through all the stages of an ideal upbringing she loves it as a chemist loves his testtubes in which he analyzes his salts the poor little object is his mothers ideal but of her head she dictates his providential days and by the force of her deliberate mentallydirected lovewill she pushes him up into boyhood the poor little devil never knows one moment when he is not encompassed by the beautiful benevolent idealistic botticellipure and finally obscene lovewill of the mother never never one mouthful does he drink of the milk of human kindness always the sterilized milk of human benevolence there is no mothers milk today save in tigers udders and in the udders of seawhales our children drink a decoction of ideal love at the breast  never for one moment poor baby the deep warm stream of love from the mothers bowels to his bowels never for one moment the dark proud recoil into rest the souls separation into deep rich independence never this lovely rich forgetfulness as a cat trots off and utterly forgets her kittens utterly richly forgets them till suddenly click the dynamic circuit reverses itself in her and she remembers and rages round in a frenzy shouting for her young  our miserable infants never know this joy and richness and pang of real maternal warmth our wonderful mothers never let us out of their minds for one single moment not for a second do they allow us to escape from their ideal benevolence not one single breath does a baby draw free from the imposition of the pure unselfish botticelliholy detestable lovewill of the mother always the will the will the lovewill the ideal will directed from the ideal mind always this stone this scorpion of maternal nourishment always this infernal selfconscious madonna starving our living guts and bullying us to death with her love  we have made the idea supplant both impulse and tradition we have no spark of wholeness and we live by an evil lovewill alas the great spontaneous mode is abrogated there is no lovely great flux of vital sympathy no rich rejoicing of pride into isolation and independence there is no reverence for great traditions of parenthood no there is substitute for everythinglifesubstitutejust as we have buttersubstitute and meatsubstitute and sugarsubstitute and leathersubstitute and silksubstitute so we have lifesubstitute we have beastly benevolence and foul goodwill and stinking charity and poisonous ideals  the poor modern brat shoved horribly into life by an effort of will and shoved up towards manhood by every appliance that can be applied to it especially the appliance of the maternal will it is really too pathetic to contemplate the only thing that prevents us wringing our hands is the remembrance that the little devil will grow up and beget other similar little devils of his own to invent more aeroplanes and hospitals and germkillers and foodsubstitutes and poison gases the problem of the future is a question of the strongest poisongas which is certainly a very sure way out of our vicious circle  there is no way out of a vicious circle of course except breaking the circle and since the motherchild relationship is today the viciousest of circles what are we to do just wait for the results of the poisongas competition presumably  oh ideal humanity how detestable and despicable you are and how you deserve your own poisongases how you deserve to perish in your own stink  it is no use contemplating the development of the modern child born out of the mentalconscious lovewill born to be another unit of selfconscious lovewill an idealborn beastly little entity with a devils own will of its own benevolent of course and a satans own seraphic selfconsciousness like a beastly botticelli brat  once we really consider this modern process of life and the lovewill we could throw the pen away and spit and say three cheers for the inventors of poisongas is there not an american who is supposed to have invented a breath of heaven whereby drop one popcornful in hampstead one in brixton one in east ham and one in islington and london is a pompeii in five minutes or was the american only bragging because anyhow whom has he experimented on i read it in the newspaper though london a pompeii in five minutes makes the gods look silly     chapter xii  litany of exhortations   i thought id better turn over a new leaf and start a new chapter the intention of the last chapter was to find a way out of the vicious circle and it ended in poisongas  yes dear reader so it did but youve not silenced me yet for all that  were in a nasty mess were in a vicious circle and were making a careful study of poisongases the secret of greek fire was lost long ago when the world left off being wonderful and ideal now it is wonderful and ideal again much wonderfuller and much more ideal so we ought to do something rare in the way of poisongas london a pompeii in five minutes how to outdo vesuviustitle of a new book by american authors  there is only one single other thing to do and its more difficult than poisongas it is to leave off loving it is to leave off benevolenting and having a good will it is to cease utterly just leave off oh parents see that your children get their dinners and clean sheets but dont love them dont love them one single grain and dont let anybody else love them give them their dinners and leave them alone youve already loved them to perdition now leave them alone to find their own way out  wives dont love your husbands any more even if they cry for it the great babies sing ive had enough of that old sauce and leave off loving them or caring for them one single bit dont even hate them or dislike them dont have any stew with them at all just boil the eggs and fill the saltcellars and be quite nice and in your own soul be alone and be still be alone and be still preserving all the human decencies and abandoning the indecency of desires and benevolencies and devotions those beastly poisongas apples of the sodom vine of the lovewill  wives dont love your husbands nor your children nor anybody sit still and say hush and while you shake the duster out of the drawingroom window say to yourselfin the sweetness of solitude and when your husband comes in and says hes afraid hes got a cold and is going to have double pneumonia say quietly surely not and if he wants the ammoniated quinine give it him if he cant get it for himself but dont let him drive you out of your solitude your singleness within yourself and if your little boy falls down the steps and makes his mouth bleed nurse and comfort him but say to yourself even while you tremble with the shock alone alone be alone my soul and if the servant smashes three electriclight bulbs in three minutes say to her how very inconsiderate and careless of you but say to yourself dont hear it my soul dont take fright at the pop of a lightbulb  husbands dont love your wives any more if they flirt with men younger or older than yourselves let your blood not stir if you can go away go away but if you must stay and see her then say to her i would rather you didnt flirt in my presence eleanora then when she goes red and loosens torrents of indignation dont answer any more and when she floods into tears say quietly in your own self my soul is my own and go away be alone as much as possible and when she works herself up and says she must have love or she will die then say not my love however and to all her threats her tears her entreaties her reproaches her cajolements her winsomenesses answer nothing but say to yourself shall i be implicated in this display of the lovewill shall i be blasted by this false lightning and though you tremble in every fiber and feel sick vomitsick with the scene still contain yourself and say my soul is my own it shall not be violated and learn learn learn the one and only lesson worth learning at last learn to walk in the sweetness of the possession of your own soul and whether your wife weeps as she takes off her amber beads at night or whether your neighbor in the train sits in your coat bottoms or whether your superior in the office makes supercilious remarks or your inferior is familiar and impudent or whether you read in the newspaper that lloyd george is performing another iniquity or the germans plotting another plot say to yourself my soul is my own my soul is with myself and beyond implication and wait quietly in possession of your own soul till you meet another man who has made the choice and kept it then you will know him by the look on his face half a dangerous look a look of cain and half a look of gathered beauty then you two will make the nucleus of a new societyooray bis bis  but if you should never meet such a man and if your wife should torture you every day with her lovewill and even if she should force herself into a consumption like catherine linton in wuthering heights owing to her obstinate and determined lovewill which is quite another matter than love and if you see the world inventing poisongas and falling into its poisoned grave never give in but be alone and utterly alone with your own soul in the stillness and sweet possession of your own soul and dont even be angry and never be sad why should you its not your affair  but if your wife should accomplish for herself the sweetness of her own souls possession then gently delicately let the new mode assert itself the new mode of relation between you with something of spontaneous paradise in it the apple of knowledge at last digested but my word what bellyaches meanwhile that apple is harder to digest than a lead guncartridge     chapter xiii  cosmological   well dear reader chapter xii was short and i hope you found it sweet  but remember this is an essay on child consciousness not a tract on salvation it isnt my fault that i am led at moments into exhortation  well then what about it one fact now seems very clearat any rate to me weve got to pause we havent got to gird our loins with a new frenzy and our larynxes with a new glory song not a bit of it before you dash off to put salt on the tail of a new religion or of a new leader of men dear reader sit down quietly and pull yourself together say to yourself come now what is it all about and youll realize dear reader that youre all in a fluster inwardly then say to yourself why am i in such a fluster and youll see youve no reason at all to be so except that its rather exciting to be in a fluster and it may seem rather stale eggs to be in no fluster at all about anything and yet dear little reader once you consider it quietly its so much nicer not to be in a fluster its so much nicer not to feel ones deeper innards storming like the bay of biscay it is so much better to get up and say to the waters of ones own troubled spirit peace be still  and they will be still  perhaps  and then one realizes that all the wild storms of anxiety and frenzy were only so much breaking of eggs it isnt our business to live anybodys life or to die anybodys death except our own nor to save anybodys soul nor to put anybody in the right nor yet in the wrong which is more the point today but to be still and to ignore the false fine frenzy of the seething world to turn away now each one into the stillness and solitude of his own soul and there to remain in the quiet with the holy ghost which is to each man his own true soul  this is the way out of the vicious circle not to rush round on the periphery like a rabbit in a ring trying to break through but to retreat to the very center and there to be filled with a new strange stability polarized in unfathomable richness with the center of centers we are so silly trying to invent devices and machines for flying off from the surface of the earth instead of realizing that for us the deep satisfaction lies not in escaping but in getting into the perfect circuit of the earths terrestrial magnetism not in breaking away what is the good of trying to break away from ones own what is the good of a tree desiring to fly like a bird in the sky when a bird is rooted in the earth as surely as a tree is nay the bird is only the topmost leaf of the tree fluttering in the high air but attached as close to the tree as any other leaf mr einsteins theory of relativity does not supersede the newtonian law of gravitation or of inertia it only says beware the law of inertia is not the simple ideal proposition you would like to make of it it is a vast complexity gravitation is not one elemental uncouth force it is a strange infinitely complex subtle aggregate of forces and yet however much it may waggle a stone does fall to earth if you drop it  we should like vulgarly to rejoice and say that the new theory of relativity releases us from the old obligation of centrality it does no such thing it only makes the old centrality much more strange subtle complex and vital it only robs us of the nice old ideal simplicity which ideal simplicity and logicalness has become such a fishbone stuck in our throats  the universe is once more in the mental meltingpot and you can melt it down as long as you like and mutter all the jargon and abracadabra aldeboronti fosco fornio of science that mental monkeytricks can teach you you wont get anything in the end but a formula and a lie the atom why the moment you discover the atom it will explode under your nose the moment you discover the ether it will evaporate the moment you get down to the real basis of anything it will dissolve into a thousand problematic constituents and the more problems you solve the more will spring up with their fingers at their nose making a fool of you  there is only one clue to the universe and that is the individual soul within the individual being that outer universe of suns and moons and atoms is a secondary affair it is the deathresult of living individuals there is a great polarity in life itself life itself is dual and the duality is life and death and death is not just shadow or mystery it is the negative reality of life it is what we call matter and force among other things  life is individual always was individual and always will be life consists of living individuals and always did so consist in the beginning of everything there never was any universe any cosmos of which the first reality was anything but living incorporate individuals i dont say the individuals were exactly like you and me and they were never wildly different  and therefore it is time for the idealist and the scientistthey are one and the same reallyto stop his monkeyjargon about the atom and the origin of life and the mechanical clue to the universe there isnt any such thing i might as well say then they took the cart and rubbed it all over with grease then they sprayed it with white wine and spun round the right wheel five hundred revolutions to the minute and the left wheel in the opposite direction seven hundred and seventyseven revolutions to the minute then a burning torch was applied to each axle and lo the footboard of the cart began to swell and suddenly as the cart groaned and writhed the horse was born and lay panting between the shafts the whole scientific theory of the universe is not worth such a tale that the cart conceived and gave birth to the horse  i do not believe onefifth of what science can tell me about the sun i do not believe for one second that the moon is a dead world spelched off from our globe i do not believe that the stars came flying off from the sun like drops of water when you spin your wet hanky i have believed it for twenty years because it seemed so ideally plausible now i dont accept any ideal plausibilities at all i look at the moon and the stars and i know i dont believe anything that i am told about them except that i like their names aldebaran and cassiopeia and so on  i have tried and even brought myself to believe in a clue to the outer universe and in the process i have swallowed such a lot of jargon that i would rather listen now to a negro witchdoctor than to science there is nothing in the world that is true except empiric discoveries which work in actual appliances i know that the sun is hot but i wont be told that the sun is a ball of blazing gas which spins round and fizzes no thank you  at length for my part i know that life and life only is the clue to the universe and that the living individual is the clue to life and that it always was so and always will be so  when the living individual dies then is the realm of death established then you get matter and elements and atoms and forces and sun and moon and earth and stars and so forth in short the outer universe the cosmos the cosmos is nothing but the aggregate of the dead bodies and dead energies of bygone individuals the dead bodies decompose as we know into earth air and water heat and radiant energy and free electricity and innumerable other scientific facts the dead souls likewise decomposeor else they dont decompose but if they do decompose then it is not into any elements of matter and physical energy they decompose into some psychic reality and into some potential will they re√´nter into the living psyche of living individuals the living soul partakes of the dead souls as the living breast partakes of the outer air and the blood partakes of the sun the soul the individuality never resolves itself through death into physical constituents the dead soul remains always soul and always retains its individual quality and it does not disappear but re√´nters into the soul of the living of some living individual or individuals and there it continues its part in life as a deathwitness and a lifeagent but it does not ordinarily have any separate existence there but is incorporate in the living individual soul but in some extraordinary cases the dead soul may really act separately in a living individual  how this all is and what are the laws of the relation between life and death the living and the dead i dont know but that this relation exists and exists in a manner as i describe it for my own part i know and i am fully aware that once we direct our living attention this way instead of to the absurdity of the atom then we have a whole living universe of knowledge before us the universe of life and death of which we whose business it is to live and to die know nothing whilst concerning the universe of force and matter we pile up theories and make staggering and disastrous discoveries of machinery and poisongas all of which we were much better without  it is life we have to live by not machines and ideals and life means nothing else even but the spontaneous living soul which is our central reality the spontaneous living individual soul this is the clue and the only clue all the rest is derived  how it is contrived that the individual soul in the living sways the very sun in its centrality i do not know but it is so it is the peculiar dynamic polarity of the living soul in every weed or bug or beast each one separately and individually polarized with the great returning pole of the sun that maintains the sun alive for i take it that the sun is the great sympathetic center of our inanimate universe i take it that the sun breathes in the effluence of all that fades and dies across space fly the innumerable vibrations which are the basis of all matter they fly breathed out from the dying and the dead from all that which is passing away even in the living these vibrations these elements pass away across space and are breathed back again the sun itself is invisible as the soul the sun itself is the soul of the inanimate universe the aggregate clue to the substantial death if we may call it so the sun is the great active pole of the sympathetic deathactivity to the sun fly the vibrations or the molecules in the great sympathymode of death and in the sun they are renewed they turn again as the great gift back again from the sympathetic deathcenter towards life towards the living but it is not even the dead which really sustain the sun it is the dynamic relation between the solar plexus of individuals and the suns core a perfect circuit the sun is materially composed of all the effluence of the dead but the quick of the sun is polarized with the living the suns quick is polarized in dynamic relation with the quick of life in all living things that is with the solar plexus in mankind a direct dynamic connection between my solar plexus and the sun  likewise as the sun is the great fiery vivifying pole of the inanimate universe the moon is the other pole cold and keen and vivifying corresponding in some way to a voluntary pole we live between the polarized circuit of sun and moon and the moon is polarized with the lumbar ganglion primarily in man sun and moon are dynamically polarized to our actual tissue they affect this tissue all the time  the moon is as it were the pole of our particular terrestrial volition in the universe what holds the earth swinging in space is first the great dynamic attraction to the sun and then counterposing assertion of independence singleness which is polarized in the moon the moon is the clue to our earths individual identity in the wide universe  the moon is an immense magnetic center it is quite wrong to say she is a dead snowy world with craters and so on i should say she is composed of some very intense element like phosphorus or radium some element or elements which have very powerful chemical and kinetic activity and magnetic activity affecting us through space  it is not the sun which we see in heaven it is the rushing thither and the rushing thence of the vibrations expelled by death from the body of life and returned back again to the body of life possibly even a dead soul makes its journey to the sun and back before we receive it again in our breast just as the breath we breathe out flies to the sun and back before we breathe it in again and as the water that evaporates rises right to the sun and returns here what we see is the great golden rushing thither from the death exhalation towards the sun as a great cloud of bees flying to swarm upon the invisible queen circling round and loosing again this is what we see of the sun the center is invisible for ever  and of the moon the same the moon has her back to us for ever not her face as we like to think the moon also pulls the water as the sun does but not in evaporation the moon pulls by the magnetic force we call gravitation gravitation not being quite such a newtonian simple apple as we are accustomed to find it we are perhaps farther off from understanding the tides of the ocean than we were before the fruit of the tree fell to sir isaacs head it is certainly not simple littlethings tumbletowardsbigthings gravitation in the moons pull there is peculiar quite special force exerted over those waterborn substances phosphorus salt and lime the dynamic energy of salt water is something quite different from that of fresh water and it is this dynamic energy which the sea gives off and which connects it with the moon and the moon is some strange coagulation of substance such as salt phosphorus soda it certainly isnt a snowy cold world like a world of our own gone cold nonsense it is a globe of dynamic substance like radium or phosphorus coagulated upon a certain vivid pole of energy which pole of energy is directly polarized with our earth in opposition with the sun  the moon is born from the death of individuals all things in their oneing their unification into the pure universal oneness evaporate and fly like an imitation breath towards the sun even the crumbling rocks breathe themselves off in this rocky death to the sun of heaven during the day  but at the same time during the night they breathe themselves off to the moon if we come to think of it light and dark are a question both of the third body the intervening body what we will call by stretching a point the individual as we all know apart from the existence of molecules of individual matter there is neither light nor dark a universe utterly without matter we dont know whether it is light or dark even the pure space between the sun and moon the blue space we dont know whether in itself it is light or dark we can say it is light we can say it is dark but light and dark are terms which apply only to ourselves the third the intermediate the substantial the individual  if we come to think of it light and dark only mean whether we have our face or our back towards the sun if we have our face to the sun then we establish the circuit of cosmic or universal or material or infinite sympathy these four adjectives cosmic universal material and infinite are almost interchangeable and apply as we see to that realm of the nonindividual existence which we call the realm of the substantial death it is the universe which has resulted from the death of individuals and to this universe alone belongs the quality of infinity to the universe of death living individuals have no infinity save in this relation to the total deathsubstance and deathbeing the summedup cosmos  light and dark these great wonders are relative to us alone these are two vast poles of the cosmic energy and of material existence these are the vast poles of cosmic sympathy which we call the sun and the other white pole of cosmic volition which we call the moon to the sun belong the great forces of heat and radiant energy to the moon belong the great forces of magnetism and electricity radiumenergy and so on the sun is not in any sense a material body it is an invariable intense pole of cosmic energy and what we see are the particles of our terrestrial decomposition flying thither and returning as fine grains of iron would fly to an intense magnet or better as the draught in a room veers towards the fire attracted infallibly as a moth towards a candle the moth is drawn to the candle as the draught is drawn to the fire in the absolute spell of the material polarity of fire and air escapes again hot and different from the fire so is the sun  fire we say is combustion it is marvelous how science proceeds like witchcraft and alchemy by means of an abracadabra which has no earthly sense pray what is combustion you can try and answer scientifically till you are black in the face all you can say is that it is that which happens when matter is raised to a certain temperatureand so forth and so forth you might as well say a word is that which happens when i open my mouth and squeeze my larynx and make various tricks with my throat muscles all these explanations are so senseless they describe the apparatus and think they have described the event  fire may be accompanied by combustion but combustion is not necessarily accompanied by fire all a is b but all b is not a and therefore fire no matter how you jiggle is not identical with combustion fire fire i insist on the absolute word you may say that fire is a sum of various phenomena i say it isnt you might as well tell me a fly is a sum of wings and six legs and two bulging eyes it is the fly which has the wings and legs and not the legs and wings which somehow nab the fly into the middle of themselves a fly is not a sum of various things a fly is a fly and the items of the sum are still fly  so with fire fire is an absolute unity in itself it is a dynamic polar principle establish a certain polarity between the moonprinciple and the sunprinciple between the positive and negative or sympathetic and volitional dynamism in any piece of matter and you have fire you have the sunphenomenon it is the sudden flare into the one mode the sun mode the material sympathetic mode correspondingly establish an opposite polarity between the sunprinciple and the waterprinciple and you have decomposition into water or towards watery dissolution  there are two sheer dynamic principles in our universe the sunprinciple and the moonprinciple and these principles are known to us in immediate contact as fire and water the sun is not fire but the principle of fire is the sunprinciple that is fire is the sudden swoop towards the sun of matter which is suddenly sunpolarized fire is the sudden sunassertion the release towards the one pole only it is the sudden revelation of the cosmic one polarity one identity  but there is another pole there is the moon and there is another absolute and visible principle the principle of water the moon is not water but it is the soul of water the invisible clue to all the waters  so that we begin to realize our visible universe as a vast dual polarity between sun and moon two vast poles in space invisible in themselves but visible owing to the circuit which swoops between them round them the circuit of the universe established at the cosmic poles of the sun and moon this then is the infinite the positive infinite of the positive pole the sunpole negative infinite of the negative pole the moonpole and between the two infinites all existence takes place  but wait existence is truly a matter of propagation between the two infinites but it needs a third presence sunprinciple and moonprinciple embracing through the √¶ons could never by themselves propagate one molecule of matter the hailstone needs a grain of dust for its core so does the universe midway between the two cosmic infinites lies the third which is more than infinite this is the holy ghost life individual life  it is so easy to imagine that between them the two infinites of the cosmos propagated life but one single moment of pause and silence one single moment of gathering the whole soul into knowledge will tell us that it is a falsity it was the living individual soul which dying flung into space the two wings of the infinite the two poles of the sun and the moon the sun and the moon are the two eternal deathresults of the death of individuals matter all matter is the lifeborn and what we know as inert matter this is only the result of death in individuals it is the dead bodies of individuals decomposed and resmelted between the hammer and anvil fire and sand of the sun and the moon when time began the first individual died the poles of the sun and moon were flung into space and between the two in a strange chaos and battle the dead body was torn and melted and smelted and rolled beneath the feet of the living so the world was formed always under the feet of the living  and so we have a clue to gravitation we mankind are all one family in our individual bodies burns the positive quick of all things but beneath our feet in our own earth lies the intense center of our human individual death our grave the earth has one center to which we are all polarized the circuit of our life is balanced on the living soul within us as the positive center and on the earths dark center the center of our abiding and eternal and substantial death our great negative center away below this is the circuit of our immediate individual existence we stand upon our own grave with our death fire the sun on our right hand and our deathdamp the moon on our left  the earths center is no accident it is the great individual pole of us who die it is the center of the first dead body it is the first germcell of death which germcell threw out the great nuclei of the sun and the moon to this center of our earth we as humans are eternally polarized as are our trees inevitably we fall to earth and the clue of us sinks to the earths center the clue of our death of our weight and the earth flings us out as wings to the sun and moon or as the deathgerm dividing into two nuclei so from the earth our radiance is flung to the sun our marshfire to the moon when we die  we fall into the earth but our rising was not from the earth we rose from the earthless quick the unfading life and earth sun and moon are born only of our death but it is only their polarized dynamic connection with us who live which sustains them all in their place and maintains them all in their own activities the inanimate universe rests absolutely on the lifecircuit of living creatures is built upon the arch which spans the duality of living beings     chapter xiv  sleep and dreams   this is going rather far for a booknay a bookleton the child consciousness but it cant be helped childconsciousness it is and we have to roll away the stone of a scientific cosmos from the tombmouth of that imprisoned consciousness  now dear reader let us see where we are first of all we are ourselveswhich is the refrain of all my chants we are ourselves we are living individuals and as living individuals we are the one pure clue to our own cosmos to which cosmos living individuals have always been the clue since time began and will always be the clue while time lasts  i know it is not so fireworky as the sudden evolving of life somewhere somewhen and somehow out of force and matter with a pop but that pop never popped dear reader the boot was on the other leg and i wish i could mix a few more metaphors like pops and legs and boots just to annoy you  life never evolved or evoluted out of force and matter dear reader there is no such thing as evolution anyhow there is only development man was man in the very first plasmspeck which was his own individual origin and is still his own individual origin as for the origin i dont know much about it i only know there is but one origin and that is the individual soul the individual soul originated everything and has itself no origin so that time is a matter of living experience nothing else and eternity is just a mental trick of course every living speck amoeba or newt has its own individual soul  and we sit on our own globe dear reader here individually located our own individual being is our own single reality but the single reality of the individual being is dynamically and directly polarized to the earths center which is the aggregate negative center of all terrestrial existence in short the center which in life we thrust away from and towards which we fall in death for our individual existence being positive we must have a negative pole to thrust away from and when our positive individual existence breaks and we fall into death our wonderful individual gravitationcenter succumbs to the earths gravitationcenter  so there we are individuals single lifeborn lifeliving yet all the while poised and polarized to the aggregate center of our substantial death our earths quick powerful centerclue  there may be other individuals alive and having other worlds under their feet polarized to their own globes center but the very sacredness of my own individuality prevents my pronouncing about them lest i in attributing qualities to them transgress against the pure individuality which is theirs beyond me  if however there be truly other people with their own world under their feet then i think it is fair to say that we all have our infinite identity in the sun that in the rush and swirl of death we pass through fiery ways to the same sun and from the sun can the spores of souls pass to the various worlds and to the worlds of the cosmos seed across space through the wild beams of the sun is there seed of mars in my veins and is astrology not altogether nonsense  but if the sun is the center of our infinite oneing in death with all the other afterdeath souls of the cosmos and in that great central station of travel the sun we meet and mingle and change trains for the stars then ought we to assume that the moon is likewise a meetingplace of dead souls the moon surely is a meetingplace of cold dead angry souls but from our own globe only  the moon is the center of our terrestrial individuality in the cosmos she is the declaration of our existence in separateness save for the intense white recoil of the moon the earth would stagger towards the sun the moon holds us to our own cosmic individuality as a world individual in space she is the fierce center of retraction of frictional withdrawal into separateness she it is who sullenly stands with her back to us and refuses to meet and mingle she it is who burns white with the intense friction of her withdrawal into separation that cold proud white fire of furious almost malignant apartness the struggle into fierce frictional separation her white fire is the frictional fire of the last strange intense watery matter as this matter fights its way out of combination and out of combustion with the sunstuff to the pure polarity of the moon fly the essential waters of our universe which essential waters at the moons clue are only an intense invisible energy a polarity of the moon  there are only three great energies in the universal life which is always individual and which yet sways all the physical forces as well as the vital energy and then the two great dynamisms of the sun and the moon to the dynamism of the sun belong heat expansionforce and all that range to the dynamism of the moon the essential watery forces not just gravitation but electricity magnetism radiumenergy and so on  the moon likewise is the pole of our night activities as the sun is the pole of our day activities remember that the sun and moon are but great selfabandons which individual life has thrown out to the right hand and to the left when individual life dies it flings itself on the right hand to the sun on the left hand to the moon in the dual polarity and sinks to earth when any man dies his soul divides in death as in life in the first germ it was united from two germs it divides into two dark germs flung asunder the sungerm and the moongerm then the material body sinks to earth and so we have the cosmic universe such as we know it  what is the exact relationship between us and the deathrealm of the afterwards we shall never know but this relation is none the less active every moment of our lives there is a pure polarity between life and death between the living and the dead between each living individual and the outer cosmos between each living individual and the earths center passes a neverceasing circuit of magnetism it is a circuit which in man travels up the right side and down the left side of the body to the earths center it never ceases but while we are awake it is entirely under the control and spell of the total consciousness the individual consciousness the soul or self when we sleep however then this individual consciousness of the soul is suspended for the time and we lie completely within the circuit of the earths magnetism or gravitation or both the circuit of the earths centrality it is this circuit which is busy in all our tissue removing or arranging the dead body of our past day for each time we lie down to sleep we have within us a body of death which dies with the day that is spent and this body of death is removed or laid in line by the activities of the earthcircuit the great active deathcircuit while we sleep  as we sleep the current sweeps its own way through us as the streets of a city are swept and flushed at night it sweeps through our nerves and our blood sweeping away the ash of our days spent consciousness towards one form or other of excretion this earthcurrent actively sweeping through us is really the deathactivity busy in the service of life it behooves us to know nothing of it and as it sweeps it stimulates in the primary centers of consciousness vibrations which flash images upon the mind usually in deep sleep these images pass unrecorded but as we pass towards the twilight of dawn and wakefulness we begin to retain some impression some record of the dreamimages usually also the images that are accidentally swept into the mind in sleep are as disconnected and as unmeaning as the pieces of paper which the street cleaners sweep into a bin from the city gutters at night we should not think of taking all these papers piecing them together and making a marvelous book of them prophetic of the future and pregnant with the past we should not do so although every rag of printed paper swept from the gutter would have some connection with the past days event but its significance the significance of the words printed upon it is so small that we relegate it into the limbo of the accidental and meaningless there is no vital connection between the many torn bits of paperonly an accidental connection each bit of paper has reference to some actual event a busticket an envelope a tract a pastryshop bag a newspaper a handbill but take them all together busticket torn envelope tract paperbag piece of newspaper and handbill and they have no individual sequence they belong more to the mechanical arrangements than to the vital consequence of our existence and the same with most dreams they are the heterogeneous odds and ends of images swept together accidentally by the besom of the nightcurrent and it is beneath our dignity to attach any real importance to them it is always beneath our dignity to go degrading the integrity of the individual soul by cringing and scraping among the ragtag of accident and of the inferior mechanic coincidence and automatic event only those events are significant which derive from or apply to the soul in its full integrity to go kowtowing before the facts of change as gamblers and fortunereaders and fatalists do is merely a perverting of the souls proud integral priority a rearing up of idiotic idols and fetishes  most dreams are purely insignificant and it is the sign of a weak and paltry nature to pay any attention to them whatever only occasionally they matter and this is only when something threatens us from the outer mechanical or accidental deathworld when anything threatens us from the world of death then a dream may become so vivid that it arouses the actual soul and when a dream is so intense that it arouses the soulthen we must attend to it  but we may have the most appalling nightmare because we eat pancakes for supper here again we are threatened with an arrest of the mechanical flow of the system this arrest becomes so serious that it affects the great organs of the heart and lungs and these organs affect the primary consciouscenters  now we shall see that this is the direct reverse of real living consciousness in living consciousness the primary affective centers control the great organs but when sleep is on us the reverse takes place the great organs being obstructed in their spontaneousautomatism at last with violence arouse the active consciouscenters and these flash images to the brain  these nightmare images are very frequently purely mechanical as of falling terribly downwards or being enclosed in vaults and such images are pure physical transcripts the image of falling of flying of trying to run and not being able to lift the feet of having to creep through terribly small passages these are direct transcripts from the physical phenomena of circulation and digestion it is the directly transcribed image of the heart which impeded in its action by the gases of indigestion is switched out of its established circuit of earthpolarity and is as if suspended over a void or plunging into a void step by step falling downstairs maybe according to the strangulation of the heart beats the same paralytic inability to lift the feet when one needs to run in a dream comes directly from the same impeded action of the heart which is thrown off its balance by some material obstruction now the heart swings left and right in the pure circuit of the earths polarity hinder this swing force the heart over to the left by inflation of gas from the stomach or by dead pressure upon the blood and nerves from any obstruction and you get the sensation of being unable to lift the feet from earth a gasping sensation or force the heart to overbalance towards the right and you get the sensation of flying or of falling the heart telegraphs its distress to the mind and wakes us the wakeful soul at once begins to deal with the obstruction which was too much for the mechanical nightcircuits the same holds good of dreams of imprisonment or of creeping through narrow passages they are direct transfers from the squeezing of the blood through constricted arteries or heart chambers  most dreams are stimulated from the blood into the nerves and the nervecenters and the heart is the transmission station for the blood has a unity and a consciousness of its own it has a deeper elemental consciousness of the mechanical or material world in the blood we have the body of our most elemental consciousness our almost material consciousness and during sleep this material consciousness transfers itself into the nerves and to the brain the transfer in wakefulness results in a feeling of pain or discomfortas when we have indigestion which is pure blooddiscomfort but in sleep the transfer is made through the dreamimages which are mechanical phenomena like mirages  nightmares which have purely mechanical images may terrify us give us a great shock but the shock does not enter our souls we are surprised in the morning to find that the bristling horror of the night seems now just nothingdwindled to nothing and this is because what was a purely material obstruction in the physical flow temporary only is indeed a nothingness to the living integral soul we are subject to such accidentsif we will eat pancakes for supper and that is the end of it  but there are other dreams which linger and haunt the soul these are true souldreams as we know life consists of reactions and interrelations from the great centers of primary consciousness i may start a chain of connection from one center which inevitably stimulates into activity the corresponding center for example i may develop a profound and passional love for my mother in my days of adolescence this starts willynilly the whole activity of adult love at the lower centers but admission is made only of the upper spiritual love the love dynamically polarized at the upper centers nevertheless whether the admission is made or not once establish the circuit in the upper or spiritual centers of adult love and you will get a corresponding activity in the lower passional centers of adult love  the activity at the lower center however is denied in the daytime there is a repression then the friction of the nightflow liberates the repressed psychic activity explosively and then the image of the mother figures in passionate disturbing soulrending dreams  the freudians point to this as evidence of a repressed incest desire the freudians are too simple it is always wrong to accept a dreammeaning at its face value sleep is the time when we are given over to the automatic processes of the inanimate universe let us not forget this dreams are automatic in their nature the psyche possesses remarkably few dynamic images in the case of the boy who dreams of his mother we have the aroused but unattached sex plunging in sleep causing a sort of obstruction we have the image of the mother the dynamic emotional image and the automatism of the dreamprocess immediately unites the sexsensation to the great stock image and produces an incest dream but does this prove a repressed incest desire on the contrary  the truth is every man has the moment he awakes a hatred of his dream and a great desire to be free of the dream free of the persistent motherimage or sisterimage of the dream it is a ghoul it haunts his dreams this image with its hateful conclusions and yet he cannot get free as long as a man lives he may in his dreams of passion or conflict be haunted by the motherimage or sisterimage even when he knows that the cause of the disturbing dream is the wife but even though the actual subject of the dream is the wife still over and over again for years the dreamprocess will persist in substituting the motherimage it haunts and terrifies a man  why does the dreamprocess act so for two reasons first the reason of simple automatic continuance the motherimage was the first great emotional image to be introduced in the psyche the dreamprocess mechanically reproduces its stock image the moment the intense sympathyemotion is aroused again the motherimage refers only to the upper plane but the dreamprocess is mechanical in its logic because the motherimage refers to the great dynamic stress of the upper plane therefore it refers to the great dynamic stress of the lower this is a piece of sheer automatic logic the living soul is not automatic and automatic logic does not apply to it  but for our second reason for the image in becoming the object of great emotional stress for her son the mother also becomes an object of poignancy of anguish of arrest to her son she arrests him from finding his proper fulfillment on the sensual plane now it is almost always the object of arrest which becomes impressed as it were upon the psyche a man very rarely has an image of a person with whom he is livingly vitally connected he only has dreamimages of the persons who in some way oppose his lifeflow and his souls freedom and so become impressed upon his plasm as objects of resistance once a man is dynamically caught on the upper plane by mother or sister then the dreamimage of mother or sister will persist until the dynamic rapport between himself and his mother or sister is finally broken and the dreamimage from the upper plane will be automatically applied to the disturbance of the lower plane  becauseand this is very importantthe dreamprocess loves its own automatism it would force everything to an automaticlogical conclusion in the psyche but the living wakeful psyche is so flexible and sensitive it has a horror of automatism while the soul really lives its deepest dread is perhaps the dread of automatism for automatism in life is a forestalling of the death process  the living soul has its great fear the living soul fears the automatically logical conclusion of incest hence the sleepprocess invariably draws this conclusion the dreamprocess fiendishly plays a triumph of automatism over us but the dreamconclusion is almost invariably just the reverse of the souls desire in any distressdream popular dreamtelling understood this and pronounced that you must read dreams backwards dream of a wedding and it means a funeral wish your friend well and fear his death and you will dream of his funeral every desire has its corresponding fear that the desire shall not be fulfilled it is fear which forms an arrestpoint in the psyche hence an image so the dream automatically produces the fearimage as the desireimage if you secretly wished your enemy dead and feared he might flourish the dream would present you with his wedding  of course this rule of inversion is too simple to hold good in all cases yet it is one of the most general rules for dreams and applies most often to desireandfear dreams of a psychic nature  so that an incestdream would not prove an incestdesire in the living psyche rather the contrary a living fear of the automatic conclusion the souls just dread of automatism and though this may sound like casuistry i believe it does explain a good deal of the dreamtrickthat which is lovely to the automatic process is hateful to the spontaneous soul the wakeful living soul fears automatism as it fears death death being automatic  it seems to me these are the first two dreamprinciples and the two most important the principle of automatism and the principle of inversion they will not resolve everything for us but they will help a great deal we have to be very wary of giving way to dreams it is really a sin against ourselves to prostitute the living spontaneous soul to the tyranny of dreams or of chance or fortune or luck or any of the processes of the automatic sphere  then consider other dynamic dreams first the dreamimage generally any significant dreamimage is usually an image or a symbol of some arrest or scotch in the living spontaneous psyche there is another principle but if the image is a symbol then the only safe way to explain the symbol is to proceed from the quality of emotion connected with the symbol  for example a man has a persistent passionate feardream about horses he suddenly finds himself among great physical horses which may suddenly go wild their great bodies surge madly round him they rear above him threatening to destroy him at any minute he may be trampled down  now a psychoanalyst will probably tell you offhand that this is a fathercomplex dream certain symbols seem to be put into complex catalogues but it is all too arbitrary  examining the emotional reference we find that the feeling is sensual there is a great impression of the powerful almost beautiful physical bodies of the horses the nearness the rounded haunches the rearing is the dynamic passion in a horse the dangerpassion it is a great sensual reaction at the sacral ganglion a reaction of intense sensual dominant volition the horse which rears and kicks and neighs madly acts from the intensely powerful sacral ganglion but this intense activity from the sacral ganglion is male the sacral ganglion is at its highest intensity in the male so that the horsedream refers to some arrest in the deepest sensual activity in the male the horse is presented as an object of terror which means that to the mans automatic dreamsoul which loves automatism the great sensual male activity is the greatest menace the automatic pseudosoul which has got the sensual nature repressed would like to keep it repressed whereas the greatest desire of the living spontaneous soul is that this very male sensual nature represented as a menace shall be actually accomplished in life the spontaneous self is secretly yearning for the liberation and fulfillment of the deepest and most powerful sensual nature there may be an element of fathercomplex the horse may also refer to the powerful sensual being in the father the dream may mean a love of the dreamer for the sensual male who is his father but it has nothing to do with incest the love is probably a just love  the bulldream is a curious reversal in the bull the centers of power are in the breast and shoulders the horns of the head are symbols of this vast power in the upper self the womans fear of the bull is a great terror of the dynamic upper centers in man the bulls horns instead of being phallic represent the enormous potency of the upper centers a woman whose most positive dynamism is in the breast and shoulders is fascinated by the bull her dreamfear of the bull and his horns which may run into her may be reversed to a significance of desire for connection not from the centers of the lower sensual self but from the intense physical centers of the upper body the phallus polarized from the upper centers and directed towards the great breast center of the woman her wakeful fear is terror of the great breastandshoulder upper rage and power of man which may pierce her defenseless lower self the terror and the desire are near togetherand go with an admiration of the slender abstracted bull loins  other dreamfears or strong dreamimpressions may be almost imageless they may be a great terror for example of a purely geometric figurea figure from pure geometry or an example of pure mathematics or they may have no image but only a sensation of smell or of color or of sound  these are the dreamfears of the soul which is falling out of human integrity into the purely mechanical mode if we idealize ourselves sufficiently the spontaneous centers do at last work only or almost only in the mechanical mode they have no dynamic relation with another being they cannot have their whole power of dynamic relationship is quenched they act now in reference purely to the mechanical world of force and matter sensation and law so that in dreamactivity sensation or abstraction abstract law or calculation occurs as the predominant or exclusive image in the dream there may be a sensation of admiration or delight the waking sensation is fear because the soul fears above all things its fall from individual integrity into the mechanic activity of the outer world which is the automatic deathworld  and this is our danger today we tend through deliberate idealism or deliberate material purpose to destroy the soul in its first nature of spontaneous integral being and to substitute the second nature the automatic nature of the mechanical universe for this purpose we stay up late at night and we rise late in the morning  to stay up late into the night is always bad let us be as ideal as we may when the sun goes down the natural mode of life changes in us the mind changes its activity as the soul gradually goes passive before yielding up its sway the mind falls into its second phase of activity it collects the results of the spent day into consciousness lays down the honey of quiet thought or the bittersweet honey of the gathered flower it is the consciousness of that which is past evening is our time to read history and tragedy and romanceall of which are the utterance of that which is past that which is over that which is finished is concluded either sweetly concluded or bitterly evening is the time for this  but evening is the time also for revelry for drink for passion alcohol enters the blood and acts as the suns rays act it inflames into life it liberates into energy and consciousness but by a process of combustion that life of the day which we have not lived by means of sunborn alcohol we can now flare into sensation consciousness energy and passion and live it out it is a liberation from the laws of idealism a release from the restriction of control and fear it is the blood bursting into consciousness but naturally the course of the liberated consciousness may be in either direction sharper mental action greater fervor of spiritual emotion or deeper sensuality nowadays the last is becoming much more unusual  the active mindconsciousness of the night is a form of retrospection or else it is a form of impulsive exclamation direct from the blood and unbalanced because the active physical consciousness of the night is the bloodconsciousness the most elemental form of consciousness vision is perhaps our highest form of dynamic upper consciousness but our deepest lower consciousness is bloodconsciousness  and the dynamic lower centers are swayed from the blood when the blood rouses into its night intensity it naturally kindles first the lowest dynamic centers it transfers its voice and its fire to the great hypogastric plexus which governs with the help of the sacral ganglion the flow of urine through us but which also voices the deep swaying of the blood in sex passion sex is our deepest form of consciousness it is utterly nonideal nonmental it is pure bloodconsciousness it is the basic consciousness of the blood the nearest thing in us to pure material consciousness it is the consciousness of the night when the soul is almost asleep  the bloodconsciousness is the first and last knowledge of the living soul the depths it is the soul acting in part only speaking with its first hoarse halfvoice and bloodconsciousness cannot operate purely until the soul has put off all its manifold degrees and forms of upper consciousness as the self falls back into quiescence it draws itself from the brain from the great nervecenters into the blood where at last it will sleep but as it draws and folds itself livingly in the blood at the dark and powerful hour it sends out its great call for even the blood is alone and in part and needs an answer like the waters of the red sea the blood is divided in a dual polarity between the sexes as the night falls and the consciousness sinks deeper suddenly the blood is heard hoarsely calling suddenly the deep centers of the sexual consciousness rouse to their spontaneous activity suddenly there is a deep circuit established between me and the woman suddenly the sea of blood which is me heaves and rushes towards the sea of blood which is her there is a moment of pure frictional crisis and contact of blood and then all the blood in me ebbs back into its ways transmuted changed and this is the profound basis of my renewal my deep blood renewal  and this has nothing to do with pretty faces or white skin or rosy breasts or any of the rest of the trappings of sexual love these trappings belong to the day neither eyes nor hands nor mouth have anything to do with the final massive and dark collision of the blood in the sex crisis when the strange flash of electric transmutation passes through the blood of the man and the blood of the woman they fall apart and sleep in their transmutation  but even in its profoundest and most elemental movements the soul is still individual even in its most material consciousness it is still integral and individual you would think the great bloodstream of mankind was one and homogeneous and it is indeed more nearly one more near to homogeneity than anything else within us the bloodstream of mankind is almost homogeneous  but it isnt homogeneous in the first place it is dual in a perfect dark dynamic polarity the sexual polarity no getting away from the fact that the blood of woman is dynamically polarized in opposition or in difference to the blood of man the crisis of their contact in sex connection is the moment of establishment of a new flashing circuit throughout the whole sea the dark burning red waters of our underworld rocking in a new dynamic rhythm in each of us and then in the second place the blood of an individual is his own blood that is it is individual and though we have a potential dynamic sexual connection we men with almost every woman yet the great outstanding fact of the individuality even of the blood makes us need a corresponding individuality in the woman we are to embrace the more individual the man or woman the more unsatisfactory is a nonindividual connection promiscuity the more individual the more does our blood cry out for its own specific answer an individual woman bloodpolarized with us  we have made the mistake of idealism again we have thought that the woman who thinks and talks as we do will be the bloodanswer and we force it to be so to our disaster the woman who thinks and talks as we do is almost sure to have no dynamic bloodpolarity with us the dynamic bloodpolarity would make her different from me and not like me in her thought mode bloodsympathy is so much deeper than thoughtmode that it may result in very different expression verbally  we have made the mistake of turning life inside out of dragging the dayself into the night and spreading the nightself over into the day we have made love and sex a matter of seeing and hearing and of dayconscious manipulation we have made men and women come together on the grounds of this superficial likeness and commonaltytheir mental and upper sympathetic consciousness and so we have forced the blood to submission which means we force it into disintegration  we have too much light in the night and too much sleep in the day it is an evil thing for us to prolong as we do the mental visual ideal consciousness far into the night when the hour has come for this upper consciousness to fade for the blood alone to know and to act by provoking the reaction of the great bloodstress the sexreaction from the upper outer mental consciousness and mental lasciviousness of conscious purpose we thereby destroy the very blood in our bodies we prevent it from having its own dynamic sway we prevent it from coming to its own dynamic crisis and connection from finding its own fundamental being no matter how we work our sex from the upper or outer consciousness we dont achieve anything but the falsification and impoverishment of our own bloodlife we have no choice either we must withdraw from interference or slowly deteriorate  we have made a corresponding mistake in sleeping on into the day once the sun rises our constitution changes once the sun is well up our sleepsupposing our life fairly normalis no longer truly sleep when the sun comes up the centers of active dynamic upper consciousness begin to wake the blood changes its vibration and even its chemical constitution and then we too ought to wake we do ourselves great damage by sleeping too long into the day the halfhours sleep after midday meal is a readjustment but the long hours of morning sleep are just a damage we submit our now active centers of upper consciousness to the dominion of the bloodautomatic flow we chain ourselves down in our morning sleep we transmute the mornings bloodstrength into false dreams and into an everincreasing force of inertia and naturally in the same line of inertia we persist from bad to worse  with the result that our chaineddown active nervecenters are halfshattered before we arise we never become newly dayconscious because we have subjected our powerful centers of dayconsciousness to be trampled and wasted into dreams and inertia by the heavy flow of the bloodautomatism in the morning sleeps then we arise with a feeling of the monotony and automatism of life there is no good glad refreshing we feel tired to start with and so we protract our dayconsciousness on into the night when we do at last begin to come awake and we tell ourselves we must sleep sleep sleep in the morning and the daytime it is better to sleep only six hours than to prolong sleep on and on when the sun has risen every man and woman should be forced out of bed soon after the sun has risen particularly the nervous ones and forced into physical activity soon after dawn the vast majority of people should be hard at work if not they will soon be nervously diseased     chapter xv  the lower self   so it comes about that the moon is the planet of our nights as the sun of our days and this is not just accidental or even mechanical the influence of the moon upon the tides and upon us is not just an accident in phenomena it is the result of the creation of the universe by life itself it was life itself which threw the moon apart on the one hand the sun on the other and it is life itself which keeps the dynamicvital relation constant between the moon and the living individuals of the globe the moon is as dependent upon the life of individuals for her continued existence as each single individual is dependent upon the moon  the same with the sun the sun sets and has his perfect polarity in the lifecircuit established between him and all living individuals break that circuit and the sun breaks without man beasts butterflies trees toads the sun would gutter out like a spent lamp it is the lifeemission from individuals which feeds his burning and establishes his sunheart in its powerful equilibrium  the same with the moon she lives from us primarily and we from her everything is a question of relativity not only is every force relative to other force or forces but every existence is relative to other existences not only does the life of man depend on man beast and herb but on the sun and moon and the stars and in another manner the existence of the moon depends absolutely on the life of herb beast and man the existence of the moon depends upon the life of individuals that which alone is original without the life of individuals the moon would fall asunder and the moon particularly because she is polarized dynamically to this our own earth we do not know what faroff life breathes between the stars and the sun but our life alone supports the moon just as the moon is the pole of our single terrestrial individuality  therefore we must know that between the moon and each individual being exists a vital dynamic flow the life of individuals depends directly upon the moon just as the moon depends directly upon the life of individuals  but in what way does the life of individuals depend directly upon the moon  the moon is the mother of darkness she is the clue to the active darkness and we below the waist we have our being in darkness below the waist we are sightless when in the daytime our life is polarized upwards towards the open sunwakened eyes and the mind which sees in vision then the powerful dynamic centers of the lower body act in subservience in their negative polarity and then we flow upwards we go forth seeking the universe in vision speech and thoughtwe go forth to see all things to hear all things to know all things by acquaintance and by knowledge one flood of dynamic flow are we upwards polarized in our tallness and our wideeyed spirit seeking to bring all the universe into the range of our conscious individuality and eager always to make new worlds out of this old world to bud new green tips on the tree of life just as a tree would die if it were not making new green tips upon all its vast old world of a body so the whole universe would perish if man and beast and herb were not always putting forth a newness the toad taking a vivider color spreading his hands a little more gently developing a more rus√© intelligence the birds adding a new note to their speech and song a new sharp swerve to their flight a new nicety to their nests and man making new worlds new civilizations if it were not for this striving into new creation on the part of living individuals the universe would go dead gradually gradually and fall asunder like a tree that ceases to put forth new green tips and to advance out a little further  but each new tip arises out of the apparent death of the old the preceding one old leaves have got to fall old forms must die and if men must at certain periods fall into death in millions why so must the leaves fall every single autumn and dead leaves make good mold and so dead men even dead mens souls  so if death has to be the goal for a great number then let it be so if america must invent this poisongas let her when death is our goal of goals we shall invent the means of death let our professions of benevolence be what they will  but this time it seems to me we have consciously and responsibly to carry ourselves through the winterperiod the period of death and denudation that is some of us have some nation even must for there are not now as in the roman times any great reservoirs of energetic barbaric life goths gauls germans slavs tartars the world is very full of people but all fixed in civilizations of their own and they all have all our vices all our mechanisms and all our means of destruction this time the leading civilization cannot die out as greece rome persia died it must suffer a great collapse maybe but it must carry through all the collapse the living clue to the next civilization its no good thinking we can leave it to china or japan or india or africaany of the great swarms  and here we are we dont look much like carrying through to a new era what have we got that will carry through the latest craze is mr einsteins relativity theory curious that everybody catches fire at the word relativity there must be something in the mere suggestion which we have been waiting for but what as far as i can see relativity means for the common amateur mind that there is no one absolute force in the physical universe to which all other forces may be referred there is no one single absolute central principle governing the world the great cosmic forces or mechanical principles can only be known in their relation to one another and can only exist in their relation to one another but says einstein this relation between the mechanical forces is constant and may be expressed by a mathematical formula which mathematical formula may be used to equate all mechanical forces of the universe  i hope that is not scientifically all wrong it is what i understand of the einstein theory what i doubt is the equation formula it seems to me also that the velocity of light through space is the deus ex machina in einsteins physics somebody will some day put salt on the tail of light as it travels through space and then its simple velocity will split up into something complex and the relativity formula will fall to bitsbut i am a confirmed outsider so ill hold my tongue  all i know is that people have got the word relativity into their heads and catchwords always refer to some latent idea or conception in the popular mind it has taken a jew to knock the last centerpin out of our ideally spinning universe the jewish intelligence for centuries has been picking holes in our ideal systemscientific and sociological very good thing for us now mr einstein we are glad to say has pulled out the very axle pin at least that is how the vulgar mind understands it the equation formula doesnt countso now the universe according to the popular mind can wobble about without being pinned downreally an anarchical conclusion but the jewish mind insidiously drives us to anarchical conclusions we are glad to be driven from false automatic fixities anyhow and once we are driven right on to nihilism we may find a way through  so there is nothing absolute left in the universe nothing lord haldane says pure knowledge is absolute as far as it goes no doubt but pure knowledge is only such a tiny bit of the universe and always relative to the thing known and to the knower  i feel inclined to relativity myself i think there is no one absolute principle in the universe i think everything is relative but i also feel most strongly that in itself each individual living creature is absolute in its own being and that all things in the universe are just relative to the individual living creature and that individual living creatures are relative to each other  and what about a goal there is no final goal but every step taken has its own little relative goal so what about the next step  well first and foremost that every individual creature shall come to its own particular and individual fullness of beingvery nice very prettybut how well through a living dynamic relation to other creaturesvery nice again pretty little adjectives but what sort of a living dynamic relationwell not the relation of love thats one thing nor of brotherhood nor equality the next relation has got to be a relationship of men towards men in a spirit of unfathomable trust and responsibility service and leadership obedience and pure authority men have got to choose their leaders and obey them to the death and it must be a system of culminating aristocracy society tapering like a pyramid to the supreme leader  all of which sounds very distasteful at the moment but upon all the vital lessons we have learned during our era of love and spirit and democracy we can found our new order  we wanted to be all of a piece and we couldnt bring it off because we just arent all of a piece we wanted first to have nothing but nice daytime selves awfully nice and kind and refined but it didnt work because whether we want it or not weve got nighttime selves and the most spiritual woman ever born or made has to perform her natural functions just like anybody else we must always keep in line with this fact  well then we have nighttime selves and the nightself is the very basis of the dynamic self the bloodconsciousness and the bloodpassion is the very source and origin of us not that we can stay at the source nor even make a goal of the source as freud does the business of living is to travel away from the source but you must start every single day fresh from the source you must rise every day afresh out of the dark sea of the blood  when you go to sleep at night you have to say here dies the man i am and know myself to be and when you rise in the morning you have to say here rises an unknown quantity which is still myself  the self which rises naked every morning out of the dark sleep of the passionate hoarselycalling blood this is the unit for the next society and the polarizing of the passionate blood in the individual towards life and towards leader this must be the dynamic of the next civilization the intense passionate yearning of the soul towards the soul of a stronger greater individual and the passionate bloodbelief in the fulfillment of this yearning will give men the next motive for life  we have to sink back into the darkness and the elemental consciousness of the blood and from this rise again but there is no rising until the bath of darkness and extinction is accomplished  as social units as civilized men we have to do what we do as physical organisms every day the sun sets from the sky and darkness falls and every day when this happens the tide of life turns in us instead of flowing upwards and outwards towards mental consciousness and activity it turns back to flow downwards downwards towards the digestion processes downwards further to the great sexual conjunctions downwards to sleep  this is the soul now retreating back from the outer life of day back to the origins and so it stays its hour at the first great sensual stations the solar plexus and the lumbar ganglion but the tide ebbs on down to the immense almost inhuman passionate darkness of sex the strange and moonlike intensity of the hypogastric plexus and the sacral ganglion then deep deeper past the last great station of the darkest psyche down to the earths center then we sleep  and the moon is the tideturner the moon is the great cosmic pole which calls us back back out of our dayself back through the moonlit darknesses of the sensual planes to sleep it is the moon that sways the blood and sways us back into the extinction of the bloodand as the soul retreats back into the sea of its own darkness the mind stage by stage enjoys the mental consciousness that belongs to this retreat back into the sensual deeps and then it goes extinguished there is sleep  and so we resolve back towards our elementals we dissolve back out of the upper consciousness out of mind and sight and speech back down into the deep and massive swaying consciousness of the dark living blood at the last hour of sex i am no more than a powerful wave of mounting blood which seeks to surge and join with the answering sea in the other individual when the sea of individual blood which i am at that hour heaves and finds its pure contact with the sea of individual blood which is the woman at that hour then each of us enters into the wholeness of our deeper infinitude our profound fullness of being in the ocean of our oneness and our consciousness  this is under the spell of the moon of seaborn aphrodite mother and bitter goddess for i am carried away from my sunny dayself into this other tremendous self where knowledge will not save me but where i must obey as the sea obeys the tides yet however much i go i know that i am all the while myself in my going  this then is the duality of my day and my night being a duality so bitter to an adolescent for the adolescent thinks with shame and terror of his night he would wish to have no nightself but it is moloch and he cannot escape it  the tree is born of its roots and its leaves and we of our days and our nights without the nightconsummation we are trees without roots  and the nightconsummation takes place under the spell of the moon it is one pure motion of meeting and oneing but even so it is a circuit not a straight line one pure motion of meeting and oneing until the flash breaks forth when the two are one and this this flashing moment of the ignition of two seas of blood this is the moment of begetting but the begetting of a child is less than the begetting of the man and the woman woman is begotten of man at that moment into her greater self and man is begotten of woman this is the main and that which cannot be fulfilled perfected in the two individuals that which cannot take fire into individual life this trickles down and is the seed of a new life destined ultimately to fulfill that which the parents could not fulfill so it is for ever  sex then is a polarization of the individual blood in man towards the individual blood in woman it is more also but in its prime functional reality it is this and sex union means bringing into connection the dynamic poles of sex in man and woman  in sex we have our basic most elemental being here we have our most elemental contact it is from the hypogastric plexus and the sacral ganglion that the dark forces of manhood and womanhood sparkle from the dark plexus of sympathy run out the acute intense sympathetic vibrations direct to the corresponding pole or so it should be in genuine passionate love there is no mental interference there is even no interference of the upper centers love is supposed to be blind though modern love wears strong spectacles  but love is really blind without sight or scent or hearing the powerful magnetic current vibrates from the hypogastric plexus in the female vibrating on to the air like some intense wireless message and there is immediate response from the sacral ganglion in some male and then sight and dayconsciousness begin to fade in the lower animals apparently any male can receive the vibration of any female and if need be even across long distances of space but the higher the development the more individual the attunement every wireless station can only receive those messages which are in its own vibration key so with sex in specialized individuals from the powerful dynamic center the female sends out her dark summons the intense dark vibration of sex and according to her nature she receives her responses from the males the male enters the magnetic field of the female he vibrates helplessly in response there is established at once a dynamic circuit more or less powerful it would seem as if while ever life remains free and wild and independent the sexcircuit while it lasts is omnipotent there is one electric flow which encompasses one male and one female or one male and one particular group of females all polarized in the same key of vibration  this circuit of vital sex magnetism at first loose and wide gradually closes and becomes more powerful contracts and grows more intense until the two individuals arrive into contact and even then the pulse and flow of attraction and recoil varies in free wild life each touch brings about an intense recoil and each recoil causes an intense sympathetic attraction so goes on the strange battle of desire until the consummation is reached  it is the precise parallel of what happens in a thunderstorm when the dynamic forces of the moon and the sun come into collision the result is threefold first the electric flash then the birth of pure water new water  so it is in sex relation there is a threefold result first the flash of pure sensation and of real electricity then there is the birth of an entirely new state of blood in each partner and then there is the liberation  but the main thing as in the thunderstorm is the absolute renewal of the atmosphere in this case the blood it would no doubt be found that the electrodynamic condition of the white and red corpuscles of the blood was quite different after sex union and that the chemical composition of the fluid of the blood was quite changed  and in this renewal lies the great magic of sex the life of an individual goes on apparently the same from day to day but as a matter of fact there is an inevitable electric accumulation in the nerves and the blood an accumulation which weighs there and broods there with intolerable pressure and the only possible means of relief and renewal is in pure passional interchange there is and must be a pure passional interchange from the upper self as when men unite in some great creative or religious or constructive activity or as when they fight each other to the death the great goal of creative or constructive activity or of heroic victory in fight must always be the goal of the daytime self but the very possibility of such a goal arises out of the vivid dynamism of the conscious blood and the blood in an individual finds its great renewal in a perfected sex circuit  a perfected sex circuit and a successful sex union and there can be no successful sex union unless the greater hope of purposive constructive activity fires the soul of the man all the time or the hope of passionate purposive destructive activity the two amount religiously to the same thing within the individual sex as an end in itself is a disaster a vice but an ideal purpose which has no roots in the deep sea of passionate sex is a greater disaster still and now we have only these two things sex as a fatal goal which is the essential theme of modern tragedy or ideal purpose as a deadly parasite sex passion as a goal in itself always leads to tragedy there must be the great purposive inspiration always present but the automatic idealpurpose is not even a tragedy it is a slow humiliation and sterility  the great thing is to keep the sexes pure and by pure we dont mean an ideal sterile innocence and similarity between boy and girl we mean pure maleness in a man pure femaleness in a woman woman is really polarized downwards towards the center of the earth her deep positivity is in the downward flow the moonpull and man is polarized upwards towards the sun and the days activity women and men are dynamically different in everything even in the mind where we seem to meet we are really utter strangers we may speak the same verbal language men and women as turk and german might both speak latin but whatever a man says his meaning is something quite different and changed when it passes through a womans ears and though you reverse the sexual polarity the flow between the sexes still the difference is the same the apparent mutual understanding in companionship between a man and a woman is always an illusion and always breaks down in the end  woman can polarize her consciousness upwards she can obtain a hand even over her sex receptivity she can divert even the electric spasm of coition into her upper consciousness it was the trick which the snake and the apple between them taught her the snake whose consciousness is only dynamic and noncerebral the snake who has no mental life but only an intensely vivid dynamic mind he envied the human race its mental consciousness and he knew this intensely wise snake that the one way to make humanity pay more than the price of mental consciousness was to pervert woman into mentality to stimulate her into the upper flow of consciousness  for the true polarity of consciousness in woman is downwards her deepest consciousness is in the loins and belly even when perverted it is so the great flow of female consciousness is downwards down to the weight of the loins and round the circuit of the feet pervert this and make a false flow upwards to the breast and head and you get a race of intelligent women delightful companions tricky courtesans clever prostitutes noble idealists devoted friends interesting mistresses efficient workers brilliant managers women as good as men at all the manly tricks and better because they are so very headlong once they go in for mens tricks but then after a while pop it all goes the moment woman has got mans ideals and tricks drilled into her the moment she is competent in the manly worldtheres an end of it shes had enough shes had more than enough she hates the thing she has embraced she becomes absolutely perverse and her one end is to prostitute herself and her ideals to sex which is her business at the present moment  we bruise the serpents head his flat and brainless head but his revenge of bruising our heel is a good one the heels through which the powerful downward circuit flows these are bruised in us numbed with a horrible neurotic numbness the dark strong flow that polarizes us to the earths center is hampered broken we become flimsy fungoid beings with no roots and no hold in the earth like mushrooms the serpent has bruised our heel till we limp the lame gods the enslaved gods the toiling limpers moaning for the woman you dont find the sun and moon playing at pals in the sky their beams cross the great gulf which is between them  so with man and woman they must stand clear again they must fight their way out of their selfconsciousness there is nothing else or rather each must fight the other out of selfconsciousness instead of this leprous forbearance which we are taught to practice in our intimate relationships there should be the most intense open antagonism if your wife flirts with other men and you dont like it say so before them all before wife and man and all say you wont have it if she seems to you false in any circumstance tell her so angrily furiously and stop her never mind about being justified if you hate anything she does turn on her in a fury harry her and make her life a hell so long as the real hot rage is in you dont silently hate her or silently forbear it is such a dirty trick so mean and ungenerous if you feel a burning rage turn on her and give it to her and never repent itll probably hurt you much more than it hurts her but never repent for your real hot rages whether theyre justifiable or not if you care one sweet straw for the woman and if she makes you that you cant bear any more give it to her and if your heart weeps tears of blood afterwards tell her youre thankful shes got it for once and you wish she had it worse  the same with wives and their husbands if a womans husband gets on her nerves she should fly at him if she thinks him too sweet and smarmy with other people she should let him have it to his nose straight out she should lead him a dogs life and never swallow her bile  with wife or husband you should never swallow your bile it makes you go all wrong inside always let fly tooth and nail and never repent no matter what sort of a figure you make  we have a vice of love of softness and sweetness and smarminess and intimacy and promiscuous kindness and all that sort of thing we think its so awfully nice of us to be like that in ourselves but in our wives or our husbands it gets on our nerves horribly yet we think it oughtnt to so we swallow our spleen  we shouldnt when jesus said if thine eye offend thee pluck it out he was beside the point the eye doesnt really offend us we are rather fond of our own squint eye it only offends the person who cares for us and its up to this person to pluck it out  this holds particularly good of the love and intimacy vice itll never offend us in ourselves while it will be gall and wormwood to our wife or husband and it is on this promiscuous love and intimacy and kindness and sweetness all a vice that our selfconsciousness really rests if we are battered out of this we shall be battered out of selfconsciousness  and so men drive your wives beat them out of their selfconsciousness and their soft smarminess and good lovely idea of themselves absolutely tear their lovely opinion of themselves to tatters and make them look a holy ridiculous sight in their own eyes wives do the same to your husbands  but fight for your life men fight your wife out of her own selfconscious preoccupation with herself batter her out of it till shes stunned drive her back into her own true mode rip all her nice superimposed modernwoman and wonderfulcreature garb off her reduce her once more to a naked eve and send the apple flying  make her yield to her own real unconscious self and absolutely stamp on the self that shes got in her head drive her forcibly back back into her own true unconscious  and then youve got a harder thing still to do stop her from looking on you as her lover cure her of that if you havent cured her before put the fear of the lord into her that way and make her know shes got to believe in you again and in the deep purpose you stand for but before you can do that youve got to stand for some deep purpose its no good faking one up you wont take a woman in not really even when she chooses to be taken in for prettiness sake it wont do you any good  but combat her combat her in her sexual pertinacity and in her secret glory or arrogance in the sexual goal combat her in her cocksure belief that she knows and that she is right take it all out of her make her yield once more to the male leadership if youve got anywhere to lead to if you havent best leave the woman alone she has one goal of her own anyhow and its better than your nullity and emptiness  youve got to take a new resolution into your soul and break off from the old way youve got to know that youre a man and being a man means you must go on alone ahead of the woman to break a way through the old world into the new and youve got to be alone and youve got to start off ahead and if you dont know which direction to take look round for the man your heart will point out to you and followand never look back because if lots wife looking back was turned to a pillar of salt these miserable men for ever looking back to their women for guidance they are miserable pillars of halfrotten tears  youll have to fight to make a woman believe in you as a real man a real pioneer no man is a man unless to his woman he is a pioneer youll have to fight still harder to make her yield her goal to yours her night goal to your day goal the moon the planet of women sways us back from our dayself sways us back from our real social unison sways us back like a retreating tide in a friction of criticism and separation and social disintegration that is womans inevitable mode let her words be what they will her goal is the deep sensual individualism of secrecy and nightexclusiveness hostile with guarded doors and youll have to fight very hard to make a woman yield her goal to yours to make her in her own soul believe in your goal as the goal beyond in her goal as the way by which you go shell never believe until you have your soul filled with a profound and absolutely inalterable purpose that will yield to nothing least of all to her shell never believe until in your soul you are cut off and gone ahead into the dark  she may of course already love you and love you for yourself but the love will be a nest of scorpions unless it is overshadowed by a little fear or awe of your further purpose a living belief in your going beyond her into futurity  but when once a woman does believe in her man in the pioneer which he is the pioneer who goes on ahead beyond her into the darkness in front and who may be lost to her for ever in this darkness when once she knows the pain and beauty of this belief knows that the loneliness of waiting and following is inevitable that it must be so ah then how wonderful it is how wonderful it is to come back to her at evening as she sits half in fear and waits how good it is to come home to her how good it is then when the night falls how richly the evening passes and then for her at last all that she has lost during the day to have it again between her arms all that she has missed to have it poured out for her and a richness and a wonder she had never expected it is her hour her goal thats what it is to have a wife  ah how good it is to come home to your wife when she believes in you and submits to your purpose that is beyond her then how wonderful this nightfall is how rich you feel tired with all the burden of the day in your veins turning home then you too turn to your other goal to the splendor of darkness between her arms and you know the goal is there for you how rich that feeling is and you feel an unfathomable gratitude to the woman who loves you and believes in your purpose and receives you into the magnificent dark gratification of her embrace thats what it is to have a wife  but no man ever had a wife unless he served a great predominant purpose otherwise he has a lover a mistress no matter how much she may be married to him unless his days have a living purpose constructive or destructive but a purpose beyond her and all she stands for unless his days have this purpose and his soul is really committed to his purpose she will not be a wife she will be only a mistress and he will be her lover  if the man has no purpose for his days then to the woman alone remains the goal of her nights the great sex goal and this goal is no goal but always cries for the something beyond for the rising in the morning and the going forth beyond the man disappearing ahead into the distance of futurity that which his purpose stands for the future the sex goal needs absolutely needs this further departure and if there be no further departure no great way of belief on ahead and if sex is the starting point and the goal as well then sex becomes like the bottomless pit insatiable it demands at last the departure into death the only available beyond like carmen or like anna karenina when sex is the starting point and the returning point both then the only issue is death which is plain as a pikestaff in carmen or anna karenina and is the theme of almost all modern tragedy our one hackneyed hackneyed theme ecstasies and agonies of love and final passion of death death is the only pure beautiful conclusion of a great passion lovers pure lovers should say let it be so  and one is always tempted to say let it be so but no let it be not so only i say this let it be a great passion and then death rather than a false or faked purpose tolstoi said no to the passion and the death conclusion and then drew into the dreary issue of a false conclusion his books were better than his life better the womans goal sex and death than some false goal of mans  better anna karenina and vronsky a thousand times than natasha and that porpoise of a pierre this pretty slightly sordid couple tried so hard to kid themselves that the porpoise pierre was puffing with great purpose better vronsky than tolstoi himself in my mind better vronskys final statement as a soldier i am still some good as a man i am a ruinbetter that than tolstoi and tolstoiism and that beastly peasant blouse the old man wore  better passion and death than any more of these isms no more of the old purpose done up in aspic better passion and death  but stillwe might live mightnt we  for heavens sake answer plainly no if you feel like it no good temporizing     epilogue   tutti i salmi finiscono in gloria  all the psalms wind up with the gloriaas it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end amen  well then amen  i hope you say amen along with me dear little reader if there be any dear little reader who has got so far if not i say amen all by myselfbut dont you think the show is all over ive got another volume up my sleeve and after a year or two years when i have shaken it down my sleeve i shall bring it and lay it at the foot of your liberty statue oh columbia as i do this one  i suppose columbia means the stateshail columbiai suppose etymologically it is a nest of turtledoves lat columba a dove coo me softly then columbia dont roar me like the sucking doves of the critics of my psychoanalysis and the unconscious  and when i lay this little book at the foot of the liberty statue that brawny lady is not to look down her nose and bawl do you see any green in my eye of course i dont dear lady i only see the reflection of that torchor is it a carrotwhich you are holding up to light the way into new york harbor well many an ass has strayed across the uneasy paddock of the atlantic to nibble your carrot dear lady and i must say you can keep on slicing off nice little carrotslices of guineas and doubloons for an extraordinarily inexhaustible long time and innumerable asses can collect themselves nice little heaps of golden carrotslices and then lift up their heads and brag over them with fairly pandemoniac yells of gratification of course i dont see any green in your eye dear libertas unless it is the smallest glint from the carrottips the gleam in your eye is golden oh columbia  nevertheless and in spite of all this up trots this here little ass and makes you a nice present of this pretty book you neednt sniff and glance at your carrotsceptre lady liberty you neednt throw down the thinnest carrotparing you can pare off and then say why should i pay for this tripe this wordy mass of rather revolting nonsense you cant pay for it darling if i didnt make you a present of it you could never buy it so dont shake your carrotsceptre and feel supercilious heres a gift for you missis you can look in its mouth too mind it doesnt bite youno you neednt bother to put your carrot behind your back nobody wants to snatch it  how do you do columbia look i brought you a posy this nice little posy of words and wisdom which i made for you in the woods of ebersteinburg on the borders of the black forest near baden baden in germany in this summer of scanty grace but nice weather i made it specially for youwhitman for whom i have an immense regard says these states i suppose i ought to say those states if the publisher would let me id dedicate this book to you to those states because i wrote this book entirely for you columbia you may not take it as a compliment you may even smell a tiny bit of schwarzwald sap in it and be finally disgusted i admit that trees ought to think twice before they flourish in such a disgraced place as the fatherland chi va coi zoppi all anno zoppica but youve not only to gather ye rosebuds while ye may but where ye may and so as i said before the black forest etc  i know columbia dear libertas youll take my posy and put your carrot aside for a minute and smile and say im sure mr lawrence it is a long time since i had such a perfectly beautiful bunch of ideas brought me and i shall blush and look sheepish and say so glad you think so i believe youll find theyll keep fresh quite a long time if you put them in water whereupon you columbia with real american gallantry oh theyll keep for ever mr lawrence they couldnt be so cruel as to go and die such perfectly lovelycolored ideas lovely thank you ever ever so much  just think of it columbia how pleased we shall be with one another and how much nicer it will be than if you snorted highfalutin nonsenseor wordy mass of repulsive rubbish  when they were busy making italy and were just going to put it in the oven to bake that is when garibaldi and vittorio emmanuele had won their victories at caserta naples prepared to give them a triumphant entry so there sat the little king in his carriage he had short legs and huge swagger mustaches and a very big bump of philoprogeniture the town was all done up in spite of the rain and down either side of the wide street were hasty statues of large wellfleshed ladies each one holding up a forefinger we dont know what the king thought but the staff held their breath the kings appetite for strapping ladies was more than notorious and naturally it looked as if naples had done it on purpose  as a matter of fact the forefinger meant italia una italy shall be one ask don sturzo  now you see how risky statues are how many nice little asses and poets trot over the atlantic and catch sight of liberty holding up this carrot of desire at arms length and fairly hear her say as one does to ones pug dog with a lump of sugar beg begand jump jump then and each little ass and poodle begins to beg and to jump and theres a rare game round about liberty zap zap zappertyzap  do lower the carrot gentle liberty and let us talk nicely and sensibly i dont like you as a carotaia precious  talking about the moon it is thrilling to read the announcements of professor pickering of harvard that its almost a dead cert that theres life on our satellite it is almost as certain that theres life on the moon as it is certain there is life on mars the professor bases his assertions on photographshundreds of photographsof a crater with a circumference of thirtyseven miles im not satisfied i demand to know the yards feet and inches you dont come it over me with the triteness of these round numbers  hundreds of photographic reproductions have proved irrefutably the springing up at dawn with an unbelievable rapidity of vast fields of foliage which come into blossom just as rapidly sic and which disappear in a maximum period of eleven daysagain im not satisfied i want to know if theyre cabbages cress mustard or marigolds or dandelions or daisies fields of foliage mark you and blossom come now if you can get so far professor pickering you might have a shrewd guess as to whether the blossoms are good to eat or if theyre purely for ornament  i am only waiting at last for an aeroplane to land on one of these fields of foliage and find a donkey grazing peacefully heehaw  the plates moreover show that great blizzards snowstorms and volcanic eruptions are also frequent so no doubt the blossoms are edelweiss  we find says the professor a living world at our very doors where life in some respects resembles that of mars all i can say is pray come in mr moony and how is your cousin signor martian  now im sure professor pickerings photographs and observations are really wonderful but his explanations come now columbia where is your highfalutin nonsense trumpet vast fields of foliage which spring up at dawn  and come into blossom just as quickly  are rather too flowery even for my flowery soul but there truth is stranger than fiction  ill bet my moon against the professors anyhow  so long columbia a riverderci
