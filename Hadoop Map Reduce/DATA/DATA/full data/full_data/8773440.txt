8773440	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle     book xxiafternoon and evening of friedrichs life17631786     chapter iprefatory  the twelve herculeslabors of this king have ended here what was required of him in worldhistory is accomplished there remain to friedrich twentythree years more of life which to prussian history are as full of importance as ever but do not essentially concern european history europe having gone the road we now see it in on the grand worldtheatre the curtain has fallen for a new act friedrichs part like everybodys for the present is played out in fact there is during the rest of his reign nothing of worldhistory to be dwelt on anywhere america it has been decided shall be english prussia be a nation the french as finis of their attempt to cut germany in four find themselves sunk into torpor abeyance and dryrot fermenting towards they know not what towards spontaneous combustion in the year 1789 and for long years onwards  there readers there is the next milestone for you in the history of mankind that universal burningup as in hellfire of human shams the oath of twentyfive million men which has since become that of all men whatsoever rather than live longer under lies we will diethat is the new act in worldhistory new actor we may call it new part drama of worldhistory part third if part second was 1800 years ago this i reckon will be part third this is the truly celestialinfernal event the strangest we have seen for a thousand years celestial in one part in the other infernal for it is withal the breaking out of universal mankind into anarchy into the faith and practice of nogovernmentthat is to say if you will be candid into unappeasable revolt against shamgovernors and shamteacherswhich i do charitably define to be a search most unconscious yet in deadly earnest for true governors and teachers that is the one fact of worldhistory worth dwelling on at this day and friedrich cannot be said to have had much hand farther in that  nor is the progress of a french or european world all silently ripening and rotting towards such issue a thing one wishes to dwell on only when the spontaneous combustion breaks out and manycolored with loud noises envelops the whole world in anarchic flame for long hundreds of years then has the event come there is the thing for all men to mark and to study and scrutinize as the strangest thing they ever saw centuries of it yet lying ahead of us several sad centuries sordidly tumultuous and good for little say two centuries yetsay even ten of such a process before the old is completely burnt out and the new in any state of sightliness millennium of anarchiesabridge it spend your heartsblood upon abridging it ye heroic wise that are to come for it is the consummation of all the anarchies that are and werewhich i do trust always means the death temporary death of them death of the anarchies or a world once more built wholly on fact better or worse and the lying jargoning professor of shamfact whose name is legion who as yet oftenest little conscious of himself goes tumulting and swarming from shore to shore become a species extinct and well known to be gone down to tophet  there were bits of anarchies before little and greater but till that of france in 1789 there was none long memorable all were pygmies in comparison and not worth mentioning separately in 1772 the anarchy of poland which had been a considerable anarchy for about three hundred years got itself extinguishedwhat we may call extinguisheddecisive surgery being then first exercised upon it an anarchy put in the sure way of extinction in 1775 again there began over seas another anarchy much more considerablelittle dreaming that it could be called an anarchy on the contrary calling itself liberty rights of man and singing boundless iopaeans to itself as is common in such cases an anarchy which has been challenging the universe to show the like ever since and which has at last flamed up as an independent phenomenon unexampled in the hideously suicidal wayand does need much to get burnt out that matters may begin anew on truer conditions but neither the partition of poland nor the american war of independence have much general importance or except as precursors of 1789 are worth dwelling on in history from us here so far as friedrich is concerned with them they may deserve some transient mention more or less but worldhistory eager to be at the general funeralpile and ultimate burningup of shams in this poor world will have less and less to say of small tragedies and premonitory symptoms  curious how the busy and continually watchful and speculating friedrich busied about his dangers from austrian encroachments from russianturk wars bavarian successions and other troubles and anarchies close by saw nothing to dread in france nothing to remark there except carelessly from time to time its beggarly decaying condition so strangely sunk in arts in arms in finance oftenest an object of pity to him for he still has a love for franceand reads not the least sign of that immeasurable allengulfing french revolution which was in the wind neither voltaire nor he have the least anticipation of such a thing voltaire and he see to their contentment superstition visibly declining friedrich rather disapproves the heat of voltaires procedures on the infame why be in such heat other nonsense quite equal to it will be almost sure to follow take care of your own skin voltaire and he are deeply alive especially voltaire is to the horrors and miseries which have issued on mankind from a fanatic popish superstition or creed of incredibilitieswhich except from the throat outwards from the bewildered tongue outwards the orthodox themselves cannot believe but only pretend and struggle to believe this voltaire calls the infamous and thiswhat name can any of us give it the man who believes in falsities is very miserable the man who cannot believe them but only struggles and pretends to believe and yet being armed with the power of the sword industriously keeps menacing and slashing all round to compel every neighbor to do like him what is to be done with such a man human nature calls him a social nuisance needing to be handcuffed gagged and abated human nature if it be in a terrified and imperilled state with the sword of this fellow swashing round it calls him infamous and a monster of chaos he is indeed the select monster of that region the patriarch of all the monsters little as he dreams of being such an angel of heaven the poor caitiff dreams himself rather and in cheery moments is conscious of beingbedlam holds in it no madder article and i often think he will again need to be tied up feeble as he now is in comparison disinclined though men are to manacling and tying so many helpless infirm souls are wandering about not knowing their right hand from their left who fall a prey to him linfame i also name himknowing well enough how little he in his poor muddled drugged and stupefied mind is conscious of deserving that name more signal enemy to god and friend of the other party walks not the earth in our day  anarchy in the shape of religious slavery was what voltaire and friedrich saw all round them anarchy in the shape of revolt against authorities was what friedrich and voltaire had never dreamed of as possible and had not in their minds the least idea of in one or perhaps two places you may find in voltaire a grim and rather glad forethought not given out as prophecy but felt as interior assurance in a moment of hope how these priestly sham hierarchies will be pulled to pieces probably on the sudden once people are awake to them yes my muchsuffering m de voltaire be pulled to pieces or go aloft like the awakening of vesuvius one dayvesuvius awakening after ten centuries of slumber when his crater is all grown grassy bushy copiously tenanted by wolves i am told which after premonitory grumblings heeded by no wolf or bush he will hurl bodily aloft ten acres at a time in a very tremendous manner first modern eruption of vesuvius ad 1631 after long interval of rest a thought like this about the priestly shamhierarchies i have found somewhere in voltaire but of the social and civic shamhierarchies which are likewise accursed if they knew it and indeed are junior copartners of the priestly and in a sense sons and products of them and cannot escape being partakers of their plagues there is no hint in voltaire though voltaire stood at last only fifteen years from the fact 17781793 nor in friedrich though he lived almost to see the fact beginning  friedrichs history being henceforth that of a prussian king is interesting to prussia chiefly and to us little otherwise than as the biography of a distinguished fellowman friedrichs biography his physiognomy as he grows old quietly on his own harvestfield among his own people this has still an interest and for any feature of this we shall be eager enough but this withal is the most of what we now want and not very much even of this friedrich the unique king not having as a man any such depth and singularity tragic humorous devotionally pious or other as to authorize much painting in that aspect extreme brevity beseems us in these circumstances and indeed there areas has already happened in different parts of this enterprise nature herself in her silent way being always something of an artist in such thingsother circumstances which leave us no choice as to that of detail available details if we wished to give them of friedrichs later life are not forthcoming masses of incondite marinestores tumbled out on you dry rubbish shot with uncommon diligence for a hundred years till for rubbishpelion piled on rubbishossa you lose sight of the stars and azimuths whole mountain continents seemingly all of cinders and sweepings though fragments and remnants do lie hidden could you find them againthese are not details that will be available anecdotes there are in quantity but of uncertain quality of doubtful authenticity above all one recollects hardly any anecdote whatever that seems completely credible or renders to us the physiognomy of friedrich in a convincing manner so remiss a creature has the prussian clio beenemployed on all kinds of loose errands over the earth and the air and as good as altogether negligent of this most pressing errand in her own house peace be with her poor slut why should we say one other hard word on taking leave of her to all eternity  the practical fact is what we have henceforth to produce is more of the nature of a loose appendix of papers than of a finished narrative loose paperswhich we will hope the reader can by industry be made to understand and tolerate more we cannot do for him no continuous narrative is henceforth possible to us for the sake of friedrichs closing epoch we will visit for the last time that dreary imbroglio under which the memory of friedrich which ought to have been in all the epochs of it bright and legible lies buried and will try to gather as heretofore and put under labels what dwells with oneself as human may have some chance to be humanly interesting in the wildest chaos of marinestores and editorial shortcomings provided only the editors speak truth as these poor fellows do this can be done part the living from the dead pick out what has some meaning leave carefully what has none you will in some small measure pluck up the memory of a hero like drowned honor by the locks and rescue it into visibility  that friedrich on reaching home made haste to get out of the bustle of joyances and exclamations on the streets proceeded straight to his musicchapel in charlottenburg summoning the artists or having them already summoned and had there all alone sitting invisible wrapt in his cloak grauns or somebodys grand tedeum pealed out to him in seas of melodysoothing and salutary to the altered soul revolving many thingsis a popular myth of pretty and appropriate character but a myth only with no real foundation though it has some loose and apparent in preuss ii 46 all the details of it no doubt friedrich had his own thoughts on entering berlin again after such a voyage through the deeps himself his country still here though solitary and in a world of wild shipwrecks he was not without piety but it did not take the devotional form and his habits had nothing of the clerical  what is perfectly known and much better worth knowing is the instantaneous practical alacrity with which he set about repairing that immense miscellany of ruin and the surprising success he had in dealing with it his methods his rapid inventions and procedures in this matter are still memorable to prussia and perhaps might with advantage be better known than they are in some other countries to us what is all we can do with them here they will indicate that this is still the old friedrich with his old activities and promptitudes which indeed continue unabated lively in peace as in war to the end of his life and reign  the speed with which prussia recovered was extraordinary within little more than a year june 1st 1764 the coin was all in order again in 1765 the king had rebuilt not to mention other things in silesia 8000 houses in pommern 6500 rodenbeck ii 234 261 prussia has been a meritorious nation and however cut and ruined is and was in a healthy state capable of recovering soon prussia has defended itself against overwhelming oddsbrave prussia but the real soul of its merit was that of having merited such a king to command it without this king all its valors disciplines resources of war would have availed prussia little no wonder prussia has still a loyalty to its great friedrich to its hohenzollern sovereigns generally without these hohenzollerns prussia had been what we long ago saw it the unluckiest of german provinces and could never have had the pretension to exist as a nation at all without this particular hohenzollern it had been trampled out again after apparently succeeding to have achieved a friedrich the second for king over it was prussias grand merit  an accidental merit thinks the reader no reader you may believe me it is by no means altogether such nay i rather think could we look into the accountbooks of the recording angel for a course of centuries no part of it is such there are nations in which a friedrich is or can be possible and again there are nations in which he is not and cannot to be practically reverent of human worth to the due extent and abhorrent of human want of worth in the like proportion do you understand that art at all i fear notor that you are much forgetting it again human merit do you really love it enough think youhuman scoundrelism brought to the dock for you and branded as scoundrel do you even abhor it enough without that reverence and its corresponding oppositepole of abhorrence there is simply no possibility left that my friend is the outcome and summary of all virtues in this world for a man or for a nation of men it is the supreme strength and glory of a nationwithout which indeed all other strengths and enormities of bullion and arsenals and warehouses are no strength none i should sayand are oftenest even the reverse  nations who have lost this quality or who never had it what friedrich can they hope to be possible among them age after age they grind down their friedrichs contentedly under the hoofs of cattle on their highways and even find it an excellent practice and pride themselves on liberty and equality most certain it is there will no friedrich come to rule there by and by there will none be born there such nations cannot have a king to command them can only have this or the other scandalous swindling copper captain constitutional gilt mountebank or other the like unsalutary entity by way of king and the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children in a frightful and tragical manner little noticed in the penny newspapers and periodical literatures of this generation oh my friends but there is plain business waiting us at hand     chapter iirepairing of a ruined prussia  that of friedrichs sitting wrapt in a cloud of reflections olympianabysmal in the musicchapel at charlottenburg while he had the ambrosian song executed for him there as the preliminary step was a loose myth but the fact lying under it is abundantly certain few sons of adam had more reason for a piously thankful feeling towards the past a piously valiant towards the future what king or man had seen himself delivered from such strangling imbroglios of destruction such devouring rages of a hostile world and the ruin worked by them lay monstrous and appalling all round friedrich is now fiftyone gone unusually old for his age feels himself an old man broken with years and toils and here lies his kingdom in haggard slashed condition worn to skin and bone how is the king resourceless to remedy it that is now the seemingly impossible problem begin itthereby alone will it ever cease to be impossible friedrich begins we may say on the first morrow morning labors at his problem as he did in the march to leuthen finds it to become more possible day after day month after month the farther he strives with it  why not leave it to nature think many with the dismal science at their elbow well that was the easiest plan but it was not friedrichs his remaining moneys 25 million thalers ready for a campaign which has not come he distributes to the most necessitous all his artilleryhorses are parted into ploughteams and given to those who can otherwise get none think what a fine figure of rye and barley instead of mere windlestraws beggary and desolation was realized by that act alone nature is ready to do much will of herself cover with some veil of grass and lichen the nakedness of ruin but her victorious act when she can accomplish it is that of getting you to go with her handsomely and change disaster itself into new wealth into new wisdom and valor which are wealth in all kinds california mere zero to them zero or even a frightful minus quantity friedrichs procedures in this matter i believe to be little less didactic than those other which are so celebrated in war but no dryasdust not even a dryasdust of the dismal science has gone into them rendered men familiar with them in their details and results his silesian landbank jointstock moneys lent on security of land was of itself had i room to explain it an immense furtherance preuss iii 75 oeuvres de frederic vi 84 friedrich many tell us was as great in peace as in war and truly in the economic and material provinces my own impression gathered painfully in darkness and contradiction of the dismalscience doctors is much to that effect a firstrate husbandman as his father had been who not only defended his nation but made it rich beyond what seemed possible and diligently sowed annuals into it and perennials which flourish aloft at this day  mirabeaus monarchie prussienne in 8 thick volumes 8vocomposed or hastily cobbled together some twenty years after this periodcontains the best tabular view one anywhere gets of friedrichs economics military and other practical methods and resourcessolid exact tables these are and intelligent intelligible descriptions done by mauvillon fils the same punctual major mauvillon who used to attend us in duke ferdinands warand so far as mirabeau is concerned the work consists farther of a certain small essay done in big type shoved into the belly of each volume and eloquently recommending with respectful censures and regrets over friedrich the gospel of free trade dear to papa mirabeau the son is himself a convert far above lying even to please papa but one can see the thought of papa gives him new fire of expression they are eloquent ruggedly strong essays those of mirabeau junior upon free tradethey contain in condensed shape everything we were privileged to hear seventy years later from all organs coachhorns jewsharps and scrannelpipes pro and contra on the same sublime subject god is great and plugson of undershot is his prophet thus saith the lord buy in the cheapest market sell in the dearest to which the afflicted human mind listens what it canand after seventy years mournfully asks itself and mirabeau m le comte would there have been in prussia for example any trade at all any nation at all had it always been left free there would have been mere sand and quagmire and a community of wolves and bisons m le comte have the goodness to terminate that litany and take up another  we said friedrich began his problem on the first morrow morning and that is literally true that or even more here is how friedrich takes his stand amid the wreck speedy enough to begin this view of our old friend nussler and him is one of the pieces we can givethanks to herr busching and his beitrage for the last time nussler is now something of a country gentleman so to speak has a pleasant place out to east of berlin is landrath county chairman there landrath of netherbarnim circle where we heard of the cossacks spoiling him he as who not has suffered dreadfully in these tumults here is buschings welcome account     landrath nussler and the king 30th march3d april 1763  march 30th 1763 friedrich on his return to berlin came by the route of tassdorftassdorf in netherbarnim circle 40 odd miles from frankfurt and above 15 from berlinand changed horses there during this little pause among a crowd assembled to see him he was addressed by nussler landrath of the circle who had a very piteous story to tell nussler wished the king joy of his noble victories and of the glorious peace at last achieved may your majesty reign in health and happiness over us many years to the blessing of us alland recommended to his gracious care the extremely ruined and especially by the russians uncommonly devastated circle for which continues busching this industrious landrath had not hitherto been able to extract any effective help generally for the provinces wasted by the russians there had already some poor 300000 thalers 45000 pounds been allowed by a helpful majesty not overrich himself at the moment and of this netherbarnim no doubt gets its share but what is this to such ruin as there is a mere preliminary drop instead of the bucket and buckets we needbusching a dull though solid accurate kind of man heavyfooted and yet always in a hurry always slipshod has nothing of dramatic here far from it but the facts themselves fall naturally into that formin three scenes   i tassdorf still two hours from berlin king nussler and a crowd of people nussler alone daring to speak  king from his carriage ostlers making despatch what is your circle most short of  landrath nussler of horses for ploughing the seedfields of rye to sow them and of bread till the crops come  king rye for bread and to sow with i will give with horses i cannot assist  nussler on representation of privycouncillor van brenkenhof the minister concerned with such things your majesty has been pleased to give the neumark and pommern an allowance of artillery and commissariat horses but poor netherbarnim nobody will speak for it and unless your majestys gracious self please to take pity on it netherbarnim is lost a great many things more he said in presence of a large crowd of men who had gathered round the kings carriage as the horses were being changed and spoke with such force and frankness that the king was surprised and asked  king who are you has forgotten the longserviceable man  nussler i am the nussler who was lucky enough to manage the fixing of the silesian boundaries for your majesty  king ja ja now i know you again bring me all the landraths of the kurmark mark of brandenburg proper electoral mark in a body i will speak with them  nussler all of them but two are in berlin already  king send off estafettes for those two to come at once to berlin and on thursday day after tomorrow come yourself with all the others to the schloss to me i will then have some closer conversation and say what i can and will do for helping of the country kings carriage rolls away with low bows and blessings from nussler and everybody   ii thursday april 1st nussler and assembled landraths at the schloss of berlin to them enter king  nussler whom they have appointed spokesman your majesty has given us peace you will also give us wellbeing in the land again we leave it to highestthesames gracious judgment no limit to highestthesames power it would seem what you will vouchsafe to us as indemnification for the russian plunderings  king be you quiet let me speak have you got a pencil hat er crayon yes well then write and these gentlemen shall dictate to you  how much rye for bread how much for seed how many horses oxen cows their circles do in an entirely pressing way require  consider all that to the bottom and come to me again the day after tomorrow but see that you fix everything with the utmost exactitude for i cannot give much exit king  nussler to the landraths meine herren have the goodness to accompany me to our landschaft house we have a kind of county hall it seems there we will consider everything  and nussler guiding the deliberations which are glad to follow him on every point and writing as protempore secretary has all things brought to luminous protocol in the course of this day and next     iii saturday april 3d in the schloss again nussler and landraths to them the king  nussler we deliver to your majesty the written specification you were graciously pleased to command of us it contains only the indispensablest things that the circles are in need of moreover it regards only the stande richer nobility who pay contribution the gentry adel and other poor people who have been utterly plundered out by the russians are not included in itthe gentry too have suffered very much by the war and the plundering  king what edelleute that are members of stande have you er got in your circle  nussler names them and as finis of the list adds i myself too your majesty i have suffered more than anybody i absolutely could not furnish those 4000 bushels of meal ordered of me by the russians upon which they  king i cannot give to all but if you have poor nobles in your circle who can in no way help themselves i will give them something  nussler has not any in netherbarnim who are altogether in that extreme predicament but knows several in lebus circle names them to the kingand turning to the landrath of lebus and to another who is mute herr you can name some more in lebus and you in teltow circle herr landrath since his majesty permits in a word the king having informed himself and declared his intention nussler leads the landraths to their old county hall and brings to protocol what had taken place  next day the kammer president exchequer president van der groben had nussler with other landraths to dinner during dinner there came from head secretary eichel majestys unwearied clerk of the pells sheepskins or papers an earnest request to von der groben for helpeichel not being able to remember with the requisite precision everything his majesty had bid him put down on this matter you will go herr von nussler be so kind wont you and nussler went and fully illuminated eichel  to the poorest of the nobility busching tells us what is otherwise well known the king gave considerable sums to one circle 12000 pounds to another 9000 pounds 6000 pounds and so on by help of which bounties and of nussler laboring incessantly with all his strength niederbarnim circle got on its feet again no subject having been entirely ruined but all proving able to recover busching beitrage nussler i 401405  this busching fragment is not in the style of the elder dramatists or for the bankside theatre but this represents a fact which befell in gods creation and may have an interest of its own to the practical soul especially in anarchic countries far advanced in the goldnugget and nothing to buy with it career of unexampled prosperities  on these same errands the king is soon going on an inspection journey where we mean to accompany but first one word and one will suffice on the debased coin the peace was no sooner signed than friedrich proceeded on the coin the third week after his arrival home there came out a salutary edict on it april 21st king eager to do it without loss of time yet with the deliberation requisite not at one big leap which might shake to danger of oversetting much commercial arrangement but at two leaps with a halfway station intervening halfway station with a new coinage ready much purer of alloy and marked how much for the benefit of parties with accounts to settle is to commence on trinitatis whitsunday instant from and after whitsunday the improved new coin to be sole legal tender till farther notice farther notice comes accordingly within a year march 29th 1764 pure money of the standard of 1750 honest silver coinage readers may remember linsenbarth the candidatus theologiae and his sack of batzen confiscated at the paekhof shall be ready on the 1st of june instant rodenbeck ii 214 234from and after which day we hear no more of that sad matter finished off in about fourteen months here meanwhile is the inspection journey     kriegsrath roden and the king 6th13th june 1763  june 2d 1763 friedrich left potsdam for westphalia got as far as magdeburg that day intends seeing into matters with his own eyes in that region as in others after so long and sad an absence there are with him friedrich wilhelm prince of prussia a tall young fellow of nineteen generaladjutant von anhalt and one or two prussian military people from magdeburg and onwards the great duke ferdinand accompanieswho is now again governor of magdeburg and a quiet prussian officer as heretofore though with excellent pensions from england and glory from all the world  the royal party goes by halberstadt which suffered greatly in the war thence by minden june 4th and the first thing next day friedrich takes view of the battlefield thereunder ferdinands own guidance doubtless and an interesting thing to both friedrich and him though left silent to us this done they start for lippstadt are received there under joyous clangorous outburst of all the bells and all the honors that same afternoon and towards sunset hamm being the nightquarter ahead are crossing vellinghausen battlegroundwhere doubtless ferdinand again like a dutiful apprentice will explain matters to his old master so far as needful or permissible the conversation i suppose may have been lively and miscellaneous ferdinand mentions a clever businessperson of the name of roden whom he has known in these parts roden the king carefully makes noteand in fact we shall see roden presently and his bit of dialogue with the king recorded by his own hand is our chief errand on this journey from hamm next morning june 6th they get to wesel by 11 am only sixty miles wesel all in gala as lippstadt was or still more than lippstadt and for four days farther they continue there very busy as roden is our chief errand let us attend to roden  wesel monday june 6th dinner being done says an authentic thirdparty rodenbeck ii 217 the king had kammerdirector meyen summoned to him with his registerbooks schedules and reports what they call etats and was but indifferently contented with meyen and them and in short ordering meyen to remodel these into a more distinct conditionwe may now introduce the herr kriegsrath roden a subaltern in rank but who has perhaps a better head than meyen to judge of these etats roden himself shall now report this is the royal dialogue with roden accurately preserved for us by himi wish it had been better worth the readers trouble but its perfect credibility in every point will be some recommendation to it  monday 6th june 1763 about 11 am his majesty arrived in wesel says roden confirming to us the authentic thirdparty i waited on adjutantgeneral colonel von anhalt to announce myself who referred me to kriegsrath coper mein segreter koper is a name we have heard before who told me to be ready so soon as dinner should be over dinner was no sooner over 2 pm or so than the herr kammerdirector meyen with his etats was called in his majesty was not content with these herr meyen was told and they were to be remodelled into a more distinct condition the instant herr meyen stept out i was called in his majesty was standing with his back to the fire and said  king come nearer roden comes nearer prince ferdinand of brunswick whom we generally call duke and great to distinguish him from a little prussian prince ferdinand has told me much good of you where do you come from  roden from soest venerable stoneold little town in vellinghausen region  king did you get my letter  roden yea ihro majestat  king i will give you some employment have you got a pencil  roden yea and took out his notebook and tools which he had bought in a shop a quarter of an hour before  king listen by the war many houses have got ruined i mean that they shall be put in order again for which endto those that cannot themselves help particularly to soest hamm lunen and in part wesel as places that have suffered mosti intend to give the moneys now you must make me an exact list of what is to be done in those places thus king lifting his finger let us fancy dictates roden with brandnew pencil and tablets writes  1 in each of those towns how many ruined houses there are which the proprietors themselves can manage to rebuild 2 how many which the proprietors cannot 3 the vacant grounds or steadings of such proprietors as are perhaps dead or gone elsewhither must be given to others that are willing to build but in regard to this law also must do its part and the absent and the heirs must be cited to say whether they will themselves build and in case they wont the steadings can then be given to others roden having written  king in the course of six days you must be ready what an expeditious king is to be at cleve the sixth day hence meet me there thenlonger i cannot give you  roden considering a moment if your majesty will permit me to use estafettes express messengers for the towns farthest offas i cannot myself within the time travel over all the townsi hope to be ready  king that i permit and will repay you the estafette moneystell me how comes the decrease of population in these parts recruits i got none  roden under favor of your majesty regiment schenkendorf got every year for recompletion what recruits were wanted from its canton in the grafschaft mark here  king there you may be right but from cleve country we had no recruits not we though the austrians had with a slight sarcasm of tone  roden out of cleve so far as i know there were no recruits delivered to the austrians  king you could not know you were with the allied army duke ferdinands commissariating and the like where duke ferdinand recognized you to have a head  roden there have been many epidemic diseases too especially in soestafter the battle of vellinghausen all the wounded were brought thither and the hospitals were established there  king epidemic diseases they might have got without a battle dislikes hearing ill of the soldier trade i will have order sent to the cleve kammer not to lay hindrance in your way but the contrary now god keep you gott bewahre ihnexit rodendarauf retirirte mich says hebut will reappear shortly  sunday 12th june is the sixth day hence later than the end of sunday is not permissible to swift roden nor does he need it  friday 10th friedrich left wesel crossed the rhine intending for cleve went by crefeldat crefeld had view of another battlefield under good ciceroneship remarks or circumstances otherwise not givenand next day saturday 11th picked up dalembert who by appointment is proceeding towards potsdam at a more leisurely rate that same saturday after much business done the king was at kempen thence at geldern speeding for cleve itself due there that night at geldern we say he picked up dalembertconcerning whom more by and by and finally on saturday night about halfpast 8 the king entered cleve amid joyances extraordinary hut did not alight drove direct through by the nassau gate and took quarter in the neighboring countryhouse of bellevue with the dutch general von spaen therean obliging acquaintance once while lieutenant spaen in our old crownprince times of trouble had his year in spandau for us there while poor katte lost his head to whom i have heard the king talked charmingly on this occasion but was silent as to old potsdam matters supra vii 165  by his set day roden is also in cleve punctual man finished or just finishing and ready for summons by his majesty and accordingly  cleve monday june 13th at 9 in the morning records he i had audience of the kings majesty in spaens villa of bellevue shall we still suppose duke ferdinand prince of prussia and the rest have bestowed themselves in other fit houses dalembert toowho is to make direct for potsdam henceforth by his own route and will meet us on arrivingi handed him my report with the tabular schedule his majesty read it carefully through in my presence and examined all of it with strictness was pleased to signify his satisfaction

interesting to prussian readers than to english he has himself given lucid and eloquent account of ittwo ample chapters des finances du militaire oeuvres de frederic vii 7390 91109altogether pleasant reading should there still be curiosity upon it there is something of flowingly eloquent in friedrichs account of this battle waged against the inanimate chaos something of exultant and triumphant not noticeable of him in regard to his other victories on the leuthens rossbachs he is always cold as water and nobody could gather that he had the least pleasure in recording them not so here and indeed here he is as beautiful as anywhere and the reader as a general son of adamproud to see human intellect and heroism slaying that kind of lions and doing what in certain sad epochs is unanimously voted

general subversion says the king in regard to 1763 and how great were the desolation and discouragement you must represent to yourself countries entirely ravaged the very traces of the old habitations hardly discoverable towns some ruined from top to bottom others half destroyed by fire13000 houses of which the very vestiges were gone no field in seed no grain for the food of the inhabitants 60000 horses needed if there was to be ploughing carried on in the provinces generally half a million population 500000 less than in 1756that is to say upon only four millions and a half the ninth man was wanting noble and peasant had been pillaged ransomed foraged eaten out by so many different armies nothing now left them but life and miserable rags  there was no credit by trading people even for the daily necessaries of life and furthermore what we were not prepared for no police in the towns to habits of equity and order had succeeded a vile greed of gain and an anarchic disorder the colleges of justice and of finance had by these frequent invasions of so many enemies been reduced to inaction no judge in many places not even a taxgatherer the silence of the laws had produced in the people a taste for license boundless appetite for gain was their main rule of action the noble the merchant the farmer the laborer raising emulously each the price of his commodity seemed to endeavor only for their mutual ruin such when the war ended was the fatal spectacle over these provinces which had once been so flourishing however pathetic the description may be it will never approach the touching and sorrowful impression which the sight of it produced  friedrich found that it would never do to trust to the mere aid of time in such circumstances at the end of the thirtyyears war time had owing to absolute want of money been the one recipe of the great elector in a similar case and time was then found to mean about a hundred years friedrich found that he must at once step in with active remedies and on all hands strive to make the impossible possible luckily he had in readiness as usual the funds for an eighth campaign had such been needed out of these moneys he proceeded to rebuild the towns and villages from the cornstores granaries dabondance government establishments gathered from plentiful harvests against scarce according to old rule were taken the supplies for food of the

land silesia was discharged from all taxes for six months pommern and the neumark for two years a sum of about three million sterling in thalers 20389000 was given for relief of the provinces and as acquittance of the impositions the enemy had wrung from them  great as was this expense it was necessary and indispensable the condition of these provinces after the peace of hubertsburg recalled what we know of them when the peace of munster closed the famous thirtyyears war on that occasion the state failed of help from want of means which put it out of the great electors power to assist his people and what happened that a whole century elapsed before his successors could restore the towns and champaigns to what they were this impressive example was admonitory to the king that to repair the public calamities assistance must be prompt and effective repeated gifts largesses restored courage to the poor husbandmen who began to despair of their lot by the helps given hope in all classes sprang up anew encouragement of labor produced activity love of country rose again with fresh life in a word within the second year in a markedly hopeful manner and within seven years altogether the fields were cultivated again manufacturers had resumed their work and the police once more in vigor corrected by degrees the vices that had taken root during the time of anarchy oeuvres de frederic vi

prussian administration had successively died and in such time of trouble it had been impossible to replace them the embarrassment was to find persons capable of filling these different employments some would have very soon done it your majesty but their haste would not have tended to speedwe searched the provinces on fouilla sifted where good heads were found as rare as in the capital at length five chief ministers were pitched uponwho prove to be tolerable and even good three of them were the vons blumenthal massow hagen unknown to readers here fourth and fifth were the von wedell as

accidental fires in different places while we struggled to repair the ravagings of war were of unexampled frequency and did immense farther damage from 1765 to 1769 here is the list of places burnt in

free trader except where it suited him and his continual subventions and donations guidances encouragements commandings and prohibitions wise supervision and impulsionare a thing i should like to hear an intelligent mirabeau junior or senior discourse upon after he had well studied them for example on rendit les pretres utiles the priests catholic priests were turned to use by obliging all the rich abbeys to establish manufactures here it was weavers making damasks and tablecloths there oilmills oil from linseed or workers in copper wiredrawers as suited the localities and the natural productsthe flaxes and the metals with waterpower markets and so on what a charming resuscitation of the rich abbeys from their dormant condition  i should like still better to explain how in lower silesia we on managed to increase the number of husbandmen by 4000 families you will be surprised how it was possible to multiply to this extent the people living by agriculture in a country where already not a field was waste the reason was this many lords of land to increase their domain had imperceptibly appropriated to themselves the holdings terres of their vassals had this abuse been suffered to go on in time a greatbut the commentary needed would be too lengthy we will give only the result in the longrun every village would have had its lord but there would have been no taxpaying farmers left the landlord ruler of these landless might himself as majesty well knows have been made to pay had that been all but it was not to possess something that is what makes the citizen attached to his country those who have no property and have nothing to lose what tie have they a weak one in comparisonall these things being represented to the landlord class their own advantage made them consent to replace their peasants on the old footing  to make head against so many extraordinary demands adds the king looking over to a new chapter that of the military which department to his eyes was not less shockingly dilapidated than the civil and equally or more needed instant repair new resources had to be devised for besides what was needed for reestablishment of the provinces new fortifications were necessary and all our cannon evases worn too wide in the bore needed to be refounded which occasioned considerable new expense this led us to improvement of the excisesconcerning which there will have to be a section by itself     of friedrichs new excise system  in his late inspectionjourney to cleve country dalembert from paris by appointment waited for the king in oeuvres

of much clear intellect a thought shrieky in his ways sometimes but always prudent rational polite and loyally recognizing friedrich as a precious article in this world here is a word of dalemberts to madame du deffand at paris some ten or twelve days after the cleve meeting and the third day after his arrival here  potsdam 25th june 1763 madame i will not go into the praises of this prince king friedrich my now host in my mouth it might be suspicious i will merely send you two traits of him which will indicate his way of thinking and feeling when i spoke to him at geldern probably on our first meeting of the glory he had acquired he answered with the greatest simplicity that there was a furious discount to be deducted from said glory that chance came in for almost the whole of it and that he would far rather have done ratines athalie than all this warathalie is the work he likes and rereads oftenest i believe you wont disapprove his taste there the other trait i have to give you is that on the day 15th february last of concluding this peace which is so glorious to him some one saying it is the finest day of your majestys life the finest day of life answered he is the day on which one quits itadieu madame oeuvres posthumes de dalembert paris 1799 i 197 cited in preuss ii 348  the meeting in cleve country was no doubt a very pretty passage with two pretty months followingand if it be true that helvetius was a consequence the 11th of june 1763 may almost claim to be a kind of epoch in friedrichs later history the opulent and ingenious m helvetius who wrote de lesprit and has got banished for that feat lost in the gloom of london in those months had been a mighty taxgatherer as well dalembert as brother philosophe was familiar with helvetius it is certain also king friedrich at this time found he would require annually two million thalers morewhere to get them seemed the impossibility a general krockow who had long been in french service and is much about the king was often recommending the french excise systemhe is the krockow of domstadtl and that siege of olmutz memorable to some of usa wonderful excise system krockow is often saying in this time of straits who completely understands it the king might ask helvetius against the world dalembert could justly answer invite helvetius to leave his london exile and accept an asylum here where he may be of vital use to me concludes friedrich  helvetius came in march 1765 stayed till june 1766 rodenbeck ii 254 preuss iii 11within which time a french excise system which he had been devising and putting together had just got in gear and been in action for a month to helvetiuss satisfaction who thereupon went his way and never returnedtaking with him as man and taxgatherer the kings lasting gratitude but by no means that of the prussian nation in his taxgathering capacity all prussia or all of it that fell under this helvetius excise system united to condemn it in all manner of dialects louder and louder here for instance is the utterance of herr hamann himself a kind of customhouse clerk at konigsberg in east preussen and on modest terms a literary man of real merit and originality who may be supposed to understand this subject and so says hamann the state has declared its own subjects incapable of managing its finance system and in this way has intrusted its heart that is the purse of its subjects to a company of foreign scoundrels ignorant of everything relating to it hamann to jacobi see preuss iii 135 konigsberg 18th january 1786  this lasted all friedrichs lifetime and gave rise to not a little buzzing especially in its primary or incipient stages it seems to have been one of the unsuccessfulest finance adventures friedrich ever engaged in it cost his subjects infinite small trouble awakened very great complaining and for the first time real discontentskindeep but sincere and universalagainst the misguided vater fritz much noisy absurdity there was upon it at home and especially abroad griping miser greedy tyrant and so forth deducting all which everybody now admits that friedrichs aim was excellent and proper but nobody denies withal that the means were inconsiderate of no profit in proportion to the trouble they gave and improper to adopt unless the necessity compelled  friedrich is forbidden or forbids himself as we have often mentioned to impose new taxes and nevertheless now on calculations deep minute and no doubt exact he judges that for meeting new attacks of war or being ready to meet which will oftenest mean averting thema thing which as he has just seen may concern the very existence of the stateit is necessary that there should be on foot such and such quantities and kinds of soldiery and warfurniture visible to all neighbors and privately in the treasury never less than such and such a sum to which end arithmetic declares that there is required about two million thalers more of yearly revenue than we now have and where in these circumstances are the means of raising such a sum  friedrich imposes no new taxes but there may be stricter methods of levying the oldthere may and in fact there must be means found friedrich has consulted his finance ministers put the question seriatim to these wise heads they answer with one voice there are no means rodenbeck ii 256 friedrich therefore has recourse to helvetius who on due consideration and after survey of much documentary and tabulary rawmaterial is of opinion that the prussian excises would if levied with the punctuality precision and vigilant exactitude of french methods actually yield the required overplus organize me the methods then get them put in action here under french hands if that be indispensable helvetius bethought him of what fittest french hands there were to his knowledgein france there are a great many hands flung idle in the present downbreak of finance therehelvetius appears to have selected arranged and contrived in this matter with his best diligence de launay the headengineer of the thing was admitted by all prussia after twentytwo years unfriendly experience of him to have been a suitable and estimable person a man of judicious ways of no small intelligence prudence and of very great skill in administering business  headengineer de launay one may guess would be consulted by helvetius in choice of the subaltern officials the stokers and steerers in this new steammachinery which had all to be manned from france there were four heads of departments immediately under de launay or scarcely under him junior brothers ratherwho chose these i did not hear but these latter it is evident were not a superior quality of people of these fourall at very high salaries from de launay downwards higher than a prussian minister of state murmured the publictwo within the first year got into quarrel fought a duel fatal to one of them so that there were now only three left three with de launay will do opined

tumbled hither and thither in the search for what perhaps is not there nay it was said and suspected but i never knew it for certain that these poisonous french are capable of slipping in something contraband on purpose to have you fined whether or not  readers can conceive though apparently friedrich did not what a world of vexation all this occasioned and how in the continual annoyance to all mankind the irritation provocation and querulous eloquence spread among high and low of which the king knew something but far from the whole his object was one of vital importance and his plan once fixed he went on with it according to his custom regardless of little rubs the anecdote books are full of details comic mostly on this subject how the french rats pounced down upon good harmless people innocent frugal parsonages farmhouses and were comically flung prostrate by native ready wit or by direct appeal to the king details never so authentic could not be advisable in this place perhaps there are not more than two authentic passages known to me which can now have the least interest even of a momentary sort to english readers the first is of king friedrich caricatured as a miser grinding coffee i give it without essential alteration of any kind in herr preusss words copied from those of one who saw itthe second which relates to a princess or exprincess of the royal house i must reserve for a little while herr preuss says  once during the time of the regie which lasted from 1766 to 1786 and the kings death no other date assignable though 1768 or so may be imaginable for our purpose as the king came riding along the jager strasse there was visible near what is called the furstenhaus kind of berlin somerset house nicolai i 155 a great crowd of people see what it is the king sent his one attendant a heiduc or groom into it to learn what it was they have something posted up about your majesty reported the groom and friedrich who by this time had ridden forward took a look at the thing which was a caricature figure of himself king in very melancholy guise seated on a stool a coffeemill between his knees diligently grinding with the one hand and with the other picking up any bean that might have fallen hang it lower said the king beckoning his groom with a wave of the finger lower that they may not have to hurt their necks about it no sooner were the words spoken which spread instantly than there rose from the whole crowd one universal huzza of joy they tore the caricature into a thousand pieces and rolled after the king with loud lebe hoch our friedrich forever as he rode slowly away preuss iii 275 from berlin conversutionsblatt c of 1827 no 253 that is their friedrichs method with the caricature department heffner kapellmeister in upsala reports this bit of memorability he was then of the kings musicchapel in berlin and saw this with his eyes  the kings tendency at all times and his practice generally when we hear of it was to take the peoples side so that gradually these french procedures were a great deal mitigated and die regieso they called this hateful newfangled system of excise machinerybecame much more supportable the sorrows of it nothing but a tradition to the younger sort reports dohm who is extremely ample on this subject christian wilhelm von dohm denkwurdigkeiten meiner zeit lemgo und hanover 1819 iv 500 et seq de launay was honorably dismissed and the whole regie abolished a month or two after friedrichs death  with a splenetic satisfaction authentic dohm who sufficiently condemns the regie adds that it was not even successful and shows by evidence and computation to the uttermost farthing that instead of two million thalers annually it yielded on the average rather less than one the desired overplus of two millions and a good deal more did indeed come in says he but it was owing to the great prosperity of prussia at large after the sevenyears war to the manifold industries awakening which have gone on progressive ever since dohm declares farther that the very object was in a sort fanciful nugatory arguing that nobody did attack friedrichbut omitting to prove that nobody would have done so had friedrich not stood ready to receive him we will remark only what is very indisputable that friedrich owing to the regie or to other causes did get the humble overplus necessary for him and did stand ready for any war which might have come and which did in a sort come that he more and more relaxed the regie as it became less indispensable to him and was willing if he found the caricatures and opposition placards too high posted to save the poor reading people any trouble that was possible  a french eyewitness testifies they had no talent these regie fellows but that of writing and ciphering extremely conceited too and were capable of the most ridiculous follies once for instance they condemned a common soldier who had hidden some pounds of tobacco to a fine of 200 thalers the king on reviewing it for confirmation wrote on the margin before confirming this sentence i should wish to know where the soldier who gets 8 groschen ninepence halfpenny in the 5 days will find the 200 crowns for paying this fine laveaux 2d edition iii 228 innumerable instances of a constant disposition that way on the kings part stand on record a crown a head on the import of fat

though doubtless it was then in berlin society the more celebrated of the two relating as it did to a high courtlady almost the highest and who was herself only too celebrated in those years the heroine is princess elizabeth of brunswick kings own niece and a pretty woman who for four years 14th july 176518th april 1769 of her long life was princess royal of prussiawife of that tall young gentleman whom we used to see dancing about whom we last saw at schweidnitz getting flung from his horse on the day of pirchs saddle therehis wife for four years but in the fourth year ceased to be so rodenbeck ii 241 257 for excellent reasons on both sides and lived thenceforth in a divorced eclipsed state at stettin where is laid the scene of our anecdote i understand it to be perfectly true but cannot ascertain from any of the witnesses in what year the thing happened or whether it was at stettin or berlinthough my author has guessed stettin in the ladys divorced state as appears  this princess had commissioned direct from lyon a very beautiful dress which arrived duly addressed to her at stettin as this kind of stuffs is charged with very heavy dues the douanier head customhouse personage of the town had the impertinence to detain the dress till payment were made the princess in a lofty indignation sent word to this person to bring the dress instantly and she would pay the dues on it he obeyed butmark the resultscarcely had the princess got eye on him when she seized her lyon dress and giving the douanier a couple of good slaps on the face ordered him out of her apartment and house  the douanier thinking himself one and somewhat withdrew in high choler had a long procesverbal of the thing drawn out and sent it to the king with eloquent complaint that he had been dishonored in doing the function appointed him friedrich replied as follows to the douanier at stettin the loss of the excisedues shall fall to my score the dress shall remain with the princess the slaps to him who has received them as to the pretended dishonor i entirely relieve the complainant from that never can the appliance of a beautiful hand dishonor the face of an officer of customsf laveaux abridged iii 229  northern tourists wraxall and others passing that way speak of this princess down to recent times as a phenomenon of the place apparently a high and peremptory kind of lady

to reproach himself withalas yes some fewand he swore that he would never forsake me and that if heaven disposed of my life before his none but he should close my eyes he was fingering with a penknife at the time he struck the point of it into the palm of his left hand and wrote with his blood the unclean creature on a little bit of paper the oath which his lips had just pronounced in so solemn a tone vainly should i undertake to paint my emotion on this action of his the prince saw what i felt and took advantage of it to beg that i would follow his example i hastened to satisfy him and traced as he had done with my blood the promise to remain his friend to the tomb and never to forsake him this promise must have been found among his papers after his death still in the archives we will hope

and finished 17631770  if dalemberts visit was the germ of the excise system it will be curious to noteand indeed whether or not it will be chronologically serviceable to us here and worth notingthat there went on a small synchronous affair still visible to everybody namely that in the very hours while friedrich and dalembert were saluting mutually at geldern 11th june 1763 there was laid the foundation of what they call the neue palais new palace of sanssouci rodenbeck ii 219 a sumptuous edifice in the curious louisquinze or what is called rococo style of the time palace never much inhabited by friedrich or his successors which still stands in those ornamental potsdam regions why built especially in the then downpressed financial circumstances some have had their difficulties to imagine it appears this new palace had been determined on before the war broke out and friedrich said to himself we will build it now to help the mechanical classes in berlinperhaps also in part think some and why should not they a little to show mankind that we have still ready money and are nothing like so ruined as they fancy  this neue palais says one recent tourist is a pleasant quaint object

more artificial kind and at any rate has memories for you and footsteps of persons still unforgotten by mankindhere is a notice of lord marischal which readers will not grudge the chronology of the worthy man in these his later epochs being in so hazy a state  lord marischal we know well and pitt knows was in england in 1761ostensibly on the kintore heritage and in part perhaps really on that errand but he went and came at dates now uncertain was back in spain after that had difficult voyagings about kings letters to him in oeuvres de frederic xx 282285and did not get to rest again in his government of neufchatel till april 1762 there is a letter of the kings which at least fixes that point  breslau 10th april 1762 my nose is the most impertinent nose in the universe mon cher mylord queendowager snuff spaniol from the fountainhead of marischals providing quality exquisite but difficult to get transmitted in the storms of war i am ashamed of the trouble it costs you i beg many pardonsand should be quite abashed did i not know how you compassionate the weak points of your friends and that for a long time past you have a singular indulgence for my nose i am very glad to know you happily returned to your government safe at colombier dovecote in neufchatel again this is 10th april 1762 there as i gather quiet in his dovecote marischal continued though rather weary of the business for about a year more or till the king got homewho delights in companionship and is willing to let an old man demit for good  it was in summer 1762 about three months after the above letter from the king that rousseau made his celebrated exodus into neufchatel country and found the old governor so good to himglad to be allowed to shelter the poor skinless creature and mark as curious it must have been on two of those mornings towards the end of the siege of schweidnitz when things were getting so intolerable and at times breaking out into electricity into rebuke all round that friedrich received that singular pair of laconic notes from rousseau in neufchatel forwarded successively by lord marischal note first of date motiertravers neufchatel september nobody can guess what day 1762 i have said much ill of you and dont repent it now everybody has banished me and it is on your threshold that i sit down kill me if you have a mind and then after not death but the gift of

de rousseau a geneve 17821789 xxxiii 64 65what curious reading for a king in such posture among the miscellaneous arrivals overnight above six weeks before either of these notes friedrich hearing of him from lord marischal had answered an asylum yes by all means the unlucky cynic it is on september 1st that he sends by the same channel 100 crowns for his use with advice to give them in natura lest he refuse otherwise as friedrich knows to be possible in words the rousseau notes got nothing of answer a garcon singulier says friedrich odd fellow yes indeed your majestyand has such a pungency of flattery in him too presented in the way of snarl his majesty might take him i suppose with a kind of relish like queendowager snuff  there was still another shift of place shift which proved temporary in old marischals life home to native aberdeenshire the two childless brothers earls of kintore had died successively the last of them november 22d 1761 title and heritage not considerable the latter fell duly by what preparatives we know to old marischal but his keith kinsfolk furthermore would have him personally among themnay after that would have him to wed and produce new keiths at the age of 78 decidedly an inconvenient thing old marischal left potsdam august 1763 letter of his to the king londres 14 aout 1763 in oeuvres de frederic xx 293in letters of eminent persons to david

long i know not the precise month but his villacottage was built for him the books say in 1764 he had left dalembert just going next year he will find helvetius coming he lived here a great treasure to friedrich till his death 25th may 1778 age 92  the new palace was not finished till 1770in which year also friedrich reckons that the general problem of repairing prussia was victoriously over new

violent stress of effort for repairing prussia friedrich intimates was mostly over in 1766 till which date specifically and in a looser sense till 1770 that may be considered as his main business but it was not at any time his sole business nor latterly at all equal in interest to some others that had risen on him as the next chapter will now show here first is a little fraction of necrology which may be worth taking with us readers can spread these fateful specialties over the period in question and know that each of them came with a kind of knell upon friedrichs heart whatever he might be employed about hour striking after hour on the horologe of time intimating how the afternoon wore and that night was coming various meanings there would be to friedrich in these footfalls of departing guests the dear the less dear and the indifferent or hostile but each of them would mean gone then gone thus we all go     obituary in friedrichs circle till 1771  of polish majestys death 5th october

before all these friedrich had lost friends with a sad but quiet emotion he often alludes to this tragic fact that all the souls he loved most are gone his winterfelds his keiths many loved faces the war has snatched at monbijou at baireuth it was not war but they too are gone is the world becoming all a mausoleum then nothing of divine in it but the tombs of vanished loved ones friedrich makes no

year after his sevenyears labor of hercules friedrich made treaty of alliance with the new czarina catharine england had deserted him france was his enemy especially pompadour and choiseul and refused reconcilement though privately solicited he was without an ally anywhere the russians had done him frightful damage in the last war and were most of all to be dreaded in the case of any new one the treaty was a matter of necessity as well as choice agreement for mutual good neighborhood and friendly offices guarantee of each other against intrusive third parties should either get engaged in war with any neighbor practical aid to the length of 12000 men or else money in lieu treaty was for eight years from day of date  as friedrich did not get into war and catharine did with the turks and certain loose polacks the burden of fulfilment happened to fall wholly on friedrich and he was extremely punctual in performanceeager now and all his life after to keep well with such a country under such a czarina which proved to be the whole rule of his policy on that russian side good that country cannot bring me by any quarrel with it evil it can to a frightful extent in case of my quarrelling with others be wary be punctual magnanimously polite with that grandiose czarina and her huge territories and notions this was friedrichs constant rule in public and in private nor is it thought his correspondence with the empress catharine when future generations see it in print will disclose the least ground of offence to that highflying female potentate of the north nor will it ever be known what the silently observant friedrich thought of her except indeed what we already know or as good as know that he if anybody did saw her clearly enough for what she was and found good to repress into absolute zero whatever had no bearing upon business and might by possibility give offence in that quarter for we are an old king and have learned by bitter experiences no more nicknames biting verses or words which a bird of the air could carry though this poor lady too has her liabilities were not we old and prudentand is entirely as weak on certain points deducting the devotions and the brandyandwater as some others were the treaty was renewed when necessary and continued valid and vital in every particular so long as friedrich ruled  by the end of the first eight years by strictly following this passive rule friedrich in counterbalance of his losses unexpectedly found himself invested with a very singular bit of gainunjust gain cried all men making it of the nature of gain and loss to himwhich is still practically his and which has made and makes to this day an immense noise in the world everybody knows we mean westpreussen partition of poland bloodiest picture in the book of time sarmatias fall unwept without a crimeand that we have come upon a very intricate part of our poor history  no prudent manespecially if to himself as is my own poor case in regard to it the subject have long been altogether dead and indifferentwould wish to write of the polish question for almost a hundred years the polish question has been very loud in the world and ever and anon rises again into vocality among able editors as a thing pretending not to be dead and buried but capable of rising again and setting itself right by good effort at home and abroad not advisable beyond the strict limits of compulsion to write of it at present the rather as the history of it any history we have is not an intelligible series of events but a series of vociferous execrations filling all nature with nothing left to the reader but darkness and such remedies against despair as he himself can summon or contrive  rulhieres on that subject says a note which i may cite is the only articulatespeaking book to which mankind as yet can apply cl rulhiere histoire de lanarchie de pologne paris 1807 4 vols 12mo and they will by no means find that a sufficient one rulhieres book has its considerable merits but it absolutely wants those of a history and can be recognized by no mind as an intelligible cosmic portraiture of that chaotic mass of occurrences chronology topography precision of detail by time and place scene and actors on scene remain unintelligible rulhiere himself knew poland at least had looked on it from warsaw outwards year after year and knew of it what an inquiring secretary of legation could pick up on those terms which perhaps after all is not very much his narrative is drowned in beautiful seas of description and reflection has neither dates nor references and advances at an intolerable rate of slowness in fact rather turns on its axis than advances produces on you the effect of a melodious sonata not of a lucid and comfortably instructive history  i forget for how long rulhiere had been in poland as ambassadors assistant but the country the king and leading personages were personally known to him more or less events with all details of them were known why not write a history of the anarchy and wreck they fell into said the official people to him on his return home for behoof of the dauphin who is to be louis xvi shortly may not he perhaps draw profit from it at the top of the universe experience is sometimes wanted here are the archives here is salary here are what appliances you like to name write it is well known he was appointed on a pension of 250 pounds a year with access to all archives documents and appliances in possession of the french government and express charge to delineate this subject for benefit of the dauphins young mind nor can i wonder considering everything that the process on rulhieres part being so full of difficulties was extremely deliberate that this book did not grow so steadily or fast as the dauphin did and that in fact the poor dauphin never got the least benefit from itbeing guillotined he in 1793 and the book intended for him never coming to light for fourteen years afterwards it too in a posthumous and still unfinished condition  rulhiere has heard the voices of rumor knows an infinitude of events that were talked of but has not discriminated which were the vital which were the insignificant treats the vital and the insignificant alike seldom with satisfactory precision mournfully seldom giving any date and by no chance any voucher or authorityand instead of practical terrestrial scene of action with distances milestones definite sequence of occurrences and of causes and effects paints us a rosy cloudland which if true at all as he well intends it to be is little more than symbolically or allegorically so and can satisfy no clearheaded dauphin or man rulhiere strives to be authentic too gives you no suspicion of his fairness there is really fine highcolored painting in rulhiere and you hope always he will let you into the secret of the matter but the sad fact is he never does he merely loses himself in picturesque details philosophic eloquences elegancies takes you to a castle of choczim a monastery of czenstochow a bay of tschesme and lets off extensive fireworks that contain little or no shot leads you on trackless marches inroads or outroads through the lithuanian peatbogs on daring adventures and hairbreadth escapes of mere pulawski potocki and the likehad not got to understand the matter himself you perceive how hopeless to

to the meditating mind some outline of the phenomenon may begin to become conceivable king of poland dies and there ensue huge anarchies in that country     king of poland dies and there ensue huge anarchies in that country  the poor old king of polandwhom we saw on that fall of the curtain at pirna seven years ago rush off for warsaw with his bruhl with expressive speed and expressive silence and who has been waiting there ever since sublimely confident that his powerful terrestrial friends austria russia france not to speak of heavens justice at all would exact due penalty of signal and tremendous nature on the prussian aggressorhas again been disappointed the poor old gentleman got no compensation for his manifold losses and woes at pirna or elsewhere not the least mention of such a thing on the final windingup of that war of seven years in which his share had been so tragical no alleviation was provided for him in this world his sorrows in poland have been manifold nothing but anarchies confusions and contradictions had been his royal portion there in about forty different diets he had tried to get some business doneno use asking what for the diets one and all exploded in

russia the virtual head of it this long while so far as it has any head  februaryaugust 1763 just while the treaty of hubertsburg was blessing everybody with the return of peace and for long months after peace had returned to everybody polish majesty was in sore trouble trouble in regard to courland to his poor son karl who fancied himself elected under favor and permission of the late czarina our gracious protectress and ally to the difficult post of duke in courland and had proceeded three or four years ago to take possessionbut was now interrupted by russian encroachments and violences not at all well disposed to him these new peters new catharines they have recalled their bieren from siberia declare that old bieren is again duke or at least that young bieren is and not saxon karl at all and have proceeded czarina catharine has to install him forcibly with russian soldiers karl declares you shall kill me before you or he get into this palace of mietauand by domestics merely and armed private gentlemen he does maintain himself in said palatial mansion valiantly indignant for about six months the russian battalions girdling him on all sides minatory more and more but loath to begin actual bloodshed rulhiere ii livre v 81 et antea hermann v 348 et seq a transaction very famed in those parts and still giving loud voice in the polish books which indeed get ever noisier from this point onward till they end in inarticulate shrieks as we shall too well hear  empress catharine after the lapse of six months sends an ambassador to warsaw kayserling by name who declares in tone altogether imperative that czarish majesty feels herself weary of such contumacy weary generally of polish majestys and polish republics multifarious contumacies and in fine cruelest of all that she has troops on the frontier that courland is not the only place where she has troops what a stab to the poor old man contumacies has not he been russias patient steppingstone all along his anarchic

months his son and successor friedrich christian with whom we dined at moritzburg had followed him prince died 17th december bruhl 18th november 1763 leaving a small boy age 13 as new kurfurst friedrich august the name of him with guardians to manage the minority especially with his mother as chief guardianof whom for two reasons we are now to say something reason first is that she is really a rather brilliant distinguished creature distinguished more especially in friedrichs world whose letters to her are numerous and in their kind among the notablest he wroteof which we would gladly give some specimen better or worse and reason second that in so doing we may contrive to look for a moment or two into the preliminary polish anarchies at firsthand and transiently and far off

scandal was not entirely idlehanbury chronicling as we once noticed all which i believe to be mere lying wind the young princess was beautiful extremely clever graceful and lively we can still see for

may be useful if you can have it followed in saxony however my letters get openedwhich obliges me to send this by a special messenger and him that he may cause no suspicion i have charged with fruits from my garden you will have the goodness to say if anybody is eavesdropping that you asked them of me at moritzburg when i was happy enough to see you there six months ago coming home from the sevenyears war the hint i had to give was this  in petersburg peoples minds are getting angry at the stubbornness your friends show in refusing to recognize duke bieren home from siberia again duke of courland by russian appointment as if russia had that right polish majesty and his prince karl resisting to the uttermost i counsel you to induce the powerful in your circle to have this condescension they have had it been obliged to have it though friedrich does not yet know for it will turn out ill to them if they persist in being obstinately stiff it begins already to be said that there are more than a million russian subjects at this time refugees in poland whom by i forget what cartel the republic was bound to deliver up orders have been given to detachments of military to enter certain places and bring away these russians by force in a word you will ruin your affairs forever unless you find means to produce a change of conduct on the part of him they complain of take madam what i now say as a mark of the esteem and profound regard with whichf oeuvres de frederic xxiv 46  this hint if the king knew had been given in a less kind shape by necessity itself and had sent polish

promise you have assured us too that you would with pleasure contribute to secure poland for us the moment is come for accomplishing that promise the king is dead died this very day see if i lose time in sentimental lamentationswith him these grievances of russia our stiffness on courland and the like must be extinct the rather as we the now reigning will lend ourselves willingly to everything that can be required of us for perfect reconcilement with that power  you can do all if you will it you can contribute to this reconcilement you can render it favorable to us you will give me that proof of the flattering sentiments i have been so proud of hithertowont you now russia cannot disapprove the mediation you might deign to offer on that behalfour intentions being so honestly amicable and all ground of controversy having died with the late king russia reconciled our views on the polish crown might at once be declared eclater oh do it your majestymy gratitude shall only end with lifem a oeuvres de frederic xxiv 47  friedrich who is busy negotiating his treaty with russia perfected 11th april next and understands that they will mean not to have a saxon but to have a piast and perhaps dimly even what piast stanislaus poniatowski the emeritus lover who will be their own and not saxonys at allmust have been a little embarrassed by such an appeal from his fair friend at this moment wait a little dont answer yet would have occurred to the common mind but that was not friedrichs resource he answers by return of post as always in such casesand in the following adroit manner brushes off without hurt to it with kisses to it rather the beautiful hand that has him by the button   to the electress marieantoine at dresden  berlin 8th october 1763  madam my sisteri begin by making my condolences and my congratulations to your electoral highness on the death of the king your fatherinlaw and on your accession to the electorate  your electoral highness will remember what i wrote not

suitable in you to send some discreet diplomatist to that court to notify the kings death and you would learn by him what you have to expect from her czarish majesty the empress he always calls her knowing she prefers that title it seems to me madam that it would be precipitate procedure should i wish to engage you in an enterprise which appears to myself absolutely dubious hasardee unless approved by that princess as to me madam i have not the ascendant there which you suppose i act under rule of all the delicacies and discretions with a court which separated itself from my enemies when all europe wished to crush me but i am far from being able to regulate the empresss way of thinking  it is the same with the quarrels about the duke of courland one cannot attempt mediation except by consent of both parties i believe i am not mistaken in supposing that the court of russia does not mean to terminate that business by foreign mediation what i have heard about it what however is founded only on vague news is that the empress might prevail upon herself pourrait se resoudre to purchase from bruhl the principality of zips zips on the edge of hungary let readers take note of that principality at present in the hand of bruhlwho has much disgusted poland by his voracity for lands and is disgorging them all again poor soul to give it to prince karl in compensation but that would lead to a negotiation with the court of vienna which might involve the affair in other contentions  i conjure you madam i repeat it be not precipitate in anything lest as my fear is you replunge europe into the troubles it has only just escaped from as to me i have found since the peace so much to do within my own borders that i have not i assure you had time madam to think of going abroad i confine myself to forming a thousand wishes for the prosperity of your electoral highness assuring you of the high esteem with which i amf oeuvres de frederic xxiv 48  after some farther

poland to act entirely in concert with the count kayserling and she adds these very words i expect from the friendship of your majesty that you will not allow a passage through your territory nor the entry into poland to saxon troops who are to be regarded there absolutely as strangers  unless your letters madam madam had said that she had written to the empress assuring her c change the sentiments of the empress i do not see in what way the elector could arrive at the throne of poland and consequently whether i deferred to the wishes of the empress in this point or refused to do so you would not the more become queen and i might commit myself against a power which i ought to keep well with menager i am persuaded madam that your electoral highness enters into my embarrassment and that unless you find yourself successful in changing the empresss own ideas on this matter you will not require of me that i should embroil myself fruitlessly with a neighbor who deserves the greatest consideration from me  all this is one consequence of the course which count bruhl induced his late polish majesty to take with regard to the interests of prince karl in courland and your electoral highness will remember that i often represented to you the injury which would arise to him from it  i will wish madam that other opportunities may occur where it may be in my power to prove to your electoral highness the profound esteem and consideration with which i amf oeuvres de frederic xxiv 52   electress to friedrich  dresden 11th november 1763  sirei am not yet disheartened i love to

the mind of the empress of russia than your majesty use it sire to incline it to our favor our obligation will be infinite why should she be absolutely against us what has she to fear from us the courland business if that sticks with her could be terminated in a suitable mannertroops into poland siremy husband so little thinks of sending troops thither that he has given orders for the return of those already there he does not wish the crown except from the free suffrages of the nation if the empress absolutely refuse to help him with her good offices let her at least not be against him do try sire ib xxiv 53friedrich answers after four days or by return of postbut we will give the rest in the form of dialogue  friedrich after four days if madam i had crowns to give away i would place the first on your head as most worthy to bear it but i am far from such a position i have just got out of a horrible war which my enemies made upon me with a rage almost beyond example i endeavor to cultivate friendship with all my neighbors and to get embroiled with nobody with regard to the affairs of poland an empress whom i ought to be well with and to whom i owe great obligations requires me to enter into her measures you madam whom i would fain please if i could you want me to change the sentiments of this empress do but enter into my embarrassment according to all i hear from russia it appears to me that every resolution is taken there and that the empress is resolved even to sustain the party of her partisans in poland with the forces she has all in readiness at the borders as for me madam i wish if possible not to meddle at all with this business which hitherto is not complicated but which may any day become so by the neighbors of poland taking a too lively part in it ready

beside his hearth and his household gods sanssouci 26th june 1764 ib p 69 adieu bright madam  no reader who has made acquaintance with polish history can well doubt but poland was now dead or moribund and had well deserved to die anarchies are not permitted in this world under fine names they are grateful to the populaces and to the editors of newspapers but to the maker of this universe they are eternally abhorrent and from the beginning have been forbidden to be they go their course applauded or not applauded by self and neighborsfor what lengths of time none of us can know for a long term sometimes but always for a fixed term and at last their day comes poland had got to great lengths two centuries ago when poor john casimir abdicated his crown of poland after a trial of twenty years and took leave of the republic in that remarkable speech to the diet of 1667  this john is casimir v last scion of the swedish house of vasawith whom in the great electors time we had some slight acquaintance and saw at least the three days beating he got warsaw 28th30th july 1656 from karl gustav of sweden and the great elector supra v 284286 ancestors respectively of karl xii and of our present friedrich he is not casimir the great of polish kings but he is in our day casimir the alone remarkable it seems to me i once had in extenso this valedictory speech of his but it has lapsed again into the general mother of dead dogs and i will not spend a week in fishing for it the gist of the speech innumerable books and dead dogs tell you histoire des trois demembremens does and many others docopied in biographie universelle vii 278  casimir is lamentation over the polish anarchies and a prophecy which is very easily remembered the poor old gentleman had no doubt eaten his peck of dirt among those polacks and swallowed chagrins till he felt his stomach could no more and determined to have done with it to ones fancy in abridged form the valediction must have run essentially as follows  magnanimous polack gentlemen you are a glorious republic and have nie pozwalam and strange methods of business and of behavior to your kings and others we have often fought together been beaten together by our enemies and by ourselves and at last i for my share have enough of it i intend for paris religiousliterary pursuits and the society of ninon de lenclos i wished to say before going that according to all record ancient and modern of the ways of god almighty in this world there was not heretofore nor do i expect there can henceforth be a human society that would stick together on those terms believe me ye polish chivalries without superior except in heaven if your glorious republic continue to be managed in such manner not good will come of it but evil the day will arrive this is the prophecy almost in ipsissimis verbis the day perhaps is not so far off when this glorious republic will get torn into shreds hither thither be stuffed into the pockets of covetous neighbors brandenburg muscovy austria and find itself reduced to zero and abolished from the face of the world  i speak these words in sorrow of soul words which probably you will not believe which only fate can compel you to believe one day if they are true wordsyou think probably they are not me at least or interest of mine they do not regard i speak them from the fulness of my heart and on behest of friendship and conviction alone having the honor at this moment to bid you and your republic a very long farewell goodmorning for the last time and so exit to rome had been cardinal once to paris and the society of ninons circle for the few years left him of life died 16th december 1672 age 63  this poor john had had his bitter experiences think only of one instance in 1662 the incredible law of liberum veto had been introduced in spite of john and his endeavors liberum veto the power of one man to stop the proceedings of polish parliament by pronouncing audibly nie pozwalam i dont permitnever before or since among mortals was so incredible a law law standing indisputable nevertheless on the polish statutebook for above two hundred years like an everflowing fountain of anarchy joyful to the polish nation how they got any business done at all under such a law truly they did but little and for the last thirty years as good as none but if polish parliament was universally in earnest to do some business and veto came upon it honorable members i observe gathered passionately round the vetoing brother conjured obtested menaced wept prayed and if the case was too urgent and insoluble otherwise the nie pozwalam gentleman still obstinate they plunged their swords through him and in that way brought consent the commoner course was to dissolve and go home again in a tempest of shrieks and curses  the right of confederation too is very curious do readers know it a free polack gentleman aggrieved by anything that has occurred or been enacted in his nation has the right of swearing whether absolutely by himself i know not but certainly with two or three others of like mind that he will not accept said occurrence or enactment and is hereby got into arms against its abettors and it the brightest jewel in the cestus of polish liberty is this right of confederating and it has been till of late and will be now again practised to all lengths right of every polish gentleman to confederate with every other against or for whatsoever to them two may seem good and to assert their particular view of the case by fighting for it against all comers king and diet included it must be owned there never was in nature such a form of government before such a mode of social existence rendering government impossible for some generations past  on the strength of saxony and its resources and connections the two augusts had contrived to exist with the name of kings with the name but with little or nothing more under this last august as we heard there have been about forty diets and in not one of them the least thing of business done all the forty after trying their best have stumbled on nie pozwalam and been obliged to vanish in shrieks and curses buchholz preussischbrandenburgische geschichte ii 133 134 c c gives various samples and this enumeration as to august the physically strong such treatment had he met withpoor august if readers remember had made up his mind to partition poland to give away large sections of it in purchase of the consent of neighbors and plant himself hereditarily in the central partand would have done so had not grumkow and he drunk so deep and death by inflammation of the foot suddenly come upon the poor man some partition of poland has been more than once thought of by practical people concerned poland as a house chronically smoking through the slates which usually brings a new european war every time it changes king does require to be taken charge of by its neighbors  latterly as we observed there has been little of confederating indeed for the last thirty years as rulhiere copiously informs us there has been no government consequently no mutiny needed little or no national business of any kindthe forty diets having all gone the road we saw electing of the judgesthat says rulhiere and wearisomely teaches by example again and ever again has always been an interesting act in the various provinces of poland not with the hope of getting fair or upright judges but judges that will lean in the desirable direction in a country overrun with endless lawsuits debts credits feudal intricacies claims liabilities how important to get judges with the proper bias and these once got or lost till next termwhat is there to hope or to fear russia does our politics fights her sevenyears war across us and we happy we have no fightingnever till this of courland was there the least illnature from russia we are become latterly the peaceable steppingstone of russia into europe and out of itwhat may be called the doormat of russia useful to her feet when she is about paying visits or receiving them that is not a glorious fact if it be a safe and lucky one nor do the polish notabilities at all phrase it in that manner but a fact it is which has shown itself complete in the late czarinas and late augusts time and which had been on the growing hand ever since peter the great gained his battle of pultawa and rose to the ascendency instead of karl and sweden  the poles put fine colors on all this and are much contented with themselves the russians they regard as intrinsically an inferior barbarous people and to this day you will hear indignant polack gentlemen bursting out in the same strain still barbarian sir no culture no literatureinferior because they do not make verses equal to ours how it may be with the verses i will not decide but the russians are inconceivably superior in respect that they have to a singular degree among nations the gift of obeying of being commanded polack chivalry sniffs at the mention of such a gift polack chivalry got sore stripes for wanting this gift and in the end got striped to death and flung out of the world for continuing blind to the want of it and never acquiring it  beyond all the verses in nature it is essential to every chivalry and nation and man polite polish society for the last thirty years has felt itself to be in a most halcyon condition says rulhiere rulhiere i 216 a noteworthy passage given up to the agreeable and to that only charming eveningparties and a great deal of flirting full of the benevolences the philanthropies the new ideasgiven up especially to the pleasing idea of laissezfaire and everything will come right of itself what a discovery said every liberal polish mind for thousands of years how people did torment themselves trying to steer the ship never knowing that the plan was to let go the helm and honestly sit down to your mutual amusements and powers of pleasing  to this condition of beautifully phosphorescent rotheap has poland ripened in the helpless reigns of those poor auguststhe fulness of time not now far off one would say it would complete the picture could i go into the state of what is called religion in poland dissenterism of various poor types is extensive and over against it is such a type of jesuit fanaticism as has no fellow in that day of which there have been truly savage and sanguinary outbreaks from time to time especially one at thorn forty years ago which shocked friedrich wilhelm and the whole protestant world see supra vi 64 and many old pamphlets on it polish orthodoxy in that time and perhaps still in ours is a thing worth noting a late tourist informs me he saw on the streets of stettin not long since a drunk human creature staggering about who seemed to be a baltic sailor just arrived the dirtiest or among the dirtiest of mankind who as he reeled along kept slapping his hands upon his breast and shouting in exultant soliloquy polack catholik i am a pole and orthodox ye inferior twolegged entitiesin regard to the jesuit fanaticisms at thorn and elsewhere no blame can attach to the poor augusts who always leant the other way what they durst or could nor is specialty of blame due to them on any score it was like people like king all alongand they such their luck have lived to bring in the fulness of time  the saxon electors are again aspirants for this enviable throne we have seen the beautiful electress zealously soliciting friedrich for help in that project friedrich in a dexterously graceful manner altogether declining hereditary saxons are not to be the expedient this time it would seem a grandiose czarina has decided otherwise why should not she she and all the world are well aware russia has been virtual lord of poland this long time credible enough that russia intends to continue so and also that it will be able without very much expenditure of new contrivance for that object  so far as can be guessed and assiduously deduced from rulhiere with your best attention russian catharines interference seems first of all to have been grounded on the grandiose philanthropic principle astonishing to the liberal mind yet to appearance true rulhiere nowhere says so but that is gradually ones own perception of the matter no other refuge for you out of flat inconceivability philanthropic principle we say which the voltaires and sages of that epoch are prescribing as ones duty and ones glory o ye kings why wont you do good to mankind then catharine a kind of shelouis quatorze was equal to such a thing to put ones cast lover into a thronepoor soul console him in that mannerand reduce the longdissentient country to blessed composure under him what a thing foolish poniatowski an empty windy creature redolent of macassar and the finer sensibilities of the heart him she did make king of poland but to reduce the longdissentient country to composurethat was what she could not do countries in that predicament are sometimes very difficult to compose the czarina took for above five years a great deal of trouble without losing patience the czarina after every new effort perceived with astonishment that she was farther from success than ever with astonishment and gradually with irritation thickening and mounting towards indignation  there is no reason to believe that the grandiose woman handled or designed to handle a doomed poland in the merciless felinediabolic way set forth with wearisome loud reiteration in those distracted books playing with the poor country as cat does with mouse now lifting her fell paw letting the poor mouse go loose in floods of celestial joy and hope without limit and always clutching the hapless creature back into the blackness of death before eating and ending it reason first is that the czarina as we see her elsewhere never was in the least a cat or a devil but a mere woman already virtual proprietress of poland and needing little contrivance to keep it virtually hers reason second is that she had not the gift of prophecy and could not foreknow the polish events of the next ten years much less shape them out beforehand and preside over them like a devil or otherwise in the way supposed  my own private conjecture i confess has rather grown to be on much reading of those rulhieres and distracted books that the czarinawho was a grandiose creature with considerable magnanimities natural and acquired with many ostentations some really great qualities and talents in effect a kind of shelouis quatorze if the reader will reflect on that royal gentleman and put him into petticoats in russia and change his improper females for improper malesthat the czarina very clearly resolute to keep poland hers had determined with herself to do something very handsome in regard to poland and to gain glory both with the enlightened philosophe classes and with her own proud heart by her treatment of that intricate matter on the one hand thinks she or let us fancy she thinks here is poland a country fallen bedrid amid anarchies curable or incurable much tormented with religious intolerance at this time hateful to the philosophic mind a hateful fanaticism growing upon it for forty years past though it is quite against polish law and the cries of oppressed dissidents dissenters chiefly of the protestant and of the greek persuasion becoming more and more distressing to hear and on the other hand here is poniatowski who who  readers have not forgotten the handsome otherwise extremely paltry young polack stanislaus poniatowski whom excellency williams took with him 8 or 9 years ago ostensibly as secretary of legation unostensibly as something very different handsome stanislaus did duly become lover of the grandduchess and has duly in the course of nature some time ago date uncertain to me become discarded lover the question rising what is to be done with that elegant inane creature and his vaporous sentimentalisms and sublime sorrows and disappointments let us make him king of poland said the czarina who was always much the gentleman with her discarded lovers more so i should say than louis quatorze with hisand indeed it is computed they cost her in direct moneys about twenty millions sterlingbeing numerous and greedy but never the least tiff of scolding or ill language castera vie de catharine ii has an elaborate appendix on this part of his subjectking of poland with furnishings and set him handsomely up in the world we will close the dissident business for him cure many a curable anarchy of poland to the satisfaction of voltaire and all leading spirits of mankind he shall have outfit of russian troops poor creature and be able to put down anarchies and show himself a useful and grateful viceroy for us there outfit of 10000 troops a wise russian manager and the question of the dissidents to be settled as the first glory of his reign  ingenuous readers are invited to try in their diffuse vague rulhieres and unintelligible shrieky polish histories whether this notion does not rise on them as a possible human explanation more credible than the felinediabolic one which needs withal such a foreknowledge unattainable by cat or devil poland must not rise to be too strong a country and turn its back on russia no truly nor except by miraculous suspension of the laws of nature is there danger of that but neither need poland lie utterly lame and prostrate useless to russia and be tortured on its sickbed with dissident questions and anarchies curable by a strong sovereign of whom much is expected by voltaire and the leading spirits of mankind  what we shall have to say with perfect certainty and what alone concerns us in our own affair is first that catharine did proceed by this method of crowning fitting out and otherwise setting up stanislaus did attempt settlement and at one time thought she had settled the dissident question and some curable anarchiesbut stirred up such legions of incurable waxing on her hands day after day year after year as were abundantly provoking and astonishingand that within the next eight years she had arrived with poland and her cargo of anarchies at results which struck the whole world dumb dumb with astonishment for some time and then into tempests of vociferation more or less delirious which have never yet quite ended though sinking gradually to lower and lower stages of human vocality fact first is abundantly manifest nor is fact second any longer doubtful that king friedrich in regard to all this till a real crisis elsewhere had risen took little or no visible interest whatever had one unvarying course of conduct that of punctually following czarish majesty in every respect instructing his minister at warsaw always to second and reinforce the russian one as his one rule of policy in that countrywhose distracted procedures imbecilities and anarchies are beyond this point of keeping well with a grandiose czarina concerned in it of no apparent practical interest to prussia or its king  friedrich for a long time passed with the public for contriver of the catastrophe of polandfelonious mortal monster of maleficence and what not in consequence rulhiere whose notion of him is none of the friendliest nor correctest acquits him of this atrocity declares him till the very end mainly or altogether passive in it which i think is a little more than the truthand only a little as perhaps may appear by and by beyond dispute these polish events did at last grow interesting enough to prussia and its kingand it will be our task sufficient in this place to extricate and riddle out what few of these had any cardinal or notable quality and put them down dated if possible and in intelligible form as pertinent to throwing light on this distressing matter with careful exclusion of the immense mass which can throw only darkness     exlover poniatowski becomes king of poland 7th sept 1764 and is crowned without loss of his hair  warsaw 7th september 1764 stanislaus poniatowski by what management of an imperial catharine upon an anarchic nation readers shall imagine ad libitum was elected what they call elected king of poland of course there had been preliminary diets of convocation much dieting demonstrating and electing of imaginary members of dietonly ten persons massacred in the business there was a saxon party but no countercandidate of that or any other nation king friedrich solicited by a charming electressdowager decides to remain accurately passive polish emissaries came entreating him a certain mockranowski who had been a soldier under him never of much mark in that capacity though now a flamingly conspicuous general and politician in the new scene he has got into came passionately entreating potsdam summer of 1764 is all the date donnez nous le prince henri give us prince henri for a king the sound of which almost made friedrich turn pale have you spoken or hinted of this to the prince no your majesty home then instantly and not a whisper of it again to any mortal rulhiere ii 268 hermann vi 355364 which they say greatly irritated prince henri and left a permanent soreplace in his mind when he came to hear of it long after  a question rises here says one of my notes which perhaps i had better have burnt at or about what dates did this glorious poniatowski become lover of the grandduchess and then become exlover nobody will say or perhaps can preuss iv 12 seems to try but does not succeed would have been a small satisfaction to us and it is denied ritter williams that is hanbury must have produced him at petersburg some time in 1756 11th january 1757 finding it would suit poniatowski appeared there on his own footing as ambassador from warsaweasy to get that kind of credential from a devoted warsaw if you are succeeding at the court of petersburg warsaw watchfully makes that the rule of distributing its honors and from freezingpoint upwards is the most delicate thermometer says hermann somewhere and this is our one date poniatowski in business spring 1757 of poniatowski fallen bankrupt date is totally wanting  poniatowskis age is 32 gonehow long out of russia readers have to guess made his first public appearance on the streets of warsaw in the late election time as a captain of patriot volunteersindependence of poland shall poland be dictated to cried stanislaus and an indignant public at one stage of the affair his uncles czartoryski were piloting him in and in that mad element the cries and shiftings of tack had to be many in hermann v 362380 still more in rulhiere ii 119289 wearisome account of every particular he is nephew by his mother of these czartoryskis but is not by the father of very high family ought he to be king of poland argued some polish emissary at petersburg his grandfather was landsteward to the sapiehas and if he himself had been it said the empress inflexible though with a blushit seems the family was really good though fallen poor and since that landsteward phasis had bloomed well out again his father was conspicuous as a busy shifting kind of man in the charlestwelfth and other troubles had died two years ago as castellan of cracow always a dear friend of stanislaus leczinski who gets his death two years hence in 1766 as we have seen  king stanislaus poniatowski had five brothers two of them dead long before this time a third still alive was bishop of something abbot of something ate his revenues in peace and demands silence from us the other two casimir and andreas are better worth namingespecially the son of one of them is casimir the eldest is grand crownchamberlain in the days now coming is also starost of zips a country you may note the name ofand has a son who is not the remarkable one andreas the second brother died 1773 was in the austrian service ordnancemaster and a man of parts and weightwho has been here at warsaw ardently helping in the late election time he too had a son at this time a child in armswho is really the remarkable nephew of king stanislaus and still deserves a word from us  this nephew bred as an austrian soldier like his father is the joseph poniatowski who was very famous in the newspapers fifty years ago by all appearance a man of some real patriotism energy and worth he had tried to believe though i think never rightly able what his omnipotent napoleon had promised him that extinct poland should be resuscitated and he fought and strove very fiercely his poles and he in that faith or halffaith and perished

since thatthough she now and then still tries it in the insane the more to my regret for her and others  besides these three brothers king stanislaus had two sisters still living one of them wife of a very high zamoiski the other of a ditto branicki pronounce branitzkihim whom our german books call krongrossfeldherr grand crowngeneral if the crown have any soldiers at all the sublime debauched old branicki of whom rulhiere is continually talking and never reports anything but futilities in a futile manner so much is futile and not worth reporting in this polish elementking stanislaus himself was born 17th january 1732 played king of shreds and patches till 1790or even farther not till 1795 did catharine pluck the paper tabard quite off him he died in petersburg february 11th or 12th 1798 after such a life  stanislaus was crowned 25th november 1764 he needs as preliminary to be anointed on the bare scalp of him with holy oil before crowning ought to have his head closeshaved with that view stanislaus having an uncommonly fine head of hair shuddered at the barbarous idea absolutely would not whereupon delay consultation and at length some artificial scalp or second skull of pasteboard or dyed leather was contrived for the poor man which comfortably took the oiling in a vicarious way with the ambrosial locks well packed out of sight under it and capable of flowing out again next day as if nothing had happened rulhiere not a sublime specimen of ornamental human nature this poor stanislaus ornamental wholly the body of him and the mind of him got up for representation and terribly plucked to pieces on the stage of the world you may try to drop a tear over him but will find mostly that you cannot     for several years the dissident question cannot be got settled confederation of radom 23d june 17675th march 1768 pushes it into settlement  for several years after this feat of the false scalp through long volumes wearisome even in rulhiere there turns up nothing which can now be called memorable the settling of the dissident question proves extremely tedious to an impatient czarina as to curing of the other curable anarchies there is absolutely nothing but a knitting up by a with a ravellingout again by b and no progress discernible whatever impatient czarina ardently pushes on some dissident settlementseconded by king friedrich and the chief protestant courts london included and by the european leading spirits everywherethrough endless difficulties finds native orthodoxy an unexpectedly stiff matter bishops generally having a fanaticism which is wonderful to think of and which keeps mounting higher and higher till at length there will images of the virgin take to weepingas they generally do in such cases when in the vicinity of brewhouses and conveniences nicolai in his travels over germany doggedly undertook to overhaul one of those weeping virgins somewhere in austria i think and found her he says to depend on subterranean percolation of steam from a brewery not far offa carmelite monk go about the country working miracles and in short an extremely ugly phasis of religious human nature disclose itself to the afflicted reader king friedrich thinks had it not been for this dissident question things would have taken their old saxon complexion and poland might have rotted on as heretofore perhaps a good while longer  as to the knittingup and ravellingout again which is called curing of the other anarchies no reader can or need say anything it seems to be a most painful knittingup by the czartoryskis chiefly then an instant ravelling out by malign opposition parties of various indistinct complexion the knitting the ravelling and the malign opposition parties alike indistinct and without interest to mankind a certain drunken rather brutal phantasm of a prince radzivil who hates the czartoryskis and is dreadfully given to drink to wasteful ambitions and debaucheries figures much in these businesses is got banished and confiscated by some confederation formed then by new confederations is recalled and reinstatedworse if possible than ever the thing is reality but it reads like a phantasmagory produced by lapland witches under presidency of diabolus very certainly the devil presiding as you see at all turnsand is not worth understanding were it even easy  much semiintelligible wholly forgettable stuff about king stanislaus and his difficulties and his duplicities and treacherous imbecilities hermann v 400 c rulhiere passim now of interest to no mortal stanislaus is at one time out with the uncles czartoryski at another in with these worthy gentlemen a man not likely to cure anarchies unless wishing would do it on the dissident question itself he needs spurring a king of liberal ideas yes but with such flames of fanaticism under the nose of him in regard to the dissident and all other curative processes he is languid evasive for moments recalcitrant to russian suggestions a lost imbecileforget him with or without a tear he has still a good deal of socalled gallantry on his hands flies to his harem when outside things go contradictory hermann v 402 c think

that has with more of the like stuff for a czarinas behoof  winter of 1766 imperial majesty whether after or before that miraculous carmelite monk i do not remember became impatient of these tedious languors and tortuosities about the dissident question and gave express order settle it straightway to which end confederations and the other machinery were set agoing confederations among the protestants and dissidents themselves about thorn and such places got up by russian engineering and much more extensively in the lithuanian parts confederations of great extent imperative minatory ostensibly for reinstating these poor people in their rights which by old polish law they quite expressly were if that were any matter but in reality for bringing back drunken radzivil who has covenanted to carry that measure and so  june 23d 1767 these multiplex polishlithuanian confederations twentyfour of them in all with their sublime marshals and officials and above 80000 noblemen in them meet by deputies at radom a convenient little town within wind of warsaw lies 60 miles to south of warsaw and there coalesce into one general confederation of radom hermann v 420 with drunken radzivil atop who glad to be reinstated in his ample domains and winecellars and willing at any rate to spite the czartoryskis and others has pledged himself to carry that great measure in diet and quash any nie pozwalams and difficulties there may be this is the once worldfamous now dimly discoverable confederation of radom whichby preparatory declaring under its hand and seal that the law of the land must again become valid and free polacks of dissident opinions concerning religion nos dissidentes de religione as the old law phrases it shall have equal rights of citizenshipwas beautifully instrumental in achieving that bit of human progress and pushing it through the diet and its difficulties shortly ensuing  not that the diet did not need other vigorous treatment as well the flame of fanaticism being frightfully ardent many of the poor bishops having run nearly frantic at this open spoliation of mother church and snatching of the sword from peter so that imperial majesty had to decide on picking out a dozen or bakers dozen of the hottest bishops and carrying them quietly into russia under lock and key till the thing were done done it was surely to the infinite relief of mankindi cannot say precisely on what day october 13th14th locking up of the dozen bishops was one vital epoch of it november 19th 1767 report of committee on it under radzivils and russias coercion was another first and last it took about five months baking in diet diet met oct 4th 1767 radzivil controlling as grandmarshal and russia as minatory phantom controlling radzivil diet after adjournments after one long adjournment disappeared 5th march 1768 and of work mentionable it had done this of the dissidents only that of contributing to the sovereign contempt with which king stanislaus is regarded by all ranks of men is hardly to be called peculiar work or peculiarly mentionable  at this point to relieve the readers mind and at any rate as the date is fully come we will introduce a small newspaper article from a very high hand little guessed till long afterwards as the writernamely from king friedrichs own it does not touch on the dissident question or the polish troubles but does in a backhanded way on prussian rumors rising about them and may obliquely show more of the kings feeling on that subject than we quite suppose it seems the king had heard that the berlin people were talking and rumoring of a war being just at hand whereuponmarch 5th 1767 in the vossische zeitung vosss chronicle no 28 an inquisitive berlin public read as follows  we are advised from potsdam that on the 27th of february towards evening the sky began to get overcast black clouds presaging a tempest of unexampled fury covered all the horizon the thunder with its lightnings forked bolts of amazing brilliancy burst out and under its redoubled peals there descended such a torrent of hail as within mans memory had not been seen of two bullocks yoked in their plough with which a peasant was hastening home one was struck on the head by a piece of it and killed outright many of the common people were wounded in the streets a brewer had his arm broken roofs are destroyed by the weight of this hail all the windows that looked windward while it fell were broken in the streets hailstones were found of the size of pumpkins citrouilles which had not quite melted two hours after the storm ceased this singular phenomenon has made a very great impression scientific people say the air had not buoyancy enough to support these solid masses when congealed to ice that the small hailstones in these clouds getting so lashed about in the impetuosity of the winds had united the more the farther they fell and had not acquired that enormous magnitude till comparatively near the earth whatever way it may have happened it is certain that occurrences of that kind are rare and almost without example vossische zeitung ubi supra oeuvres de frederic xv 204  another singularity is professor johann daniel titius of wittenberg who teaches natural philosophy in that famous university one may judge with what effect wrote a monograph on this unusual phenomenon rodenbeck ii 285 gives the title of it considerations on the potsdam hail of last year wittenberg 1768     confederation of bar ensues on the percontra side march 28th 1768 and as first result of its achievements october 6th 1768 a turkrussian war  the confederation of radom and its victorious diet had hardly begun their song of triumph when there ensued on the percontra side a flaming confederation of barwhich by successive stages does at last burn out the anarchies of poland and reduce them to ashes confederation of bar and then as progeny of that for and against such a brood of confederations orthodox heterodox big little shortlived longlived of all complexions and degrees of noisy fury potent at any rate each of them for murder and arson within a certain radius as the earth never saw before now was the time of those inextricable marchings as inroads and outroads through the lithuanian bogs of those deathdefiant unparalleled exploits skirmishings scaladings riding by the edge of precipices of pulawski potocki and othersin which rulhiere loses himself and turns on his axis amid impatient readers  for the russian troops summoned by a trembling stanislaus and his senate in terms of treaty 1764 and in more languid manner the stanislaus soldiery as per law of the case proceeded to strike ingenerally my impression was with an eye to maintain the kings peace and keep down murder and arsonand sure enough the small bodies of drilled russians blew an infuriated orthodox polack chivalry to right and left at a short notice but as to the constables peace or kings made no improvement upon that far the reverse it is certain the confederate chivalry were driven about at a terrible rateover the turk frontier for shelter began to appeal to the grand turk in desperate terms brother of the sun and moon saw you ever such a chance for finishing russia polack chivalry is orthodox catholic but also it is antirussian the turk beginning to give ear to it made the matter pressing and serious here more specifically are some features and successive phasesunless the reader prefer to skip  bar march 1768 the confederation of radom as efficient preliminary and chief agent in that diet of emancipation to the dissident human mind might long have been famous over poland and the world but there instantly followed as corollary to it a confederation of bar which quite dimmed the fame of radom and indeed of all confederations prior or posterior as the confederation of bar and its doings or rather sufferings and tragical misdoings and undoings still hang like fitful spectralities or historical shadows of a vague ghastly complexion in the human memory one asks at least since they were on this planet tell us where bar is in the waiwodship podol what we call podolia some 400 miles southeast of warsaw not far from the dniester rivernot far very from that mystery of the dniester the zaporavian cossacksfrom those rapids or cataracts quasicataracts of the dniester with islands in them where those cossack robbers live unassailableacross the dniester lies turkey and its famed fortress of choczim this is a commodious station for polish gentlemen intending mutiny by law  march 8th 1768 three short days after the diet of radom had done its fine feat and retired to privacy news came to warsaw that podolia and the southern parts are all up confederating with the highest animation in hot rage against such decision of a diet contrary to holy religion and to much else and that the said decision will have to fight for itself now that it has done voting this interesting news is true and goes on intensifying and enlarging itself one dreadful confederation springing up and then another and ever another day after day till at last we hear that on the 27th of the month march 27th 1768 at bar a little town on the southern or turkish frontier all these more or less dreadful confederations have met by delegates and coalesced into one confederatiou of barwhich did surely prove dreadful enough to itself especially in the months now ensuing  no history of bar confederation shall we dream of far be such an attempt from us it consists of many confederations and out of each pro and contra spring many like the lernean hydra or even hydras in a plural condition a manyheaded dog and how many whelps it hadi cannot give even the cipher of them or i would one whelp confederation that of cracow is distinguished by having frequently or generally been drunk and of course its procedures had often a vinous character in hermann v 431448 and especially in rulhiere ii livre 8 et seq details in superabundance i fancy to have read somewhere that the number of them was one hundred and twentyfive the rumor and the furious barking of bar and its whelps goes into all lands such rabid loud baying at mankind and the moon and then under russias treatment such shrill yelping and shrieking was not heard in the world before though perhaps it has since  poor bars exploits in the fighting way were highly inconsiderable all on the same scale and spread over such a surface of country mostly unknown as renders it impossible to give them headroom were you never so unfurnished they can be read in eloquent rulhiere but by no mortal held in memory anarchy is not a thing to be written of a lernean hydra several lernean hydras in chaotic genesis getting their heads lopped off and at the same time sprouting new ones in such ratio where is the zoologist that will give account of it there was not anything considerable of fighting but of bullying plundering murdering and being murdered a frightful amount there are seizures of castles convents defensible houses marches at a rate like that of antelopes through the lithuanian parts boggy hungry boundless opening to the fancy the infinitude of peat in the solid and the fluid state this perhaps is the finest species of feats though they never lead to anything there are heroes famed for these marches  the pulawskis for examplefour of them lawyer peopleshowed much activity and a talent for impromptu soldiering in that kind the magnates of the confederation i was surprised to learn had all quitted it the instant it came to strokes you lawyer people with your priests and orthodox peasantries you do the fighting part ours is the consulting and except potocki and he worse than none there is presently not a magnate of them left in polandthe rest all gone across the austrian border to teschen to bilitz a handy little town and domain in that duchy of teschenand sit there as committee of government much at their ease in comparison could they but agree among themselves which they cannot bilitz is one of the many domains of magnate sulkowskido readers recollect the sulkowski who at one time declared war on king friedrich and was picked up both war and he so compendiously by general goltz and locked in glogau to cool this is the same sulkowski much concerned now in these matters a rich magnate glad to see his friends about him as governing committee but gets and gives a great deal of vexation in it the element proving again too hot  i said there were four famed pulawskis hermann v 465 a father once advocate in warsaw with three sons and a nephew who though extremely active people could do no good whatever the father pulawski had the fine idea of introducing the british constitution clothing poland wholly in british tailorage and so making it a new poland but he never could get it done this poor gentleman died in turkish prison flung into jail at constantinople on calumnious accusation and contrivance by a rival countryman his sons and nephew poor fellows all had their fame more or less in the cause of freedom so called but no other profit in this world that i could hear of casimir the eldest son went to america died there still in the cause of freedom so called fort pulawski in the harbor of charleston which is at present on very singular terms reengaged in the same socalled cause was named in memory of this casimir he had defended czenstochow if anybody knew what czenstochow was or could find it in the polish map and it was also he that contrived that wonderful plan of suddenly snapping up king stanislaus from the streets of warsaw one night 3d november 1771 and of locking him away by no means killing him as the source of all our woes o my pulawskis men not without manhood what a bedlam of a time have you and i fallen into and what causes of freedom it has got in hand  bar a poor place with no defences but a dry ditch and some miserable earthworks the confederates had not the least chance to maintain kaminiec the only fortress of the province they never even got into finding some fraction of royal soldiery who stood for king stanislaus there and who fired on the confederates when applied to bar a small russian division with certain stanislaus soldieries conjoined took by capitulation and date not given entered in a victorious manner the warepic of the confederates which rulhiere sings at such length is blank of meaning  of cloister czenstochow a famed feat of pulawskis also without result i could not from my rulhiere discover what was altogether an illuminative fact to me that the date of czenstochow was not till 1771 a feat of cloister berdiczow almost an exact facsimile by the same pulawski also resultless i did under hermanns guidance at once findand hope the reader will be satisfied to accept it instead cloister berdiczow which lies in the palatinate of kiow and which has a miraculous holy virgin not less venerated far and wide in those eastern parts than she of cloister czenstochow in the western this cloister berdiczow and its salutary virgin pulawski the casimir now of charleston harbor did defend with about 1000 men in a really obstinate way the monastery itself had in it gifts of the faithful accumulated for ages and all the richest people in those provinces confederate or not had lodged their preciosities there as in an impregnable and sure place in those times of trouble intensely desirous accordingly the russians were to take it but had no cannon desperately resolute pulawski and his 1000 to defend pulawski and his 1000 fired intensely till their cannonballs were quite done then took to firing with ironwork and hard miscellanies of every sort especially glad when they could get a haul of glass to load withand absolutely would not yield till famine came though the terms offered were goodhad they been kept  so that pulawski it would appear did two cloister defences two each with a miraculous holy virgin an eastern and then a westerly this of berdiczow not dated to me farther is for certain of the year 1768 and pulawski owing to famine did yield here in 1771 at miraculous cloister czenstochow in the western parts pulawski did an external feat or consented to see it donethat of trying to snuff out poor king stanislaus on the streets 3d november 10 pm miraculously in vain as most readers knowwhich brought its obloquies and troubles on the defender of czenstochow obloquies and troubles but as to surrendering czenstochow on call of obloquy or of famine itself pulawski would not not he for his own part but solemnly left his men to do it and walked away by circuitous uncertain paths which end in charleston harbor as we have seen at savannah in a stricter sense perished at the siege futile attempt to storm by the french which they called a siege of savannah 9th october 1779 defence of czenstochow in 1771 shall not concern us farther truly these two small defences of monasteries by pulawski are almost all i do not say of glorious but even of creditable or human that reward the poor wanderer in that polish valley of jehoshaphat much of it peatcountry wherefore i have as before marked the approximate localities approximate dates for behoof of ingenuous readers  the russians ever since 1764 from the beginnings of those stanislaus times are pledged to maintain peace in poland and it is they that have to deal with this affairthey especially or almost wholly poor stanislaus having scarcely any power military or other and perhaps being loath withal there was more of investigating and parleying bargaining and intriguing than of fighting on stanislauss part june 11th 1768 says a saxon note from warsaw mokranowski stanislauss general the same that was with friedrich has been sent down to bar to look into those confederates mokranowski does not think there are above 8000 of them about 3000 have got their death from russian castigation the 8000 might be treated with only russians are so dreadfully severe especially so intent on wringing money from them confederates have been complaining to the turk turk ambiguous gives them no definite ground of hope what then is your hope i inquired little or none except in heaven several answered it is for our religion and our liberty religion cut to pieces by this dissident tolerationblasphemy liberty ditto by the russian guarantee of peace among us what can we do but trust in god and our own despair essens report 11th june 1768 in hermann v 441 prave worts ancient pistolbut much destitute of sense and not to be realized in present circumstances here is something much more critical  junejuly 1768 the peasants in the southern regions palatinates podol kiow braclaw called ukraine or bordercountry by the poles are mostly of greek and other schismatic creeds their lords are of an orthodox religion and not distinguished by mild treatment of such peasantry upon whom civil war and plunder have been latterly a sore visitation to complete the matter the confederates in certain quarters blown upon by fanatical priests set about converting these poor peasants or forcing them at the point of the bayonet to swear that they adopt the greek united rite which i suppose to be a kind of halfway house towards perfect orthodoxy in one village which was getting converted in this manner the military party seemed to be small the village boiled over upon it trampled orthodoxy and military both under foot in a violent and sanguinary manner and was extremely frightened when it had done extremely frightened not the village only but the schismatic mind generally in those parts dreading vengeance for such a paroxysm but the atrocious russians whispered them we are here to protect you in your religions and rights in your poor consciences and skins upon which hint of the atrocious russians the schismatic mind and population one and all rose and with the cannibals ferocity gave way to their appetite for plunder  nay the russian government certain russian officials hard pressed had invited the zaporavian cossacks to step over from their islands in the dniester and assist in defending their religion true greek of course who at once did so and not only extinguished the last glimmer of confederation there but overwhelmed the country thousands on thousands of them attended by revolted peasantssay a 20000 of peasants under command of these zaporavianswho went about plundering and burning that they plundered the jew pothouses of their brandy and drank it was a small matter very furious upon jews upon noblemen landlords upon catholic priests on one tree tree should have been noted was found hanged a specimen of each of those classes with a dog adjoined as fit company in one little town town of human so called in that foreign dialect getting some provocation or other they set to massacring and if brandy were plentiful we can suppose they made short work by the lowest computation the number of slain jews and catholics amounted to 10000 odd hermann v 444 rulhiere iii 93rulhiere says 50000 by some accounts 200000 this i guess to have been at its height about the end of june this leads direct to the catastrophe as will presently be seen  foreign states dont seem to pay much attentionindeed what sane person would like to interfere or hope to do it with profit france austria both wish well to poland at least ill to russia choiseul has no finance can do nothing but intrigue and stir up trouble everywhere a devout kaiserinn goes with holy church and disapproves of these dissident tolerations it is remarked that all through 1768 the confederates of bar are permitted to retire over the austrian frontier into austrian silesia and find themselves there in safety permitted to buy arms to make preparations issue orders at sulkowskis bilitz in the duchy of teschen supreme managing committee sits there no

just heard in fact for diligence in this turk element in this young time the like of him was seldom seen we knew him long afterwards as a diligent old gentleman in frenchrevolution daysm de vergennes zealously supports zealous to let loose the turk upon antifrench parties the turks seem to wag their heads for some time and their responses are ambiguous for some time not for long here fast enough comes in disguised shape the catastrophe itself ye poor plaintive poles  julyoctober 1768 those zaporavian and other cossacks with 20000 peasants plundering about on both sides of the dniester had set fire to the little town of balta which is on the south side and belongs to the turks a very grave accident think all political people think especially the foreign excellencies at warsaw when news of it arrives burning of balta not to be quenched by the amplest russian apologies proved a livecoal at constantinople and vergennes says he set population and divan on fire by it a proof that the population and divan had already been in a very inflammable state not a wise divan though a zealous plenty of fury in these people but a sad deficiency of every other faculty they made haste in their hot humor to declare war 6th october 1768 hermann v 608611 not considering much how they would carry it on declared themselves in late autumnas if to give the russians ample time for preparing those poor turks themselves being as yet ready with nothing and even the season for fieldoperations being over  king friedrich who has still a minister at the porte endeavored to dissuade his old turk friends in this rash crisis but to no purpose they would listen to nothing but vergennes and their own fury friedrich finds this war a very mad one on the part of his old turk friends their promptitude to go into it he has known them backward enough when their chances were better and their way of carrying it on are alike surprising to him he says catharines generals were unacquainted with the first elements of castrametation and tactic but the generals of the sultan had a still more prodigious depth of ignorance so that to form a correct idea of this war you must figure a set of purblind people who by constantly beating a set of altogether blind end by gaining over them a complete mastery oeuvres de frederic vi 23 24 this as friedrich knows is what austria cannot suffer this is what will involve austria and russia and friedrich along with them infriedrich as the matter gradually unfolds itself shudders to think what the beginnings of this war were perhaps almost comical to the old soldierking but as it gradually developed itself into complete shattering to pieces of the stupid blind by the ambitious purblind he grew abundantly serious upon it  it is but six months since polish patriotism so effulgent to its own eyes in orthodoxy in love of glorious liberty confederated at bar and got into that extraordinary whirlpool or cesspool of miseries and deliriums we have been looking at and now it has issued on a broad highway of progressbroad and precipitousand will rapidly arrive at the goal set before it all was so rapid on the polish and on the turkish part the blind turks out of mere fanaticism and heat of humor have rushed into this adventureand go rushing forward into a series of chaotic platitudes on the huge scale and mere tragical disasters year after year which would have been comical had they not been so hideous and sanguinary constant and enormous blunders on the turk part issuing in disasters of like magnitude which in the course of two campaigns had quite finished off their polish friends in a very unexpected way and had like to have finished themselves off had not drowned poland served as a steppingstone  not till march 26th 1769 six months after declaring in such haste did the blind turks display their banner of mahomet that is begin in earnest to assemble and make ready nor were the russians shiningly strategic though sooner in the fielda prince galitzin commanding them an extremely purblind person till replaced by romanzow our old colberg acquaintance who saw considerably better galitzin early in the season made a rush on choczim chotzim the first turk fort beyond the dniester and altogether failednot by turk prowess but by his own purblind malarrangements want of ammunition want of bread or i will forget whatwhich occasioned mighty grumblings in russia till in a month or two by favor of fortune and blindness of the turk matters had come well round again and galitzin walking up to choczim the second time found there was not a turk in the place and that choczim was now his on those uncommonly easy terms  instead of farther details on such a warthe shadow or reflex of which as mirrored in the austrian mind has an importance to friedrich and us but the self or substance of which has otherwise little or nonewe will close here with a bit of russian satire on it which is still worth reading the date is evidently spring 1769 the scene what we are now treating of galitzin obliged to fall back from choczim great rumorwhat a galitzin what a turk war his in contrast to the last we had turk war of 17361739 under munnich supra vii 81126no romanzow yet appointed in his room and here is a small manuscript which was then circulating fresh and new in russian society and has since gone over all the world though mostly in an uncertain condition in old jestbooks and the like as a genuine bit of caviare from those northern parts  manuscript circulating in russian society galitzin much grieved about choczim could not sleep and wandering about in his tent overheard one night a common soldier recounting his dream to the sentry outside the door  a curious dream said the soldier i dreamt i was in a battle that i got my head cut off that i died and of course went to heaven i knocked at the door peter came with a bunch of keys and made such rattling that he awoke god who started up in haste asking what is the matter why says peter there is a great war on earth between the russians and the turks and who commands my russians said the supreme being count munnich answered peter very well i may go to sleep againbut this was not the end of my dream continued the soldier i fell asleep and dreamt again the very same as before except that the war was not count munnichs but the one we are now in accordingly when god asked who commands my russians peter answered prince galitzin galitzin then get me my boots said the russian supreme being w richardson then at petersburg tutor to excellency cathcarts children afterwards professor at glasgow and a man of some reputation in his old age anecdotes of the russian empire in a series of letters written a few years ago from st petersburg london 1784 p 110 date of this letter is 17th october 1769     chapter ivpartition of poland  these polish phenomena were beginning to awaken a good deal of attention not all of it pleasant on the part of friedrich from the first he had as usual been a most cleareyed observer of everything and found the business as appears not of tragical nature but of expensivefarcical capable to shake the diaphragm rather than touch the heart of a reflective onlooker he has a considerable poem on itwar of the confederates by title in the old style of the palladion imitating an unattainable jeanne darcconsiderable poem now forming itself at leisure in his thoughts la guerre des confederes oeuvres xiv 183 et seq finished in november 1771 which decidedly takes that turn and laughs quite loud at the rabid fanaticisms blusterous inanities and imbecilities of these noisy unfortunate neighborsold unpleasant style of the palladion and pucelle but much better worth reading having a great deal of sharp sense in its laughing guise and more of real historical discernment than you will find in any other book on that delirious subject  much a laughingstock to this king hitherto such a war of the confederatesconsisting of the noisiest emptiest bedlam tumults seasoned by a proportion of homicide and a great deal of battery and arson but now with a russianturk war springing from it or already sprung there are quite serious aspects rising amid the laughable by treaty this war is to cost the king either a 12000 of auxiliaries to the czarina or a 72000 pounds 480000 thalers annually oeuvres de frederic vi 13which latter he prefers to pay her as the alternative not an agreeable feature at all but by no means the worst feature suppose it lead to russian conquests on the turk to austrian complicacies to one knows not what and kindle the world round one again in short we can believe friedrich was very willing to stand well with nextdoor neighbors at present and be civil to austria and its young kaisers civilities     first interview between friedrich and kaiser joseph neisse 25th28th august 1769  in 1766 the young kaiser who has charge of the military department and of little else in the government and is already a great traveller and enthusiastic soldier made a pilgrimage over the bohemian and saxon battlefields of the sevenyears war on some of them whether on all i do not know he set up memorialstones one of which you still see on the field of lobositzof another on prag field and of reverent salutation by artillery to the memory of schwerin there we heard long ago coming to torgau on this errand the kaiser through his berlin minister had signified his particular desire to make acquaintance with the king in returning to which the king was ready with the readiestonly that kaunitz and the kaiserinn in the interim judged it improper and stopped it the reported interview is not to take place friedrich warns the newspapers having been given up though only from courtesy on some points of ceremonial friedrich to one of his foreign ambassadors the common way of announcing in newspapers preuss iv 22 n  the young kaiser felt a little huffed and signified to friedrich that he would find a time to make good this bit of uncivility which his pedagogues had forced upon him and now after three years august 1769 on occasion of the silesian reviews the kaiser is to come across from his bohemian businesses and actually visit him interview to be at neisse 25th august 1769 for three days of course the king was punctual everybody was punctual glad and cordial

the kaiser was reported just coming the king went to the window of the grand episcopal saloon and seeing him alight from his carriage turned round and said je lai vu i have seen him his majesty then went to receive him on the grand staircase had hardly descended three or four steps where they embraced and then his majesty led by the hand his august guest into the apartments designed for him which were all standing open and readywhich however the august guest will not occupy except with a grateful imagination being for the present incognito mere graf von falkenstein and judging that the threekings inn will be suitabler  arrived in the apartments they embraced anew and sat talking together for an hour and halfthe talk unknown to lefebvre began in this strain kaiser now are my wishes fulfilled since i have the honor to embrace the greatest of kings and soldiers king i look upon this day as the fairest of my life for it will become the epoch of uniting two houses which have been enemies too long and whose mutual interests require that they should strengthen not weaken one another kaiser for austria there is no silesia farther preuss v 23 oeuvres de frederic vi 25 26 talk it

lodge in an inn three kings under the name of graf von falkenstein would not go into the carriage which had stood expressly ready to conduct him thither he preferred walking on foot the loftily scornful incognito in spite of the rain it was like a lieutenant of infantry stepping out of his quarters some moments after the king went to visit him and they remained together from 5 in the evening till 8 it was thought they would be present assister at a comic opera which was to be played but after waiting till 7 oclock the people received orders to go on with the pieceboth majesties did

embraced lefebvre while commending his excellent performance which filled the poor soul with a now unimaginable joy  helas says formey the poor gentleman wrote to me of his endless satisfaction and how he hoped to get through his building and retire on halfpay this very season thenceforth to belong to the academy and me he had been member for twenty years past with this view thinks formey he most likely hastened on his buildings too fast certain it is a barrack he was building tumbled suddenly and some workmen perished in the ruins enemies at court suggested or the accident itself suggested without any enemy has not he been playing false using cheap bad materialsand friedrich ordered him arrest in his own apartments till the question were investigated excitable lefebvre was like to lose his wits almost to leap out of his skin one evening at supper he managed to smuggle away a knife and in the course of the night gave himself sixteen stabs with it which at length sufficed the king said he has used himself worse than i should have done and was very sorry of lefebvres scientific structures globes of compression and the rest i know not whether anything is left the above two notes thrown off to formey were accidentally a hit and in the great blank may last a long while  the king found this young kaiser a very pretty man and could have liked him considerably had their mutual positions permitted he had a frankness of manner which seemed natural to him says the king in his amiable character gayety and great vivacity were prominent features by accidental chinks

ubi supra it is too insignificant for being shown to readers dialogues there were delicately holding wide of the mark and at length coming close enough but at neither the one interview nor the other was poland at all a party concernedthough beyond doubt the turk war was silently this first time and with clear vocality on the second occasion  in spite of galitzins blunders the turk war is going on

brother of the sun and moon and his performancesis weltering in violently impotent spasms into deeper and ever deeper wretchedness friedrich sometimes thinking of a burlesque poem on the subjectthough the russian successes and the austrian grudgings and gloomings are rising on him as a very serious consideration is there no method then of allowing russia to prosecute its turk war in spite of austria and its umbrages thinks friedrich sometimes in his anxieties about peace in europeif the ukraine and its meal for the armies were but russias at present austria can strike in there cut off the provisions and at once put a spoke in russias wheel friedrich tells us he on the king himself what i do not find in any other book sent to petersburg under the name of count lynar the seraphic danish gentleman who in 1757 had brought about the convention of klosterzeven a project or sketch of plan for partitioning certain provinces of poland in that viewthe lynar opining so far as i can see somewhat as follows russia to lay hold of the essential bit of polish territory for provisioning itself against the turk and allow to austria and prussia certain other bits which would content everybody and enable russia and christendom to extrude and suppress ad libitum that abominable mass of mahometan sensualism darkness and fanaticism from the fairest part of gods creation an excellent project though not successful to which petersburg intoxicated with its own outlooks on turkey paid not the least attention says the king oeuvres de frederic vi 26 he gives no date to this curious statement nor does anybody else mention it at all but we may fancy it to have been of winter 17691770and leave it with the curious or the idly curious since nothing came of it now or afterwards

ligne who was present there has left us some record or loose lively reminiscence of it prince de ligne memoires et melanges historiques par 1827 i 321sputtering effervescing epigrammatic creature had he confined himself to a faithful description and burnt off for us not like a pretty firework but like an innocent candle or thing for seeing by but we must take what we have and endeavor to be thankful by great luck the one topic he insists on is friedrich and his aspect and behavior on the occasion which is what of all else in it we are most concerned with  you have ordered me sire this was written for him in 1785 to speak to you of one of the greatest men of this age you admire him though his neighborhood has done you mischief enough and placing yourself at the impartial distance of history feel a noble curiosity on all that belongs to this extraordinary genius i will therefore give you an exact account of the smallest words that i myself heard the great friedrich speak the i le je is odious to me but nothing is indifferent whenwell your account then your account without farther preambling and in a more exact way than you are wont  by a singular chance in 1770 3d7th september if you would but date the kaiser was for the second time enabled to deliver himself to the personal admiration which he had conceived for the king of prussia and these two great sovereigns were so well together that they could pay visits the kaiser permitted me to accompany and introduced me to the king it was at neustadt in moravia mahrischneustadt short way from austerlitz which is since become a celebrated place i cant recollect if i had or had assumed an air of embarrassment but what i do well remember is that the kaiser who noticed my look said to the king he has a timid expression which i never observed in him before he will recover presently this he said in a graceful merry way and the two went out to go i believe to the play on the way thither the king for an instant quitting his imperial friend asked me if my letter to jean jacques now an entirely forgotten piece which had been printed in the papers was really by me i answered sire i am not famous enough to have my name forged as a certain other name has been on this same unproductive topic he felt what i meant it is known that horace walpole took the kings name to write his famous lettre a jean jacques impossible to attend to the like of it at present which contributed the most to drive mad that eloquent and unreasonable man of genius  coming out of the play the kaiser said to the king of prussia there is noverre the famous composer of ballets he has been in berlin i believe noverre made thereupon a beautiful dancingmaster bow ah i know him said the king we saw him at berlin he was very droll mimicked all the world especially our chief dancing women to make you split with laughing noverre ill content with this way of remembering him made another beautiful thirdposition bow and hoped possibly the king would say something farther and offer him the opportunity of a small revenge your ballets are beautiful said the king to him your dancing girls have grace but it is grace in a squattish form de la grace engoncee i think you make them raise their shoulders and their arms too much for monsieur noverre if you remember our principal dancing girl at berlin wasnt so that is why she was at berlin sire replied noverre satirically all he could  i was every day asked to sup with the king too often the conversation addressed itself to me in spite of my attachment to the kaiser whose general i like to be but not whose dargens or algarotti i had not beyond reason abandoned myself to that feeling when urged by the kings often speaking to me i had to answer and go on talking besides the kaiser took a main share in the conversation and was perhaps more at his ease with the king than the king with him one day they got talking of what one would wish to be in this world and they asked my opinion i said i should like to be a pretty woman till thirty then till sixty a fortunate and skilful generaland not knowing what more to say but for the sake of adding something whatever it might be a cardinal till eighty the king who likes to banter the sacred college made himself merry on this and the kaiser gave him a cheap bargain of rome and its upholders suppots that supper was one of the gayest and pleasantest i have ever seen the two sovereigns were without pretension and without reserve what did not always happen on other days and the amiability of two men so superior and often so astonished to see themselves together was the agreeablest thing you can imagine the king bade me come and see him the first time he and i should have three or four hours to ourselves  a storm such as there never was a deluge compared with which that of deucalion was a summer shower covered our hills with water cannot say which day of the four and almost drowned our army while attempting to manoeuvre the morrow was a restday for that reason at nine in the morning i went to the king and stayed till one he spoke to me of our generals i let him say of his own accord the things i think of marshals lacy and loudon and i hinted that as to the others it was better to speak of the dead than of the living and that one never can well judge of a general who has not in his lifetime actually played high parts in war he spoke to me of feldmarschall daun i said that against the french i believed he might have proved a great man but that against him you he had never quite been all he was seeing always his opponent as a jupiter thunderbolt in hand ready to pulverize his army that appeared to give the king pleasure he signified to me a feeling of esteem for daun he spoke favorably of general brentano one of the maxen gentlemen i asked his reason for the praises i knew he had given to general beck why mais i thought him a man of merit said the king i do not think so sire he didnt do you much mischief he sometimes took magazines from me and sometimes let your generals escape bevern at reichenbach for instance do you reckon that his blamei have never beaten him said the king he never came near enough for that and i always thought your majesty was only appearing to respect him in order that we might have more confidence in him and that you might give him the better slap some day with interest for all arrears  king do you know who taught me the little i know it was your old marshal traun that was a man that oneyou spoke of the french do they make progress  ego they are capable of everything in time of war sire but in peacetheir chiefs want them to be what they are not what they are not capable of being  king how then disciplined they were so in the time of m de turenne  ego oh it isnt that they were not so in the time of m de vendome and they went on gaining battles but it is now wished that they become your apes and ours and that does nt suit them  king perhaps so i have said of their busy people faiseurs st germains and armyreformers that they would fain sing without knowing music  ego oh that is true but leave them their natural notes profit by their bravery their alertness legerete by their very faultsi believe their confusion might confuse their enemies sometimes  king well yes doubtless if you have something to support them with  ego just so siresome swiss and germans  king t is a brave and amiable nation the french one cant help loving thembut mon dieu what have they made of their men of letters and what a tone has now come up among them voltaire for example had an excellent tone dalembert whom i esteem in many respects is too noisy and insists too much on producing effect in societywas it the men of letters that gave the court of louis xiv its grace or did they themselves acquire it from the many amiable persons they found there he was the patriarch of kings that one in a certain sense your majesty in his lifetime a little too much good was said of him but a great deal too much ill after his death  ego a king of france sire is always the patriarch of clever people patriarche des gens desprit you do not much mean this monsieur you merely grin it from the teeth outward  king that is the bad number to draw they are nt worth a doit ne valent pas le diable these gens desprit at governing better be patriarch of the greek church like my sister the empress of russia that brings her and will bring advantages theres a religion for you comprehending many countries and different nations as to our poor lutherans they are so few it is not worth while being their patriarch  ego nevertheless sire if one join to them the calvinists and all the little bastard sects it would not be so bad a post the king appeared to kindle at this his eyes were full of animation but it did not last when i said if the kaiser were patriarch of the catholics that too wouldnt be a bad place  king there there europe divided into three patriarchates i was wrong to begin you see where that leads us messieurs our dreams are not those of the just as m le regent used to say if louis xiv were alive he would thank us  all these patriarchal ideas possible and impossible to realize made him for an instant look thoughtful almost moody  king louis xiv possessing more judgment than cleverness esprit looked out more for the former quality than for the latter it was men of genius that he wanted and found it could not be said that corneille bossuet racine and conde were people of the clever sort des hommes desprit  ego on the whole there is that in the country which really deserves to be happy it is asserted that your majesty has said if one would have a fine dream one must  king yes it is truebe king of france  ego if francis i and henri iv had come into the world after your majesty they would have said be king of prussia  king tell me pray is there no citable writer left in france  this made me laugh the king asked the reason i told him he reminded me of the russe a paris that charming little piece of verse of m de voltaires and we remembered charming things out of it which made us both laugh he said  king i have sometimes heard the prince de conti spoken of what sort of man is he  ego he is a man composed of twenty or thirty men he is proud he is affablehe is fiddle he is diddle in the seesaw epigrammatic way for a page or more and is not worth pen and ink from us since the time old marshal traun got us rid of himhome across the rhine full speed with croats sticking on his skirts supra viii 475  this portrait seemed to amuse the king one had to captivate him by some piquant detail without that he would escape you give you no time to speak the success generally began by the first words no matter how vague of any conversation these he found means to make interesting and what generally is mere talk about the weather became at once sublime and one never heard anything vulgar from him he ennobled everything and the examples of greeks and romans or of modern generals soon dissipated everything of what with others would have remained trivial and commonplace  have you ever said he seen such a rain as yesterdays your orthodox catholics will say that comes of having a man without religion among us what are we to do with this cursed maudit king a protestant at lowest for i really think i brought you bad luck your soldiers would be saying peace we have and still is this devil of a man to trouble us  ego certainly if your majesty was the cause it is very bad such a thing is only permitted to jupiter who has always good reasons for everything and it would have been in his fashion after destroying the one set by fire to set about destroying the others by water however the fire is at an end and i did not expect to revert to it  king i ask your pardon for having plagued you so often with that i regret it for the sake of all mankind but what a fine apprenticeship of war i have committed errors enough to teach you young people all of you to do better mon dieu how i love your grenadiers how well they defiled in my presence if the god mars were raising a bodyguard for himself i should advise him to take them hand over head do you know i was well pleased bien content with the kaiser last night at supper did you hear what he said to me about liberty of the press and the troubling of consciences la gene des consciences there will be bits of difference between his worthy ancestors and him on some points  ego i am persuaded he will entertain no prejudices on anything and that your majesty will be a great book of instruction to him  king how adroitly he disapproved without appearing to mean anything the ridiculous vienna censorship and the too great fondness of his mother without naming her for certain things which only make hypocrites by the by she must detest you that high lady  ego well then not at all she has sometimes lectured me about my strayings but very maternally she is sorry for me and quite sure that i shall return to the right path she said to me some time ago i dont know how you do you are the intimate friend of father griffet the bishop of neustadt has always spoken well of you likewise the archbishop of malines and the cardinal name sinzendorf or else not known to me dignity and red hat sufficiently visible loves you much  why cannot i remember the hundred luminous things which escaped the king in this conversation it lasted till the trumpet at headquarters announced dinner the king went to take his place and i think it was on this occasion that some one having asked why m de loudon had not come yet he said that is not his custom formerly he often arrived before me please let him take this place next me i would rather have him at my side than opposite  that is very pretty and a better authority gives it the king said to loudon himself on loudons entering mettezvous aupres de moi m de loudon jaime mieux vous avoir a cote de moi que visavis he was very kind to loudon constantly called him m le feldmarechal delicate hint of what should have been but was not for seven years yet and at parting gave him as he did to lacy also two superb horses magnificently equipped pezzl vie de loudon ii 29  another day continues prince de ligne the manoeuvres being over in good time there was a concert at the kaisers notwithstanding the kings taste for music he was pleased to give me the preference and came where i was to enchant me with the magic of his conversation and the brilliant traits gay and bold which characterize him he asked me to name the general and particular officers who were present and to tell him those who had served under marshal traun for enfin he said as i think i have told you already he is my master he corrected me in the schooling i was at  ego your majesty was very ungrateful then you never paid him his lessons if it was as your majesty says you should at least have allowed him to beat you and i do not remember that you ever did  king i did not get beaten because i did not fight  ego it is in this manner that the greatest generals have often conducted their wars against each other one has only to look at the two campaigns of m de montecuculi and m de turenne in the valley of the rench strasburg country 1674 and 1675 two celebrated campaigns turenne killed by a cannonshot in the last  king between traun and the former there is not much difference but what a difference bon dieu between the latter and me  i named to him the count dalthan who had been adjutantgeneral and the count de pellegrini he asked me twice which was which from the distance we were at and said he was so shortsighted i must excuse him  ego nevertheless sire in the war your sight was good enough and if i remember right it reached very far  king it was not i it was my glass  ego ha i should have liked to find that glassbut i fear it would have suited my eyes as little as scanderbegs sword my arm  i forget how the conversation changed but i know it grew so free that seeing somebody coming to join in it the king warned him to take care that it was nt safe to converse with a man doomed by the theologians to everlasting fire i felt as if he somewhat overdid this of his being doomed and that he boasted too much of it not to hint at the dishonesty of these freethinking gentlemen messieurs les esprits forts who very often are thoroughly afraid of the devil it is at least bad taste to make display of such things and it was with the people of bad taste whom he has had about him such as a jordan a dargens maupertuis la beaumelle la mettrie abbe de prades and some dull sceptics of his own academy that he had acquired the habit of mocking at religion and of talking de parler dogma spinoism court of rome and the like in the end i did nt always answer when he touched upon it i now seized a moments interval while he was using his handkerchief to speak to him about some business in connection with the circle of westphalia and a little comte immediat county holding direct of the reich which i have there the king answered me i for my part will do anything you wish but what thinks the other director my comrade the elector of cologne about it  ego i was not aware sire that you were an ecclesiastical elector  king i am so at least on my protestant account  ego that is not to our accounts advantage those good people of mine believe your majesty to be their protector  he continued asking me the names of persons he saw i was telling him those of a number of young princes who had lately entered the service and some of whom gave hopes that may be said he but i think the breed of the governing races ought to be crossed i like the children of love look at the marechal de saxe and my own anhalt severe adjutant von anhalt a bastard of prinz gustav the old dessauers heirapparent who begot a good many bastards but died before inheriting bastards were brought up all of them to soldiering by their unclesthis one by uncle moritz was thrown from his horse eight years hence to the great joy of many though i am afraid that since mark this since alas his fall on his head that latter is not so good as formerly i should be grieved at it not for eight years yet mon prince i am sorry to say adjutant von anhalt did in reality get this fall and damaging hurt on the head in the bavarian war nicknamed kartoffelkrieg potatowar 17781779 militairlexikon i 69 see preuss ii 356 iv 578 c both for his sake and for mine he is a man full of talents  i am glad to remember this for i have heard it said by silly slanderous people sots denigrants who accuse the king of prussia of insensibility that he was not touched by the accident which happened to the man he seemed to love most too happy if one had only said that of him he was supposed to be jealous of the merit of schwerin and of keith and delighted to have got them killed it is thus that mediocre people seek to lower great men to diminish the immense space that lies between themselves and such  out of politeness the king and his suite as well had put on white austrian uniforms not to bring back on us that blue which we had so often seen in war he looked as though he belonged to our army and to the kaisers suite there was in this visit i believe on both sides a little personality some distrust and perhaps a beginning of bitternessas always happens says philippe de comines when sovereigns meet the king took spanish snuff and brushing it off with his hand from his coat as well as he could he said i am not clean enough for you messieurs i am not worthy to wear your colors the air with which he said this made me think he would yet soil them with powder if the opportunity arose  i forgot a little incident which gave me an opportunity of setting off faire valoir the two monarchs to each other incident about the kings high opinion of the kaisers drillsergeantry in this days manoeuvres and how i was the happy cause of the kaisers hearing it himself incident omissible as the whole sequel is except a sentence or two   on this neustadt occasion the king was sometimes too ceremonious which annoyed the kaiser for instancei know not whether meaning to show himself a disciplined elector of the reich but so it waswhenever the kaiser put his foot in stirrup the king was sure to take his majestys horse by the bridle stand respectfully waiting the kaisers right foot and fit it into its stirrup and so with everything else the kaiser had the more sincere appearance in testifying his great respect like that of a young prince to an aged king and of a young soldier to the greatest of captains  sometimes there were appearances of cordiality between the two sovereigns one saw that friedrich ii loved joseph ii but that the preponderance of the empire and the contact of bohemia and silesia a good deal barred the sentiments of king and kaiser you remember sire exsire of poland their letters readers shall see them in 1778or rather refuse to see them on the subject of bavaria their compliments the explanations they had with regard to their intentions all carried on with such politeness and that from politeness to politeness the king ended by invading bohemia  well here is legible record with something really of portraiture in it valuable so far as it goes record unique on this subjectand substantially true though inexact enough in details thus even in regard to that of anhalts head which is so impossible in this first dialogue friedrich did most probably say something of the kind in a second which there is of date 1780 of which latter de ligne is here giving account as wellthough we have to postpone it till its time come  at this neustadt interview there did something of political occur and readers ought to be shown exactly what kaunitz had come with the kaiser and this something was intended as the real business among the gayeties and galas at neustadt poland or its farcetragedy now playing was not once mentioned that i hear of though perhaps as flebile ludibrium it might turn up for moments in dinnerconversation or the like but the astonishing russianturk war which has sprung out of poland and has already filled stamboul and its divans and muftis with mere horror and amazement and in fact has brought the grand turk to the giddy rim of the abyss nothing but ruin and destruction visible to him this beyond all other things whatever is occupying these high heads at presentand indeed the two latest bits of russianturk news have been of such a blazing character as to occupy all the world more or less readers

one battle this summer and brings him ismail akkerman all wallachey and no turks left in those parts but first let us attend to seamatters and the liberation of greece which precede in time and importance  liberation of greece an actual fleet steering from cronstadt to the dardanelles to liberate greece the sound of it kindles all the warm heads in europe especially voltaires which though covered with the snow of age is still warm internally on such points as to liberating greece voltaires hopes were utterly balked but the fleet from cronstadt did amazing service otherwise in those

officers whom we shall hear of when alexei and they come up meanwhile on the peloponnesian coast are modern spartans to the number of 15000 all sitting ready expecting the russian advent these rose duly got russian muskets cartridgesonly two russian officersand attacked the turks with considerable fury or voracity but with no success of the least solidity were foiled here driven out there in

february19th april seven weeks and a day the russians retired to their fleet with little loss and rode at their ease again in navarino bay but the 15000 modern spartans had nothing to retire tothese

admiral among them or like us only a sham one  tchesme bay 7th july 1770 nothing can be more imaginary than alexei orlof as an admiral but he has a captain elphinstone a captain gregg a lieutenant

or irregular balmerino scion but could never much hear of him except in rulhiere where on vague somewhat theatrical terms he figures as above  august 1st romanzow has a battle of kaghul so they call it though it is a slaughtery or schlachterei rather than a slaught or schlacht say my german friends kaghul is not a specific place but a longish river a branch of the pruth under screen of which the grand turk army 100000 strong with 100000 tartars as second line has finally taken position and fortified itself with earthworks and abundant cannon august 1st 1770 romanzow after study and advising feels prepared for this grand army and its earthworks with a select 20000 under select captains romanzow after nightfall bursts in upon it simultaneously on three different points and gains gratis or nearly so such a victory as was never heard of before the turks on their earthworks had 140 cannons these the turk gunners fired off two times and fled leaving them for romanzows uses the turk cavalry then tried if they could not make some attempt at charging found they could not whirled back upon their infantry set it also whirling and in a word the whole 200000 whirled without blow struck and it was a universal panic rout and delirious stampede of flight which never paused the very garrisons emptying themselves and joining in it till it got across the donau again and drew breath there not to rally or stand but to run rather slower and had left wallachia bessarabia dniester river donau river swept clear of turks all romanzows henceforth to such astonishment of an invincible grand turk and of his moslem populations fallen on such a set of giaours allah kerim and cannot we abolish them then not we them it would appearas every reader can imagine which shall suffice every reader here in regard to the turk war and what concern he has in the extremely brutish phenomenon  tchesme fell out july 7th elphinstone has hardly done his tea in the dardanelles when august 1st this of kaghul follows both would be fresh news blazing in every head while the dialogues between friedrich and kaunitz were going on for they had many dialogues friedrich says and one of the days probably september 6th was mainly devoted to politics to deep private colloquy with kaunitz of which and of the great things that followed out of it i will now give from friedrichs own hand the one entirely credible account i have anywhere met with in writing  friedrichs account of kaunitz himself is altogether lifelike a solemn arrogant mouthing browbeating kind of manembarrassed at present by the necessity not to browbeat and by the consciousness that king friedrich is the only man who refuses to acknowledge my claims to distinction rulhiere somewhere has heard this as an utterance of kaunitzs in some plaintive momenta kaunitz whose arrogances qualities and claims this king is not here to notice except as they concern business on hand he says kaunitz had a clear intellect greatly twisted by perversities of temper un sens droit lesprit rempli de travers especially by a selfconceit and arrogance which were boundless he did not talk but preach at the smallest interruption he would stop short in indignant surprise it has happened that at the councilboard in schonbrunn when imperial majesty herself asked some explanation of a word or thing not understood by her kaunitz made his bow lui tira sa reverence and quitted the room good to know the nature of the beast listen to him then on those terms since it is necessary the kaunitz sermon was of great length imbedded in circumlocutions innuendoes and diplomatic cautions but the gist of it we gather to have been abridged into dialogue form essentially as follows  kaunitz dangerous to the repose of europe those russian encroachments on the turk never will imperial majesty consent that russia possess moldavia or wallachia war soonerall things sooner these views of russia are infinitely dangerous to everybody to your majesty as well if i may say so and no remedy conceivable against themto me none conceivablebut this only that prussia and austria join frankly in protest and absolute prohibition of them  friedrich i have nothing more at heart than to stand well with austria and always to be her ally never her enemy but your highness sees how i am situated bound by express treaty with czarish majesty must go with russia in any war what can i do i can and will with all industry labor to conciliate czarish majesty and imperial to produce at petersburg such a peace with the turks as may meet the wishes of vienna let us hope it can be done by faithful endeavoring on my part and on yours i persuade myself it can meanwhile steadfastly together we two all our little rubs customhouse squabbles on the frontier and such like why not settle them here and now and does so with his highness that there be nothing but amity helpfulness and mutual effort towards an object so momentous to us both and to all mankind  kaunitz good so far and may a not intolerable turkrussian peace prove possible without our fighting for it meanwhile imperial majesty as she has been visibly doing for some time must continue massing troops and requisites on the hungarian frontier lest the contrary happen  this was the result arrived at of which friedrich judged it but polite to inform the young kaiser who appeared to be grateful for this mark of attention being much held down by kaunitz in his present state of tutelage oeuvres de frederic xxvi 30  and by a singular chance on the very morrow there arrived from the divan dated august 12th an express to friedrich mediate a peace for us with russia not you alone as we have often asked but austria and you for the kaghul slaughtery has come on us giaour elphinstone has taken tea in the dardanelles and we know not to what hand to turnthe young kaiser did not hide his joy at this overture as kaunitz did his which was perhaps still greater the kaiser warmly expressed his thanks to friedrich as the author of it kaunitz with a lofty indifference morgue and nose in air as over a small matter merely signified his approval of this step which the turks had taken  never was mediation undertaken with greater pleasure adds the king and both did proceed upon it with all zeal but only the king as real mediator or middleman kaunitz from the first planting himself immovably upon the turk side of things which is likewise the austrian and playing in secret as friedrich probably expected he would the strangest tricks with his assumed function  so that friedrich had to take the burden of mediating altogether on himself and month after month year after year it is evident he prosecutes the same with all the industry and faculty that are in himin intense desire and in hope often nearly desperate to keep his two neighbors houses and his own and the whole world along with them from taking fire apart from their conflicting interests the two empresses have privately a rooted aversion to one another what with russian exorbitancy a czarina naturally uplifted with her tchesmes and kaghuls what with austrian cupidity pride mulishness and private trickery of kaunitz the adroit and heartily zealous friedrich never had such a bit of diplomacy to do for many months hence in spite of his intensest efforts and cunningest appliances no way of egress visible the imbroglio must catch fire at last a way opens ha at last a waythen for above a twelvemonth longer such a guiding of the purblind quadrupeds and obstinate austrian mules into said way and for years more such an urging of them in pigdriver fashion along the same till peace did come  and here without knowing it we have insensibly got to the topmost summit of our polish business one small step more and we shall be on the brow of the precipitous inclinedplane down which poland and its business go careering thenceforth down downand will need but few words more from us actual discovery of a way out stands for next section  first however we will notice as prefatory a curious occurrence in the country of zips contiguous to the hungarian frontier zips a pretty enough district of no great extent had from time immemorial belonged to hungary till above 300 years ago it wasby sigismund super grammaticam a man always in want of money whom we last saw in flaming color investing friedrichs ancestor with brandenburg instead of payment for a debt of moneypledged to the crown of poland for a round sum to help in sigismunds pressing occasions redemption by payment never followed attempt at redemption there had never been by sigismund or any of his successors nay one successor in a treaty still extant preuss iv 32 date 1589 pawning had beep 1412 expressly gave up the right of redeeming pledge forfeited a zips belonging to polish crown and republic by every law  well imperial majesty as we have transiently seen is assembling troops on the hungarian frontier for a special purpose poor poland is by this time 1770 as we also saw sunk in pestilencepigs and dogs devouring the dead bodies not a loaf to be had for a hundred ducats and the rage of pestilence itself a mild thing to that of hunger not to mention other rages so that both austria and prussia in order to keep out pestilence at least if they cannot the other rages have had to draw cordons or lines of troops along the frontiers the prussian cordon i am informed goes from crossen by frankfurt northward to the weichsel river and border of warsaw country and is under the command of general belling our famous antiswede hussar of former years the austrian cordon looks over upon zips and other starosties on the hungarian border where independently of pestilence an alarmed and indignant empressqueen has been and is assembling masses of troops with what object we know looking over into zips in these circumstances indignant kaunitz and imperial majesty especially his imperial majesty a youth always passionate for territory say to themselves zips was ours and in a sense isand precise date refused us but after neustadt and before winter has quite come push troops across into zips starosty seize the whole thirteen townships of zips and not only these but by degrees tract after tract of the adjacencies must have a frontier to our mind in those parts indefensible otherwise and quietly set up boundarypillars with the austrian doubleeagle stamped on them and intimation to zips and neighborhood that it is now become austrian and shall have no part farther in these polish confederatings pestilences rages of men and pigs devouring dead bodies but shall live quiet under the doubleeagle as others do which to zips for the moment might be a blessed change welcome or otherwise but which awoke considerable amazement in the outer worldvery considerable in king stanislaus to whom on applying kaunitz would give no explanation the least articulateand awoke in the russian court especially a rather intense surprise and provocation     prince henri has been to sweden is seen at petersburg in masquerade on or about newyears day 1771 and does get home with results that are important  prince henri as we noticed was not of this second kingandkaiser interview henri had gone in the opposite directionto sweden on a visit to his sister ulriqueoff for west and north just in the same days while the king was leaving potsdam for silesia and his other errand in the southeast parts henri got to drottingholm his sisters country palace near stockholm by the end of august and was there with queen ulrique and husband during these neustadt manoeuvres a changed queen ulrique since he last saw her beautiful as love whirling off in the dead of night for those remote countries and destinies supra viii 309 she is now fifty or on the edge of it her old man sixtyold man dies within few months they have had many chagrins especially she as the prouder has had from their contumacious peoplecontumacious senators at least strong always both in pocketmoney french or russian and in tendency to insolence and follywho once i remember demanded sight and count of the crownjewels from queen ulrique there voila there are they said the proud queen view them count themlock them up never more will i wear one of them but she has pretty sons grown to manhood one pretty daughter a patient good old husband and time in sweden too brings its roses and life is life in spite of contumacious bribed senators and doggeries that do rather abound henri stayed with her six or seven weeks leaves sweden middle of october 1770not by the straight course homewards no verily and well knew why shrieks the indignant polish world on us ever since  it is not true that friedrich had schemed to send henri round by petersburg on the contrary it was the czarina on ground of old acquaintanceship who invited him and asked his brothers leave to do it and if poland got its fate from the circumstance it was by accident and by the fact that polands fate was dropripe ready to fall by a touchbefore going farther here is ocular view of the shrillminded serious and ingenious henri little conscious of being so fateful a manprince henri in white domino prince henri of prussia says richardson the useful eyewitness cited already is one of the most celebrated generals of the present age so great are his military talents that his brother who is not apt to pay compliments says of himthat in commanding an army he was never known to commit a fault this however is but a negative kind of praise he the king reserves to himself the glory of superior genius which though capable of brilliant achievements is yet liable to unwary mistakes and allows him no other than the praise of correctness  to judge of prince henri by his appearance i should form no high estimate of his abilities but the scythian ambassadors judged in the same manner of alexander the great he is under the middle size very thin he walks firmly enough or rather struts as if he wanted to walk firmly and has little dignity in his air or gesture he is darkcomplexioned and he wears his hair which is remarkably thick clubbed and dressed with a high toupee his forehead is high his eyes large and blue with a little squint and when he smiles his upper lip is drawn up a little in the middle his look expresses sagacity and observation but nothing very amiable and his manner is grave and stiff rather than affable he was dressed when i first saw him in a lightblue frock with silver frogs and wore a red waistcoat and blue breeches he is not very popular among the russians and accordingly their wits are disposed to amuse themselves with his appearance and particularly with his toupee they say he resembles samson that all his strength lies in his hair and that conscious of this and recollecting the fate of the son of manoah he suffers not the nigh approaches of any deceitful delilah they say he is like the comet which about fifteen months ago appeared so formidable in the russian hemisphere and which exhibiting a small watery body but a most enormous train dismayed the northern and eastern potentates with fear of change  i saw him a few nights ago on or about newyears day 1771 come back to us from his tour to moscow three weeks before and nothing but galas ever since at a masquerade in the palace said to be the most magnificent thing of the kind ever seen at the russian court fourteen large rooms and galleries were opened for the accommodation of the masks and i was informed that there were present several thousand people a great part of the company wore dominos or capuchin dresses though besides these some fanciful appearances afforded a good deal of amusement a very tall cossack appeared completely arrayed in the hauberks twisted mail he was indeed very grim and martial persons in emblematical dresses representing apollo and the seasons addressed the empress in speeches suited to their characters the empress herself at the time i saw her majesty wore a grecian habit though i was afterwards told that she varied her dress two or three times during the masquerade prince henri of prussia wore a white domino several persons appeared in the dresses of different nationschinese turks persians and armenians the most humorous and fantastical figure was a frenchman who with wonderful nimbleness and dexterity represented an overgrown but very beautiful parrot he chattered with a great deal of spirit and his shoulders covered with green feathers performed admirably the part of wings he drew the attention of the empress a ring was formed he was quite happy fluttered his plumage made fine speeches in russ french and tolerable english the ladies were exceedingly diverted everybody laughed except prince henri who stood beside the empress and was so grave and so solemn that he would have performed his part most admirably in the shape of an owl the parrot observed him was determined to have revenge and having said as many good things as he could to her majesty he was hopping away but just as he was going out of the circle seeming to recollect himself he stopped looked over his shoulder at the formal prince and quite in the parrot tone and french accent he addressed him most emphatically with henri henri henri and then diving into the crowd disappeared his royal highness was disconcerted he was forced to smile in his own defence and the company were not a little amused  at midnight a spacious hall of a circular form capable of containing a vast number of people and illuminated in the most magnificent manner was suddenly opened twelve tables were placed in alcoves around the sides of the room where the empress prince henri and a hundred and fifty of the chief nobility and foreign ministers sat down to supper the rest of the company went up by stairs on the outside of the room into the lofty galleries placed all around on the inside such a row of masked visages many of them with grotesque features and bushy beards nodding from the side of the wall appeared very ludicrous to those below the entertainment was enlivened with a concert of music and at different intervals persons in various habits entered the hall and exhibited cossack chinese polish swedish and tartar dances the whole was so gorgeous and at the same time so fantastic that i could not help thinking myself present at some of the magnificent festivals described in the oldfashioned romantes       the marshald feast      served up in hall with sewers and seneschals  the rest of the company on returning to the rooms adjoining found prepared for them also a sumptuous banquet the masquerade began at 6 in the evening and continued till 5 next morning  besides the masquerade and other festivities in honor of and to divert prince henri we had lately a most magnificent show of fireworks they were exhibited in a wide apace before the winter palace and in truth beggared description they displayed by a variety of emblematical figures the reduction of moldavia wallachia bessarabia and the various conquests and victories achieved since the commencement of the present war the various colors the bright green and the snowy white exhibited in these fireworks were truly astonishing for the space of twenty minutes a tree adorned with the loveliest and most verdant foliage seemed to be waving as with a gentle breeze it was entirely of fire and during the whole of this stupendous scene an arch of fire by the continued throwing of rockets and fireballs in one direction formed as it were a suitable canopy  on this occasion a prodigious multitude of people were assembled and the empress it was surmised seemed uneasy she was afraid it was apprehended lest any accident like what happened at paris at the marriage of the dauphin should befall her beloved people i hope i have amused you and ever amw richardson anecdotes of the russian empire pp 325331 petersburg 4th january 1771  the masquerades and galas in honor of prince henri from a grandiose hostess who had played with him in childhood were many but it is not with these that we have to do one day the czarina talking to him of the austrian procedures at zips said with pique it seems in poland you have only to stoop and pick up what you like of it if the court of vienna have the notion to dismember that kingdom its neighbors will have right to do as much rulhiere iv 210 trois demembremens i 142 above all henri himself in oeuvres de frederic xxvi 345 petersburg 8th january 1771 this is supposed in all books to be the punctum saliens or first mention of the astonishing partition which was settled agreed upon within about a year hence and has made so much noise ever since and in effect it was so the idea rising practically in that high head was the real beginning but this was not the first head it had been in far from that above a year ago as friedrich himself informed us it had been in friedrichs own headthough at the time it went for absolutely nothing nobody even bestowing a sneer on it as friedrich intimates and disappeared through the horngate of dreams  friedrich himself appears to have quite forgotten the countlynar idea and on henris report from russia was totally incredulous and even suspected that there might be trickery and danger in this russian proposal not till henris return february 18th 1771 could he entirely believe that the czarina was seriousand then sure enough he did with his whole heart go into it the eureka out of all these difficulties which had so long seemed insuperable prince henri had an interview with the austrian minister next day february 19th who immediately communicated with his kaunitzand got discouraging response from kaunitz discouraging or almost negatory which did not discourage friedrich a way out thinks friedrich the one way to save my prussia and the world from incalculable conflagration and entered on it without loss of a moment and labored at it with such continual industry rapidity and faculty for guiding and pushing as all readers have known in him on dangerous emergencies at no moment lifting his hand from it till it was complete  his difficulties were enormous what a team to drive and on such a road untrodden before by hoof or wheel two empresses that cordially hate one another and that disagree on this very subject kaunitz and his empress are extremely skittish in the matter and as if quite refuse it at first zips will be better thinks kaunitz to himself cannot we have all to ourselves a beautiful little cutting out of poland in that part and then perhaps in league with the turk who has money beat the russians home altogether and rule poland in their stead or share it with the sultan as reiseffendi suggests and the dismal truth is though it was not known for years afterward kaunitz does about this time in profoundest secret actually make treaty of alliance with the turk so many million piastres to us ready money year by year and you shall if not by our mediating then by our fighting be a contented turk and all along at the different russianturk peacecongresses kaunitz while pretending to sit and mediate along with prussia sat on that far other basis privately thwarting everything and span out the turk pacification in a wretched manner for years coming peace of kainardschi not till 21st july 1774after four or five abortive attempts two of them congresses kaunitz so industrious hermann v 664 et antea a dangerous hardmouthed highstalking illgiven old

shall know it is your one road my illgiven friend i ostentatiously increase my cavalry by 8000 meaning a new sevenyears war if you force me and russia by my side this time so that kaunitz had to quit his turk courses never paid the piastres back and go into what really was the one way out  but friedrichs difficulties on this course are not the thing that can interest readers and all readers know his faculty for overcoming difficulties readers ask rather and had friedrich no feeling about poland itself then and this atrocious partitioning of the poor country apparently none whateverunless it might be that deliverance from anarchy pestilence famine and pigs eating your dead bodies would be a manifest advantage for poland while it was the one way of saving europe from war nobody seems more contented in conscience or radiant with heartfelt satisfaction and certainty of thanks from all wise and impartial men than the king of prussia now and afterwards in regard to this polish atrocity a psychological fact which readers can notice scrupulous regard to polish considerations magnanimity to poland or the least respect or pity for her as a dying anarchy is what nobody will claim for him consummate talent in executing the partition of poland inevitable some day as he may have thought but is nowhere at the pains to saygreat talent great patience too and meritorious selfdenial and endurance in executing that partition and in saving it from catching fire instead of being the means to quench fire no wellinformed person will deny him of his difficulties in the operation which truly are unspeakable i will say nothing more readers are prepared to believe that he beyond others should conquer difficulties when the object is vital to him i will mark only the successive dates of his progress and have done with this wearisome subject  june 14th 1771 within four months of the arrival of prince henri and that first certainty from russia diligent friedrich upon whom the whole burden had been laid of drawing up a plan and bringing austria to consent is able to report to petersburg that austria has dubieties reluctances which it is to be foreseen she will gradually get over and that here meanwhile june 14th 1771 is my plan of partitionthe simplest conceivable that each choose subject to future adjustments what will best suit him i for my own part will say westpreussenwhat province will czarish majesty please to say czarish majesty in answer is exorbitantly liberal to herself claims not a province but four or five will have friedrich if the austrians attack her in consequence to assist by declaring war on austria czarish majesty in the reciprocal case not to assist friedrich at all till her turk war is done impossible thinks friedrich surprisingly so high madam but to the delicate bridlehand you are a manageable entity  it was with kaunitz that friedrichs real difficulties lay privately in the course of this summer kaunitz by way of preparation for mediating a turkrussian peace had concluded his subsidy treaty with the turk 6th july 1771 preuss iv 31 hermann c ctreaty never ratified but the piastres duly paidtreaty rendering peace impossible so long as kaunitz had to do with mediating it and indeed kaunitzs tricks in that function of mediator and also after it were of the kind which friedrich has some reason to call infamous your majesty as comediator will join us should the russians make war said kaunitzs ambassador one day to friedrich for certain no answered friedrich and on the contrary remounted his cavalry to signify i will fight the other way if needed which did at once bring kaunitz to give up his mysterious turk projects and come into the polish after which his exorbitant greed of territory there his attempts to get russia into a partitioning of turkey as wella slice of turkey too your czarish majesty and we hints he more than oncegave friedrich no end of trouble and are singular to look at by the light there now is not for about a twelvemonth did friedrich get his hardmouthed kaunitz brought into step at all and to the last perpetual vigilance and by whip and bit the adroitest charioteering was needed on him  february 17th 1772 russia and prussia for their own partfriedrich in the circumstances submitting to many things from his czarinaget their particular convention bargain in regard to poland completed in all parts will take possession 4th june instant sign said convention february 17thand invite austria to join and state her claims which in three weeks after march 4th austria doesexorbitant abundantly and not to be got very much reduced though we try for a series of months till at last  august 5th 1772 final agreement between the three partitioning powers these are our respective shares we take possession on the 1st of september instantand actual possession for friedrichs share did on the 13th of that month ensue a right glad friedrich as everybody friend or enemy may imagine him glad to have done with such a businesshad there been no other profit in it which was far from being the case ones clear belief on studying these books is of two things first that as everybody admits friedrich had no real hand in starting the notion of partitioning polandbut that he grasped at it with eagerness as the one way of saving europe from war second what has been much less noticed that under any other hand it would have led europe to warand that to friedrich is due the fact that it got effected without such accompaniment friedrichs share of territory is counted to be in all 9465 english square miles austrias 62500 russias 87500 preuss iv 45 between nine and ten times the amount of friedrichswhich latter however as an anciently teutonic country and as filling up the always dangerous gap between his ostpreussen and him has under prussian administration proved much the most valuable of the three and next to silesia is friedrichs most important acquisition september 13th 1772 it was at last entered uponthrough such wasteweltering confusions and on terms never yet unquestionable  consent of polish diet was not had for a year more but that is worth little record diet for that object got together 19th april 1773 recalcitrant enough had not russia understood the methods a common fund was raised on se cotisa says friedrich for bribing the three powers had each a representative general in warsaw lentulus the prussian personage all three with forces to rear diet came down by degrees and in the course of five months september 18th 1773 acquiesced in everything  and so the matter is ended and various men will long have various opinions upon it i add only this one small document from maria theresas hand which all hearts and i suppose even friedrichs had he ever read it will pronounce to be very beautiful homely faithful wholesome wellbecoming in a high and true sovereign woman     the empressqueen to prince kaunitz undated date must be vienna february 1772  when all my lands were invaded and i knew not where in the world i should find a place to be brought to bed in i relied on my good right and the help of god but in this thing where not only public law cries to heaven against us but also all natural justice and sound reason i must confess never in my life to have been in such trouble and am ashamed to show my face let the prince kaunitz consider what an example we are giving to all the world if for a miserable piece of poland or of moldavia or wallachia we throw our honor and reputation to the winds i see well that i am alone and no more in vigor therefore i must though to my very great sorrow let things take their course als alle meine lander angefochten wurden und gar nit mehr wusste wo ruhig niederkommen sollte steiffete ich

long after i am dead it will be known what this violating of all that was hitherto held sacred and just will give rise to from zietgenossen a biographical periodical lxxi 29 cited in preuss iv 39 hear her majesty  friedrich has none of these compunctious visitings but his account too when he does happen to speak on the subject is worth hearing and credible every word writing to voltaire a good while after potsdam 9th october 1773 this in the swiftflowing miscellaneous letter is one passage to return to your king of poland i am aware that europe pretty generally believes the late partition made quon a fait of poland to be a result of the political trickeries manigances which are attributed to me nevertheless nothing is more untrue after in vain proposing different arrangements and expedients there was no alternative left but either that same partition or else europe kindled into a general war appearances are deceitful and the public judges only by these what i tell you is as true as the fortyseventh of euclid oeuvres de frederic xxiii 257     what friedrich did with his new acquisition  considerable obloquy still rests on friedrich in many liberal circles for the partition of poland two things however seem by this time tolerably clear though not yet known in liberal circles first that the partition of poland was an event inevitable in polish history an operation of almighty providence and of the eternal laws of nature as well as of the poor earthly sovereigns concerned there and secondly that friedrich had nothing special to do with it and in the way of originating or causing it nothing whatever  it is certain the demands of eternal justice must be fulfilled in earthly instruments concerned with fulfilling them there may be all degrees of demerit and also of meritfrom that of a worldruffian attila the scourge of god conscious of his own ferocities and cupidities alone to that of a heroic cromwell sacredly aware that he is at his souls peril doing gods judgments on the enemies of god in tredah and other severe scenes if the laws and judgments are verily those of god there can be no clearer merit than that of pushing them forward regardless of the barkings of gazetteers and wayside dogs and getting them at the earliest term possible made valid among recalcitrant mortals friedrich in regard to poland i cannot find to have had anything considerable either of merit or of demerit in the moral point of view but simply to have accepted and put in his pocket without criticism what providence sent he himself evidently views it in that light and is at no pains to conceal his great sense of the value of westpreussen to him we praised his narrative as eminently true and the only one completely intelligible in every point in his preface to it written some years later he is still more candid speaking there in the first person this once and never before or afterhe says  these new pretensions of the czarina to assuage the religious putridfever of the poles by word of command raised all poland into confederation of bar and war of the confederates sung by friedrich the grandees of the kingdom implored the assistance of the turks straightway war flamed out in which the russian armies had only to show themselves to beat the turks in every rencounter his majesty continues this war changed the whole political system of

in indemnifying our monarchy for its past losses by incorporating polish prussia with my old provinces oeuvres de frederic preface to memoirs depuis 1763 jusqua 1774 vi 6 7 memoires chapter first including all the polish part were finished in 1775 preface is of 1779  here is a historian king who uses no rougepot in his narrativeswhose word which is all we shall say of it at present you find to be perfectly trustworthy and a representation of the fact as it stood before himself what follows needs no vouching for this acquisition was one of the most important we could make because it joined pommern to east prussia ours for ages past and because rendering us masters of the weichsel river we gained the double advantage of being able to defend that kingdom ostpreussen and to draw considerable tolls from the weichsel as all the trade of poland goes by that river  yes truly our interests are very visible and the interests and wishes and claims of polandare they nowhere worthy of one word from you o king nowhere that i have noticed not any mention of them or allusion to them though the world is still so convinced that perhaps they were something and not nothing which is very curious in the whole course of my reading i have met with no autobiographer more careless to defend himself upon points in dispute among his audience and marked as criminal against him by many of them shadow of apology on such points you search for in vain in rapid bare summary he sets down the sequel of facts as if assured beforehand of your favorable judgment or with the profoundest indifference to how you shall judge them drops his actions as an ostrich does its young to shift for themselves in the wilderness and hurries on his way this style of his noticeable of old in regard to silesia too has considerably hurt him with the common kind of readers who in their preconceived suspicions of the man are all the more disgusted at tracing in him not the least anxiety to stand well with any reader more than to stand ill as ill as any reader likes  third parties it would seem have small temptation to become his advocates he himself being so totally unprovided with thanks for you but on another score and for the sake of a better kind of readers there is one third party bound to remark 1 that hardly any sovereign known to us did in his general practice if you will examine it more perfectly respect the boundaries of his neighbors and go on the road that was his own anxious to tread on no mans toes if he could avoid it a sovereign who at all times strictly and beneficently confined himself to what belonged to his real business and him 2 that apparently therefore he must have considered poland to be an exceptional case unique in his experience case of a moribund anarchy fallen down as carrion on the common highways of the world belonging to nobody in particular liable to be cut into nay for sanitary reasons requiring it if one were a rhadamanthus errant which one is notliable to be cut into on a great and critically stringent occasion no question to be asked of it your only question the consent of bystanders and the moderate certainty that nobody got a glaringly disproportionate share that must have been on the part of an equitable friedrich or even of a friedrich accurate in bookkeeping by double entry the notion silently formed about poland  whether his notion was scientifically right and conformable to actual fact is a question i have no thought of entering on still less whether friedrich was morally right or whether there was not a higher rectitude granting even the fact in putting it in practice these are questions on which an editor may have his opinion partly complete for a long time past partly not complete or in human language completable or pronounceable at all and may carefully forbear to obtrude it on his readers and only advise them to look with their own best eyesight to be deaf to the multiplex noises which are evidently blind and to think what they find thinkablest on such a subject for were it never so just proper and needful this is by nature a case of lynch law upon which in the way of approval or apology no spoken word is permissible lynch being so dangerous a lawgiver even when an indispensable one  for granting that the nation of poland was for centuries past an anarchy doomed by the eternal laws of heaven to die and then of course to get gradually buried or eaten by neighbors were it only for sanitary reasonsit will by no means suit to declare openly on behalf of terrestrial neighbors who have taken up such an idea granting it were even a just one and a true reading of the silent but inexorably certain purposes of heaven that they those volunteer terrestrial neighbors are justified in breaking in upon the poor dying or dead carcass and flaying and burying it with amicable sharing of skin and shoes if it even were certain that the wretched polish nation for the last forty years hastening with especial speed towards death did in present circumstances with such a howling canaille of turk janissaries and vultures of creation busy round it actually require prompt surgery in the usual method by neighborsthe neighbors shall and must do that function at their own risk if heaven did appoint them to it heaven for certain will at last justify them and in the mean while for a generation or two the same heaven i can believe has appointed that earth shall pretty unanimously condemn them the shrieks the foamlipped curses of mistaken mankind in such case are mankinds one security against overpromptitude which is so dreadfully possible on the part of surgical neighbors  alas yes my articulatespeaking friends here as so often elsewhere the solution of the riddle is not logic but silence when a dark human individual has filled the measure of his wicked blockheadisms sins and brutal nuisancings there are gibbets provided there are laws provided and you can in an articulate regular manner hang him and finish him to general satisfaction nations too you may depend on it as certain do require the same process and do infallibly get it withal heavens justice with written laws or without being the most indispensable and the inevitablest thing i know of in this universe no doing without it and it is sure to comeand the judges and executioners we observe are not in that latter case escorted in and out by the sheriffs of counties and general ringing of bells not so in that latter case but far otherwise  and now leaving that vexed question we will throw one glanceonly one is permittedinto the far more profitable question which probably will one day be the sole one on this matter what became of poor westpreussen under friedrich had it to sit weeping unconsolably or not herr dr freytag a man of good repute in literature has in one of his late books of popular history g freytag neue bilder aus dem leben des deutschen volkes leipzig 1862 gone into this subject in a serious way and certainly with opportunities far beyond mine for informing himself upon itfrom him these passages have been excerpted labelled and translated by a good hand  acquisition of polish prussia during several centuries the muchdivided germans had habitually been pressed upon and straitened and injured by greedy conquering neighbors friedrich was the first conqueror who once more pushed forward the german frontier towards the east reminding the germans again that it was their task to carry law culture liberty and industry into the east of europe all friedrichs lands with the exception only of some oldsaxon territory had by force and colonization been painfully gained from the sclave at no time since the migrations of the middle ages had this struggle for possession of the wide plains to the east of oder ceased when arms were at rest politicians carried on the struggle  persecution of german protestants in poland in the very century of enlightenment the persecution of

regard to germans a protestant starost of gnesen a herr von unruh of the house of birnbaum one of the largest proprietors of the country was condemned to die and first to have his tongue pulled out

vagabonds around went roaming and ravaging through the country falling upon small towns and german villages the polish nobleman roskowski a celebrated symbolical nobleman this put on one red boot and one black symbolizing fire and death and in this guise rode about murdering and burning from places to place finally at jastrow he cut off the hands feet and lastly the head of the protestant pastor willich by name and threw the limbs into a swamp this happened in 1768  in what state friedrich found the polish provinces some few only of the larger german towns which were secured by walls and some protected districts inhabited exclusively by germansas the niederung near dantzig the villages under the mild rule of the cistercians of oliva and the opulent german towns of the catholic ermelandwere in tolerable circumstances the other towns lay in ruins so also most of the hamlets hofe of the open country bromberg the city of german colonists the prussians found in heaps and ruins to this hour

slaughter that had been going on in the whole district of the netze there during the last ten years before the arrival of the prussians the town of culm had preserved its strong old walls and stately churches but in the streets the necks of the cellars stood out above the rotten timber and brick heaps of the tumbled houses whole streets consisted merely of such cellars in which wretched people were still trying to live of the forty houses in the large marketplace of culm twentyeight had no doors no roofs no windows and no owners other towns were in similar condition  the country people

on 9000 english square miles lived 500000 souls not 55 to the square mile  sets to work the very rottenness of the country became an attraction for friedrich and henceforth westpreussen was what hitherto silesia had been his favorite child which with infinite care like that of an anxious loving mother he washed brushed newdressed and forced to go to school and into orderly habits and kept ever in his eye the diplomatic squabbles about this acquisition were still going on when he had already sent so early as june 4th 1772 and still more on september 13th of that year see his new

fifteen miles connects by the netze river the weichsel with the oder and the elbe within one year after giving the order the king saw loaded vessels from the oder 120 feet in length of keel and of forty tons burden enter the weichsel the vast breadths of land gained from the state of swamp by drainage into this canal were immediately peopled by german colonists  as his sevenyears struggle of war may be called superhuman so was there also in his present labor of peace something enormous which appeared to his contemporaries unless my fancy mislead me almost preternatural at times inhuman it was grand but also terrible that the success of the whole was to him at all moments the one thing to be striven after the comfort of the individual of no concern at all when in the marshland of the

portrait of the fact and therewith con la bocca dolce we will rise from this supper of horrors that friedrich fortified the country that he built an impregnable graudentz and two other fortresses rendering the country and himself on that eastern side impregnable henceforth all readers can believe friedrich has been building various fortresses in this interim though we have taken no notice of them building and repairing many thingstrimming up his military quite to the old pitch as the most particular thing of all he has his new silesian fortress of silberbergbig fortress looking into certain dangerous bohemian doors in tobias stusches country if readers recollect an old adventure now mythicalhis new silesian silberberg his newer polish graudentz and many others and flatters himself he is not now pregnable on any side  a friedrich working all along in poland especially amid what circumambient deluges of maledictory outcries and mendacious shriekeries from an illinformed public is not now worth mentioning mere distracted rumors of the pamphleteer and newspaper kind which after hunting them a long time through dense and rare end mostly in zero and angry darkness of some poor human brainor even testify in favor of this headworker and of the sense he shows especially of the patience for example that of the polish towns and villages ordered by this tyrant to deliver each of them so many marriageable girls each girl to bring with her as dowry furnished by her parents 1 featherbed 4 pillows 1 cow 3 swine and 3 ducatsin which desirable condition this

still less afterwards though it brought chicanings more than enough and she was not illpleased to keep this thorn in the kings foot for her own conveniences thinks the king though mainly he perceives that it is the english acting on her grandiose mind english who were apprehensive for their baltic trade under this new proprietor and who egged on an ambitious czarina to protect human liberty and an inflated dantzig burgermeister to stand up for ditto and made a dismal shriekery in the newspapers and got into dreadful illhumor with said proprietor of dantzig harbor and have never quite recovered from it to this day lindseys polish letters are very loud again on this occasion aided by his seven dialogues on poland concerning which partly for extinct lindseys sake let us cite one small passage and so wind up  march 2d 1775 in answer to voltaire friedrich writes the polish dialogues you speak of are not known to me i think of such satires with epictetus if they tell any truth of thee correct thyself if they are lies laugh at them i have learned with years to become a steady coachhorse i do my stage like a diligent roadster and pay no heed to the little dogs that will bark by the way and then three weeks after  i have at length got the seven dialogues on poland and the whole history of them as well the author is an englishman named lindsey parson by profession and tutor to the young prince poniatowski the king of polands nephewnephew joseph andreass son not the undistinguished nephew so we will believe for poor loud lindseys sake it was at the instigation of the czartoryskis uncles of the king that lindsey composed this satirein english first of all satire ready they perceived that nobody in poland would understand it unless it were translated into french which accordingly was done but as their translator was unskilful they sent the dialogues to a certain gerard at dantzig who at that time was french consul there and who is at present a clerk in your foreign office under m de vergennes this gerard who does not want for wit but who does me the honor to hate me cordially retouched these dialogues and put them into the condition they were published in i have laughed a good deal at them here and there occur coarse things grossieretes and platitudes of the insipid kind but there are traits of good pleasantry i shall not go fencing with goosequills against this sycophant as mazarin said let the french keep singing provided they let us keep doing oeuvres de frederic xxiii 319321 potsdam 2d march 1775 and 25th march following see preuss iii 275 iv 85

the two sovereigns to friendly visiting a very different state of mutual feeling had succeeded which went on such the immeasurable ambition visible in some of us deepening and worsening itself instead of improving or abating friedrich had josephs portrait hung in conspicuous position in the rooms where he lived somebody noticing the fact friedrich answered ah yes i am obliged to keep that young gentleman in my eye and in effect the rest of friedrichs political activity from this time onwards may be defined as an evervigilant defence of himself and of the german reich against austrian encroachment which to him in the years then running was the grand impending peril and which to us in the new times has become so inexpressibly uninteresting and will bear no narrative austrian encroachment did not prove to be the deathperil that had overhung the world in friedrichs last years  these accordingly are years in which the historical interest goes on diminishing and only the biographical were anything of biography attainable is left friedrichs industrial economic and other royal activities are as beautiful as ever but cannot to our readers in our limits be described with advantage events of worldinterest after the partition of poland do not fall out or friedrich is not concerned in them it is a dim element its significance chiefly german or prussian not european what of humanly interesting is discoverable in itat least while the austrian grudge continues in a chronic state and has no acute fiti will here present in the shape of detached fragments suitably arranged and rendered legible in hopes these may still have some lucency for readers and render more conceivable the surrounding masses that have to be left dark our first piece is of winter or late autumn

the transitory candlelight of a king friedrich close by  at sanssouci says he in his famed book where that old god of war kriegsgott forges his thunderbolts and writes works of intellect for posterity where he governs his people as the best father would his house where during one half of the day he accepts and reads the petitions and complaints of the meanest citizen or peasant comes to help of his countries on all sides with astonishing sums of money expecting no payment nor seeking anything but the common weal and where during the other half he is a poet and philosopherat sanssouci i say there reigns all round a silence in which you can hear the faintest breath of every soft wind i mounted this hill for the first time in winter late autumn 25th october 1771 edge of winter in the dusk when i beheld the small dwellinghouse of this convulser of the world close by me and was near his very chamber i saw indeed a light inside but no sentry or watchman at the heros door no soul to ask me who i was or what i wanted i saw nothing and walked about as i pleased before this small and silent house preuss i 387 from einsamkeit zimmermanns solitude i 110 edition of leipzig 1784  yes doctor this is

zimmermann had a dialogue next day with his majesty which we propose to give still more as he made such noise in the world by other dialogues with friedrich and by a strange book about them which are still aheadreaders may desire to know a little who or what the zimmermann is and be willing for a rough brief note upon him which certainly is not readier than it is rough  johann georg zimmermann born 1728 at brugg in the canton of bern where his father seems to have had some little property and no employment a rathsherr towncouncillor who was much respected of brothers or sisters no mention the mother being from the french part of the canton he learned to speak both languages went to bern for his latin and highschooling then to gottingen where he studied medicine under the once great haller and other now dimmed celebrities haller himself from bern had taken zimmermann to board and became much attached to him haller in 1752 came on a summer visit to native bern zimmermann who had in the mean time been for a few months in france in italy and england now returned and joined him there but the great man feeling very poorly and very old decided that he would like to stay in bern and not move any morezimmermann accordingly was sent to gottingen to bring mrs haller with her daughters bandboxes and effects home to bern which he didand not only them but a soft ingenious ingenuous and rather pretty young gottingen lady along with them as his own wife withal with her he settled as stadtphysicus towndoctor in native brugg where his beloved hallers were within reach and practice in abundance and honors all that the place yielded were in readiness for him  here he continued some sixteen years very busy very successful in medicine and literature but tormented with hypochondriahaving indeed an immense conceit of himself and generally too thin a skin for this world here he first wrote his book on solitude a book famed over all the world in my young days and perhaps still famed he wrote it a second time much enlarged about thirty years after betrachtungen uber die einsamkeit von doctor j g zimmermann stadtphysicus in brugg zurich 1756as yet only 1 vol 8vo

lived much alone at brugg and elsewhere all his days hypochondria was the main company he hadand it was natural but unprofitable that he should say to himself and others the best he could for that bad arrangement poor soul he wrote also on medical experience a famed book in its day also on national pride and became famed through the universe and was member of infinite learned societies  all which rendered dull dead brugg still duller and more dead unfit utterly for a man of such sublime accomplishments plenty of counts stadion kings of poland even offered him engagements eager to possess such a man and deliver him from dull dead brugg but he had hypochondria and always feared their deliverance might be into something duller at lengthin his fortieth year 1768the place of courtphysician hofmedicus at hanover was offered him by george the third of pious memory and this he resolved to accept and did lift anchor and accept and occupy accordingly  alas at the gate of hanover his carriage overset broke his poor old motherinlaws leg who had been rejoicing doubtless to get home into her own country and was the end of herpoor old souland the beginning of misfortunes continual and too tedious to mention spleen envy malice and calumny from the hanover medical world treatment by the old buckram hofdames who had drunk coffee with george ii which was fitter for a laquaisdeplace than for a medical gentleman of eminence unworthy treatment in fact in many or most quartersfollowed by hypochondria by dreadful bodily disorder kind not given or discoverable so that i suffered the pains of hell sat weeping sat gnashing my teeth and could nt write a note after dinner followed finally by the sickness and then by the death of my poor wife after five months of torment upon which in 1771 zimmermanns friendsfor he had many friends being in fact a person of fine graceful intellect high proud feelings and tender sensibilities gone all to this sad staterallied themselves set his hanover house in order for him governess for his children what not and sent him off to berlin there to be dealt with by one meckel an incomparable surgeon and be healed of his dreadful disorder leibesschade of which the first traces had appeared in bruggthough to most people it seemed rather he would die and one medical eminency in hanover said to myself zimmermann one day dr soandso is to have your pension i am told now by all right it should belong to me dont you think so what i thought of the matter seeing the greedy gentleman thus parting my skin may be conjectured  the famed meckel received his famed patient with a nobleness worthy of the heroic ages dodged him in his own house in softest beds and appliances spoke comfort to him hope to himthe gallant meckelrallied in fact the due medical staff one morning came up to zimmermann who stripped with the heart of a lamb and lion conjoined and trusting in god flung himself on his bed on his face or on his back we never know and there by the hands of meckel and staff received above 2000 two thousand cuts in the space of an hour and half without uttering one word or sound a frightful operation gallantly endured and skilfully done whereby the bodily disorder leibesschade whatever it might be was effectually and forever sent about its business by the noble meckel  hospitalities and soft hushed kindnesses and soothing ministrations by meckel and by everybody were now doubled and trebled wise kind madam meckel young kind mamsell meckel and the son who now in 1788 lectures in gottingen not these only nor schmucker

sulzer prime minister herzberg queens and kings equerries and honorable men and womenbore him on angelwings towards complete recovery talked to him sang and danced to him at least the muses and the female meckels danced and sang and all lapped him against eating cares till after twelve weeks he was fairly on his feet again and able to make jaunts in the neighborhood with his lifes savior and enjoy the pleasant autumn weather to his farther profitall this though described in ridiculous superlative by zimmermann is really touching beautiful and human perhaps never in his life was he so happy or a thousandth part so helped by man as while under the roof of this thriceuseful meckelmore power to meckel  head armysurgeon schmucker had gone through all the sevenyears war zimmermann an ardent heroworshipper was never weary questioning him listening to him in full career of narrative on this great subjectonly eight years old at that time among their country drives meckel took him to potsdam twenty english miles off in the end of october there to stay a night this was the evermemorable friday when we first ascended the hill of sanssouci and had our evening walk of contemplationto

know well was a genevese and knew zimmermann from of old schmucker and de catt were privately twitching up friedrichs curiosityto whom also zimmermanns name and perhaps his late surgical operation might be known can he speak frenchnative to him your majesty friedrich had some notion to see zimmermann and judicious de catt on this fortunate saturday 26th october 1771 morrow after zimmermanns arrival at potsdam came to our inn about 1 pm kings dinner just done and asked me to come and look at the beauties of sanssouci big sanssouci for a little zimmermann willingly went catt left him in good hands to see the beauties slipt off for his own part to little sanssouci came back took zimmermann thither left him with schmucker all trembling thinking perhaps the king might call him i trembled sometimes then again i felt exceeding happiness i was in schmuckers room sitting by the fire mostly alone for a good while the room that had once been marquis dargenss who is now dead and buried far away good old soulwhen at last about halfpast 4 catt came jumping in breathless with joy snatched me up his majesty wants to speak with you this very moment zimmermanns self shall say the rest  i hurried handinhand with catt along a row of chambers here said catt we are now at the kings roommy heart thumped like to spring out of my body catt went in but next moment the door again opened and catt bade me enter  in the middle of the room stood an iron campbed without curtains there on a worn mattress lay king friedrich the terror of europe without coverlet in an old blue roquelaure he had a big cockedhat with a white feather hat aged worn soft as duffel equal to most caps feather is not perpendicular but horizontal round the inside of the brim on his head  the king took off his hat very graciously when i was perhaps ten steps from him and said in french our whole dialogue proceeded in french come nearer m zimmermann  i advanced to within two steps of the king he said in the mean while to catt call schmucker in too herr schmucker came placed himself behind the king his back to the wall and catt stood behind me now the colloquy began  king i hear you have found your health again in berlin i wish you joy of that  ego i have found my life again in berlin but at this moment sire i find here a still greater happiness ach  king you have stood a cruel operation you must have suffered horribly  ego sire it was well worth while  king did you let them bind you before the operation  ego no i resolved to keep my freedom  king laughing in a very kind manner oh you behaved like a brave switzer but are you quite recovered though  ego sire i have seen all the wonders of your creation in sanssouci and feel well in looking at them  king i am glad of that but you must have a care and especially not get on horseback  ego it will be pleasant and easy for me to follow the counsels of your majesty  king from what town in the canton of bern are you originally  ego from brugg  king i dont know that town no wonder thought i  king where did you study  ego at gottingen haller was my teacher  king what is m haller doing now  ego he is concluding his literary career with a romance usong had just come outno mortal now reads a word of it and the great haller is dreadfully forgotten already  king ah that is prettyon what system do you treat your patients  ego not on any system  king but there are some physicians whose methods you prefer to those of others  ego i especially like tissots methods who is a familiar friend of mine  king i know m tissot i have read his writings and value them very much on the whole i love the art of medicine my father wished me to get some knowledge in it he often sent me into the hospitals and even into those for venereal patients with a view of warning by example  ego and by terrible examplesire medicine is a very difficult art but your majesty is used to bring all arts under subjection to the force of your genius and to conquer all that is difficult  king alas no i cannot conquer all that is difficult hardmouthed kaunitz for example stockstill with his right ear turned on turkey how get kaunitz into stephere the king became reflective was silent for a little moment and then asked me with a most bright smile how many churchyards have you filled a common question of his to members of the faculty  ego perhaps in my youth i have done a little that way but now it goes better for i am timid rather than bold  king very good very good  our dialogue now became extremely brisk the king quickened into extraordinary vivacity and examined me now in the character of doctor with such a stringency as in the year 1751 at gottingen when i stood for my degree the learned professors haller richter segner and brendel for which heaven recompense them never dreamed of all inflammatory fevers and the most important of the slow diseases the king mustered with me in their order he asked me how and whereby i recognized each of these diseases how and whereby distinguished them from the approximate maladies what my procedure was in simple and in complicated cases and how i cured all those disorders on the varieties the accidents the mode of treatment of smallpox especially the king inquired with peculiar strictnessand spoke with much emotion of that young prince of his house who was carried off some years ago by that disordersuddenly arrested by it while on march with his regiment near ruppin 26th may 1767 this is the prince henri junior brother of the subsequent king friedrich wilhelm ii who among other fooleries invaded france in 1792 with such success both henri and he as boys used to be familiar to us in the final winters of the late war poor henri had died at the age of nineteenas yet all brightness amiability and nothing else friedrich sent an eloge of him to his academie in oeuvres de frederic vii 37 et seq which is touchingly and strangely filled with authentic sorrow for this young nephew of his but otherwise emptya mere bottle of sighs and tears then he came upon inoculation went along over an incredible multitude of other medical subjects into all he threw masterly glances spoke of all with the soundest all in superlative knowledge of the matter and with no less penetration than liveliness and sense  with heartfelt satisfaction and with the freest soul i made my answers to his majesty it is true he potently supported and encouraged me ever and anon his majesty was saying to me that is very goodthat is excellently thought and expressedyour mode of proceeding altogether pleases me very welli rejoice to see how much our ways of thinking correspond often too he had the graciousness to add but i weary you with my many questions his scientific questions i answered with simplicity clearness and brevity and could not forbear sometimes expressing my astonishment at the deep and conclusive tiefen und frappanten medical insights and judgments of the king  his majesty came now upon the history of his own maladies he told me them over in their series and asked my opinion and advice about each on the haemorrhoids which he greatly complained of i said something that struck him instantly he started up in his bed turned his head round towards the wall and said schmucker write me that down i started in fright at this word and not without reason then our colloquy proceeded  king the gout likes to take up his quarters with me he knows i am a prince and thinks i shall feed him well but i feed him ill i live very meagrely  ego may gout thereby get disgusted and forbear ever calling on your majesty  king i am grown old diseases will no longer have pity on me  ego europe feels that your majesty is not old and your majestys look physiognomie shows that you have still the same force as in your thirtieth year  king laughing and shaking his head well well well  in this way for an hour and quarter with uninterrupted vivacity the dialogue went on at last the king gave me the sign to go lifting his hat very kindly and saying adieu my dear m zimmermann i am very glad to have seen you  towards 6 pm now and friedrich must sign his despatches have his concert have his reading then to supper as spectator onlywith quintus icilius and old lord marischal tonight or whom of icilius and a quarrel and estrangement there had lately been now happily reconciled see nicolai anekdoten vi 140142  herr von catt accompanied me into the anteroom and schmucker followed i could not stir from the spot could not speak was so charmed and so touched that i broke into a stream of tears being very weak of nerves at the time herr von catt said i am now going back to the king go you into the room where i took you up about eight i will conduct you home i pressed my excellent countrymans hand ischmucker said i had stood too near his majesty i had spoken too frankly with too much vivacity nay what was unheard of in the world i had gesticulated before his majesty in presence of a king said herr schmucker one must stand stiff and not stir de catt came back to us at eight and in schmuckers presence let him chew the cud of that reported the following little dialogue with the king  king what says zimmermann  de catt zimmermann at the door of your majestys room burst into a stream of tears  king i love those tender affectionate hearts i love right well those brave swiss people  next morning the king was heard to say i have found zimmermann quite what you described himcatt assured me furthermore since the sevenyears war there had thousands of strangers persons of rank come to potsdam wishing to speak with the king and had not attained that favor and of those who had there could not one individual boast that his majesty had talked with him an hour and quarter at once fourteen years hence he dismissed mirabeau in half an hour which was itself a good allowance  sunday 27th i left potsdam with my kind meckels in an enthusiasm of admiration astonishment love and gratitude wrote to the king from berlin sent him a tissots book marked on the margins for majestys use which he acknowledged by some word to catt whereupon iin short i got home to hanover in a more or less seraphic conditionwith indescribable unspeakable what notearly in november and as a healed man never more troubled with that disorder though still troubled with many and many endeavored to get a little work out of myself again zimmermann meine unterredungen dialogues with friedrich the great 8vo leipzig 1788 pp 305326  zimmermann was tall handsome of shape his

sparkled in his eyeshad it not been for those dreadful hypochondrias and confused disasters a very pretty man at the time of this first visit to friedrich he is 43 years of age and friedrich is on the borders of 60 zimmermann with still more famous dialogues will reappear on us from hanover on a sad occasion meanwhile few weeks after him here is a visit of far more joyful kind     sister ulrique queendowager of sweden revisits her native place december 1771august 1772  prince henri was hardly home from petersburg and the swedish visit when poor adolf friedrich king of sweden died 12th february 1771 a very great and sad event to his queen who had loved her old man and is now left solitary eclipsed in circumstances greatly altered on the sudden in regard to settlements accession of the new prince dowager revenues and the like all went right enough which was some alleviation though an inconsiderable to the sorrowing widow her two princes were absent touring over europe when their father died and the elder of them karl gustav suddenly saw himself king they were in no breathless haste to return visited their uncle their prussian kindred on the way and had an interesting week at

was come and the outburst of the swedish summer at hand  some think the young king had already something dangerous and serious in view and wished his mother out of the way for a time certain it is she decided on a visit to her native country in december following arrived accordingly december 2d 1771 and till the middle of august next was a shining phenomenon in the royal house and upper ranks of berlin society and a touching and interesting one to the busy friedrich himself as may be supposed she had her own apartments and household at berlin in the palace there i think but went much visiting about and receiving many visitsfond especially of literary people  friedrichs notices of her are frequent in his letters of the time all affectionate natural and reasonable here are the first two i meet with to the electress of saxony three weeks after ulriques arrival a thousand excuses madam for not answering sooner what will plead for me with a princess who so well knows the duties of friendship is that i have been occupied with the reception of a sister who has come to seek consolation in the bosom of her kindred for the loss of a loved husband the remembrance of whom saddens and afflicts her and again two months later  your royal highness deigns to take so obliging an interest in the visit i have had and still have from the queen of sweden i beheld her as if raised from the dead to me for an absence of eightandtwenty years in the short space of our duration is almost equivalent to death she arrived among us still in great affliction for the loss she had had of the king and i tried to distract her sad thoughts by all the dissipations possible it is only by dint of such that one compels the mind to shift away from the fatal idea where grief has fixed it this is not the work of a day but of time which in the end succeeds in everything i congratulate your royal highness on your journey to bavaria on a somewhat similar errand we may politely say where you will find yourself in the bosom of a family that adores you after which and the sight of old scenes how pleasant to go on to italy as you propose oeuvres de frederic xxiv 230 235 24th december 1771 february

persons leaving these we will take an excerpt probably our last from authentic busching which is at least to be depended on for perfect accuracy and has a feature or two of portraiture  busching for the last five or six years is home from russia comfortably established here as consistorialrath much concerned with schoolsuperintendence still more with geography with copious rugged literature of the undigested kind a man well seen in society has six families of rank which invite him to dinner all the dining he is equal to with so much undigested writing on his hands busching in his final section headed berlin life section more incondite even than its foregoers has this passage  on the queendowager of sweden louise ulriques coming to berlin i felt not a little embarrassed the case was this most part of the sixth volume of my magazine meritorious curious book sometimes quoted by us here not yet known in english libraries was printed and in it in the printed part were various things that concerned the deceased sovereign king adolf friedrich and his spouse now come to visit usand among these were articles which the then ruling party in sweden could certainly not like and now i was afraid these people would come upon the false notion that it was from the queendowager i had got the articles in questionnotion altogether false as they had been furnished me by baron korf well known to hordt and others of us at petersburg in the czarpeter time now russian minister at copenhagen however when duke friedrich of brunswick one of the juniors soldiering here with his uncle as they almost all are wrote to me one day that his lady aunt the queen of sweden invited me to dine with her tomorrow and that he the duke would introduce mei at once decided to lay my embarrassment before the queen herself  next day when i was presented to her majesty she took me by the hand and led me to a window as was her custom with guests whom she judged to be worth questioning and talking to and so placed herself in a corner there that i came to stand close before her when she did me the honor to ask a great many questions about russia the imperial court especially and most of all the grandduke czar paul that is to bea kind of kinsman he his poor father was my late husbands cousingerman as perhaps you know a great deal of time was spent in this way so that the princes and princesses punctual to invitation had to wait above half an hour long and the queen was more than once informed that dinner was on the table and getting cold i could get nothing of my own mentioned here all i could do was to draw back in a polite way so soon as the queen would permit and afterwards at table to explain with brevity my concern about what was printed in the magazine and request the queen to permit me to send it her to read for herself she had it accordingly that same afternoon  a few days after she invited me again again spoke with me a long while in the window embrasure in a low tone of voice confirmed to me all that she had readand in particular minutely explained that letter of the king one of my pieces in which he relates what passed between him and count tessin sons tutor in the queens apartment at table she very soon took occasion to say i cannot imagine to myself how the herr consistorialrath busching to wit has come upon that letter of my deceased lord the king of swedens which his majesty did write and which is now printed in your magazine for certain the king showed it to nobody whereupon busching certainly nor is that to be imagined your majesty but the person it was addressed to must have shown it and so a copy of it has come to my hands queen still expresses her wonder whereupon again busching with a courageous candor your majesty most graciously permit me to say that hitherto all swedish secrets of court or state have been procurable for money and good words the queen to whom i sat directly opposite cast down her eyes at these words and smiledand the reichsrath graf von schwerin a swedish gentleman of hers who sat at my left seized me by the hand and said alas that is truehere is a difficulty got over magazine number can come out when it will as it did next easterfair with proper indications and tacit proofs that the swedish part of it lay printed several months before the queens arrival in our neighborhood  busching dined with her majesty several timeseating nothing he is careful to mention and was careful to show her majesty except very gradually a small bit of bread soaked in a glass of winemeaning thereby note ye great ones it is not for your dainties in fact it is out of loyal politeness mainly the gloomily humble man  one time the queen asked me in presence of various princes and princesses of the royal house do you think it advisable to enlighten the lower classes by education to which i answered considering only under what heavy loads a man of the lower classes especially of the peasant sort has to struggle through his life one would think it was better neither to increase his knowledge nor refine his sensibility but when one reflects that he as well as those of the higher classes is to last through eternity and withal that good instruction may or might if it be not bad increase his practical intelligence and help him to methods of alleviating himself in this world it must be thought advisable to give him useful enlightenment the queen accorded with this view of the matter  twice i dined with her majesty at her sister princess amelia the abbess of quedlinburgsand the second time must have been summer 1772 professor sulzer who was also a guest caught his death there when i entered the receptionroom sulzer was standing in the middle of a thoroughdraught which they had managed to have there on account of the great heat and he had just arrived all in a perspiration from the thiergarten i called him out of the draught but it was too late busching beitrage vi 578582 ach mein lieber sulzeralas dear sulzer seriously this time  busching has a great deal to say about schools about the school commission 1765 the subjects taught the methods of teaching devised by busching and others and the kings continual exertions under deficient funds in this province of his affairs busching had unheardof difficulty to rebuild the old gymnasium at berlin into a new tried everybody tried the king thrice over but nobody would one of the persons i applied to was lieutenantgeneral von ramin governor of berlin surliest of mankind of whose truculent incivility there go many anecdotes to ramin i wrote entreating that he would take a good opportunity and suggest a new town schoolhouse to his majesty excellenz it will render you immortal in the annals of berlin to which ramin made answer that is an immortality i must renounce the hope of and leave to the townsyndics and yourself i for my own part will by no means risk such a proposal to his majesty which he would in all likelihood answer in the negative and receive ill at anybodys hands ib vi 568 by subscriptions by bequests donations and the private piety of individuals busching aiding and stirring the thing was at last got done here is another glance into schoollife not from busching  june 9th 1771 this year the stande of the kurmark find they have an overplus of 100000 thalers 15000 pounds which sum they do themselves the pleasure of presenting to the king for his majestys uses king cannot accept it for his own uses this money answers he 9th june comes from the province wherefore i feel bound to lay it out again for advantage of the province could not it become a means of getting english husbandry turnips in particular whether shorthorns or not i do not know introduced among us in the towns that follow farming chiefly or in villages belonging to unmoneyed nobles we will lend out this 15000 pounds at 4 per cent in convenient sums for that object hereby will turnipculture and rotation be vouchsafed us interest at 4 per cent brings us in 600 pounds annually and this we will lay out in establishing new schoolmasters in the kurmark and having the youth better educated what a pretty idea neat and beautiful killing two important birds with one most small stone i have known enormous cannonballs and granite blocks torrent after torrent shot out under other kinds of financegunnery that were not only less respectable but that were abominable to me in comparison  unluckily no nobles were found inclined english husbandry turnipse and the rest of it had to wait their time the king again writes no nobles to be found say you well put the 15000 pounds to interest in the common waythat the schoolmasters at least may have solacement i will add 120 thalers 18 pounds apiece that we may have a chance of getting better schoolmasterssend me list of the places where the worst are list was sent is still extant and on the margin of it in royal autograph this remark  the places are well selected the bad schoolmasters are mostly tailors and you must see whether they cannot be got removed to little towns and set to tailoring again or otherwise disposed of that our schools might the sooner rise into good condition which is an interesting thing eager always our master is to have the schooling of his people improved and everywhere diffused writes some years afterwards the excellent zedlitz officially minister of public justice but much and meritoriously concerned with school matters as well the kings ideas were of the best and zedlitz sometimes had fine hopes but the want of funds was always great  in 1779 says preuss there came a sad blow to zedlitzs hopes minister von brenkenhof deep in westpreussen canaldiggings and expenditures having suggested that instead of getting pensions the old soldiers should be put to keeping school do but fancy it poor old fellows little versed in scholastics hitherto friedrich in his pinch grasped at the small help wrote to the wardepartment send me a list of invalids who are fit or at least fittest to be schoolmasters and got thereupon a list of 74 and afterwards 5 more 79 invalids in all wardepartment adding that besides these scholastic sort there were 741 serving as budner turnpikekeepers in a sort as forestwatchers and the like and 3443 unversorgt shifting for themselves no provision made for them at allsuch the check by cold arithmetic and inexorable finance upon the genial current of the soul  the turnips i believe got gradually in and brandenburg in our day is a more and more beautifully farmed country nor

frederic xxiii 140 139  the truth is he is growing very old and though a piercing radiance as of stars bursts occasionally from the central part of him the outworks are getting decayed and dim obstruction more and more accumulating and the immeasurable night drawing nigh well does voltaire himself at all moments know this and his bearing under it one must say is rather beautiful there is a tenderness a sadness in these his later letters to friedrich instead of emphasis or strength a beautiful shrill melody as of a woman as of a child he grieves unappeasably to have lost friedrich never will forgive maupertuispoor old man friedrich answers in a much livelier more robust tone friendly encouraging communicative on small mattersfull of praisesin fact sincerely glad to have such a transcendent genius still alive with him in this world praises to the most liberal pitch everything of voltairesexcept only the article on war which occasionally as below he quizzes a little to the patriarch or his disciple   as we have room for nothing of all this and perhaps shall not see voltaire againthere are two actual interviews with him which being withal by englishmen though otherwise not good for much we intend for readers here in these last twenty years dalembert is friedrichs chief correspondent of dalembert to the king it may be or may not some opportunity will rise for a specimen meanwhile here is a short letter of the kings to dalembert through which there pass so many threads of contemporaneous flying events swift shuttles on the loudsounding loom of time that we are tempted to give this before the two interviews in question  date of the letter is two months after that apparition of the duchess of wurtemberg at ferney of crillon an ingenious enough young soldier rushing ardently about the world in his holiday time we have nothing to say except that he is son of that rossbach crillon who always fancies to himself that once he perhaps spared friedrichs life by a glass of wine judiciously given long since while the bridge of weissenfels was on fire and rossbach close ahead supra x 6 colonel guibert is another soldier still young but of much superior

these points first that her eldest daughter is wife second wife to the dissolute crownprince of prussia and then that she has three other daughtersone of whom has just been disposed of in an important way wedded to the czarowitsh paul of russia namely by friedrichs means and management as friedrich informs us oeuvres de frederic memoires de 1763 jusqua 1775 vi 57 the czarina he says had sent out a confidential gentleman one asseburg who was prussian by birth to seek a fit wife for her son friedrich hearing of this suggested to asseburg the landgravine of darmstadt the most distinguished and

denounce this poor chaumeix did after such feats die peaceably at moscow as a schoolmaster  m de guibert has gone by ferney where it is said voltaire has converted him that is has made him renounce the errors of ambition abjure the frightful trade of hired manslayer with intent to become either capuchin or philosophe so that i suppose by this time he will have published a declaration like gresset informing the public that having had the misfortune to write a work on tactics he repented it from the bottom of his soul and hereby assured mankind that never more in his life would he give

letter thursday december 16th 1773 what a commotion is going on far over seas at boston new englandin the old south meetinghouse there in regard to three english tea ships that are lying embargoed in griffins wharf for above a fortnight past the case is well known and still memorable to mankind british parliament after nine years of the saddest haggling and baffling to and fro under constitutional stress of weather and such eastwinds and westwinds of parliamentary eloquence as seldom were has made up its mind that america shall pay duty on these teas before infusing them and america boston more especially is tacitly determined that it will not and that to avoid mistakes these teas shall never be landed at all such is bostons private intention more or less fixedto say nothing of the philadelphias charlestons new yorks who are watching boston and will follow suit of it  sunday november 26ththat is nineteen days agothe first of these tea ships the dartmouth captain hall moored itself in griffins wharf owner and consignee is a broadbrimmed boston gentleman called rotch more attentive to profits of trade than to the groans of bostonbut already on that sunday much more on the monday following there had a meeting of citizens run togetheron monday faneuil hall wont hold them and they adjourn to the old south meetinghousewho make it apparent to rotch that it will much behoove him for the sake both of tea and skin not to enter or officially announce this ship dartmouth at the customhouse in any wise but to pledge his broadbrimmed word equivalent to his oath that she shall lie dormant there in griffins wharf till we see which accordingly she has been doing ever since she and two others that arrived some days later dormant all three of them side by side three crews totally idle a committee of ten supervising rotchs procedures and the boston world much expectant thursday december 16th this is the 20th day since rotchs dartmouth arrived here if not entered at customhouse in the course of this day customhouse cannot give her a clearance either a leave to departshe becomes a smuggler an outlaw and her fate is mysterious to rotch and us  this thursday accordingly by 10 in the morning in the old south meetinghouse boston is assembled and countrypeople to the number of 2000and rotch never was in such a company of human friends before they are not uncivil to him cautious people heedful of the verge of the law but they are peremptory to the extent ofrotch may shudder to think what i went to the customhouse yesterday said rotch your committee of ten can bear me witness and demanded clearance and leave to depart but they would not were forbidden they said go then sir get you to the governor himself a clearance and out of harbor this day had nt

instant in front of old south meetinghouse a terrific warwhoop and about fifty mohawk indianswith whom adams seems to be acquainted and speaks without interpreter aha  and sure enough before the stroke of 7 these fifty painted mohawks are forward without noise to griffins wharf have put sentries all round there and in a great silence of the neighborhood are busy in three gangs upon the dormant tea ships opening their chests and punctually shaking them out into the sea listening from the distance you could hear distinctly the ripping open of the chests and no other sound about 10 pm

business is getting to bed by 10 on the boston clocks when the process finishes there friedrich will have had the best of his sleep over here is montcalms prophecy coming to fulfilmentand a curious intersection of a flying event through ones poor letter to dalembert we will now give the two english interviews with voltaire one of which is of three years past another of three years ahead     no 1 dr burney has sight of voltaire july 1770  in the years 17701771 burney then a famous doctor of music made his tour through france and italy on musical errands and researches charles burneys present state of music in france and italy being the journal of a tour through those countries to collect materials for a general history of music london 1773 the history of music followed duly in four 4tos london 17761789 with these we have no concern but only with one most small exceptional offshoot or episode which grew out of these enough for us to know that burney a comfortable welldisposed rather dull though vivacious doctor age near 45 had left london for paris in june 1770 that he was on to geneva intending for turin early in july and that his m fritz mentioned below is a veteran brother in music settled at geneva for the last thirty years who has been helpful and agreeable to burney while here our excerpt therefore dates itself one of the early days of july 1770burney hovering between two plans as we shall dimly perceive and not exactly executing either   my going to m fritz broke was about breaking but did not quite into a plan which i had formed of visiting m de voltaire at the same hour along with some other strangers who were then going to ferney but to say the truth besides the visit to m fritz being more my business i did not much like going with these people who had only a geneva bookseller to introduce them and i had heard that some english had lately met with a rebuff from m de voltaire by going without any letter of recommendation or anything to recommend themselves he asked them what they wanted upon their replying that they wished only to see so extraordinary a man he said well gentlemen you now see me did you take me for a wild beast or monster that was fit only to be stared at as a show this story very much frightened me for not having when i left london or even paris any intention of going to geneva i was quite unprovided with a recommendation however i was determined to see the place of his residence which i took to be still les delices  cette maison daristippe ces jardins dpicure  to which he retired in 1755 but was mistaken not the delices now at all but ferney for nine or ten years back  i drove to ferney alone after i had left m fritz this house is three or four miles from geneva but near the lake i approached it with reverence and a curiosity of the most minute kind i inquired when i first trod on his domain i had an intelligent and talkative postilion who answered all my questions very satisfactorily m de voltaires estate is very large here and he is building pretty farmhouses upon it he has erected on the geneva side a quadrangular justice or gallows to show that he is the seigneur one of his farms or rather manufacturing housesfor he is establishing a manufacture upon his estatewas so handsome that i thought it was his chateau  we drove to ferney through a charming country covered with corn and vines in view of the lake and mountains of gex switzerland and savoy on the left hand approaching the house is a neat chapel with this inscription  deo erexit voltaire mdcclxi  i sent to inquire whether a stranger might be allowed to see the house and gardens and was answered in the affirmative a servant soon came and conducted me into the cabinet or closet where his master had just been writing this is never shown when he is at home but having walked out i was allowed that privilege from thence i passed to the library which is not a very large one but well filled here i found a wholelength figure in marble of himself recumbent in one of the windows and many curiosities in another room a bust of himself made not two years since his mothers picture that of his niece madam denis his brother m dupuis the calas family and others it is a very neat and elegant house not large nor affectedly decorated  i should first have remarked that close to the chapel between that and the house is the theatre which he built some years ago where he treated his friends with some of his own tragedies it is now only used as a receptacle for wood and lumber there having been no play acted in it these four years the servant told me his master was 78 76 gone but very well il travaille said he pendant dix heures chaque jour he studies ten hours every day writes constantly without spectacles and walks out with only a domestic often a mile or twoet le voila la bas and see yonder he is  he was going to his workmen my heart leaped at the sight of so extraordinary a man he had just then quitted his garden and was crossing the court before his house seeing my chaise and me on the point of mounting it he made a sign to his servant who had been my cicerone to go to him in order i suppose to inquire who i was after they had exchanged a few words together he m de voltaire approached the place where i was standing motionless in order to contemplate his person as much as i could while his eyes were turned from me but on seeiug him move towards me i found myself drawn by some irresistible power towards him and without knowing what i did i insensibly met him halfway  it is not easy to conceive it possible for life to subsist in a form so nearly composed of mere skin and bone as that of m de voltaire extremely lean old gentleman he complained of decrepitude and said he supposed i was anxious to form an idea of the figure of one walking after death however his eyes and whole countenance are still full of fire and though so emaciated a more lively expression cannot be imagined  he inquired after english news and observed that poetical squabbles had given way to political ones but seemed to think the spirit of opposition as necessary in poetry as in politics les querelles dauteurs sont pour le bien de la litterature comme dans un gouvernement libre les querelles des grands et les clameurs des petits sont necessaires a la liberte and added when critics are silent it does not so much prove the age to be correct as dull he inquired what poets we had now i told him we had mason and gray they write but little said he and you seem to have no one who lords it over the rest like dryden pope and swift i told him that it was one of the inconveniences of periodical journals however well executed that they often silenced modest men of genius while impudent blockheads were impenetrable and unable to feel the critics scourge that mr gray and mr mason had both been illiberally treated by mechanical critics even in newspapers and added that modesty and love of quiet seemed in these gentlemen to have got the better even of their love of fame  during this conversation we approached the buildings that he was constructing near the road to his chateau these said he pointing to them are the most innocent and perhaps the most useful of all my works i observed that he had other works which were of far more extensive use and would be much more durable than those he was so obliging as to show me several farmhouses that he had built and the plans of others after which i took my leave burneys present state of music london 1773 pp 5562     no 2 a reverend mr sherlock sees voltaire and even dines with him april 1776  sherlocks book of travels though he wrote it in two languages and it once had its vogue is now little other than a dance of willowisps to us a book tawdry incoherent indistinct at once flashy and opaque full of idle excrescences and exuberancesas is the poor man himself he was chaplain to the earl of bristol bishop of derry gyrating about as ecclesiastical moon to that famed solar luminary what could you expect title of his book is letters from an english traveller translated from the french original london 1780 ditto letters from an english trader written originally in french by the rev martin sherlock am chaplain to the earl of bristol c a new edition 2 vols london 1802 poor sherlock is nowhere intentionally fabulous nor intrinsically altogether so foolish as he seems let that suffice us in his dance of willowisps which in this point happily is dated26th27th april 1776he had come to ferney with proper introduction to voltaire and here after severe excision of the flabby parts but without other change is credible account of what he saw and heard in three scenes with this prologueas to costume which is worth reading twice  voltaires dress on the two days i saw him he wore white cloth shoes white woollen stockings red breeches with a nightgown and waistcoat of blue linen flowered and lined with yellow he had on a grizzle wig with three ties and over it a silk nightcap embroidered with gold and silver   scene i the entrancehall of ferney friday 26th april 1776 exuberant sherlock entering letter of introduction having preceded  he met in the hall his nephew m dhornoi grandnephew abbe mignot famous for burying voltaire and madame denis whom we know were dhornois uncle and auntgrandnephew counsellor in the parlement of paris held him by the arm he said to me with a very weak voice you see a very old man who makes a great effort to have the honor of seeing you will you take a walk in my garden it will please you for it is in the english tasteit was i who introduced that taste into france and it is become universal but the french parody your gardens they put your thirty acres into three  from his gardens you see the alps the lake the city of geneva and its environs which are very pleasant he said  voltaire it is a beautiful prospect he pronounced these words tolerably well  sherlock how long is it since you were in england  voltaire fifty years at least not quite in 1728 left in 1726 had come supra vii 47  dhornoi it was at the time when you printed the first edition of your henriade  we then talked of literature and from that moment he forgot his age and infirmities and spoke with the warmth of a man of thirty he said some shocking things against moses and against shakspeare like enough we then talked of spain  voltaire it is a country of which we know no more than of the most savage parts of africa and it is not worth the trouble of being known if a man would travel there he must carry his bed c on arriving in a town he must go into one street to buy a bottle of wine a piece of a mule by way of beef in another he finds a table in a thirdand he sups a french nobleman was passing through pampeluna he sent out for a spit there was only one in the town and that was lent away for a wedding  dhornoi there monsieur is a village which m de voltaire has built  voltaire yes we have our freedoms here cut off a little corner and we are out of france i asked some privileges for my children here and the king has granted me all that i asked and has declared this pays de gex exempt from all taxes of the farmersgeneral so that salt which formerly sold for ten sous a pound now sells for four i have nothing more to ask except to livewe went into the library had made the round of the gardens i suppose   scene ii in the library  voltaire there you find several of your countrymen he had shakspeare milton congreve rochester shaftesbury bolingbroke robertson hume and others robertson is your livy his charles fifth is written with truth hume wrote his history to be applauded rapin to instruct and both obtained their ends  sherlock lord bolingbroke and you agreed that we have not one good tragedy  voltaire we did think so cato is incomparably well written addison had a great deal of tastebut the abyss between taste and genius is immense shakspeare had an amazing genius but no taste he has spoiled the taste of the nation he has been their taste for two hundred years and what is the taste of a nation for two hundred years will be so for two thousand this kind of taste becomes a religion there are in your country a great many fanatics for shakspeare  sherlock were you personally acquainted with lord bolingbroke  voltaire yes his face was imposing and so was his voice in his works there are many leaves and little fruit distorted expressions and periods intolerably long taking down a book there you see the koran which is well read at least it was marked throughout with bits of paper there are historic doubts by horace walpole which had also several marks here is the portrait of richard iii you see he was a handsome youth  sherlock making an abrupt transition you have built a church  voltaire true and it is the only one in the universe in honor of god deo erexit voltaire as we read above you have plenty of churches built to st paul to st genevieve but not one to god exit sherlock to his inn makes jotting as aboveis to dine at ferney tomorrow   scene iii dinnertable of voltaire  the next day as we sat down to dinner our host in the above shining costume he said in english tolerably pronounced  voltaire we are here for liberty and property parody of some old speech in parliament let us guessliberty and property my lords this gentlemanwhom let me present to monsieur sherlockis a jesuit old pere adam whom i keep for playing chess in his old unsheltered days he wears his hat i am a poor invalidi wear my nightcap  i do not now recollect why he quoted these verses also in english by rochester on charles second       here lies the muttoneating king       who never said a foolish thing      nor ever did a wise one  but speaking of racine he quoted this couplet of roscommans essay on translated verse       the weighty bullion of one sterling line      drawn to french wire would through whole pages shine  sherlock the english prefer corneille to racine  voltaire that is because the english are not sufficiently acquainted with the french tongue to feel the beauties of racines style or the harmony of his versification corneille ought to please them more because he is more striking but racine pleases the french because he has more softness and tenderness  sherlock how did you find like the english fare la chere anglaisewhich voltaire mischievously takes for the dear englishwoman  voltaire i found her very fresh and whitetruly it should be remembered that when he made this pun upon women he was in his eightythird year  sherlock their language  voltaire energetic precise and barbarous they are the only nation that pronounce their a as e and some time afterwards though i cannot perfectly pronounce english my ear is sensible of the harmony of your language and of your versification pope and dryden have the most harmony in poetry addison in prose takes now the interrogating side  voltaire how have you liked avexvous trouve the french  sherlock amiable and witty i only find one fault with them they imitate the english too much  voltaire how do you think us worthy to be originals ourselves  sherlock yes sir  voltaire so do i toobut it is of your government that we are envious  sherlock i have found the french freer than i expected  voltaire yes as to walking or eating whatever he pleases or lolling in his elbowchair a frenchman is free enough but as to taxesah monsieur you are a lucky nation you can do what you like poor we are born in slavery we cannot even die as we will we must have a priest cant get buried otherwise am often thinking of that well if the english do sell themselves it is a proof that they are worth something we french dont sell ourselves probably because we are worth nothing  sherlock what is your opinion of the eloise rousseaus immortal work  voltaire that it will not be read twenty years hence  sherlock mademoiselle de lenclos wrote some good letters  voltaire she never wrote one they were by the wretched crebillon my beggarly old rival in the pompadour epoch  voltaire the italians are a nation of brokers italy is an oldclothes shop in which there are many old dresses of exquisite taste but we are still to know whether the subjects of the pope or of the grand turk are the more abject we have now gone to the drawingroom i think though it is not jotted  he talked of england and of shakspeare and explained to madame denis part of a scene in henry fifth where the king makes love to queen catherine in bad french and of another in which that queen takes a lesson in english from her waitingwoman and where there are several very gross doubleentendresbut i hope did not long dwell on these  voltaire when i see an englishman subtle and fond of lawsuits i say there is a norman who came in with william the conqueror when i see a man goodnatured and polite that is one who came with the plantagenets a brutal character that is a danefor your nation monsieur as well as your language is a medley of many others  after dinner passing through a little parlor where there was a head of locke another of the countess of coventry and several more he took me by the arm and stopped me do you know this bust bust of sir isaac newton it is the greatest genius that ever existed if all the geniuses of the universe were assembled he should lead the band  it was of newton and of his own works that m de voltaire always spoke with the greatest warmth sherlock letters london 1802 i 98106 exit sherlock to jot down the above and thence into infinite space     general or fieldmarshal conway direct from the london circles attends one of friedrichs reviews augustseptember 1774  now that friedrichs military department is got completely into trim again which he reckons to have been about 1770 his annual reviews are becoming very famous over europe and intelligent officers of all countries are eager to be present and instruct themselves there the review is beautiful as a spectacle but that is in no sort the intention of it rigorous business as in the strictest of universities examining for degrees would be nearer the definition sometimes when a new manoeuvre or tactical invention of importance is to be tried by experiment you will find for many miles the environs of potsdam which is usually the scene of such experiments carefully shut in sentries on every road no unfriendly eye admitted the thing done as with closed doors nor at any time can you attend without leave asked though to foreign officers and persons that have really business there there appears to be liberality enough in granting it the concourse of military strangers seems to keep increasing every year till friedrichs death rodenbeck iii in locis french more and more in quantity present themselves multifarious german names generally a few english tooburgoyne of saratoga finally cornwallis duke of york marshal conwayof which last we have something farther to say at present  in summer 1774 conwaythe marshal conway of whom walpole is continually talking as of a considerable soldier and politician though he was not in either character considerable but was walpoles friend and an honest modest manhad made up his mind perhaps partly on domestic grounds for i have noticed glimpses of a lady c much out of humor to make a tour in germany and see the reviews both austrian and prussian prussian especially two immense letters of his on that subject have come into my hands kindly presented me by charles knight esq the wellknown author and publisher who possesses a collection by the same hand these two run to fourteen large pages in my copy and elsewhere incidentally there is printed record of the tour in keith sir robert murray memoirs and correspondence ii 21 et seq unimportant as possible both tour and letters but capable if squeezed into compass of still being read without disadvantage here  sir robert murray keiththat is the younger excellency keith now minister at dresden whom we have sometimes heard ofaccompanies conway on this tour or flies alongside of him with frequent intersections at the principal points and there is printed record by sir robert but still less interesting than this of conway and perfectly conformable to itso that except for some words about the lord marischal which shall be given keith must remain silent while the diffuse conway strives to become intelligible indeed neither conway nor keith tell us the least thing that is not abundantly and even wearisomely known from german sources but to readers here a pair of english eyes looking on the matter put straight in places by the help there is may give it a certain freshness of meaning here are conways two letters with the nine parts of water charitably squeezed out of them by a skilful friend of mine and his   conway to his brother marquis of hertford in london  berlin july 17th 1774  dear brotherin the hurry i live in leaving brunswick where in absence of most of the court who are visiting at potsdam my old commander duke ferdinand now estranged from potsdam had a kind of quarrel with friedrich in 1766 rough treatment by adjutant von anhalt not tolerable to a captain now become so eminent and quietly withdrewstill on speaking terms with the king but never his officer more and living here among works of art and speculations on free masonry was very kind to me i went to celle in hanover to pay my respects to the queen of denmark unfortunate divorced matilda saved by my friend keithinnocent i will hope she is grown extremely fat at magdeburg the prussian frontier on this side one is not allowed without a permit even to walk on the rampartssuch the strictness of prussian rule driving through potsdam on my way to berlin i was stopped by a servant of the good old lord marischal who had spied me as i passed under his window he came out in his nightgown and insisted upon our staying to dine with himworthy old man a word of him were this letter done we ended on consultation about times and movements of the king by staying three days at potsdam mostly with this excellent old lord  on the third day yesterday evening in fact i went by appointment to the new palace to wait upon the king of prussia there was some delay his majesty had gone in the interim to a private concert which he was giving to the princesses duchess of brunswick and other high guests rodenbeck in die iii 98 but the moment he was told i was there he came out from his company and gave me a most flattering gracious audience of more than half an hour talking on a great variety of things with an ease and freedom the very reverse of what i had been made to expect i asked and received permission to visit the silesian camps next month his majesty most graciously telling me the particular days they would begin and end 27th august3d september schmelwitz near breslau are time and place ib iii 101 this considerably deranges my austrian movements and will hurry my return out of those parts but who could resist such a temptationi saw the footguards exercise especially the splendid first battalion i could have conceived nothing so perfect and so exact as all i sawso well dressed such men and so punctual in all they did  the new palace at potsdam is extremely noble not so perfect perhaps in point of taste but better than i had been led to expect the king dislikes living there never does except when there is high company about him for seven or eight months in the year he prefers little sanssouci and freedom among his intimates and some of his generals his music still takes up a great share of the kings time on a table in his cabinet there i saw i believe twenty boxes with a german flute in each in his bedchamber twice as many boxes of spanish snuff and alike in cabinet and in bedchamber three armchairs in a row for three favorite dogs each with a little stool by way of step that the getting up might be easy  the town of potsdam is a most extraordinary and in its appearance beautiful town all the streets perfectly straight all at right angles to each other and all the houses built with handsome generally elegant fronts he builds for everybody who has a bad or a small house even the lowest mechanic he has done the same at berlin altogether his majestys building operations are astonishing and from whence does this money come after a long expensive war it is all fairyland and enchantmentmagnum vectigal parsimonia in fact at berlin here i saw the porcelain manufacture today which is greatly improved i leave presently adieu dear brother excuse my endless letter since you cannot squeeze the water out of it as some willyours most sincerely  henry seymour conway  keith is now minister at dresden for some years back and has among other topics much to say of our brilliant friend the electress there but his grand diplomatic feat was at copenhagen on a sudden sally out thither in 1771 in keith i 152 c nothing of intelligible narrative given hardly the date discoverable the saving of queen matilda youngest sister of george third from a hard doom unfortunate queen matilda one never knows how guilty or whether guilty at all but she was very unfortunate poor young lady what with a mad husband collapsed by debaucheries into stupor of insanity what with a doctor gradually a prime minister struensee wretched scarecrow to look upon but wiser than most danes about and finally with a lynxeyed stepsister whose son should matilda mistake will inheritunfortunate matilda had fallen into the awfulest troubles got divorced imprisoned would have lost her head along with scarecrow struensee had not her brother george iii emphatically intervenedexcellency keith with seventyfours in the distance coming out very strong on the occasionand got her loose loose from danish axe and jail at any rate delivered into safety and solitude at celle in hanover where she now isand soon after suddenly dies of fever so closing a very sad short history  excellency keith famed in the diplomatic circles ever since is at present ahead of conway on their joint road to the austrian reviews before giving conways second letter let us hear keith a little on his kinsman the old marischal whom he saw at berlin years ago and still occasionally corresponds with and mentions in his correspondence keith loquitur date is dresden february 1770  has visited the old marischal at potsdam lately my stay of three days with lord marischal he is the most innocent of gods creatures and his heart is much warmer than his head the place of his abode i must say is the very temple of dulness and his female companion a poor turk foundling a perishing infant flung into his late brothers hands at the fall of oczakow supra vii 82whom the marischal has carefully brought up and who refuses to marry away from himrather stupid not very pretty by the portraits must now be twoandthirty gone is perfectly calculated to be the priestess of it yet he dawdles away his day in a manner not unpleasant to him and i really am persuaded he has a conscience that would gild the inside of a dungeon the feats of our barelegged warriors in the late war bergschotten among whom i was a colonel accompanied by a pibrach elegiac bagpipe droning more suo in his outer room have an effect on the old don which would delight you keith i 129 dresden 25th february 1770 to his sister in scotland  and then seen him in berlin on the same occasion lord marischal came to meet me at sir andrews mitchells in berlin the last year of the brave mitchells life where we passed five days together my visit to his country residence as you already know was of three days and i had reason to be convinced that it gave the old don great pleasure he talked to me with the greatest openness and confidence of all the material incidents of his life and hinted often that the honor of the clan was now to be supported by our family for all of whom he had the greatest esteem his taste his ideas and his manner of living are a mixture of aberdeenshire and the kingdom of valencia and as he seeks to make no new friends he seems to retain a strong though silent attachment for his old ones as to his political principles i believe him the most sincere of converts to whiggery and orthodoxy since i began this i have had a most inimitable letter from lord marischal i had mentioned dr bailies to him noted english doctor at dresden bent on inoculating and the like and begged he would send me a state of his case and infirmities that the doctor might prescribe for him this is a part of his answer  i thank you for your advice of consulting the english doctor to repair my old carcass i have lately done so by my old coach and it is now almost as good as new please therefore to tell the doctor that from him i expect a good repair and shall state the case first he must know that the machine is the worse for wear being nearly eighty years old the reparation i propose he shall begin with is one pair of new eyes one pair of new ears some improvement on the memory when this is done we shall ask new legs and some change in the stomach for the present this first reparation will be sufficient and we must not trouble the doctor too much at onceyou see by this how easy his lordships infirmities sit upon him and it is really so as he says your friend sir andrew is i am afraid less gay but i have not heard from him these three months keith i 132 133 dresden 13th march 1770 to his father  conway to keith on the late three days at potsdam date dresden 21st july 1774 in keith ii 15 i stayed three days at potsdam with much entertainment for good part of which i am obliged to your excellencys old friend lord marischal who showed me all the kindness and civility possible he stopped me as i passed and not only made me dine with him that day but in a manner live with him he is not at all blind as you imagined so much otherwise that i saw him read without spectacles a difficult hand i could not easily decipher stayed but a day at berlin am rushing after youhere is my second letter   conways second letter to his brother as before  schmelwitz near breslau headquarters  august 31st 1774  dear brother i left that camp austrian camp and reviews in hungary where the kaiser and everybody had been very gracious to me with much regret parted regretfully with keithhad played at presburg in sight of him and fourteen other englishmen a game with the chess automaton brandnew miracle just out account of it and of this game in keith too ii 18 view 3d september 1774 keith to his fathercame on through vienna hitherward as fast as posthorses could carry us travelling night and day without stopping being rather behind time arrived at breslau near dark last night where i learnt that the camp was twenty miles off that the king was gone there and that the manoeuvres would begin at four or five this morning i therefore ordered my chaise at twelve at night and set out in darkness and rain to be presented to the king of prussia next morning at five at the head of his troops when i arrived before five at the place called headquarters i found myself in the middle of a miserable village this schmelwitz here no creature alive or stirring nor a sentinel or any military object to be seen as soon as anything alive was to be found we asked if the king was lodged in that village yes they said in that house pointing to a clay hovel but general lentulus soon appeared and  his majesty has been very gracious asked me many questions about my tour to hungary i saw all the troops pass him as they arrived in camp they made a very fine appearance really though it rained hard the whole time we were out and as his majesty age 62 did not cloak we were all heartily wet and what was worse went from the field to orders giving out of parole and the like at his quarters there to make our bowwhere we stayed in our wet clothes an hour and half towards 10 am by this time how different at the emperors when his imperial majesty and everybody was cloaked got no hurt by the wet strange to say  these are our news to this day and now having sat up five nights out of the last six and been in rain and dirt almost all day i wish you sincerely goodnighth s c  ps breslau 4th september my prussian campaign is finished and as much to my satisfaction as possible the beauty and order of the troops their great discipline their c c almost pass all belief yesterday we were on horseback early at four oclock the movement was conducted with a spirit and order on both sides that was astonishing and struck the more delightful sic by the variety as in the course of the action the enemy conducted by general anhalt head all right as yet took three different positions before his final retreat  the moment it was over nine oclock or so his majesty got a fresh horse and set out for potsdam after receiving the compliments of those present or rather holding a kind of short levee in the field i cant say how much in my particular i am obliged to his majesty for his extraordinary reception and distinction shown me throughout each day after the manoeuvre and giving the orders of the day he held a little levee at the door or in the court at which i can assure you it is not an exaggeration of vanity to say that he not only talked to me but literally to nobody else at all it was a good deal each time and as soon as finished he made his bow and retired though all or most of the other foreigners were standing by as well as his own generals he also called me up and spoke to me several times on horseback when we were out which he seldom did to anybody  the prince royal also showed me much civility the second day he asked me to come and drink a dish of tea with him after dinner and kept me an hour and half he told me among other things that the king of prussia had a high opinion of me and that it came chiefly from the favorable manner in which duke ferdinand and the hereditary prince of brunswick had spoken of me pray let horace walpole know my address that i may have all the chance i can of hearing from him but if he comes to paris i forgive himh s c  friedrichs reviews though fine to look upon or indeed the finest in the world were by no means of spectacular nature but of altogether serious and practical almost of solemn and terrible to the parties interested like the strictest college examination for degrees as we said like a royal assize or doomsday of the year to military people and over the upper classes of berlin society nothing could be more serious major kaltenborn an exprussian officer presumably of overtalkative habits who sounds on us like a very messroom of the time all gathered under one hatdescribes in an almost awful manner the kind of terror with which all people awaited these annual assizes for trial of military merit  what a sight says he and awakening what thoughts that of a body of from 18000 to 20000 soldiers in solemn silence and in deepest reverence awaiting their fate from one man a review in friedrichs time was an important moment for almost the whole country the fortune of whole families often depended on it from wives mothers children and friends during those terrible three days there arose fervent wishes to heaven that misfortune might not as was too frequently the case befall their husbands fathers sons and friends in the course of them here the king as it were weighed the merits of his officers and distributed according as he found them light or heavy praise or blame rebukes or favors and often too often punishments to be felt through life one single unhappy moment especially if it were the last of a long series of such often deprived the bravest officer of his bread painfully earned in peace and war and of his reputation and honor at least in the eyes of most men who judge of everything only by its issue the higher you had risen the easier and deeper your fall might be at an unlucky review the heads and commanders of regiments were always in danger of being sent about their business weggejagt  the fact is i kaltenborn quitted the prussian service and took hessianbeing presumably of exaggerative overtalkative nature and strongly gravitating opposition waykaltenborn admits that the king delighted in nothing so much as to see peoples faces cheerful about him provided the price for it were not too high here is another passage from him  at latest by 9 in the morning the days manoeuvre had finished and everything was already in its place again straight from the ground all heads of regiments the majorsdejour all aidesdecamp and from every battalion one officer proceed to headquarters it was impossible to speak more beautifully or instructively than the king did on such occasions if he were not in bad humor it was then a very delight to hear him deliver a military lecture as it were he knew exactly who had failed what caused the fault and how it might and should have been retrieved his voice was soft and persuasive hinreissend he looked kindly and appeared rather bent upon giving good advice than commands  thus for instance he once said to general van lossow head of the black hussars your seine attack would have gone very well had not your own squadron pressed forward too much vorgeprellt the brave fellows wanted to show me how they can ride but dont i know that well enoughand also that you covetous lossow always choose the best horses from the whole remount for your own squadron there was therefore no need at all for that tell your people not to do so tomorrow and you will see it will go much better all will remain closer in their places and the left wing be able to keep better in line in coming onanother time having observed in a certain footregiment that the soldiers were too long in getting out their cartridges he said to the commandant do you know the cause of this my dear colonel look the cartouche in the cartridgebox has 32 holes into these the fellow sticks his eight cartridges without caring how and so the poor devil fumbles and gropes about and cannot get hold of any but now if the officers would look to it that he place them all well together in the middle of the cartouche he would never make a false grasp and the loading would go as quick again only tell your officers that i had made this observation and i am sure they will gladly attend to it anonymous kaltenborn briefe eines alten preussischen officiers hohenzollern 1790 ii 2426  of humane consolatory anecdotes in this kind our opposition kaltenborn gives several of the rhadamanthine desolating or destructive kind though such also could not be wanting if your assize is to be good for anything he gives us none and so far as i can learn the effective punishments dismissals and the like were of the due rarity and propriety though the flashes of unjust rebuke fulminant severity lightnings from the gloom of ones own sorrows and illhumor were much more frequent but were seldomi do not know if everpersisted in to the length of practical result this is a rhadamanthus much interested not to be unjust and to discriminate good from bad of ziethen there are two famous review anecdotes omitted and omissible by kaltenborn so well known are they one of each kind at a certain review year not ascertainablelong since prior to the sevenyears warthe kings humor was of the grimmest nothing but faults all round to ziethen himself and the ziethen hussars he said various hard things and at length this hardest out of my sight with you madame de blumenthal life of ziethen i 265 upon which ziethena stratum of redhot kindling in ziethen too as was easily possibleturns to his hussars right about rechts um march and on the instant did as bidden disappeared doublequick and at the same high pace in a high frame of mind rattled on to berlin home to his quarters and there first drew bridle turn for heavens sake bethink you said more than one friend whom he met on the road but it was of no use everybody said ziethen is ruined but ziethen never heard of the thing more  anecdote second is not properly of a review but of an incidental parade of the guard at berlin 25th december 1784 by the king in person parade or rather giving out of the parole after it in the kings apartments which is always a kind of military levee as welland which in this instance was long famous among the berlin people king is just arrived for carnival season old ziethen will not fail to pay his duty though climbing of the stairs is heavy to a man of 85 gone this is madam blumenthals narrative corrected as it needs in certain points  saturday 25th december 1784 ziethen in spite of the burden of eightysix years went to the palace at the end of the parade to pay his sovereign this last tribute of respect and to have the pleasure of seeing him after six months absence the parole was given out the orders imparted to the generals and the king had turned towards the princes of the bloodwhen he perceived ziethen on the other side of the hall between his son and his two aidesdecamp surprised in a very agreeable manner at this unexpected sight he broke out into an exclamation of joy and directly making up to himwhat my good old ziethen are you there said his majesty how sorry am i that you have had the trouble of walking up the staircase i should have called upon you myself how have you been of late sire answered ziethen my health is not amiss my appetite is good but my strength my strength this account replied the king makes me happy by halves only but you must be tiredi shall have a chair for you thing unexampled in the annals of royalty a chair on order to ziethens aidesdecamp was quickly brought ziethen however declared that he was not at all fatigued the king maintained that he was sit down good father mein lieber alter papa ziethen setze er sich doch continued his majesty i will have it so otherwise i must instantly leave the room for i cannot allow you to be incommoded under my own roof the old general obeyed and friedrich the great remained standing before him in the midst of a brilliant circle that had thronged round them after asking him many questions respecting his hearing his memory and the general state of his health he at length took leave of him in these words adieu my dear ziethen it was his last adieutake care not to catch cold nurse yourself well and live as long as you can that i may often have the pleasure of seeing you after having said this the king instead of speaking to the other generals and walking through the saloons as usual retired abruptly and shut himself up in his closet blumenthal ii 341 militairlexikon iv 318 chodowiecki has made an engraving of this scene useful to look at for its military portraits if of little esteem otherwise strangely enough both in blumenthal and in chodowieckis engraving the year is given as 1785 plainly impossible militairlexikon misprints the month and one way or other only rodenbeck iii 316 is right in both day and year  following in date these small conway phenomena if these so extraneous and insignificant can have any glimmer of memorability to readers are two other occurrences especially one other which come in at this part of the series and greatly more require to be disengaged from the dustheaps and presented for remembrance  in 1775 the king had a fit of illness which long occupied certain gazetteers and others that is the first occurrence of the two and far the more important he himself says of it in his history all that is essential to us here  towards the end of 1775 the king was attacked by several strong consecutive fits of gout van swieten a famous doctors son and minister of the imperial court at berlin took it into his head that this gout was a declared dropsy and glad to announce to his court the approaching death of an enemy that had been dangerous to it boldly informed his kaiser that the king was drawing to his end and would not last out the year at this news the soul of joseph flames into enthusiasm all the austrian troops are got on march their rendezvous marked in bohemia and the kaiser waits full of impatience at vienna till the expected event arrives ready then to penetrate at once into saxony and thence to the frontiers of brandenburg and there propose to the kings successor the alternative of either surrendering silesia straightway to the house of austria or seeing himself overwhelmed by austrian troops before he could get his own assembled all these things which were openly done got noised abroad everywhere and did not as is easy to believe cement the friendship of the two courts to the public this scene appeared the more ridiculous as the king of prussia having only had a common gout in larger dose than common was already well of it again before the austrian army had got to their rendezvous the kaiser made all these troops return to their old quarters and the court of vienna had nothing but mockery for its imprudent conduct oeuvres de frederic vi 124  the first of these goutattacks seems to have come in the end of september and to have lasted about a month after which the illness abated and everybody thought it was gone the kaiserjoseph evolution must have been in october and have got its mockery in the next months friedrich writing to voltaire october 22d has these words a pair of charming letters from ferney to which had they been from the great demiurgus himself i could not have dictated answer gout held me tied and garroted for four weeksgout in both feet and in both hands and such its extreme liberality in both elbows too at present the pains and the fever have abated and i feel only a very great exhaustion ib xxv 44 four consecutive attacks hope they are now all over but we read within the spring following that there have been in all twelve of them and in may 1776 the newspapers count eighteen quasiconsecutive so that in reality the kings strength was sadly reduced and his health which did not recover its old average till about 1780 continued for several years after this bad fit to be a constant theme of curiosity to the gazetteer species and a matter of solicitude to his friends and to his enemies  of the kaisers immense ambition there can be no question he is stretching himself out on every side seriously wishing thinks friedrich that he could revivify the german reichnew barbarossa in improved fixed form how noble certainly to king friedrichs sad conviction the austrian court is aiming to swallow all manner of dominions that may fall within its grasp wants bosnia and servia in the east longs to seize certain venetian territories which would unite trieste and the milanese to the tyrol is throwing out hooks on modena on the ferrarese on this and on that looking with eager eyes on bavariathe situation of which is peculiar the present kurbaiern being elderly childless and his heir the like who withal is already kurpfalz and will unite the two electorates under one head a thing which austria regards with marked dislike oeuvres de frederic vi 123 these are anxious considerations to a king in friedrichs sick state in his private circle too there are sorrows death of fouquet death of quintus icilius of seidlitz quantz good old quantz with his fine flutings these fifty years and the still finer memories he awoke friedrichs teacher of the flute procured for him by his mother supra

friedrich fouquet at brandenburg died last year his benefactor in the early custrin distresses his bayard and chosen friend ever since how conspicuously dear to friedrich to the last is still evident a friedrich getting lonely enough and the lights of his life going out around himhas but one sure consolation which comes to him as compulsion withal and is not neglected that of standing steadfast to his work whatever the mood and posture be  the event of 1776 is czarowitsh pauls arrival in berlin and betrothal to a second wife there his first having died in childbirth lately the first had been of friedrichs choosing but had behaved illseduced by spanishfrench diplomacies by this and that poor young creaturethe second also was of friedrichs choosing and a still nearer connection figure what a

not much diplomatic employment i should think but with a style of general bearing and social physiognomy which with some procedures partly incidental as well are still remembered in berlin something of spying too doubtless there was bribing of menials opening of letters i believe a great deal of that went on impossible to prevent under the carefulest of kings an ingenious young friend of mine connected with legationary business found lately at the hague a consecutive series complete for four or five years i think from 1780 onwards of friedrichs letters to his minister in londoncopies punctually filched as they went through the postoffice therespecimens of which i saw and the whole of which i might have seen had it been worth the effort necessary but friedrichs london minister in this case was a person of no significance or intimacy and the kings letters though strangely exact clear and even elucidative on english courtpolitics and vicissitudes seemed to be nearly barren as to prussian hitherto with one exception to be mentioned presently his main business seems to have been that of introducing on different courtdays a great number of travelling english who want to see the king and whom the king little wants but quietly submits to incoherent sherlock whom we discover to have been of the number has in his tawdry disjointed book this passage  the last time of my seeing

last the king are you a relation of lord chathams yes sirehe is a man whom i highly esteem read esteemed  he then went to the foreign ministers and talked more to prince dolgorucki the russian ambassador than to any other in the midst of his conversation with this prince he turned abruptly to mr elliot the english minister and asked what is the duchess of kingstons family name this transition was less pindaric than it appears he had just been speaking of the court of petersburg and that lady was then there sherlock ii 27 whereupon sherlock hops his ways again leaving us

stolen letters of friedrich which show so exact a knowledge of the current of events in america as well as england knows every step of it as if he were there himself the archenemy of honest neighbors in a time of stressbut it does appear they had got it into their sagacious heads that the bad neighbor at berlin was in effect the archenemy probably mainspring of the whole matter and that it would be in the highest degree interesting to see clearly what lee and he had on hand order thereupon to elliot do it at any price and finally as mere price will not answer do it by any methodsteal lees

improper or proper ways a discovery of less value discovery that lee has indeed been urgent at berlin and has raised in friedrich the question have you got to such a condition that i can with safety

condition that his majesty has replied well let him wait till they are and that lee is waiting accordingly in general that his majesty is not less concerned in guidance or encouragement of the american war than he is in ditto of the atlantic tides or of the eastwind though he does keep barometers and meteorological apparatus by him and that we of the councilboard are awhat shall i say not

have heard you are for germany this season some say you intend to become german altogether  dalembert i did promise myself the high honor of a visit to his prussian majesty who has deigned to invite me with all the kindness possible but alas for such hopes the bad state of my health  falkenstein it seems to me you have already been to see the king of prussia  dalembert two times once in 1756 1755 17th19th juneif you will be exact at wesel when i remained only a few days and again in 1763 when i had the honor to pass three or four months with him since that time i have always longed to have the honor of seeing his majesty again but circumstances hindered me i above all regretted not to have been able to pay my court to him that year he saw the emperor at neissebut at this moment there is nothing more to be wished on that head dont bow the gentleman is incognito  falkenstein it was very natural that the emperor young and desiring to instruct himself should wish to see such a prince as the king of prussia so great a captain a monarch of such reputation and who has played so great a part it was a scholar going to see his master these are his very words your majesty  dalembert i wish

passed by an accident just fallen out into the acute state rose gradually and in spite of negotiating issued in a thing called bavariansuccession war which did not end till spring of the following year the accident was this at munchen december 30th 1777 max joseph kurfurst of baiern only brother of our lively friend the electressdowager of saxony died suddenly of smallpox unskilfully treated he was in his fiftysecond year childless the last of that bavarian branch his heir is karl theodor kurpfalz elector palatine who is now to unite the two electoratesunless austria can bargain with him otherwise austrias desire to get hold of baiern is of very old standing and we have heard lately how much it was an object with kaunitz and his young kaiser with karl theodor they did bargainin fact had beforehand as good as bargainedand were greatly astonished when king friedrich alone of all teutschland or the world mildly but peremptorily interfered and said nowith effect as is well known  something not much must be said of this bavariansuccession war which occupied at a pitch of tension and anxiety foreign to him for a long time fifteen months of friedrichs old age january 1778march 1779 and filled all europe round him and it in an extraordinary manner something by no means much now that we have seen the issue of such mountains all in travail nobody could then say but it bade fair to become a fourth austrianprussian war as sanguinary as the sevenyears had been for in effect there stood once more the two nations ranked against each other as if for mortal duel near half a million men in whole parleying indeed but brandishing their swords and ever and anon giving mutual clash of fence as if the work had begun though there always intervened new parleying first  and now everybody sees that the work never did begin that parleying enforced by brandishing turned out to be all the work there was and everybody has forgotten it and except for specific purposes demands not to be put in mind of it mountains in labor were not so frequent then as now when the penny newspaper has got charge of them though then as now to practical people they were a nuisance mountains all in terrific travailthroes threatening to overset the solar system have always a charm especially for the more foolish classes but when once the birth has taken place and the wretched mouse ducks past you or even nothing at all can be seen to duck past who is there but impatiently turns on his heel  those territories which adjoin on its own dominions would have been extremely commodious to austriaas austria itself has long known and by repeatedly attempting them on any chance given as in 17411745 to go no farther back has shown how well it knows indeed the whole of bavaria fairly incorporated and made austrian what an infinite convenience would it be  do but look on the map this note is not by busching but by somebody of austrian tendencies you would say austria without bavaria is like a human figure with its belly belonging to somebody else bavaria is the trunk or belly of the austrian dominions shutting off all the limbs of them each from the other making for central part a huge chasm  oberpfalzwhich used to be kurpfalzs which is bavarias since we took it from the winterking and bestowed it in that wayoberpfalz the country of amberg where maillebois once pleased to make invasion of usdoes not it adjoin on the bohemian forest the ribs there bohemian all up to the shoulder are ours but the shoulderblade and left arm whose are they austria proper and hungary these may be taken as sittingpart and lower limbs ample and fleshy but see just above the pelvis on the south side how bavaria and its tyrol sticks itself in upon austria who fancied she also had a tyrol and far the more important one our tyrol our styria carniola carinthiabavaria blocks these in then the swabian austriabreisach and those upperrhine countries from which we invade francewe cannot reach them except through bavarian ground swabian austria should be our right arm fingers of it reaching into switzerland oberpfalz our leftand as to the broad breast between these two left arm and broad breast are bavarias not ours of the netherlands which might be called geographically the head of austria alas the long neck lorraine was once ours but whose is it irrecoverable for the presentperhaps may not always be so  these are kaunitzs ideas and the young kaiser has eagerly adopted them as the loadstar of his life make the reich a reality again thinks the kaiser good if only possible think we too make austria great austria is the reich how else can the reich be real  in practical politics these are rather wild ideas but they are really kaunitzs and his kaisers and were persisted in long after this bavarian matter got its check and as a whole they got repeated checks being impossible all and far from the meaning of a time big with french revolution and with quite other things than worldgreatness to austria and rejuvenescence on such or on any terms to the poor old holy roman reich which had been a wiggery so long nobody could guess of what it was that france or the world might be with child nobody till the birth in 1789 and even for a generation afterwards france is weakly and unwieldy has strange enough longings for chalky inky visionary foolish substances and may be in the familyway for aught we know  to kaunitz it is pretty clear that france will not stand in his path in this fine little bavarian business which is all he cares for at present england in war with its colonies russia attentive to its turk foreign nations what can they do but talk remonstrate more or less as they did in the case of poland and permit the thing with protest only from one sovereign person and from him i should guess not much does kaunitz expect serious opposition from friedrich of prussia to whom no enlargement of austria can be matter of indifference but cannot we perhaps make it worth his while thinks kaunitz tush he is old and broken thought to be dying has an absolute horror of war he too will sit quiet or we must make it worth his while in this calculation kaunitz deceived himself we are now shortly to see how  kaunitzs case when he brings it before the reich and general public of mankind and its gazetteers will by no means prove to be a strong one his law title is this  archduke albert v of austria subsequently kaiser albert ii had married elizabeth only daughter of kaiser sigismund supergrammaticam albert is he who got three crowns in one year hungary bohemia romish reich and we hope a fourth say the old historians which was a heavenly and eternal onedied in short 1439 age forty from him come the now kaisers  in 1426 thirteen years before this event of the crowns sigismund grammaticam had infeoffed him in a thing still of shadowy naturethe expectancy of a straubingen princedom pleasant extensive district only not yet fallen or like falling vacant you shall inherit you and yours who are also my own so soon as this present line of wittelsbachers die said kaiser sigismund solemnly in two solemn sheepskins not a whit of it would the wittelsbachers have answered had they known of the affair when we die out there is another line of wittelsbachers plenty of other lines and housetreaties many and old settling all that without help of you and albert of the three crowns and accordingly there had never come the least fruit or attempt at fruit from these two sigismund sheepskins which were still lying in the vienna archives where they had lain since the creation of them known to an antiquary or two but not even by them thought worthy of mention in this busy world this was literally all the claim that austria had and every bystander admitted it to be in itself not worth a rush  in itself perhaps not thought kaunitz but the free consent of karl theodor the heir will not that be a title in full one would hope so in the present state of europe france england russia every nation weltering overhead in its own troubles and affairs little at leisure for ours and it is with karl theodor to make out a full title for himself there that kaunitz has been secretly busy this long time back especially in the late critical days of poor kurfurst max  karl theodor of the pfalz now fallen heir to baiern is a poor idle creature of purely egoistic ornamental dilettante nature sunk in theatricals bastard children and the like much praised by voltaire who sometimes used to visit him and by collini to whom he is a kind master karl theodor cares little for the integrity of baiern much for that of his own skin very long ago in 1742 in poor kaiser karls coronation time we saw him wedded him and another to two fair sister sulzbach princesses supra viii 119 granddaughters of old karl philip the then kurpfalz whom he has inherited it was the last act of that neverresting old karl philip of whom we used to hear so much karl theodor to have one of my inestimable granddaughters duke clement younger brother of our blessed new kaiser to have another thereby we unite the kindred branches of the pfalzbaiern families and make the assurance of the heritages doubly sure said old karl philip and died happy or the happiest he could  readers no doubt have forgotten this circumstance and in their total lack of interest in karl theodor and his paltry affairs may as well be reminded of itand furthermore that these brilliant young wives duchess clement especially called on wilhelmina during the frankfurt gayeties and were a charm to kaiser karl albert striving to look forward across clouds into a glittering future for his house theodors princess brought him no children she and her sister are both still living a lone woman the latter duke clement dead these seven yearsa still more lone the former with such a husband yet living lone women both well forward in the fifties active souls i should guess at least to judge by duchess clement who being a dowager and mistress of her movements is emphatic in denouncing such disaster and disgrace and plays a great part at munchen in the agitating scenes now on hand comes out like a noble amazon say the admiring bystanders on this occasion stirs whatever faculty she has especially her tongue and goes on urging pushing and contriving all she can regardless of risks in such an imminency  karl theodor finds his heritages indisputable but he has no legitimate son to leave them to and has many illegitimate whom austria can provide forand richly will his heir is a nephew karl august christian of zweibruck whom perhaps it would not be painful to him to disappoint a little of his high expectations on the whole peace plentiful provision titular and other for his illegitimates and a comfortable sum of ready money over to enliven the theatricals dusseldorf picturegalleries and dilettante operations and collectionshow much welcomer to theodor than a baiern never so religiously saved entire at the expense of quarrel which cannot but be tedious troublesome and dangerous honor indeedbut what to an old stager in the dilettante line is honor old stagers there are who will own to you like balzacs englishman in a case of conflagration when honor called on all men to take their buckets mais je nai point dhonneur to whom unluckily you cannot answer as in that case cest egal t is all one do as if you had some karl theodor scandalously left baiern to its fate  karl theodors heir poor august christian of zweibruck had of course his own gloomy thoughts on this parcelling of his bavarian reversion but what power has he none he thinks but to take the inevitable patiently nor generally in the princes of the reich though one would have thought them personally concerned were it only for danger of a like mistreatment was there any emotion publicly expressed or the least hope of help perhaps prussia will quarrel about it think they austria prussia in any of their quarrels we get only crushed better to keep out of it we well out of it the more they quarrel and fight the better for us england in the shape of hanover would perhaps have made some effort to interfere provided france did on either side i incline to thinkthat is to say on the side opposite to france but poor england is engaged with its melancholy american war france on the point of breaking out into alliance with the insurrection there neither france nor england did interfere france is sinking into bankruptcy intent to have a navy before most things to assist the cause of human liberty over seas withal and become a sublime spectacle and a ruin to englandnot as in the pittchoiseul time but by that improved method russia again involved in turk business looks on with now and then a big word thrown out on the one side and the othermunchen in the interval we can fancy what an agitated city one note says  kurfurst max joseph being dead 30th december 1777 privy councillor johann euchar von obermayr favorite and factotum minister of the deceased opened the chatoulle princely safe or case of preciosities took from it the act which already lay prepared for homaging and solemn instalment of karl theodor kurpfalz as heir of baiern with immediate intent to execute the same euchar orders strict closure of the towngates the soldiery to draw out and beset all streetsespecially that street where imperial majestys ambassador lives rank close with your backs to that house orders euchar and the instant anybody stirs to come out sound your drums and at the same instant let the rearmost rank of you without looking round for one would not give offence unless imperative smite the butts of their muskets to the ground ready for firing if imperative nobody i think stirred out from that austrian excellencys house in any case obermayr completed his act without the least protest or trouble from anybody and karl theodor almost to his terror for he meant to sell and satisfy austria by no means to resist or fight the paltry old creature careful of self and skin only saw himself solemnly secured by all forms of law in all the lands of the deceased fischer

munchen regensburg vienna are loud with pleading protocolling but it is not there that the crisis of the game will be found to lie  friedrich has for some time back especially since the late kurbaierns illness understood that austria always eager for a clutch at baiern had something of that kind in view but his first positive news of it was a letter from duchess clement date january 3d which by the detail of facts unveiled to his quick eye the true outline extent and nature of this enterprise of austrias enterprise which he could not but agree with duchess clement was one of great concernment not to baiern alone must be withstood prevented at whatever risk thought friedrich on the instant the new elector karl theodor he probably is dead to the matter but one ought to ask him if he answer dead then ask his heir have you no life to it heir is a gallant enough young gentleman of endless pedigree but small possessions karl august christian karl ii in official style duke of zweibruckbirkenfeld karl theodors eldest nephew friedrich judges that he probably will have haggled to sign any austrian convention for dismembering baiern and that he will start into life upon it so soon as he sees hope  a messenger to him to karl theodor and him thinks friedrich a messenger instantly and who for that clearly is the first thing and a delicate thing it is requiring to be done in profoundest secrecy by hint and innuendo rather than speech by somebody in a cloak of darkness who is of adroit quality and was never heard of in diplomatic circles before not to be suspected of having business of mine on hand friedrich bethinks him that in a late visit to weimar he had noticed for his fine qualities a young gentleman named gortz eustace von gortz preuss iv 92 n c late tutor to the young duke karl august whom readers know as goethes friend a wise firm adroitlooking young gentleman who was farther interesting as brother to lieutenantgeneral von gortz a respectable soldier of friedrichs extutor at weimar we say and idle for the moment hanging about court there till he should find a new function  of this extutor friedrich bethinks him and in the course of that same dayfor there is no delayfriedrich who is at berlin beckons general gortz to come over to him from potsdam instantly hither this evening and in all privacy meet me in the palace at such an hour hour of midnight or thereby which of course gortz duly invisible to mankind does friedrich explains an errand to munchen perfectly secret for the moment and requiring great delicacy and address perhaps not without risk a timorous man might say will your brother go for me think you gortz thinks he will here is his instruction if so adds the king handing him an autograph of the necessary outline of procedurenot signed nor with any credential or even specific address lest accident happen adieu then herr generallieutenant rule is shoes of swiftness cloak of darkness adieu and gortz senior is off on the instant careering towards weimar where he finds gortz junior and makes known his errand gortz junior stares in the natural astonishment but after some intense brief deliberation becomes affirmative and in a minimum of time is ready and on the road  gortz junior proved to have been an excellent choice on the kings part and came to good promotion afterwards by his conduct in this affair gortz junior started for munchen on the instant masked utterly or his business masked from profane eyes saw this person saw that and glided swiftly about swiftly and with sure aim and speedily kindled the matter and had smoke rising in various points and before january was out saw the reichsdiet at regensburg much more the general gazetteerage everywhere seized of this affair and thrown into paroxysms at the size and complexion of it saw in fact a world getting into flamekindled by whom or what nobody could guess for a long time to come gortz had great running about in his cloak of darkness and showed abundant talent of the kind needed a pushing cleareyed stouthearted man much cleverness and sureness in what he did and forbore to do his adventures were manifold he had much travelling about was at regensburg at mannheim saw many persons whom he had to judge of on the instant and speak frankly to or speak darkly or speak nothing and he made no mistake one of his best counsellors i gather was duchess clement of course it was not long till duchess clement heard some inkling of him till in some of his goings and comings he saw duchess clement who hailed him as an angel of light in one journey more mysterious than ever he was three days invisible in duchess clements gardenhouse ah madame que netiezvous electeur why were not you elector writes friedrich to her once we should not have seen those shameful events which every good german must blush for to the bottom of his heart dont tout bon allemand doit rougir jusquau fond du coeur preuss iv 94  we cannot afford the least narrative of gortz and his courses imagination from a few traits will sufficiently conceive them he had gone first to karl theodors minister dead to it i fear has already signed alas yes upon which to zweibruck the heirs minister whom his master had distinctly ordered to sign but who at his own peril gallant man delayed remonstrated had not yet done it and was able to answer alive to it he yes with a witness were there hope in the worldwhich threw gortz upon instant gallop towards zweibruck schloss in search of said heir the young duke august christian who however had left in the interim summoned by his uncle on austrian urgency to consent along with him but whom gortz by dexterity and intuition of symptoms caught up by the road with what a mutual joy as had been expected august christian on sight of gortz with an armed friedrich looming in the distance took at once into new courses and activities from him no consent now far other treaty with friedrich flat refusal ever to consent application to the reich application even to france and whatever a gallant young fellow could do  it was by friedrichs order that he applied to france his younger brother max joseph was a soldier there and strove to back him in official and other circleswho were all friendly even zealous for him and gave good words but had nothing more this french department of the business was long a delay to friedrichs operations and in result poor maxs industry there do what he could proved rather a minus quantity than otherwise a good young man they say but not the man to kindle into action horses that are deadof which he had experience more than once in time coming he is the same that 30 years after having survived his childless elder brother became king max first king of baiern begot ludwig second kingwho for his part has begotten otho king of greece and done other feats still less worth mentioning august christians behavior is praised as excellentpassively firm and polite the grand requisite persistence on your ground of nobut his luck to find such a friedrich and also to find such a gortz was the saving clause for him  friedrich was in very weak health in these months still considered by the gazetteers to be dying but it appears he is not yet too weak for taking on the instant necessary a worldimportant resolution and of being on the road with it to this issue or to that at full speed before the day closed desist good neighbor i beseech you you must desist and even you shall this resolution was entirely his own as were the equally prompt arrangements he contrived for executing it should hard come to hard and austria prefer war to doing justice excellent methods say the most unfriendly judges which must at once have throttled austria into compliance had he been as prompt in executing themwhich he by no means was and there lies his error and failure very lamentable excusable only by decrepitude of body producing weakness and decay of mind this is emphatically and wearisomely schmettaus opinion f w c graf van schmettau this is the elder schmettaus son not the dresdeners whom we used to quote feldzug der preussischen armee in bohmen im jahre

who looks at it only as a military adjutant intent on honor and rapid feats of warwith how much reason readers not prussian or military shall judge as we go on  saxony we ought to mention was also aggrieved the dowagerelectress maria antoinette our sprightly friend had as sole surviving sister of the late kurfurst max the undoubted heirship of kurfurst maxs allodial properties and territories territories i think mainly in the oberpfalz which are not bavaria proper but were acquired in the thirtyyears war which are important in value and which austria regardless of our lively friend has laid hold of as lapsed fiefs of bohemia clearly bohemian says austria and keeps hold our lively friend hereupon makes over all her rights in that matter to her son the reigning elector with the counsel if counsel were needed ask protection of king friedrich go wholly with king friedrich mecklenburg too has an interest among the lapsed fiefs is one to a duchy called of leuchtenbergin regard to which says mecklenburg as loud as it can that duchy is not lapsed at all that is now mine witness this document of a valid testamentary nature other claims were put in but these three zweibruck endlessly important saxony important too though not in such degree mecklenburg unimportant but justwere alone recognized in impartial quarters as authentic and worthy of notice  of the pleadings and procedures in the reichs diet no reader would permit me to speak were i inclined enough to understand that they went on in the usual voluminous dulldroning way crescendo always and deserve what at present they are sure of oblivion from all creatures the important thing was not those pleadings in the reichs diet nor the austrian proposals there or elsewhere but the brandishing of arms in emitting and also in successively answering the same answer always no by friedrich and some new flash of handled armsthe physiognomy of which was the one significant point austria which is far from ready with arms though at each fresh pleading or proposal it tries to give a kind of brandish says mainly three things in essence somewhat thus austria cannot two states of the reich come to a mutual understanding as austria and bavaria have done and what have third parties to say to it friedrich much parties of the reich have much to say to it this several times with variations austria our rights seem to us valid zweibruck saxony mecklenburg if aggrieved can try in the reichs lawcourts friedrich lawcourts with a new brandish that is sets more regiments on march from pommern to wesel all on march to berlin to silesia towards the bohemian frontier austria by the voice of kaunitz we will not give up our rights without sentence of law we cannot recognize the king of prussia as lawjudge in this matter friedrich the king of prussia is of the jury  pulse after pulse this is something like the course things had crescendo till in about three months they got to a height which was evidently serious nay in the course of the pleadings it became manifest that on the austrian grounds of claim not maria theresa could be heir to straubingen but friedrich himself i descend from threecrown alberts daughter said maria theresa and i from an elder daughter of his and do not claim friedrich could have answered but did not treating such claim all along as merely colorable and chimerical not worth attention in serious affairs of fact till at length after about three months there comes a really serious brandish  sunday april 5th 1778 at berlin friedrich holds review of his army all assembled equipped and in readiness and in that upper paroleroom of the schloss makes this speech which not without extraneous intention was printed in the newspapers  friedrichs speech to his generals gentlemen i have assembled you here for a public object most of you like myself have often been in arms along with one another and are grown gray in the service of our country to all of us is well known in what dangers toils and renown we have been fellowsharers i doubt not in the least that all of you as myself have a horror of bloodshed but the danger which now threatens our countries not only renders it a duty but puts us in the absolute necessity to adopt the quickest and most effectual means for dissipating at the right time the storm which threatens to break out on us  i depend with complete confidence on your soldierly and patriotic zeal which is already well and gloriously known to me and which while i live i will acknowledge with the heartiest satisfaction before all things i recommend to you and prescribe as your most sacred duty that in every situation you exercise humanity on unarmed enemies and be continually attentive that in this respect too there be the strictest discipline mannszucht kept among those under you  to travel with the pomp of a king is not among my wishes and all of you are aware that i have no pleasure in rich fieldfurniture but my increasing age and the weakness it brings render me incapable of riding as i did in my youth i shall therefore be obliged to make use of a postchaise in times of marching and all of you have liberty to do the same but on the day of battle you shall see me on horseback and there also i hope my generals will follow that example  voltaire smothered under roses kings speech was on sunday april 5th evening of last monday march 30th at the theatre francais in paris poor voltaire had that worldfamous apotheosis of his and got smothered under roses as he termed it he had left ferney such the urgency of niece denis and her unappeasable desire for a sight of paris again february 5th arrived in paris february 10th ventured out to see his poor last tragedy not till the sixth night of it march 30th was beshouted crowned raised to the immortal gods by a repentant paris world greatest of menyou were not a miscreant and malefactor then on the contrary you were a spiritual hercules a heroic son of light slayer of the nightmare monsters and foul dragons and devils that were preying on us to you shall not we now say long life with all our throats and all our heartsand so quench you at last which they managed to do poor repentant souls the tottering wayworn voltaire overagitated in this way took to bed never rose again and on that day two months was dead in duvernet and still better in longchamp et wagniere ample account of these interesting occurrences his light all done to king friedrich or to any of us no flash of radiancy from him any more forever  april 6th friedrich gets on marchperhaps about 100000 strongfor schonwalde in the neisseschweidnitz neighborhood and there in the course of the week has cantoned himself and sits completing his magazines and appliances for actual work of war this is a considerable brandish and a good deal astonishes kaunitz and the vienna people who have not 10000 at present on those frontiers and nothing whatever in a state of readiness dangerous really kaunitz admits and sets new regiments on march from hungary from the netherlands from all ends of the earth where they are tempers his own insolent talk too but strives to persuade himself that it is menace merely he wont he abhors war kaunitz had hardly exaggerated friedrichs abhorrence of war though it turned out there were things which friedrich abhorred still more  schonwalde headquarter of this alarming prussian cantonment is close on the new fortress of silberberg a beautiful new impregnability looking into those valleys of the warta of the young neisse which are the road to bohemia or from itwhere the pandour torrents used to issue into the first silesian wars where friedrich himself was once to have been snapped up but was not quiteand only sang mass as extempore abbot with tobias stusche in the monastery of camenz according to the myth which readers may remember no more can pandours issue that way only prussians can enter in friedrichs windows in the schloss of schonwaldewhich are on the left hand if you be touring in those partslook out direct upon silberberg and have its battlements between them and the 3oclock sun schoning iv introductory part in the town of silberberg friedrich has withal a modest little lodginglodging still knownwhere he can alight for an hour or a night in the multifarious businesses that lead him to and fro a beautiful place says schoning where the king stayed twelve weeks or more waiting till the bavarianaustrian case should ripen better at schonwalde what was important in his private circle he heard of lord marischals death then of voltaires not to mention that of english pitt and perhaps others interesting to him voltaire died may 30th marischal may 25th pitt may 11thand may 4th in the cantonment here died general von rentzel the same who as lieutenant rentzel sixty years ago had taught the little crownprince his drill rodenbeck iii 187  now was the time cry schmettau and the unfavorable when he might have walked across into eastern bohemia into mahren whither you like to vienna itself and taken austria by the throat at discretion do justice then will you let go bavaria or in his young years would not he have done so his plan long since laid down was grand to march into mahren leaving silesia guarded nay leaving bohemia to be invadedfor prince henri and the saxons who are a willing handful and will complete henri likewise to 100000 were to do that feat the whilemarch into mahren on to vienna if he chose laying all flat infallible say the schmettau people he had the fire of head to contrive it all but worn down and grown old he could not execute his great thoughts which is obviously absurd friedrichs object not being to lay austria flat or drive animosities to the sanguinary point and kindle all europe into war but merely to extract with the minimum of violence something like justice from austria on this bavarian matter for which end he may justly consider slow pressure preferable to the cutting method his problem is most ticklish not allowed for by schmettau  the encampment round schonwalde especially as there was nothing ready thereabouts on the austrian side produced a visible and great effect on the negotiations and notably altered the high kaunitz tone towards friedrich must two great courts quarrel then for the sake of a small one murmured kaunitz plaintively now to himself and to the kingto the king not in a very distinct manner though to himself the principle is long since clear as an axiom in politics great courts should understand one another then the small would be less troublesome for a quarter of a century this has been the kaunitz faith in 1753 when he miraculously screwed round the french into union with the austrians to put down an upstart prussia this was his grand fulcrum the immovable rock in which the great engineer fixed down his political capstans and levered and screwed he did triumphantly wind matters roundthough whether they much profited him when round may be a question  but the same grand principle in the later instance of partitioning poland has it not proved eminently triumphant successful in all points and doubtless this king of prussia recognizes it if made worth his while thinks kaunitz in a word kaunitzs next utterance is wonderfully changed the great engineer speaks almost like a bishop on this new text let the two courts says he put themselves each in the others place each think what it would want and in fact each in a christian manner try to do as it would be done by how touching in the mouth of a kaunitz with something of pathos of plaintiveness almost of unction in it there is no other method of agreeing urges he war is a terrible method disliked by both of us austria wishes this of bavaria but his prussian majestys turn will come perhaps now is let him say and determine we will make it worth his while this is of april 24th notable change since the cantoning round schonwalde  germany at large though it lay so silent in its bedrid condition was in great anxiety never had the holy romish reich such a shock before meaning to partition us like poland thought the reich with a shudder they can by degrees if they think good these two great sovereigns courage your durchlauchts one of the two great ones has not that in his thoughts has and will have the reverse of that which will be your anchorages in the storms of fate for a long time to come nor was itas will shortly appear to readerskaunitzs immediate intention at all enough if poor we can begin it set it fairly under way let some unborn happier kaunitz the last of a series complete such blessed consummation in a happier time far over the practical horizon at present this we do gather to have been kaunitzs real view and it throws a light on the vexed partitionofpoland question and gives weight to dohms assertion that kaunitz was the actual beginner there  weeks before friedrich heard of this remarkable memorial and ten days before it was brought to paper there came to friedrich another unexpected remarkable document a letter from kaiser joseph himself who is personally running about in these parts over in bohemia endeavoring to bring army matters to a footing and is no doubt shocked to find them still in such backwardness with a friedrich at hand the kaisers letter we perceive is pilotballoon to the kaunitz episcopal document and to an actual meeting of prussian and austrian ministers on the bavarian point and had been seen to be a salutary measure by an austria in alarm it asks as the kaunitz memorial will though in another style must there be war then is there no possibility left in negotiation and mutual concession i am your majestys friend and admirer let us try this was an unexpected and doubtless a welcome thing to friedrich who answers eagerly and in a noble style both of courtesy and of business sense upon which there followed two other imperial letters with their two royal answers in oeuvres de frederic vi 183193 three successive letters from the kaiser of dates olmutz litau konigsgratz 13th19th april 1778 with kings answers schonwalde all of them and 14th20th apriltotally without interest to the general reader and directly afterwards the small austrianprussian congress we spoke of finkenstein and hertzberg on the prussian part cobenzl on the austrian congress sitting at berlin which tried to agree but could not and to which kaunitzs memorial of april 24th was meant as some helpful sprinkling of presidential quasiepiscopal oil  oil merely for it turned out kaunitz had no thought at present of partitioning the german reich with friedrich but intended merely to keep his own seized portion of baiern and in return for friedrichs assent intended to recompense friedrich within fact with austrias consent that if anspach and baireuth lapsed home to prussia as it was possible they might the present margraf friedrichs nephew the ladycraven margraf having a childless wife prussia should freely open the door to them a thing which friedrich naturally maintained to be in need of nobodys consent and to lie totally apart from this question but which austria always considered a very generous thing and always returned to with new touches of improvement as their grand recipe in this matter so that unhappily the hertzbergcobenzl treatyings kaisers letters and kaunitzs episcopal oil were without effectexcept to gain for the austrians who infinitely needed it delay of above two months the letters are without general interest but for friedrichs sake perhaps readers will consent to a specimen here are parts of his first letter people meaning to be kings which i doubt none of my readers are could not do better than read it and again read it and acquire that style first of knowing thoroughly the object in hand and then of speaking on it and of being silent on it in a true and noble manner   friedrich to his imperial majesty at olmutz  schonwalde 14th april 1778  sire my brotheri have received with all the satisfaction possible the letter which your imperial majesty has had the goodness to write to me i have neither minister nor clerk scribe about me therefore your imperial majesty will be pleased to put up with such answer as an old soldier can give who writes to you with probity and frankness on one of the most important subjects which have risen in politics for a long time  nobody wishes more than i to maintain peace and harmony between the powers of europe but there are limits to everything and cases so intricate epineux arise that goodwill alone will not suffice to maintain things in repose and tranquillity permit me sire to state distinctly what the question seems to me to be it is to determine if an emperor can dispose at his will of the fiefs of the empire answer in the affirmative and all these fiefs become timars in the turk way which are for life only and which the sultan disposes of again on the possessors death now this is contrary to the laws to the customs and constitutions of the german empirei as member of the empire and as having by the treaty of hubertsburg resanctioned the peace of westphalia find myself formally engaged to support the immunities the liberties and rights of the germanic body  this sire is the veritable state of things personal interest i have none but i am persuaded your majestys self would regard me as a paltry man unworthy of your esteem should i basely sacrifice the rights immunities and privileges which the electors and i have received from our ancestors  i continue to speak to your majesty with the same frankness i love and honor your person it will certainly be hard for me to fight against a prince gifted with excellent qualities and whom i personally esteem butand is there no remedy anspach and baireuth stand in no need of sanction i consent to the congress proposedbeing with the c cf oeuvres de frederic vi 187  the sittings of this little congress at berlin lasted all through may and june to the disgust of schmettau and the ardent prussian messrooms lying ready here and forbidden to act for the austrians all the while were at their busiest improving the moments marching continually hitherward from hungary from limburg from all ends of the earth both negotiating parties had shown a manifest wish to terminate without war and both made various attempts or proposals that way friedrich offering in the name of european peace to yield the austrians some small rim or paring of bavaria from the edge adjoining them the austrians offering anspachbaireuth with some improvementsalways offering friedrich his own baireuthanspach with some new sauce as that he might exchange those territories with saxony for a fine equivalent in the lausitz contiguous to him which was a real improvement and increasebut as neither party would in the least give up in essentials or quit the ground it had taken the result was nothing week after week so many weeks are being lost to friedrich gained to austria schmettau getting more and more disgusted  friedrich still waited not in all points quite ready yet he said nor the futile diplomacies quite completeevidently in the highest degree unwilling to come to the cutting point and begin a war which nobody could see the end of many things he tried peace so precious to him try and again try all through june too this went on the result always zeroobviously certain to be so as even friedrich had at last to own to himself and likewise that the campaign season was ebbing away and that if his grand moravian scheme was to be tried on austria there was not now a moment to lose  friedrichs ultimate proposal new modification of what all his proposals had been to you some thin rim of baiern to saxony and mecklenburg some etcetera of indemnity money chiefly money always to be paid by karl theodor who has left baiern open to the spoiler in this scandalous manner was of june 13th austrians for

fine ground and in number somewhat superior to the kingthe austrians in all counting about 250000 of whom lacy has considerably the larger share the terror at vienna nevertheless is very great a day of terror says one who was there i will not trust myself to describe the sensation which this news friedrich in bohemia again produced among all ranks of people cogniazzo iv 316 320 321 preuss iv 101

others her letters four in all with their appendixes and the kings answers in oeuvres de frederic vi 196200  schmettau says friedrich cheated of his mahren schemes was still in time the austrian position being indeed strong but not being even yet quite ready friedrich himself however on reconnoitring thought differently a position such as one never saw before thinks he contrived by lacy masterly use of the ground of the rivers of the rocks woods swamps elbe and his branches and the intricate shoulders of the giant mountains no man could have done it better than lacy here who they say is the contriver and practical hand oeuvres de frederic vi 147 from konigsgratz northward by konigshof by arnau up to hohenelbe all heights are crowned all passes bristling with cannon rivers aupa

taken time to deliberate delve and invest but it is done near fifty miles of it here clear to your glass has the head of lacy visibly emerged on us as if for survey of phenomenahead of lacy sure enough body of him lying invisible in the heights passes and points of vantage and its neck of fifty miles like the neck of a warhorse clothed with thunder on which thinks schmettau privately you may too late make your reflections  schmettau asserts that the position though strong was nothing like so infinitely strong and that friedrich in his younger days would very soon have assaulted it and turned lacy inside out but friedrich we know had his reasons against hurry he reconnoitred diligently rode out reconnoitring fifteen miles the first day july 6th ditto the second and following and was nearly shot by croatsby one specific croat says prussian mythology supported by engraving an old engraving which i have never seen represents friedrich reconnoitring those fiveandtwenty miles of elbe which have so many redoubts on their side of it and swarm with croat parties on both sides this is all the truth that is in the engraving rodenbeck p 188 fact says friedrich on the 8th if that were all the variation was a mark for the austrian sharpshooters for half an hour myth says and engraves it with the date of july 7th friedrich skirting some thicket suddenly came upon a single croat with musket levelled at him wild creatures finger just on the triggerand quietly admonishing friedrich lifts his finger with a du du ah you upon which such the divinity that hedges one the wild creature instantly flings down his murderweapon and kneeling embraces the kings bootwith kisses for anything i know it is certain friedrich about six times over in this paltry war or quasi nowar set his attendants on the tremble was namely from croateries and artilleries in imminent peril of life so careless was he and dangerous to speak to in his sour humor humor very sour they say for most part being in reality altogether backward and loath for grand enterprise and yet striving to think he was not ashamed that any war of his should be a nowar schmettau says  on the day of getting into jaromirtz july 8th the king tired of riding about while the columns were slowly getting in lay down on the ground with his adjutants about him a young officer came riding past whom the king beckoned to himwrote something with pencil an order not of the least importance and said here that order to general lossow and tell him he is not to take it ill that i trouble him as i have none in my suite that can do anything let the suite take it as they can a most pungent severe old king quite perverse at times thinks schmettau thus again more than once  on arriving with his column where the officer a perfectly skilful man had marked out the camp the king would lift his spyglass gaze to right and left riding round the place at perhaps a hundred yards distance and begin sieht er herr but look herr what a botching you have made of it again was er da wieder fur dumm zeug gemacht hat and grumbling and blaming would alter the camp till it was all out of rule and then say see there that is the way to mark out camps schmettau xxv 30 24  in a weeks time july 13th came another fine excuse for inaction plenipotentiary thugut namely and the kaiserinns letter which we spoke of autograph from maria theresa herself inspired by the terror of vienna and of her beautiful motherly heart negotiation to be private utterly my son the kaiser knows nothing of it i beg the most absolute secrecy which was accordingly kept while thugut with finkenstein and hertzberg again held congress of braunau in those neighborhoodswith as little effect as ever thuguts name it seems was originally tunicotto tyroleseitalian which the ignorant vienna people changed into thunichtgut donogood till maria theresa in very charity struck out the negative and made him dogood dogood and his congress held friedrich till august 10th five more weeks gone and nothing but reconnoitringwith of course foraging and diligently eating the country which is a daily employment and produces fencing and skirmishing enough  henri in the interim has invaded from the west seen leitmeritz lobositzprag nobility all running and i suppose prayers to st titus going againand loudon in alarm loudon however saved prag by two masterly positions not mentionable here upon which henri took camp at niemes loudon the weaker in this part seizing the iser as a bulwark and ranking himself behind it backtoback of lacy here for about five weeks sat henri nothing on hand but to eat the country over the heads of loudon and lacy as the crow flies henris camp may be about 70 miles from jaromirtz where the king is hussar belling our old antiswede friend a brilliant cutting man broke over the iser once perhaps twice and there was pretty fencing by him and the like of him but prince henri did nothing says the king oeuvres de frederic vi 154was in fact helping the king to do nothing by the 10th of september as henri has computed this country will be eaten forage i find will be quite done here on september 10th writes henri after a week or twos experience  there was always talk of henri and the king who are 100000 each joining hands by the post of arnau or some weak point of lacys well north of konigsgratz thus of cutting off the mealcarts of that backtoback copartnery and so of tumbling it off the ground which was perfectly possible says schmettau and small detachments and expeditious were pushed out general dahlwig general anhalt partly for that object but not the least of it ever took effect futile lost by loitering as all else was groans schmettau prince henri was averse to attempt intimates the kingas indeed though refusing to own it was i september 10th my forage will be out your majesty says henri always a punctual calculating man  the austrians on their side were equally stagnant and except the continual skirmishing with the prussian foragers undertook nothing shamefully illclone our foraging too exclaims schmettau again and again had we done it with neatness with regularity the country would have lasted us twice as long doing it headlong wastefully and by the ruleofthumb the country was a desert all its inhabitants fled all its edibles consumed before six weeks were over friedrich is not now himself at all in great things or in little what a changed friedrich exclaims schmettau with wearisome iteration  from about august 6th or especially august 10th when the mariatheresa correspondence or congress of braunau ended likewise in zero friedrich became impatient for actual junction with prince henri actual push of business and began to hint of an excellent plan he had burst through on their left flank blow up their post of hohenelbe yonder thence is but one march to iser river junction with prince henri there and a lacy and a loudon tumbled to the winds a plan perfectly feasible says schmettau which solaced the kings humor but which he never really intended to execute possibly not otherwise according to old wont he would have forborne to speak of it beforehand at all events august 15th in the feeling that one ought really to do something the rather as forage hereabouts was almost or altogether running out he actually set about this grand scheme  got on march to rightward namely up the aupa river through the gloomy chasms of kingdomwood memorable in old days had his bakery shifted to trautenau his heavy cannon getting tugged through the mire and the rains which by this time were abundant towards hohenelbe for the great enterprise and sat encamped on and about the battleground of sohr for a week or so waiting till all were forward eating sohr country which was painfully easy to do the austrians did next to nothing on him but the rains the mud and scarcity were doing much getting on to hohenelbe region after a weeks wet waiting he on ocular survey of the ground about was heard to say this cannot be done then had never meant to do it sneers schmettau and only wanted some excuse which is very likely schmettau gives an anecdote of him here in regard to a certain hill the key of the austrian position which the king was continually reconnoitring and lamenting the enormous height of impossible so high one of the adjutants took his theodolite ascertained the height and by way of comforting his majesty reported the exact number of feet above their present level how do you know herr said the king angrily measured it by trigonometry your majestytrigonometry scher er sich zum teufel off with you sir to the devil your trigonometry and youno believer in mathematics this king  he was loath to go and laid the blame on many things were prince henri now but across the iser had that stupid anhalt when he was upon it galloping about to the ruin of his head only seized arnau arnau and its elbebridge and had it in hand for junction with prince henri in fine just as the last batch of heavy cannontwenty or thirty hungered horses to a gun at the rate of five miles a day in roads unspeakablewere getting in he ordered them all to be dragged back back to the trautenau road whither we must now all go and september 8th in perfect order for the austrians little molested him and got a bad bargain when they did the great friedrich with his whole army got on march homeward after such a campaign as we see climbed the trautenaulandshut pass with nothing of effective loss except from the rainy elements the steep miry ways and the starved horses draughthorses especially starvedwhom poor creatures you would see spring at the ropes draughtharness thirty of them to a gun when started and geehod to tug violently with no effect and fall down in whole rows  prince henri forage done started punctually september 10th two days after his brother and with little or no pursuit from the austrians and with horses unstarved got home in comparatively tolerable circumstances cantoned himself in dresden neighborhood and sat waiting he had never approved this war and now i suppose would not want for reflections friedrichs cantonments were round landshut and spread out to right and to left from glatz country and the uppersilesian hills to silberberg and schweidnitzhis own quarter is the same region where he lay so long in summer 1759 talking on learned subjects with the late quintus icilius if readers remember and wearily waiting till cunctator daun likewise now deceased took his stand or his seat at mark lissa and the king could follow him to schmottseifen friedrich himself on this present occasion stayed at schatzlar as rearguard to see whether the austrians would not perhaps try to make some winter campaign of it and if so whether they would attempt on prince henri or on him the austrians did not attempt on either showed no such intentionthough mischievous enough in other small ways friedrich wrote the eloge of voltaire oeuvres de frederic vii 50 et seq finished nov 26th 1778 while he waited here at schatzlar among the rainy mountains later on as prospects altered he was much at breslau or running about on civic errands with breslau as centre at breslau he had many dialogues with professor garvein whose good but oppressively solemn little book more a dulldroning preachment than a narrative no reader need look for them or for him  as to the eulogy of voltaire we may say that it is generous ingenious succinct and of dialect now obsolete to us there was and is though suppressed another eulogy brandnew by a contemporary of our ownfrom which i know not if readers will permit me a sentence or two in this pause among the rainy mountains   a wonderful talent lay in this manin voltaire to wit such an intellect the sharpest swiftest of the world thinks our contemporary fathoming you the deepest subject to a depth far beyond most mens soundings and coming up with victory and something wise and logically speakable to say on it sooner than any other mannever doubting but he has been at the bottom which is from three to ten miles lower wonderful talent but observe always if you look closely it was in essence a mere talent for speech which talent bavius and maevius and the jew apella may admire without looking behind it but this eulogist by no means will speech my friend if your sublime talent of speech consists only in making ignorance appear to be knowledge and little wisdom appear to be much i will thank you to walk on with it and apply at some other shop the quantity of shops where you can apply with thricegolden advantage from the morning newspapers to the national senate is tremendous at this epoch of the poor worlds historygo i request you and while his foot is on the stairs descending from my garret i think o unfortunate fellowcreature in an unfortunate world why is not there a friedrich wilhelm to elect you as he did gundling to his tobacco parliament and there set fassmann upon you with the pans of burning peat it were better even for yourself wholesomely didactic to your poor self i cannot doubt and for the poor multitudes to whom you are now to be sacred vates speaking and singing your dismal gundlingiana as if inspired by heaven how infinitely bettercourage courage i discern across these hideous jargons the reign of greater silence approaching upon repentant men reign of greater silence i say or else that of annihilation which will be the most silent of all  voltaire if not a great man is a remarkably peculiar one and did such a work in these ages as will render him long memorable more or less he kindled the infinite dry dungheap of things set it blazing heavenhighand we all thought in the french revolution time it would burn out rapidly into ashes and then there would a clear upper firmament if over a blackened earth be once more vouchsafed us the flame is now done as i once said and only the dull dungheap smokily burning but not now blazing remainsfor it was very damp except on the surface and is by nature slow of combustionwho knows but it may have to burn for centuries yet poisoning by its villanous malodors the lifeatmosphere of all men eternal author of this universe whose throne is truth to whom all the true are sons wilt thou not look down upon us thentill this sad process is complete voltaire is like to be very memorable  to friedrich the winter was in general tranquil a friedrich busy preparing all things for his grand mahren enterprise and for real work next year by and by there came to be real peaceprospects instead meanwhile the austrians do try a little in the small pandour way to dislodge him from the uppersilesian or teschen regions where the erbprinz of brunswick is in command a man not to be pricked into gratis by pandours erbprinz accordingly provoked by their pandourings broke out at last and about zuckmantel instantly scourged them home and had peace after foiled here they next tried upon glatz get into his glatz country thena snatch of that will balance the account which was one of newspaper glory only and a certain wurmser of theirs expert in such things did burn the town of habelschwert one morning 18th january 1779 rodenbeck iii 195 schmettau c and tried farther not wisely this time a surprisal of glatz fortress itself but got smitten home by our old friend general wunsch without profit there this was the same wurmser who came to bad issues in the napoleon time afterwards a rising man then not a dim oldnewspaper ghost as now  most shameful this burning of habelschwert by way of mere bravura thinks friedrich in a time of actual treaty for peace when our congress of teschen was just struggling to get together it was the chief stroke done by the austrians in this war glorious or shameful we will not think of inquiring nor in fact of adding one word more on such a warexcept what everybody longs for that november 27th 1778 czarina catharine by her prince galitzin at vienna intervened in the matter in a lofty way and ended it czarina catharinesmall thanks to her it seems for it was friedrich that by his industries and worlddiplomacies french and other had got her turks who had been giving trouble again compesced into peace for her and indeed to friedrich or his interests though bound by treaty she had small regard in taking this step but wished merely to appear in german politics as a shejoveczarina catharine signified in high and peremptory though polite diplomatic terms at vienna imperial madam how long is such a war to last be at peace both of you or i shall however mediate if you like being the hearty friend of both copy of galitzins declaration in fischer ii 406411  do answers maria theresa whose finance is quite out whose motherly heart is almost broken though a young kaiser still prances violently and kicks against the pricks do your noble czarish majesty france too is interfering france and you will decide what is just and we will end congress of teschen met accordingly march 10th 1779 teschen in austrian silesia where we have beenrepnin as russian breteuil the frenchman cobentzl and hertzberg as austrian and prussianand may 13th in two months time not in two weeks as had been expected for there rose unexpected haggles did close everything firm as diplomacy could do it into equitable or approximately equitable finis go home you austria quit your stolen bavaria all but a rim or paring circle of burghausen since you must have something saxony mecklenburg these must be satisfied to moderate length and therewith general asyouwere  russia and france were agreed on the case and friedrich bitterly longing to have done with it had said to himself in two weeks or so but it proved far otherwise never were such hagglings provocations and unreasonable confusions as now rose the burning of habelschwert was but a type of them haggles on the part of worthless karl theodor kindled by joseph and his kaunitz kicking against the pricks haggles on saxonys part i claimed 7000000 pounds sterling and you allow me 600000 pounds better that than nothing answered friedrich haggles with mecklenburg instead of my leuchtenberg i get an improvement in my lawcourts right of judging without appeal what is that haggles with the once grateful duke of zweibruck cant part with my burghausen suppose you had had to part with your bavaria altogether in short friedrich who had gained nothing for himself but such infinity of outlay in all kinds never saw such a coil of human follies and cupidities before and had to exhaust his utmost patience submit to new losses of his own and try all his dexterities in pigdriving overjoyed at last to get out of it on any terms outlay of friedrich is about two millions sterling and above 10000 mens lives his own narrowly not included with censures criticisms provocations and botherations without end in return for which he has truly put a spoke in austrias proud wheel for this time and managed to see fair play in the reich which had seemed to him and seems a considerable thing by way of codicil austria agrees not to chicane him in regard to anspachbaireuthhow generous of austria after this experience  in reality the war was an imaginary war deserving on its own score little record anywhere to readers here requiring almost less than it has got schmettau schoning and others have been abundantly minute upon it but even to soldiers there is little either of interest or instruction to us all it yields is certain anecdotes of friedrichs temper and ways in that difficult predicament which as coming at firsthand gathered for us by punctual authentic schmettau who was constantly about him with eyes open and notebook ready have a kind of worth in the biographic point of view  the prussian soldiery of whom we see a type in schmettau were disgusted with this war and called it in allusion to the foraging a scramble for potatoes der kartoffelkrieg the potato war which is its common designation to this day the austrians in a like humor called it zwetschkenrummel say threebutton loo a game not worth playing especially not at such cost combined cost counted to have been in sumtotal 4350000 pounds and 20000 men preuss iv 115 the prussian army was full of ardor never abler for fight insists schmettau which indeed seems to have been the fact on every small occasionbut fatally forbidden to try not so fatally perhaps had schmettau looked beyond his epaulettes was not the thing by that slow method got done by the swifter method awakening a new sevenyears business how infinitely costlier might it have been  schmettaus narrative deducting the endless lamentings especially the extensive didactic digressions is very clear ocular exact and in contrast with friedrichs own is really amusing to read a schmettau giving us in his haggard light and oblique point of vision the naked truth naked and all in a shiver a friedrich striving to drape it a little and make it comfortable to himself those bits of anecdotes in schmettau clear credible as if we had seen them are so many crevices through which it is curiously worth while to look     chapter viimiller arnolds lawsuit  about the second lawreform after reading and again reading much dreary detail i can say next to nothing except that it is dated as beginning in 1776 near thirty years after coccejis in 1748 coccejis was completed in 17741775 on occasion of the silesian reviews von carmer chancellor of silesia knowing of the kings impatience at the state of law presented successively two memorials on the subject the second of which began 4th january 1776 to have visible fruit that evidently by what causes is not stated but may be readily enough conjectured in the absence of cocceji by death and of a friedrich by affairs of war the abuses of law had again become more or less unendurable to this king that said abuses did again get some reform again temporary such the law of nature which bids you sweep vigorously your kitchen though it will next moment recommence the gathering of dirt upon it and that in fine after some reluctance in the law circles and debating pro and contra oral some of it and done in the kings presence who is so intent to be convinced and see his practical way in it at potsdam 4th january 1776 debate by solemn appointment in the kings presence king very unwell between silesianchancellor von carmer and grandchancellor von furst as to the feasibility of carmers ideas old furst strong in the negativeking after reflection determining to go on nevertheless rodenbeck iii 131 133there was as supplement to the mere project or theory of a codex fredericianus in coccejis time an actual prussian code set about von carmer the silesian chancellor the chief agent and a first folio or a first and partly a second of it were brought out in friedrichs lifetime the remainder following in that of his successor which code is ever since the law of the prussian nation to this day not finished and promulgated till 5th february 1794 first volume containing prozessordnung form of procedure in all its important details had come out 26th april 1784 preuss iii 418422 of its worth as a code i have heard favorable opinions comparatively favorable but can myself say nothing famed savigny finds it superior in intelligence and lawknowledge to the code napoleonupon which indeed and upon all codes possible to poor hagridden and wigridden generations like ours savigny feels rather desperate unfortunate mortals do want to have their bits of lawsuits settled nevertheless and have on trial found even the ignorant code napoleon a mighty benefit in comparison to none  readers all see how this second prussian lawreform was a thing important to prussia of liveliest interest to the then king of prussia and were my knowledge of it greater than it is this is all i could hope to say of it that would be suitable or profitable at present let welldisposed readers take it up in their imaginations as a fact and mass of facts very serious there and then and color with it in some degree those five or six last years of this kings life  connected with this second law reform and indeed partially a source of it or provocation to go on with it mending your speed there is one little lawsuit called the miller arnold case which made an immense noise in the world and is still known by rumor to many persons who would probably be thankful as certainly i myself should for some intelligible word on it in regard to which and to which alone in this place we will permit ourselves a little more detail  in the sandy moors towards the silesian border of the neumark southwest of zullichauwhere we once were with dictator wedell fighting the russians in a tragic waythere is as was casually then indicated on one of the poor brooks trickling into oder a mill called krebsmuhle crabmill millers of which are a line of dusty arnolds laboriously for long generations grinding into meal the ryes pulses barleys of that dim region who and whose crabmill in the year 17791780 burst into a notoriety they little dreamt of and became famous in the fashionable circles of this universe where an indistinct rumor of them lives to this day we indicated arnold and his mill in wedells time wedells scene being so remote and empty to readers in fact nobody knows on what paltriest of moors a memorable thing will not happenhere for instance is withal the birthplace of that rhyming miracle frau karsch karschin karchess as they call her the berlin literary prodigy to whom friedrich was not so flush of help as had been expected the child of utterly poor peasants there whose poverty shining out as thrift unweariable industry and stoical valor is beautiful to me still more their poor little girls bits of fortunes tending three cows in the solitudes there and gazing wistfully into earth and heaven with her ingenuous little souldesiring mainly one thing that she could get books any book whatever having halfaccidentally picked up the art of reading and finding hereabouts absolutely nothing to read frau karsch i have no doubt knows the crabmill right well and can to all permissible lengths inform the berlin circles on this point see jordens karschin ii 607640 an excellent silesian nobleman lifted her miraculously from the sloughs of misery landed her from his travellingcarriage in the upper world of berlin january 1761 age then thirtynine husband karsch a wretched drunken tailor at glogau who thereupon enlisted and happily got shot or finished berlins enthusiasm was and continued to be considerablekarschins head i fear proved weakish though her rhyming faculty was great friedrich saw her once october 1763 spoke kindly to her dialogue reported by herself with a chodowiecki engraving to help in the musenalmanachs ensuing and gave her a 10 pounds but never much moresomebody had done me ill with him thinks the karschin not thinking or perhaps nobody but my poor self and my weakness of head she continued rhyming and livingcertain principalities and high people still standing truetill 12th october 1791  crabmill is in pommerzig township not far from kayzullichau kay palzig crossen all come to speech again in this narrative fancy how they turned up in berlin dinnercircles to dictator wedell gray old gentleman who is now these many years warminister peaceable and well accepted but remembers the flamy youth he had landlord of these arnolds and their mill is major graf von schmettau no connection of our schmettausto what insignificantly small amount of rent i could not learn on searching 10 pounds annually is a too liberal guess innumerable things of no pertinency to us are wearisomely told and ever again told while the pertinent are often missed out in that dreary cartload of arnold lawpapers barely readable barely intelligible to the most patient intellect with despatch let us fish up the small cardinal particles of it and arrange in some chronological or human order that readers may form to themselves an outline of the thing in 1759 we mentioned that this mill was going miller of it an old arnold millers lad a young here is the subsequent succession of occurrences that concern us  in 1762 young arnold as i dimly gather had got married apparently a wife with portion bought the mill from his father he and wife copossessors thenceforthrosine his spouse figuring jointly in all these lawpapers and the spouse especially as a most shifty litigant there they continue totally silent to mankind for about eight years happy the nation much more may we say the household whose public history is blank but in the eighth year  in 1770 freyherr baron von gersdorf in kay who lies farther up the stream bethinks him of fishhusbandry makes a fishpond to himself and for part supply thereof lays some beam or weir across the poor brook and deducts a part of arnolds water  in 1773 the arnolds fall into arrear of rent want of water fishpond spoils our water plead they to major graf von schmettau prosecute von gersdorf then says schmettau i must have my rent you shall have time lengthened terms but pay then or else for four years the arnolds tried more or less to pay but never could or never did completely during which period major von schmettau had them up in his court of pommerzigmanorial or feudal kind of court i think it is more or less his though he does not sit there and an advocate not of his appointing though probably of his accepting dispenses justice there schlecker is the advocates name acquitted by all official people of doing anything wrong no appearance that the herr graf von schmettau put hand to the balances of justice in this court with his eye however who knows but he might act on them more or less and at any rate be suspected by distressed arnolds especially by a distressed frau arnold of doing so the frau arnold had a strong suspicion that way and seems to have risen occasionally upon schlecker who did once order the poor woman to be locked up for contempt of court only two hours asseverates schlecker afterwards after which she came out cool and respectful to court  not the least account survives of those procedures in schleckers court but by accident after many readings you light upon a little fact which does shed a transient ray over them namely that already in 1775 four years before the case became audible in official circles much more in general society frau arnold had seized an opportunity majesty being at crossen in those neighborhoods and presented a petition oh just king appoint a military commission to investigate our business impartial officers will speedily find out the facts and decide what is just preuss iii 382 which denotes an irritating experience in schleckers court certain it is schleckers court did in this tedious harassing way decide against frau arnold in every point pay herr graf von schmettau or else disappear prosecute von gersdorf if you like and in fine as the arnolds could not pay up nor see any daylight through prosecuting baron von gersdorf the big gentleman in kayschlecker after some five years of this decreed sale of the milland sold it was in zullichau september 7th 1778 there is auction of the mill herr landeinnehmer cesscollector kuppisch bought it knocked down to him for the moderate sum of 600 thalers or 90 pounds sterling and the arnolds are an ousted family september 7thpotatowar just closing its sad campaign tomorrow march for trautenau thirty horses to a gun  the arnolds did make various attempts and appeals to the neumark regierung college of judges but it was without the least result schlecker right in every point gersdorf right answered the college go will you a mill forfeited by every law and fallen to the highest bidder cesscollector kuppisch it was soon known had sold his purchase to von gersdorf hah said the rural public smelling something bad certain it is von gersdorf is become proprietor both of pond and mill and it is not to the ruined arnolds that schlecker law can seem an admirable sample and truly reading over those barrowloads of pleadings and relationes one has to admit that taken as a reason for seeing oneself ruined and ones mill become the big gentlemans who fancies carp they do seem considerably insufficient the lawpleadings are duly voluminous barrowloads of them dreariest reading in creation remain going into all manner of questions proving from grotius and others that landlords have rights upon private rivers and another sort upon public ditto that von gersdorf by law of 1566 had verily the right to put down his fishpondwhether schmettau the duty to indemnify arnold for the same that is not touched upon nor singular to say is it anywhere made out or attempted to be made out how much of water arnold lost by the pond much less what degree of real impediment by loss of his own time by loss of his customers tired of such waiting on a mill arnold suffered by the pond this which you would have thought the soul of the matter is absolutely left out altogether unsettledafter i think four or at least three express commissions had sat on it at successive times with the most esteemed hydraulic sages opining and examiningand remains like the part of hamlet omitted by particular desire no wonder frau arnold begged for a military commission that is to say a decision from rational human creatures instead of juridical wigs proceeding at this rate  it was some time in 1775 that rosine what we reckoned a very elucidative point had given in her petition to the king at crossen showing how ill schlecker was using them she now about mayday 1779 in a new petition referred to that and again begged a commission of soldierpeople to settle it may 4th 1779king not yet home but coming arrived at berlin may 27th rodenbeck iii 201kings cabinet on order sends this to justicedepartment nothing said on it the existence of the petition sufficiently saying justicedepartment thereupon demands the lawrecords documentary narrative of res arnold from custrin finds all right peace ye arnolds what would you have preuss iii 382  same year 1779 no express date grandchancellor von furst being at custrin officially examining the condition of lawmatters frau arnold failed not to try there also with a petition see great lawgentleman come to reform abuses can that possibly be law or if so is it not injustice as well tush answered furstfor i believe lawpeople ever since this new stringency of royal vigilance upon them are plagued with such complaints from dorfships and dark greedy peasant people tush and flung it promptly into his wastebasket  is there no hope at all then arnold remembers that a brother of his is a prussian soldier and that he has for colonel prince leopold of brunswick a prince always kind to the poor the leopold regiment lies at frankfurt try prince leopold by that channel prince leopold listenedthe soldier arnold probably known to him as rational and respectable prince leopold now likewise applies to furst a defect not of law herr kanzler but of equity there does seem schmettau had a right to his rent von gersdorf by deed of 1566 to his pond but the arnolds had not water and have lost their mill could not there suggests leopold be appointed without noise of any kind a commission of neutral people strangers to the neumark to search this matter to the actual root of it and let equity ensue to whom also furst answers though in a politer shape tush durchlaucht every man to his trade  so that prince leopold himself the kings own nephew proves futile some think leopold did this very autumn casually or as if casually mention the matter to the kingwhose mind is uneasily awake to all such cases knowing what a buckram set his lawyers are at the reviews as these people say leopold could not have done it there being this year no reviews merely return of king and army from the bavarian war but during august and on into september this year it is very evident there was a visit of the brunswick family at potsdam rodenbeck iii 206 et seq leopolds mamma and certain of his brothersof which colonel prince leopold though not expressly mentioned in the books may very possibly have been permitted for a day or two to form part for mammas behoof and his own and may have made his casual observation at some wellchosen moment with the effect intended in which case leopold was by no means futile but proved after all to be the saving clause for the arnolds  gallant young fellow one loves to believe it of him and to add it to the one other fact now known of him which was also beautiful though tragic six years after spring 1785 oder river swollen by rains was in wild deluge houses in the suburbs like to be washed away leopold looking on it from the bridge or shore perhaps partly with an official eye saw the inhabitants of some houses like to be drowned looked wildly for assistance but found none and did himself in uncontrollable pity dash off in a little boat through the wildeddying surges and got his own death there himself drowned in struggling to save others which occasioned loud lamentation in the world in his poor mothers heart what unnamable voiceless lamentation friedrichs letter to her oeuvres de frederic xxvii i 351 12th may 1785 he had founded a garrison school at frankfurt spared no expenditure of pains or of money a man adored in frankfurt his brother friedrich in memory of him presented next year the uniform in which leopold was drowned to the freemason lodge of berlin of which he had been member militairlexikon i 24 sunt lacrymae rerum  but to return to the arnolds and have done with them for we are now by leopolds help or otherwise got to the last act of that tedious business  august 21st 1779 these high brunswickers still at potsdam if that had any influence the arnolds again make petition to the king alas no justice yet your majesty shall we never see the end of this then thinks the king some soldier with human eyes let him attended by one of their lawwigs go upon the ground and search it and next day having taken protocol of the arnold complaint issues cabinetorder or kings message to the custrin lawwigs colonel heucking whose regiment lies in zullichau district a punctual enough man he shall be the soldier to whom do you adjoin what member of your court you think the fittest and let at last justice be done and swift if you please  the custrin regierung without delay name regierungsrath neumann who is swiftly ready as is colonel heucking swiftlyand they two set out together up the pommerzig brook over that moor country investigating pondering hearing witnesses and no doubt consulting and diligently endeavoring to get to the bottom of this poor arnold question for how many september days i know not everybody knows however that they could not agree in other words that they saw two bottoms to itthe law gentleman one bottom the soldier another true bottom is already there argued the law gentleman confirm decision of court in every point no arnold has lost water has suffered wrong thinks heucking that is the true bottom and so they part each with his own opinion neumann affirmed afterwards that the colonel came with a predetermination that way and even that he said once or oftener in his eagerness to persuade his majesty has got it into his thought there will be nothing but trouble if you persist in that notion to which virtuous neumann was deaf neumann also says the colonel acquainted with austrian enemies but not with law had brought with him his regimentsauditor one bech formerly a lawpractitioner in crossen readers know crossen and exdictator wedell doeslawpractitioner in crossen who had been in strife with the custrin regierung under rebuke from them too importunate for some of his pauper clients belike was a cunning fellow too and had the said regierung in illwill an adroit fellow bech might be or must have been but his now office of regimentsauditor is certificate of honestygood at least against neumann  neumanns court was silent about these neumann surmises but said afterwards heucking had not gone to the bottom of the thing this was in a subsequent report some five or six weeks subsequent their present report they redacted to the effect all correct as it stood without once mentioning heucking gave it in 27th september by which time heuckings also was in and had made a strong impression on his majesty presumably an honest intelligible report though by illluck for the curious it is now lost among the barrowloads of vague wigged stuff this one piece probably human is not to be discovered  friedrichs indignation at the custrin report perfectly correct as it stood and no mention of heucking or his dissent was considerable already 27th septemberthat is on the very day while those custrin people were signing their provoking reportfriedrich confident in heucking had transmitted to his supreme board of justice kammergericht the impartial heuckings account of the affair with order see there an impartial human account clear and circumstantial deutliches und ganz umstandliches going down to the true roots of the business swift get me justice for these arnolds preuss iii 480 scarcely was this gone when september 29th the custrin impertinence perfectly right as it stood came to hand kindling the king into hot provocation extreme displeasure ausserstes misfallen as his answer bore rectify me all that straightway and relieve these arnolds of their injuries you pettifogging pedant knaves bring that arnold matter to order will you you had better  the custrin knaves with what feelings i know not proceed accordingly appoint a new commission one or more lawyers in it and at least one hydraulic gentleman in it schade the name of him who are to go upon the ground hear witnesses and the like who went accordingly and managed not too fast hydraulic schade rather disagreeing from the legal gentlemen to produce a report reported upon by the custrin court 28th october that there is one error found 6 pounds 12s as value of corn left clearly arnolds that when his mill was sold that with this improvement all is now correct to the uttermost and that heucking had not investigated things to the bottom by some accident this report did not come at once to friedrich or had escaped his attention so that  november 21st matters hanging fire in this way frau arnold applies again by petition to his majesty upon which is new royal order ib iii 490 far more patient than might have been expected in gods name rectify me that arnold matter and let us at last see the end of it to which the custriners answer all is rectified your majesty frau arnold in her petition has not mentioned that she gained 6 pounds 12simportant item that 6 pounds 12s for corn left clearly arnolds that when his mill was sold our sentence we cannot alter a courts sentence is alterable only by appeal your majesty decides where the appeal is to lie friedrichs patience is now wearing out but he does not yet give way berlin kammergericht be your appeal court decides he 28th november and will admit of no delay on the kammergerichts part either papers all at custrin say you send for them by express they will come in one day be swift i say  chancellor furst is not a willing horse in this case but he is obliged to go december 7th kammergericht sits on the arnold appeal kammergerichts view is custrin papers all here not the least delay permitted you judge rannsleben take these papers to you down upon them let us if humanly possible have a report by tomorrow rannsleben takes the papers in hand december 7th works upon them all day and all night following at a rate of energy memorable among legal gentlemen and december 8th attends with lucid report upon them or couple of reports one on arnold versus schmettau in six folios one on arnold versus gersdorf in two ditto draws these two documents from his pocket december 8th reads them in assembled court six of the judges present preuss iii 496which with marked thankfulness to the swift rannsleben at once adopts his report and pronounces upon the custrin raths right in every particular witness our hands every one affixing his signature as to a matter happily got done with  it was friday 10th december 1779 before friedrich got this fine bit of news saturday 11th before he authentically saw their sentence he is lying miserably ill of gout in the schloss of berlin and i suppose since his father of blessed memory took cudgel to certain judges and knocked out teeth from them and broke the judicial crowns nobody in that schloss has been in such humor against men of law attend me here at 2 pm with the three raths who signed in arnolds case saturday about 11 am chancellor furst receives this command gets rannsleben and two others friedel graunand there occurred such a scenebut it will be better to let rannsleben himself tell the story who has left an autobiography punctually correct to all appearance but except this alone notable passage of it still unpublished and like to continue so  berlin tuesday 7th december 1779 says rannsleben let him tell it again in his own words the acta which had arrived from custrin in re miller arnold and his wife versus landrath von gersdorf as also those in the same matter versus count von schmettau were assigned to me to be reported on quam primumour president von rebeur president of the supreme kammergericht kingschamber tribunal say exchequer high court or collegium whereof i have the honor to be one of the seven judges or rathsour president von rebeur enjoining me to make such utmost despatch that my report on both these sets of papers might be read to the assembled court next day whereby said court might then and there be enabled to pronounce judgment on the same i at once set to work went on with it all night and on the morrow i brought both my reports relationesone referring to the gersdorf the other to the schmettau part of the suitone of six sheets the other of two sheets to the kammergericht where both relationes were read there were present besides me the following six members of the collegium president von rebeur raths uhl friedel kircheisen graun gassler  appellant as we all know was miller arnold and along with the acta were various severe cabinetorders in which the king who had taken quite particular notice of the case positively enjoined that miller arnold should have justice done him the king had not however given formally any authoritative decision of his own keinen eigentlichen machtspruch gethan which might have given us pause though not fullstop by any means but in his order to the kammergericht had merely said we were to decide with the utmost despatch and then at once inform his majesty how with the speed of light or of thought rannsleben hardly done reading this kammergericht decidedit is well known how in the kings name right in every particular you custrin gentlemenwhich be so good as publish to parties concerned  report of kammergerichts judgment to this effect for behoof of custrin was at once got under way and kammergericht in regard to his majesty agreed merely to announce the fact in that quarter judgment arrived at please your majestyjudgment already under way for custrinyou rannsleben without saying what the judgment is you again write for us and rannsleben does so writes the above little message to his majesty which got to the kings hand friday december 10th and the same day continues rannsleben the king despatched a very severe cabinetorder to minister von dornberghead of the department to which the kammergericht belongsdemanding a copy of the judgment which order was at once obeyed  hereupon on saturday about 11 am there came to grandchancellor von furst sublime head of us and of all lawyers a cabinetorder appear before me here this day at 2 oclock and bring with you your three kammergericht raths who drew up minutirt the judgment in the arnold case message bodeful to furst and the three raths  nota says rannsleben here the king is under the impression that in judging a case three raths are always employed and therefore demands three of us but properly all the abovenamed six membra collegii besides myself ought to have gone to the palace or else i alone on some points an illinformed king rannsleben continues  president von rebeur came to me in his carriage at a quarter to 12 told me of the kings order and said as the king demanded only three raths there was nothing for it but to name me and raths friedel and kircheisen my usual partners in judgment business finding however on looking into the sentence itself that kircheisen was not amongst the signers of it he rebeur named instead of him rath graun who was for the herr president apprehended the king might demand to see our sentence in originali and would then be angry that a person had been sent to him who had not signed the same president von rebeur instructed me farther that i as reporter in the case was to be spokesman at the palace and should explain to his majesty the reasons which had weighed with the kammergericht in coming to such decision  to my dear wife i as beseemed a good husband said nothing of all this confiding it only to my fatherinlaw who tried to cheer me nor indeed did i feel any fear within me being persuaded in my conscience that in this decision of the arnold case i had proceeded according to the best of my knowledge and conviction  at 1 oclock i drove to the grandchancellors where i found the raths friedel and graun already arrived the chancellor old furst instructed us as to what we had to do when we came before the king and then towards 2 oclock he took us in his carriage to the palace we entered the room immediately at the end of the great hall here we found a heyduc tall porter by whom the chancellor announced to the king that we were here heyduc soon came back to inquire whether the cabinetsrath stellter a secretary or shorthand writer of his majestys had arrived yet and whether we we what a doubt were privy councillors we were then shortly after shown in to the king we passed through three rooms the second of which was that in which stands the confidenz tafel table that goes by pulleys through the floor and comes up refurnished when you wish to be specially private with your friends in the fourth a small room with one window was the king the chancellor walked first i followed him close behind me came the rath friedel and then graun some way within opposite the door stood a screen with our backs to this the kingward side of this we ranged ourselvesin respectful row of four furst at the inward end of us right or left is no matter the king sat in the middle of the room so that he could look pointblank at us he sat with his back to the chimney in which there was a fire burning he had on a worn hat of the clerical shape oldmilitary in fact not a shovel at all cassaquin short dressinggown of redbrown mordore velvet black breeches and boots which came quite up over the knee his hair was not dressed three little benchlets or stools covered with green cloth stood before him on which he had his feet lying terribly ill of gout in his lap he had a sort of muff with one of his hands in it which seemed to be giving him great pain in the other hand he held our sentence on the arnold case he lay reclining lag in an easychair at his left stood a table with various papers on itand two gold snuffboxes richly set with brilliants from which he kept taking snuff now and then  besides us there was present in the room the cabinetsrath stellter of the shorthand who stood at a desk and was getting ready for writing the king looked at us saying come nearer whereupon we advanced another step and were now within less than two steps of him he addressed himself to us three raths taking no notice at all of the grandchancellor  king is it you who drew up the judgment in the arnold case  we especially i with a bow yea  the king then turned to the rath friedel to friedel as the central figure of the three perhaps as the portliest though poor friedel except signing had little cognizance of the thing in which not he but rannsleben was to have been spokesman and addressed to friedel those questions of which with their answers there is protocol published under royal authority in the berlin newspapers of december 14th 1779 von seiner koniglichen majestat hochstselbat angehaltenes protocoll protocol minute of proceedings held by royal majestys highestself on the 11th december 1779 concerning the three kammergerichtsraths friedel graun and rannsleben in preuss iii 495 shorthand stellter taking down what was saidquite accurately testifies rannsleben from stellter that is to say from the protocol just mentioned or from stellter and rannsleben together we continue the dialogue  king to friedel in the tone of a rhadamanthus suffering from gout to give sentence against a peasant from whom you have taken wagon plough and everything that enables him to get his living and to pay his rent and taxes is that a thing that can be done  friedel and the two mutes bowing no  king may a miller who has no water and consequently cannot grind and therefore not earn anything have his mill taken from him on account of his not having paid his rent is that just  friedel and mutes as aforesaid no  king but here now is a nobleman wishing to make a fishpond to get more water for his pond he has a ditch dug to draw into it the water from a small stream which drives a watermill thereby the miller loses his water and cannot grind or at most can only grind in the spring for the space of a fortnight and late in the autumn perhaps another fortnight yet in spite of all this it is pretended that the miller shall pay his rent quite the same as at the time when he had full water for his mill of course he cannot pay his rent his incomings are gone and what does the custrin court of justice do it orders the mill to be sold that the nobleman may have his rent and the berlin tribunalchancellor furst standing painfully mute unspoken to unnoticed hitherto more like a broomstick than a chancellor ventures to strike in with a syllable of emendation a small correction of these words berlin tribunal  furst suggestively kammergericht mildly suggestive and perhaps with something in his tone which means i am not a broomstick kammergericht  king to shorthand stellter kammergerichtstribunalthen to furst go you sir about your business on the instant your successor is appointed with you i have nothing more to do disappearordered says official rannsleben ordered the grandchancellor in very severe terms to be gone telling him that his successor was already appointed which order herr von furst without saying a word hastily obeyed passing in front of us three with the utmost speed in frontscreen i suppose not having room behind itand altogether vanishes from friedrichs history all but some ghost of him so we may term it which reappears for an instant once as will be noticed  king continues to friedel not in a lower tone probablythe kammergerichtstribunal confirms the same that is highly unjust and such sentence is altogether contrary to his majestys landsfatherly intentionsmy name you give it in the kings name forsooth cruelly abused  so far is set forth in the royal protocol printed next tuesday as well as in rannsleben but from this point the dialogueif it can be called dialogue being merely a rebuke and expectoration of royal wrath against friedel and his two who are all mute so far as i can learn and stand like criminals in the dock feeling themselves unjustly condemnedgets more and more into conflagration and cannot be distinctly reported my name to such a thing when was i found to oppress a poor man for love of a rich to follow wiggeries and forms with solemn attention careless what became of the internal fact act of 1566 allowing gersdorf to make his pond like enoughand arnolds loss of water that is not worth the ascertaining you know not yet what it was some of you even say it was nothing care not whether it was anything could arnold grind or not as formerly what is act of 1566 or any or all acts in comparison wretched mortals had you wigs a fathom long and lawbooks on your back and acts of 1566 by the hundredweight what could it help if the right of a poor man were left by you trampled under foot what is the meaning of your sitting there as judges dispensers of right in gods name and mine i will make an example of you which shall be rememberedout of my sight whereupon exeunt in haste all threethough not far not home as will be seen  only the essential sense of all this not the exact terms could or should any stellter take in shorthand and in the protocol it is decorously omitted altogether rannsleben merely says the king farther made use of very strong expressions against ustoo strong to be repeatedand at last dismissed us without saying what he intended to do with us we had hardly left the room when he followed us ordering us to wait the king during the interview with us held the sentence of my composition in his hand and seemed particularly irritated about the circumstance of the judgment being pronounced in his name as is the usual form he struck the paper again and again with his other handheat of indignation quite extinguishing gout for the momentexclaiming at the same time repeatedly cruelly abused my name meinen namen cruel missbraucht preuss iii 495498we will now give the remaining part of the protocol what directly follows the above catechetical or dialogue part before that caught fireas taken down by stellter and read in all the newspapers next tuesday     protocol of december 11th title already given supra p 439 n docketing adds which is to be printed   catechetics as aboveand then the kings desire always is and was that everybody be he high or low rich or poor get prompt justice and that without regard of person or rank no subject of his fail at any time of impartial right and protection from his courts of law  wherefore with respect to this most unjust sentence against the miller arnold of the pommerzig crabmill pronounced in the neumark and confirmed here in berlin his majesty will establish an emphatic example ein nachdruckliches exempel statuiren to the end that all courts of justice in all the kings provinces may take warning thereby and not commit the like glaring unjust acts for let them bear in mind that the least peasant yea what is still more that even a beggar is no less than his majesty a human being and one to whom due justice must be meted out all men being equal before the law if it is a prince complaining against a peasant or vice versa the prince is the same as the peasant before the law and on such occasions pure justice must have its course without regard of person let the lawcourts in all the provinces take this for their rule and whenever they do not carry out justice in a straightforward manner without any regard of person and rank but put aside natural fairnessthen they shall have to answer his majesty for it sollen sic es mit seiner koniglichen majestat zu thun kriegen for a court of law doing injustice is more dangerous and pernicious than a band of thieves against these one can protect oneself but against rogues who make use of the cloak of justice to accomplish their evil passions against such no man can guard himself these are worse than the greatest knaves the world contains and deserve double punishment  for the rest be it also known to the various courts of justice that his majesty has appointed a new grandchancellor furst dismissed yet his majesty will not the less look sharply with his own eyes after the lawproceedings in all the provinces and he commands youthat is all the lawcourtsurgently herewith firstlywhich is also lastlyto proceed to deal equally with all people seeking justice be it prince or peasant for there all must be alike however if his majesty at any time hereafter come upon a fault committed in this regard the guilty courts can now imagine beforehand how they will be punished with rigor president as well as raths who shall have delivered a judgment so wicked and openly opposed to justice which all colleges of justice in all his majestys provinces are particularly to take notice of  mem by his majestys special command measures are taken that this protocol be inserted in all the berlin journals in berlinsche nachrichten von staats und gelehrten sachen no 149 tuesday 14th december 1779 preuss iii 494  the remainder of rannslebens narrative is beautifully brief and significantwe had hardly left the room said he supra when the king followed us lame as he was with a fulminant wait there rannsleben continues shortly after came an aidedecamp who took us in a carriage to the common townprison the kalandshof here two corporals and two privates were set to guard us on the 13th december 1779 third day of our arrest a cabinetorder was published to us by which the king had appointed a commission of inquiry but had at the same time commanded beforehand that the sentence should not be less than a years confinement in a fortress dismissal from office and payment of compensation to the arnold people for the losses they had sustained which certainly was a bad outlook for us  precisely the same has befallen our brethren of custrin all suddenly packed into prison just while reading our approval of themthere they sit their sentence to be like ours our arrest in the kalandshof lasted from 11th december 1779 till 5th january 1780 three weeks and three dayswhen with two exceptions to be noted presently we were all kammergerichters and custriners alike transferred to spandau  i spoke of what might be called a ghost of kanzler furst once revisiting the glimpses of the moon or sun if there were any in the dismal december days this is it witness one who saw it on the morning of december 12th the day after the grandchancellors dismissal the street in which he lived was thronged with the carriages of callers who came to testify their sympathy and to offer their condolence to the fallen chancellor the crowd of carriages could be seen from the windows of the kings palace the same young legal gentleman by and by a very old one who himself one of the callers at the exchancellors house that day saw this and related it in his old age to herr preuss preuss iii 499 500 remembers and relates also this other significant fact  during the days that followed the above event and publication of the royal protocol i often crossed in the forenoon the esplanade in front of the palace schlossplatz at that side where the kings apartments were the same which his royal highness the crownprince now 1833 occupies i remember that here on that part of the esplanade which was directly under friedrichs windows there stood constantly numbers of peasants not ten or twelve but as many as a hundred at a time all with petitions in their hands which they were holding up towards the window shouting please his majesty to look at these we have been still worse treated than the arnolds and indeed i have understood the lawcourts for some time after found great difficulty to assert their authority the parties against whom judgment went taking refuge in the arnold precedent and appealing direct to the king  far graver than this spectre of furst minister zedlitz hesitates finally refuses to pronounce such a sentence as the king orders on these men of law estimable able

will deign to consider that i am unable to draw up a condemnatory sentence against your majestys servantsofjustice now under arrest on account of the arnold affair your majestys till deathvon zedlitz  king to zedlitz berlin 1st january 1780my dear statesminister freiherr von zedlitzit much surprises me to see from your note of yesterday that you refuse to pronounce a judgment on those servantsofjustice arrested for their conduct in the arnold case according to my order if you therefore will not i will and do it as follows  1 the custrin regierungsrath scheibler who it appears in evidence was of an opposite opinion to his colleagues and voted that the man upstream had not a right to cut off the water from the man downstream and that the point as to arnolds wanting water should be more closely and strictly inquired intohe scheibler shall be set free from his arrest and go back to his post at custrin and in like manner kammergerichtsrath rannslebenwho has evidently given himself faithful trouble about the cause and has brought forward with a quite visible impartiality all the considerations and dubieties especially about the condition of the water and the alleged hurtfulness of the pondis absolved from arrest  2 as for the other arrested servantsofjustice they are one and all dismissed from office cassirt and condemned to one years fortressarrest furthermore they shall pay to arnold the value of his mill and make good to him out of their own pocket all the loss and damage he has suffered in this business the neumark kammer revenueboard to tax and estimate the same damage came to 1358 thalers 11 groschen 1 pfennigthat is 203 pounds 14s and some pence and farthings the last farthing of which was punctually paid to arnold within the next eight months preuss iii 409so that  3 the miller arnold shall be completely put as he was in integrum restituirt  and in such way must the matter in all branches of it be immediately proceeded with got ready and handed in for my completion vollziehung by signature which you therefore will take charge of without delay for the rest i will tell you farther that i am not ill pleased to know you on the side you show on this occasion as a man that will not go against his conscience and shall see by and by what i can farther do with you left him where he was as the best thing whereafter you are accordingly to guide yourself and i remain otherwise your wellaffectioned king friedrich ib iii 519 520 see ib 405 n  this then is an impartial account of the celebrated passage between friedrich and the lawyers known by the name of the millerarnold case which attracted the notice of all europejust while the decennium of the french revolution was beginning in russia the czarina catharine the friend of philosophers sent to her senate a copy of friedrichs protocol of december 11th as a noteworthy instance of royal supreme judicature in france prints in celebration of itone print by vangelisti entitled balance de fredericwere exhibited in shopwindows expounded in newspapers and discoursed of in drawingrooms the case brought into talk again an old miller case of friedrichs which had been famous above thirty years ago when sanssouci was getting built readers know it potsdam miller and his obstinate windmill which still grinds on its knoll in those localities and would not at any price become part of the kings gardens not at any price said the kings agent cannot the king take it from you for nothing if he chose have nt we the kammergericht at berlin answered the miller to friedrichs great delight as appearswhich might render the windmill itself a kind of ornament to his gardens thenceforth the french admiration over these two miller cases continued to be very great dieulafoi le meunier de sanssouci comedy or farce of i know not what year andrieux le moulin de sanssouci poem at institut national 15 germinal an 5 c c preuss iii 412 413  as to miller arnold and his cause the united voice of prussian society condemned friedrichs procedure such harshness to grandchancellor furst and respectable old official gentlemen amounting to the barbarous and tyrannous according to prussian society to support which feeling and testify it openly they drove in crowds to fursts some have told me to the prisondoors too but that seems hypothetic and left cards for old furst and company in sight of friedrich who inquired what is this stir on the streets thenand on learning made not the least audible remark but continued his salutary cashierment of the wigged gentlemen and imprisonment till their full term ran  my impression has been that in berlin society there was more sympathy for mere respectability of wig than in friedrich to friedrich respectability of wig that issues in solemnly failing to do justice is a mere enormity greater than the most wigless condition could be wigless the thing were to be endured a thing one is born to more or less but in wigout upon it and the wig which screens and would strive to disguise and even to embellish such a thing to the gutters with such wig  in support of their feeling for furst and company berlin society was farther obliged to pronounce the claim of miller arnold a nullity and that no injustice whatever had been done him mere pretences on his part subterfuges for his idle conduct for his inability to pay due rent said berlin society and that impartial soldierperson whom friedrich sent to examine by the light of nature and report corrupted he answer they had intrigues with i forget whom somebody of the womankind perhaps arnolds old hardfeatured wife if you are driven into a cornerand was not to be depended on at all in which condemned state berlin society almost wholly disapproving it the arnold process was found at friedrichs death restoration of honors to old furst and company one of the first acts of the new reign sure of immediate popularity and i think pretty much continues so still few or none in berlin society admitting miller arnolds claim to redress much less defending that onslaught on furst and the wigs herr preuss himself inclines that way rather condemnatory of friedrich but his account as usual is exact and authenticthough distressingly confused and scattered about into different corners preuss iii 381413 then again ibid 520 c on the other hand there is one segebusch too a learned doctor of altona who takes the kings sideand really is rather stupid argumentative merely and unilluminative if you read him segebusch historischrechtliche wurdigung der einmischung friedrichs des grossen in die bekannte rechtssache des mullers arnold auch fur nichtjuristen altona 1829  who from the remote distance would venture to contradict once more my own poor impression was which i keep silent except to friends that berlin society was wrong that miller arnold had of a truth lost portions of his damwater and was entitled to abatement and that in such case friedrichs horror at the furstandcompany phenomenon horror aggravated by gout had its highly respectable side withal  when after friedrichs death on von gersdorfs urgent reclamations the case was reopened and allowed to be carried into the secret tribunal as the competent court of appeal in third instance the said tribunal found that the lawmaxim depended upon by the lower courts as to the absolute right of owners of private streams did not apply in the present case but that the deed of 1566 did and also that the facts as to pretended damage pretence merely from loss of water were satisfactorily proved against arnold gersdorf therefore may have his pond and arnold must refund the money paid to him for damages by the condemned judges and also the purchasemoney of his mill if he means to keep the latter all which moneys however his majesty friedrich wilhelm ii friedrichs successor to have done with the matter handsomely paid out of his own pocket the handsome way of ending it  in his last journey to westpreussen june 1784 friedrich said to the new regierungspresident chief judge there i am head commissary of justice and have a heavy responsibility lying on meas will you in this new office friedrich at no moment neglected this part of his functions and his procedure in it throughout one cannot but admit to have been faithful beautiful human very impatient indeed when he comes upon imbecility and pedantry threatening to extinguish essence and fact among his law people this is one marginale of his among many such some of them still more stinging which are comfortable to every reader the case is that of a murderermurder indisputable but may not insanity be suspected your majesty such the absence of motive such the majesty answers that is nothing but inanity and stupid pleading against right the fellow put a child to death if he were a soldier you would execute him without priest and because this canaille is a citizen you make him melancholic to get him off beautiful justice preuss iii 375  friedrich has to sign all deathsentences and he does it wherever i have noticed rigorously well for the rest his criminal calendar seems to be lighter than any other

both of us is a mere stoppage of the way  czarina catharine took the hint christened her next grandson constantine to be in readiness this is the constantine who renounced in favor of the late czar nicholas and proved a failure in regard to new greek empire and otherwise and from that time stiffly refused renewing her treaty with friedrichto friedrichs great grief seeing her on the contrary

these threatening complexities now gone like a dream of the night were really lifeperils for the kingdom of prussia never to be lost sight of by a veteran shepherd of the people they kept a vigilant king friedrich continually on the stretch and were a standing lifeproblem to him in those final years problem nearly insoluble to human contrivance the russian card having palpably gone into the other hand problem solved nevertheless it is still remembered how  on the development of that pretty bavarian project the thing became pressing and it is well known by what a stroke of genius friedrich checkmated it and produced instead a furstenbund or general confederation of german princes prussia atop to forbid peremptorily that the laws of the reich be infringed furstenbund this is the victorious summit of friedrichs public history towards which all his efforts tended during these five years friedrichs last feat in the world feat how obsolete nowfallen silent everywhere except in german parishhistory and to the students of friedrichs character in old age had no result whatever in european history so unexpected was the turn things took a furstenbund which was swallowed bodily within few years in that worldexplosion of democracy and war of the giants andunless napoleons confederation of the rhine were perhaps some transitory ghost of itleft not even a ghost behind a furstenbund of which we must say something when its year comes but obviously not much  nor are the domesticities as set forth by our prussian authorities an opulent topic for us friedrichs old age is not unamiable on the contrary i think it would have made a pretty picture had there been a limner to take it with the least felicity or physiognomic coherencyas there was not his letters and all the symptoms we have denote a soundhearted brave old man continually subduing to himself many ugly troubles and like the stars always steady at his work to sit grieving or desponding is at all times far from him why despond wont it be all done presently is it of much moment while it lasts a fine unaffectedly vigorous simple and manful old agerather serene than otherwise in spite of electric outbursts and cloudy weather that could not be wanting  of all which there is not in this place much more to be said friedrichs element is itself wearing dim sombre of hue and the records of it too seem to grow dimmer more and more intermittent old friends of the intellectual kind are almost all dead the new are of little moment to usnot worth naming in comparison the chief perhaps is a certain young marchese lucchesini who comes about this time chamberlain titular with pension c 9th may 1780 age then 28 preuss iv 211arrived when or how is not said and continues in more and more favor both with friedrich and his successoremployed even in diplomatics by the latter an accomplished young gentleman from lucca of fine intelligence and what was no less essential to him here a perfect propriety in breeding and carriage one makes no acquaintance with him in these straggling records nor desires to make any it was he that brought the inane ever scribbling denina hither if that can be reckoned a merit inane denina came as academician october 1782 saw friedrich rodenbeck iii 285 286 at least once academician pension yes yesand i know not whether any second time  friedrich on loss of friends does not take refuge in solitude he tries always for something of substitute sees his man once or twicein several instances once only and leaves him to his pension in sinecure thenceforth cornelius de pauw the rich canon of xanten uncle of anacharsis klootz the afterwards renowned came on those principles hung on for six months not liked not liking and was then permitted to go home for good his

household picture dimly reported withal the following anecdotes may be added as completion of it or at least of all i have to say on it  you go on wednesday thenloss of time was one of the losses friedrich could least stand in visits even from his brothers and sisters which were always by his own express invitation he would say some morning call it tuesday morning you are going on wednesday i am sorry to hear what you never heard beforealas your majesty we must well i am sorry but i will lay no constraint on you pleasant moments cannot last forever and sometimes after this had been agreed to he would say but cannot you stay till thursday then come one other day of itwell since your majesty does graciously press and on thursday not wednesday on those curious terms the visit would terminate this trait is in the anecdotebooks but its authenticity does not rest on that uncertain basis singularly enough it comes to me individually by two clear stages from friedrichs sister the duchess of brunswick who if anybody would know it well my informant is sir george sinclair baronet of thurso his was the distinguished countess of finlater still remembered for her graces of mind and person who had been maidofhonor to the duchess  dinner with the queenthe queen a prudent simpleminded worthy person of perfect behavior in a difficult position seems to have been much respected in berlin society and the court circles nor was the king wanting in the same feeling towards her of which there are still many proofs but as to personal intercoursewhat a figure has that gradually taken preuss says citing those who saw when the king after the sevenyears war now and then in carnival season dined with the queen in her apartments he usually said not a word to her he merely on entering on sitting down at table and on leaving it made the customary bow and sat opposite to her once in the seventies years 1770 years now past the queen was ill of gout table was in her apartments but she herself was not there she sat in an easychair in the drawingroom on this occasion the king stepped up to the queen and inquired about her health the circumstance occasioned among the company present and all over town as the news spread great wonder and sympathy verwunderung und theilnahme this is probably the last time he ever spoke to her preuss iv 187  the two grandnephewsthe king was fond of children liked to have his grandnephews about him one day while the king sat at work in his cabinet the younger of the two a boy of eight or nine who died soon after twenty was playing ball about the room and knocked it once and again into the kings writing operation who twice or oftener flung it back to him but next time put it in his pocket and went on please your majesty give it me back begged the boy and again begged majesty took no notice continued writing till at length came in the tone of indignation will your majesty give me my ball then the king looked up found the little hohenzollern planted firm hands on haunches and wearing quite a peremptory air thou art a brave little fellow they wont get silesia out of thee cried he laughing and flinging him his ball fischer ii 445 year 1780  of the elder prince afterwards friedrich wilhelm iii father of the now king there is a much more interesting anecdote and of his own reporting too though the precise terms are irrecoverable how the king questioning him about his bits of french studies brought down a la fontaine from the shelves and said translate me this fable which the boy did with such readiness and correctness as obtained the kings praises praises to an extent that was embarrassing and made the honest little creature confess i did it with my tutor a few days since to the kings much greater delight who led him out to walk in the gardens and in a mood of deeper and deeper seriousness discoursed and exhorted him on the supreme law of truth and probity that lies on all men and on all kings still more one of his expressions being look at this high thing the obelisk they were passing in the gardens its uprightness is its strength sa droiture fait sa force and his final words remember this evening my good fritz perhaps thou wilt think of it long after when i am gone as the good friedrich wilhelm iii declares piously he often did in the storms of fate that overtook him r f eylert charakterzuge und historische fragmente aus dem leben des konigs von preussen friedrich wilhelm iii magdeburg 1843 i 450456 this is a kings chaplain and bishop eylert undoubtedly he heard this anecdote from his master and was heard repeating it but the dialect his editors have put it into is altogether tawdry modern and impossible to take for that of friedrich or even i suppose of friedrich wilhelm iii  industrial matters that of colonies especially of drainages embankments and reclaiming of waste lands are a large item in the kings businessreaders would not guess how large or how incessant under this head there is on record and even lies at my hand translated into english what might be called a colonial day with friedrich day of july 23d 1779 which friedrich just come home from the bavarian war spent wholly from 5 in the morning onward in driving about in earnest survey of his colonies and landimprovements in the potsdamruppin country curious enough record by a certain bailiff or overseer who rode at his chariotside of all the questions criticisms and remarks of friedrich on persons and objects till he landed at ruppin for the night taken down with forensic almost with religious exactitude by the bailiff in question a nephew of the poet gleimby whom it was published the year after friedrichs death is in anekdoten und karakterzuge no 8 berlin 1787 pp 1579 and by many others since it is curiously authentic characteristic in parts though in its bald forensic style rather heavy reading luckier for most readers that inexorable want of room has excluded it on the present occasion printed now in edition 1868 for the first time as appendix to this volume  no reader adequately fancies or could by any single document be made to do so the continual assiduity of friedrich in regard to these interests of his the strictest husbandman is not busier with his farm than friedrich with his kingdom throughoutwhich is indeed a farm leased him by the heavens in which not a gatebar can be broken nor a stone or sod roll into the smallest ditch but it is to his the husbandmans damage and must be instantly looked after there are meetings with the silesian manufacturers in review time dialogues ensuing several of which have been preserved strange to read however dull there are many scattered evidencesand only slowly does not the thing indeed but the degree of the thing become fully credible not communicable on the terms prescribed us at present and must be left to the languid fancy like so much else  here is an ocular view here are several such which we yet happily have of the actual friedrich as he looked and lived these at a cheap rate throw transiently some flare of illumination over his affairs and him these let me now give and these shall be all     prince de ligne after ten years sees friedrich a second time time and reports what was said  in summer 1780 as we mentioned kaiser joseph was on his first visit to the czarina they met at mohilow on the dnieper towards the end of may have been roving about as if in mere galas and amusements though with a great deal of business incidentally thrown in for above a month since when prince de ligne is summoned to join them at petersburg he goes by berlin stays at potsdam with friedrich for about a week and reports to polish majesty these new dialogues of 1780 the year after sending him those of mahrischneustadt of 1770 which we read above those were written down from memory in 1785 these in 1786and towards the end of it as is internally evident let these also be welcome to us on such terms as there are  since your majesty quasimajesty of poland is willing to lose another quarter of an hour of that time which you employ so well in gaining the love of all to whom you deign to make yourself known here is my second interview it can be of interest only to you sire who have known the king and who discover traits of character in what to another are but simple words one finds in few others that confidence or at least that kindliness bonhomie which characterizes your majesty with you one can indulge in rest but with the king of prussia one had always to be under arms prepared to parry and to thrust and to keep the due middle between a small attack and a grand defence i proceed to the matter in hand and shall speak to you of him for the last time  he had made me promise to come to berlin i hastened thither directly after that little war potatowar which he called an action where he had come as bailiff to perform an execution the result for him as is known was a great expense of men of horses and money some appearance of good faith and disinterestedness little honor in the war a little honesty in policy and much bitterness against us austrians the king began without knowing why to prohibit austrian officers from entering his territories without an express order signed by his own hand similar prohibition on the part of our court against prussian officers and mutual constraint without profit or reason i for my own part am of confident humor i thought i should need no permission and i think still i could have done without one but the desire of having a letter from the great friedrich rather than the fear of being illreceived made me write to him my letter was all on fire with my enthusiasm my admiration and the fervor of my sentiment for that sublime and extraordinary being and it brought me three charming answers from him he gave me in detail almost what i had given him in the gross and what he could not return me in admirationfor i do not remember to have gained a battlehe accorded me in friendship for fear of missing he had written to me from potsdam to vienna to dresden and to berlin in fine at potsdam i was saturday 9th july 1780 waiting readystayed there about a week 9th or 10th july 1780 rodenbeck iii 233 stayed till 16th  while waiting for the hour of 12 with my son charles and m de lille abbe de lille prosewriter of something now forgotten by no means lyrical de lisle of les jardins to be presented to the king i went to look at the paradeand on its breaking up was surrounded and escorted to the palace by austrian deserters and particularly from my own regiment who almost caressed me and asked my pardon for having left me  the hour of presentation struck the king received me with an unspeakable charm the military coldness of a generals headquarters changed into a soft and kindly welcome he said to me he did not think i had so big a son  ego he is even married sire has been so these twelve months  king may i oseraisje ask you to whom he often used this expression oseraisje and also this if you permit me to have the honor to tell you si vous me permettes davoir lhonneur de vous dire  ego to a polishlady a massalska  king to my son what a massalska do you know what her grandmother did  no sire said charles  king she put the match to the cannon at the siege of dantzig with her own hand february 1734 in poor stanislaus leczinskis second fit of royalty supra vi 465 she fired and made others fire and defended herself when her party who had lost head thought only of surrendering  ego women are indeed undefinable strong and weak by turns indiscreet dissembling they are capable of anything without doubt said m de lille distressed that nothing had yet been said to him and with a familiarity which was not likely to succeed without doubt look said he the king interrupted him i cited some traits in support of my opinionas that of the woman hachette at the siege of beauvais ad 1472 burgundians storming the wall had their flag planted flag and flagbearer are hurled into the ditch by hachette and other inspired womenwith the finest results the king made a little excursion to rome and to sparta he liked to promenade there after half a second of silence to please de lille i told the king that m de voltaire died in de lilles arms that caused the king to address some questions to him he answered in rather too longdrawn a manner and went away charles and i stayed dinner this is day first in potsdam  here for five hours daily the kings encyclopedical conversation enchanted me completely fine arts war medicine literature and religion philosophy ethics history and legislation in turns passed in review the fine centuries of augustus and of louis xiv good society among the romans among the greeks among the french the chivalry of francois i the frankness and valor of henri iv the newbirth renaissance of letters and their revolution since leo x anecdotes about the clever men of other times and the trouble they give m de voltaires slips susceptibilities of m de maupertuis algarottis agreeable ways fine wit of jordan dargenss hypochondria whom the king would send to bed for fourandtwenty hours by simply telling him that he looked illand in fine what not everything the most varied and piquant that could be said came from himin a most soft tone of voice rather low than otherwise and no less agreeable than were the movements of his lips which had an inexpressible grace  it was this i believe which prevented ones observing that he was in fact like homers heroes somewhat of a talker un peu babillard though a sublime one it is to their voices their noise and gestures that talkers often owe their reputation as such for certainly one could not find a greater talker than the king but one was delighted at his being so accustomed to talk to marquis lucchesini in the presence of only four or five generals who did not understand french he compensated in this way for his hours of labor of study of meditation and solitude at least said i to myself i must get in a word he had just mentioned virgil i said  ego what a great poet sire but what a bad gardener  king ah to whom do you tell that have not i tried to plant sow till dig with the georgics in my hand but monsieur said my man you are a fool bete and your book no less it is not in that way one goes to work ah mon dieu what a climate would you believe it heaven or the sun refuse me everything look at my poor orangetrees my olivetrees lemontrees they are all starving  ego it would appear then nothing but laurels flourish with you sire the king gave me a charming look and to cover an inane observation by an absurd one i added quickly besides sire there are too many grenadiers means in french pomegranates as well as grenadierspeg of ones little joke in this country they eat up everything the king burst out laughing for it is only absurdities that cause laughter  one day i had turned a plate to see of what porcelain it was where do you think it comes from asked the king  ego i thought it was saxon but instead of two swords the saxon mark i see only one which is well worth both of them  king it is a sceptre  ego i beg your majestys pardon but it is so much like a sword that one could easily mistake it for one and such was really the case this it is known is the mark of the berlin china as the king sometimes played king and thought himself sometimes extremely magnificent while taking up a walkingstick or snuffbox with a few wretched little diamonds running after one another on it i dont quite know whether he was infinitely pleased with my little allegory  one day as i entered his room he came towards me saying i tremble to announce bad news to you i have just heard that prince karl of lorraine is dying is already dead at brussels july 4th duke of sachsenteschen and wife christine succeeded him as jointgovernors in those parts he looked at me to see the effect this would have and observing some tears escaping from my eyes he by gentlest transitions changed the conversation talked of war and of the marechal de lacy he asked me news about lacy and said that is a man of the greatest merit in former time count mercy among yourselves killed while commanding in chief at the battle of parma in 1733 puysegur among the french had some notions of marches and encampments one sees from hyginuss book ancient book on castrametation that the greeks also were much occupied with the subject but your marechal surpasses the ancients the moderns and all the most famous men who have meddled with it thus whenever he was your quartermastergeneral if you will permit me to make the remark to you i did not gain the least advantage recollect the two campaigns of 1758 and 1759 you succeeded in everything i often said to myself shall i never get rid of that man then you yourselves got me rid of him andsome liberal or even profuse eulogy of lacy who is de lignes friend which we can omit  next day the king as soon as he saw me came up saying with the most penetrated air if you are to learn the loss of a man who loved you and who did honor to mankind it will be better that it be from some one who feels it as deeply as i do poor prince karl is no more others perhaps are made to replace him in your heart but few princes will replace him with regard to the beauty of his soul and to all his virtues in saying this his emotion became extreme i said your majestys regrets are a consolation and you did not wait for his death to speak well of him there are fine verses with reference to him in the poem sur lart de la guerre my emotion troubled me against my will however i repeated them to him      soutien de mes rivaux digne appui de ta reine      charles dun ennemi sourd aux cris de la haine      recois leloge  for crossing the rhine in 1744 ten rather noble lines still worth reading as indeed the whole poem well is especially to soldier students lart de la guerre chant vi oeuvres de frederic x 273 the man of letters seemed to appreciate my knowing them by heart  king his passage of the rhine was a very fine thingbut the poor prince depended upon so many people i never depended upon anybody but myself sometimes too much so for my luck he was badly served not too well obeyed neither the one nor the other ever was the case with meyour general nadasti appeared to me a great general of cavalry not sharing the kings opinion on this point i contented myself with saying that nadasti was very brilliant very fine at musketry and that he could have led his hussars to the worlds end and farther dans lenfer so well did he know how to animate them  king what has become of a brave colonel who played the devil at rossbach ah it was the marquis de voghera i thinkyes thats it for i asked his name after the battle  ego he is general of cavalry  king perdi it needed a considerable stomach for fight to charge like your two regiments of cuirassiers there and i believe your hussars also for the battle was lost before it began  ego apropos of m de voghera is your majesty aware of a little thing he did before charging he is a boiling restless evereager kind of man and has something of the good old chivalry style seeing that his regiment would not arrive quick enough he galloped ahead of it and coming up to the commander of the prussian regiment of cavalry which he meant to attack he saluted him as on parade the other returned the salute and then have at each other like madmen  king a very good style it is i should like to know that man i would thank him for ityour general von ried then had got the devil in him that time at eilenburg spurt of fight there in the meissen regions i think in year 1758 when the dahremberg dragoons got so cut up to let those brave dragoons who so long bore your name with glory advance between three of my columnshe had asked me the same question at the camp of neustadt ten years since and in vain had i told him that it was not m de ried that ried did not command them at all and that the fault was marechal dauns who ought not to have sent them into that wood of eilenburg still less ordered them to halt there without even sending a patrol forward the king could not bear our general von ried who had much displeased him as minister at berlin and it was his way to put down everything to the account of people he disliked  king when i think of those devils of saxon camps summer 1760they were unattackable citadels if at torgau m de lacy had still been quartermastergeneral i should not have attempted to attack him but there i saw at once the camp was ill chosen  ego the superior reputation of camps sometimes causes a desire to attempt them for instance i ask your majestys pardon but i have always thought you would at last have attempted that of plauen had the war continued  king oh no indeed there was no way of taking that one  ego does nt your majesty think with a good battery on the heights of dolschen which commanded us with some battalions ranked behind each other in the ravine attacking a quarter of an hour before daybreak and so forth at some lengthexcellent for soldier readers who know the plauen chasm you could have flung us out of that almost impregnable place of refuge  king and your battery on the windberg which would have scourged my poor battalions all the while in your ravine  ego but sire the night  king oh you could not miss us even by grope that big hollow that goes from burg and even from potschappelit would have poured like a waterspout or firespout over us you see i am not so brave as you think  the kaiser had set out for his interview first interview and indeed it is now more than half done a good six weeks of it gone with the czarina of russia that interview the king did not like no wonderand to undo the good it had done us he directly and very unskilfully sent the prince royal to petersburg who had not the least success there loutish fellow and was openly snubbed by a czarina gone into new courses his majesty already doubted that the court of russia was about to escape himand i was dying of fear lest in the middle of all his kindnesses he should remember that i was an austrian what said i to myself not a single epigram on us or on our master what a change  one day at dinner babbling pinto said to the person sitting next him this kaiser is a great traveller there never was one who went so far i ask your pardon monsieur said the king charles fifth went to africa he gained the battle of oran and turning towards mewho couldnt guess whether it was banter or only historythis time said he the kaiser is more fortunate than charles twelfth like charles he entered russia by mohilow but it appears to me he will arrive at moscow  the same pinto one day understanding the king was at a loss whom to send as foreign minister somewhither said to him why does not your majesty think of sending lucchesini who is a man of much brilliancy homme desprit it is for that very reason answered the king that i want to keep him i had rather send you than him or a dull fellow like monsieur i forget whom but believe it is one whom he did appoint minister somewhere  m de lucchesini by the charm of his conversation brought out that of the kings he knew what topics were agreeable to the king and then he knew how to listen which is not so easy as one thinks and which no stupid man was ever capable of he was as agreeable to everybody as to his majesty by his seductive manners and by the graces of his mind pinto who had nothing to risk permitted himself everything says he ask the austrian general sire all he saw me do when in the service of the kaiser  ego a firework at my wedding was nt that it my dear pinto  king interrupting do me the honor to say whether it was successful  ego no sire it even alarmed all my relations who thought it a bad omen monsieur the major here had struck out the idea of joining two flaming hearts a very novel image of a married couple but the groove they were to slide on and meet gave way my wifes heart went and mine remained  king you see pinto you were not good for much to those people any more than to me  ego oh sire your majesty since then owes him some compensation for the sabrecuts he had on his head  king he gets but too much compensation pinto did nt i send you yesterday some of my good preussen honey  pinto oh surelyit was to make the thing known if your majesty could bring that into vogue and sell it all you would be the greatest king in the world for your kingdom produces only that but of that there is plenty  do you know said the king one day to medo you know that the first soldiering i did was for the house of austria mon dieu how the time passeshe had a way of slowly bringing his hands together in ejaculating these mondieus which gave him quite a goodnatured and extremely mild airdo you know that i saw the glittering of the last rays of prince eugens genius  ego perhaps it was at these rays that your majestys genius lit itself  king eh mon dieu who could equal the prince eugen  ego he who excels himfor instance he who could win twelve battleshe put on his modest air i have always said it is easy to be modest if you are in funds he seemed as though he had not understood me and said  king when the cabal which during forty years the prince had always had to struggle with in his army were plotting mischief on him they used to take advantage of the evening time when his spirits brisk enough in the morning were jaded by the fatigues of the day it was thus they persuaded him to undertake his bad march on mainz march not known to me  ego regarding yourself sire and the rhine campaign you teach me nothing i know everything your majesty did and even what you said i could relate to you your journeys to strasburg to holland and what passed in a certain boat apropos of this rhine campaign one of our old generals whom i often set talking as one reads an old manuscript has told me how astonished he was to see a young prussian officer whom he did not know answering a general of the late king who had given out the order not to go aforaging and i sir i order you to go our army needs it in short i will have it so je le veux  king you look at me too much from the favorable side ask these gentlemen about my humors and my caprices they will tell you fine things of me  we got talking of some anecdotes which are consigned to or concealed in certain obscure books i have been much amused said i to the king with the big cargo of books true or false written by french refugees which perhaps are unknown in france itself discourses a little on this subject  king where did you pick up all these fine old pieces these would amuse me on an evening better than the conversation of my doctor of the sorbonne one peyrau a wandering creature not otherwise of the least interest to us nicolai anekdoten ii 133 n whom i have here and whom i am trying to convert  ego i found them all in a bohemian library where i sat diverting myself for two winters  king how then two winters in bohemia what the devil were you doing there is it long since  ego no sire only a year or two potatowar time i had retired thither to read at my easehe smiled and seemed to appreciate my not mentioning the little war of 1778 and saving him any speech about it he saw well enough that my winterquarters had been in bohemia on that occasion and was satisfied with my reticence being an old sorcerer who guessed everything and whose tact was the finest ever known he discovered that i did not wish to tell him i found berlin changed since i had last been there i took care not to remind him that i was at the capturing of it in 1760 under m de lacys orders m de lacys indeedit was for having spoken of the first capture of berlin by marshal haddick highly temporary as it was and followed by rossbach that the king had taken a dislike to m de ried  apropos of the doctor of the sorbonne uninteresting peyrau with whom he daily disputed the king said to me once get me a bishopric for him i dont think answered i that my recommendation or that of your majesty could be useful to him with us ah truly no said the king well i will write to the czarina of russia for this poor devil he does begin to bore me he holds out as jansenist forsooth mon dieu what blockheads the present jansenists are but france should not have extinguished that nursery foyer of their genius that port royal extravagant as it was indeed one ought to destroy nothing why have they destroyed too the depositaries of the graces of rome and of athens those excellent professors of the humanities and perhaps of humanity the exjesuit fathers education will be the loser by it but as my brothers the kings most catholic most christian most faithful and apostolic have tumbled them out i most heretical pick up as many as i can and perhaps one day i shall be courted for the sake of them by those who want some i preserve the breed i said counting my stock the other day a rector like you my father i could easily sell for 300 thalers you reverend father provincial for 600 and so the rest in proportion when one is not rich one makes speculations  from want of memory and of opportunities to see oftener and longer the greatest man that ever existed oh mon prince i am obliged to stop there is not a word in all this but was his own and those who have seen him will recognize his manner all i want is to make him known to those who have not had the happiness to see him his eyes are too hard in the portraits by work in the cabinet and the hardships of war they had become intense and of piercing quality but they softened finely in hearing or telling some trait of nobleness or sensibility till his death and but quite shortly before itnotwithstanding many levities which he knew i had allowed myself both in speaking and writing and which he surely attributed only to my duty as opposed to my interesthe deigned to honor me with marks of his remembrance and has often commissioned his ministers at paris and at vienna to assure me of his goodwill  i no longer believe in earthquakes and eclipses at caesars death since there has been nothing of such at that of friedrich the great i know not sire whether great phenomena of nature will announce the day when you shall cease to reign great phenomena must be very idle if they do your highnessbut it is a phenomenon in the world that of a king who rules a republic by making himself obeyed and respected for his own sake as much as by his rights hear hear prince de ligne memoires et melanges i 2240  prince de ligne thereupon hurries off for petersburg and the final section of his kaisers visit an errand of his own too the prince hadabout his new daughterinlaw massalska and claims of extensive polish properties belonging to her he was the charm of petersburg and the czarina but of the massalska properties could retrieve nothing whatever the munificent czarina gave him a beautiful territory in the crim instead and invited him to come and see it with her on his kaisers next visit 1787 the aquatic visit and the highly scenic which it is well known the prince did and has put on record in his pleasant not untrue though vague highcolored and fantastic wayif it or he at all concerned us farther     how general von der marwitz in early boyhood saw friedrich the great three times 17821785  general von der marwitz who died not many years ago is of the old marwitz kindred several of whom we have known for their rugged honesties genialities and peculiar ways this general it appears had left a kind of autobiography which friends of his thought might be useful to the prussian public after those radical distractions which burst out in 1848 and onwards and a first volume of the marwitz posthumous papers was printed accordingly nachlass des general von der marwitz berlin 1852 1 vol 8vowhether any more i have not heard though i found this first volume an excellent substantial bit of reading and the author a fine old prussian gentleman very analogous in his structure to the fine old english ditto who showed me the percontra side of this and the other muchcelebrated modern prussian person and thing prince hardenberg johannes von muller and the likeand yielded more especially the following three reminiscences of friedrich beautiful little pictures bathed in morning light and evidently true to the life  1 june 1782 or 1783 the first time i saw him was in 1782 or it might be 1783 in my sixth year middle of june whichever year as he was returning from his annual review in preussen westpreussen never revisits the konigsberg region and stopped to change horses at dolgelin dolgelin is in mullrose country westward of frankfurtonoder our marwitz schloss not far from it i had been sent with mamsell benezet my french governess and along with the clergyman of dolgelin we waited for the king  the king on his journeys generally preferred whether at midday or for the night to halt in some country place and at the parsonages most of all probably because he was quieter there than in the towns to the clergyman this was always a piece of luck not only because if he pleased the king he might chance to get promoted but because he was sure of profitable payment at any rate the king always ordering 50 thalers say 10 guineas for his noon halt and for his nights lodging 100 the little that the king ate was paid for over and above it is true his suite expected to be well treated but this consisted only of one or two individuals now the king had been wont almost always on these journeys homewards to pass the last night of his expedition with the clergyman of dolgelin and had done so last year with this present one who was then just installed with him as with his predecessor the king had talked kindly and the 100 thalers were duly remembered our good parson flattered himself therefore that this time too the same would happen and he had made all preparations accordingly  so we waited there and a crowd of people with us the team of horses stood all ready peasants horses poor little cats of things but the best that could be picked for there were then no posthorses that could run fastthe countryfellows that were to ride postilion all decked and ten head of horses for the kings coach wheelers four which the coachman drove from his box then two successive pairs before on each pair a postilionpeasant and upon the third pair foremost of all the kings outriders were to go  and now at last came the feldjager chacer huntinggroom with his big whip on a peasants horse a peasant with him as attendant all blazing with heat he dismounted said the king would be here in five minutes looked at the relays and the fellows with the waterbuckets who were to splash the wheels gulped down a quart of beer and so his saddle in the interim having been fixed on another horse sprang up again and off at a gallop the king then was not to stay in dolgelin soon came the page mounted in like style a youth of 17 or 18 utterly exhausted had to be lifted down from his horse and again helped upon the fresh one being scarcely able to standand close on the rear of him arrived the king he was sitting alone in an oldfashioned glasscoach what they call a visavis a narrow carriage two seats fore and aft and on each of them room for only one person the coach was very long like all the old carriages of that time between the drivers box and the body of the coach was a space of at least four feet the body itself was of pearshape peaked below and bellied out above hung on straps with rolled knuckles winden did not rest on springs two beams connecting fore wheels and hind ran not under the body of the coach but along the sides of it the hindwheels following with a goodly interval  the carriage drew up and the king said to his coachman the farfamed pfund is this dolgelin yes your majestyi stay here no said pfund the sun is not down yet we can get on very well to muncheberg tonight ten miles ahead and a town too perfidious pfundand then tomorrow we are much earlier in potsdam na hmwell if it must be so  and therewith they set to changing horses the peasants who were standing far off quite silent with reverently bared heads came softly nearer and looked eagerly at the king an old gingerbreadwoman sommelfrau of lebbenichen always knew her afterwards took me in her arm and held me aloft close to the coachwindow i was now at farthest an ell from the king and i felt as if i were looking in the face of god almighty es war mir als ob ich den lieben gott ansahe he was gazing steadily out before him into the glowing west through the front window he had on an old threecornered regimental hat and had put the hindward straight flap of it foremost undoing the loop so that this flap hung down in front and screened him from the sun the hatstrings hutcordons trimmings of silver or gold cord had got torn loose and were fluttering about on this downhanging front flap the white feather in the hat was tattered and dirty the plain blue uniform with red cuffs red collar and gold shoulderbands epaulettes without bush at the end was old and dusty the yellow waistcoat covered with snufffor the rest he had blackvelvet breeches and of course the perpetual boots of which he would allow no polishing or blacking still less any change for new ones while they would hang together i thought always he would speak to me the old woman could not long hold me up and so she set me down again then the king looked at the clergyman beckoned him near and asked whose child it was herr von marwitz of friedersdorfsis that the general no the chamberlain the king made no answer he could not bear chamberlains whom he considered as idle fellows the new horses were yoked away they went all day the peasants had been talking of the king how he would bring this and that into order and pull everybody over the coals who was not agreeable to them  afterwards it turned out that all clergymen were in the habit of giving 10 thalers to the coachman pfund when the king lodged with them the former clergyman of dolgelin had regularly done it but the new one knowing nothing of the custom had omitted it last yearand that was the reason why the fellow had so pushed along all day that he could pass dolgelin before sunset and get his 10 thalers in muncheberg from the burgermeister there  2 january 1785 the second time i saw the king was at the carnival of berlin in 1785 i had gone with my tutor to a cousin of mine who was a hofdame dame de cour to the princess henri and lived accordingly in the princehenri palacewhich is now in our days become the universityher apartments were in the third story and looked out into the garden as we were ascending the great stairs there came dashing past us a little old man with staring eyes jumping down three steps at a time my tutor said in astonishment that is prince henri we now stept into a window of the first story and looked out to see what the little man had meant by those swift boundings of his and lo there came the king in his carriage to visit him  friedrich the second never drove in potsdam except when on journeys but constantly rode he seemed to think it a disgrace and unworthy of a soldier to go in a carriage thus when in the last autumn of his life this very 1785 he was so unwell in the windy sanssouci where there were no stoves but only hearthfires that it became necessary to remove to the schloss in potsdam he could not determine to drive thither but kept hoping from day to day for so much improvement as might allow him to ride as no improvement came and the weather grew ever colder he at length decided to go over under cloud of darkness in a sedanchair that nobody might notice himso likewise during the reviews at berlin or charlottenburg he appeared always on horseback but during the carnival in berlin where he usually stayed four weeks he drove and this always in royal pompthus  ahead went eight runners with their staves plumed caps and runneraprons lauferschurze whatever these are in two rows as these runners were never used for anything except this show the office was a kind of post for invalids of the lifeguard a consequence of which was that the king always had to go at a slow pace his courses however were no other than from the schloss to the opera twice a week and during his whole residence one or two times to prince henri and the princess amelia once always too to dine with his wife to whom he did not speak one word but merely bowed at beginning and ending after this the runners rested again for a year behind them came the royal carriage with a team of eight eight windows round it the horses with oldfashioned harness and plumes on their heads coachman and outriders all in the then royal liveryblue the collar cuffs pockets and all seams trimmed with a stripe of red cloth and this bound on both sides with small goldcord the general effect of which was very good in the four boots nebentritten of the coach stood four pages red with gold in silk stockings featherhats crown all covered with feathers but not having plumesthe valets boot behind empty and to the rear of it down below where one mounts to the valets boot bediententritt what is now become footboard stood a groom stallknecht thus came the king moving slowly along and entered through the portal of the palace we looked down from the window in the stairs prince henri stood at the carriagedoor the pages opened it the king stepped out saluted his brother took him by the hand walked upstairs with him and thus the two passed near us we retiring upstairs to the second story and went into the apartment where now students run leaping about  3 may 23d 1785 the third time i saw him was that same year at berlin still as he returned home from the review may 21st23d rodenbeck iii 327 my tutor had gone with me for that end to the halle gate for we already knew that on that day he always visited his sister princess amelia he came riding on a big white horseno doubt old conde who twenty years after this still got his freeboard in the ecole veterinaire for since the bavarian war 1778 friedrich hardly ever rode any other horse his dress was the same as formerly at dolgelin on the journey only that the hat was in a little better condition properly looped up and with the peak but not with the long peak as is now the fashion set in front in due military style behind him were a guard of generals then the adjutants and finally the grooms of the party the whole rondeel now bellealliance platz and the wilhelmsstrasse were crammed full of people all windows crowded all heads bare everywhere the deepest silence and on all countenances an expression of reverence and confidence as towards the just steersman of all our destinies the king rode quite alone in front and saluted people continually taking off his hat in doing which he observed a very marked gradation according as the onlookers bowing to him from the windows seemed to deserve at one time he lifted the hat a very little at another he took it from his head and held it an instant beside the same at another he sunk it as far as the elbow but these motions lasted continually and no sooner had he put on his hat than he saw other people and again took it off from the halle gate to the kochstrasse he certainly took off his hat 200 times  through this reverent silence there sounded only the trampling of the horses and the shouting of the berlin streetboys who went jumping before him capering with joy and flung up their hats into the air or skipped along close by him wiping the dust from his boots i and my tutor had gained so much room that we could run alongside of him hat in hand among the boysyou see the difference between then and now who was it that then made the noise who maintained a dignified demeanorwho is it that bawls and bellows now nobilities ought to be noble thinks this old marwitz in their reverence to nobleness if nobilities themselves become washed populaces in a manner what are we to say and what value can you put on such bellowing  arrived at the princess amelias palace which lying in the wilhelmsstrasse fronts also into the kochstrasse the crowd grew still denser for they expected him there the forecourt was jammed full yet in the middle without the presence of any police there was open space left for him and his attendants he turned into the court the gateleaves went back and the aged lame princess leaning on two ladies the oberhofmeisterinn chief lady behind her came hitching down the flat steps to meet him so soon as he perceived her he put his horse to the gallop pulled up sprang rapidly down took off his hat which he now however held quite low at the full length of his arm embraced her gave her his arm and again led her up the steps the gateleaves went to all had vanished and the multitude still stood with bared head in silence all eyes turned to the spot where he had disappeared and so it lasted a while till each gathered himself and peacefully went his way  and yet there had nothing happened no pomp no fireworks no cannonshot no drumming and fifing no music no event that had occurred no nothing but an old man of 73 illdressed all dusty was returning from his days work but everybody knew that this old man was toiling also for him that he had set his whole life on that labor and for fiveandforty years had not given it the slip one day every one saw moreover the fruits of this old mans labor near and far and everywhere around and to look on the old man himself awakened reverence admiration pride confidencein short all the nobler feelings of man nachlass des general von der marwitz i 1520  this was may 21st 1785 i think the last time berlin saw its king in that public manner riding through the streets the furstenbund affair is now secretly in a very lively state at berlin and over germany at large and comes to completion in a couple of months henceas shall be noticed farther on     general bouille home from his westindian exploits visits friedrich august 5th11th 1784  in these last years of his life friedrich had many french of distinction visiting him in 1782 the abbe raynal whom except for his power of face he admired little rodenbeck iii 277 n in 1786 mirabeau whose personal qualities seem to have pleased himbut chiefly in the interval between these two various military frenchmen now home with their laurels from the american war coming about his reviews eager to see the great man and be seen by him lafayette segur and many others came of whom the one interesting to us is marquis de bouille already known for his swift sharp operation on the english leeward islands and memorable afterwards to all the world for his presidency in the flight to varennes of poor louis xvi and his queen in 1791 which was by no means so successful the brave bouille as we called him long since when writing of that latter operation elsewhere bouille left memoires of his own which speak of friedrich in the vie de bouille published recently by friendly hands rene de bouille essai sur la vie du marquis de bouille paris 1853 there is summary given of all that his papers say on friedrich this in still briefer shape but unchanged otherwise readers shall now see  in july 1784 marquis de bouille lately returned from a visit to england desirous to see the prussian army and to approach the great friedrich while it was yet time travelled by way of holland to berlin through potsdam no date got to berlin august 6th rodenbeck iii 309 so that we can guess august 5th for his potsdam day saw at sanssouci in the vestibule a bronze bust of charles xii in the diningroom among other pictures a portrait of the chateauroux louis xvs first mistress in the kings bedroom simple campbed coverlet of crimson taffetasrather dirty as well as the other furniture on account of the dogs many books lying about cicero tacitus titus livius in french translations on a chair portrait of kaiser joseph ii

called gortz presented no chamberlain a lieutenantgeneral and much about the king his brother the weimar gortz is gone as prussian minister to petersburg some time ago king talked about the war des isles my westindia war and about england they the english are like sick people who have had a fever and dont know how ill they have been till the fit is over fox he treated as a noisy fellow de brouillon but expressed admiration of young pitt the coolness with which he can stand being not only contradicted but ridiculed and insulted cela parait audessus de la patience humaine king closed the conversation by saying he would be glad to see me in silesia whither he was just about to go for reviews will go in ten days august 15th  friedrich was 72 last january 24th his physiognomy dress appearance are much what the numerous wellknown portraits represent him at court and on great ceremonies he appears sometimes in blackcolored stockings rolled over the knee and rosecolored or skyblue coat bleu celeste he is fond of these colors as his furniture too shows the marquis dined with the prince of prussia without previous presentation so simple are the manners of this soldier court the heir presumptive lodges at a brewers house and in a very mean way is not allowed to sleep from home without permission from the king  bouille set out for silesia 11th august was at neisse in good time went at 5 am date is august 19th review lasts till 24th rodenbeck iii 310 to see the king mount all the generals prince of prussia among them waited in the street outside of a very simple house where the king lodged after waiting half an hour his majesty appeared saluted very graciously without uttering a word this was one of his special reviews that was it he rode marchait generally alone in utter silence it was then that he had his regard terrible and his features took the impress of severity to say no more is displeased with the review i doubt though bouille saw nothing amissand merely tells us farther at the reviews the king inspects strictly one regiment after another it is he that selects the very corporals and sergeants much more the upper officers nominating for vacancies what cadets are to fill themall of whom are nobles yes with rare exceptions all friedrich democratic as his temper was is very strict on this point because says he repeatedly nobles have honor a noble that misbehaves or flinches in the moment of crisis can find no refuge in his own class whereas a man of lower birth always can in his oeuvres de frederic more than once bouille continues  after review dined with his majesty just before dinner he gave to the assembled generals the order for tomorrows manoeuvres as we saw in conways case ten years ago this lasted about a quarter of an hour king then saluted everybody taking off tresaffectueusement his hat which he immediately put on again had now his affable mien and was most polite to the strangers present at dinner conversation turned on the wars of louis xiv then on englishamerican warking always blaming the english whom he does not like dinner lasted three hours his majesty said more than once to me in ill humor i should almost guess and wishful to hide it complete freedom here as if we were in our tavern sir ici toute liberte monsieur comme si nous etions au cabaret on the morrow august 20th dined again king talked of france of cardinal richelieu whose principles of administration he praised repeated several times that he did not think the french nation fit for free government at the reviews friedrich did not himself command but prescribed and followed the movements criticised reprimanded and so forth on horseback six hours together without seeming fatigued  king left for breslau 25th august 24th if it were of moment bouille followed thither dined again besides officers there were present several polish princes the bishop of the diocese and the abbot bastiani king made pleasantries about religion pity that bastiani not slow with repartees of a defensive kind king told me on one occasion would you believe it i have just been putting my poor jesuits finances into order they understand nothing of such things ces bons hommes they are useful to me in forming my catholic clergy i have arranged it with his holiness the pope who is a friend of mine and behaves very well to me pointing from the window to the convent of capuchins those fellows trouble me a little with their bellringings they offered to stop it at night for my sake but i declined one must leave everybody to his trade theirs is to pray and i should have been sorry to deprive them of their chimes carillon  the 20000 troops assembled at breslau did not gain the kings approvalfar from it alas as we shall all see to some chiefs of corps he said vous ressemblez plus a des tailleurs qua des militaires you are more like tailors than soldiers he cashiered several and even sent one majorgeneral to prison for six weeks that of the tailors and majorgeneral erlach clapt in prison is too truenor is that the saddest part of the affair to us bouille was bound now on an excursion to prag to a camp of the kaisers there mind said the king

courtfellows with their red heels and delicate nerves make very bad soldiers saxe often told me in his flanders campaigns the courtiers gave him more trouble than did cumberland talked of marechal richelieu of louis xiv whose apology he skilfully made blamed however the revocation of the edict of nantes great attachment of the protestant refugees to france and its king would you believe it said he under louis xiv they and their families used to assemble on the day of st louis to celebrate the fete of the king who persecuted them expressed pity for louis xv and praised his goodnature  friedrich in his conversation showed a modesty which seemed a little affected sil mest permis davoir une opinion a common expression of hissaid opinion on most things on medicine among others being

only a part of the truth here to the person chiefly responsible is an indignant letter of the kings to a notable degree full of settled wrath against one who is otherwise a dear old friend   friedrich to lieutenantgeneral tauentzien infantry inspectorgeneral of silesia  potsdam 7th september 1784  my dear general von tauentzienwhile in silesia i mentioned to you and will now repeat in writing that my army in silesia was at no time so bad as at present were i to make shoemakers or tailors into generals the regiments could not be worse regiment thadden is not fit to be the most insignificant militia battalion of a prussian army rothkirch and schwartzbad as possible all of themof erlach the men are so spoiled by smuggling sad industry instead of drilling they have no resemblance to soldiers keller is like a heap of undrilled boors hager has a miserable commander and your own regiment is very mediocre only with graf von anhalt in spite of his head with wendessen and margraf heinrich could i be content see you that is the state i found the regiments in one after one i will now speak of their manoeuvring in our mimic battles on the late occasion  schwartz at neisse made the unpardonable mistake of not sufficiently besetting the height on the left wing had it been serious the battle had been lost at breslau erlach who is a majorgeneral forsooth instead of covering the army by seizing the heights marched off with his division straight as a row of cabbages into that defile whereby had it been earnest the enemys cavalry would have cut down our infantry and the fight was gone  it is not my purpose to lose battles by the base conduct lachete of my generals wherefore i hereby appoint that you next year if i be alive assemble the army between breslau and ohlau and for four days before i arrive in your camp carefully manoeuvre with the ignorant generals and teach them what their duty is regiment von arnim and garrisonregiment von kanitz are to act the enemy and whoever does not then fulfil his duty shall go to courtmartialfor i should think it shame of any country jeden puissance to keep such people who trouble themselves so little about their business erlach sits four weeks longer in arrest to have six weeks of it in full and you have to make known this my present declared will to your whole inspectionf rodenbeck iii 311  what a peppering is the excellent old tauentzien getting here is a case for kaltenborn and the sympathies of opposition people but alas this king knows that armies are not to be kept at the working point on cheaper termsthough some have tried it by grog by sweetmeats sweetspeeches and found it in the end come horribly dearer one thing is certain the silesian reviews next year if this king be alive will be a terrible matter and military gentlemen had better look to themselves in time kaltenborns sympathy will help little nothing but knowing ones duty and visibly and indisputably doing it will the least avail  just in the days when bouille left him for france friedrich october 1784 had conceived the notion of some general confederation or combination in the reich to resist the continual encroachments of austria which of late are becoming more rampant than ever thus in the last year especially within the last six months a poor bishop of passau quasibavarian or in theory sovereign bishop of the reich is getting himself pulled to pieces diocese torn asunder and masses of it forcibly sewed on to their new bishopric of vienna in the most tragic manner in spite of express treaties and of all the

to the much of panisbriefe and the like which had preceded friedrich though studiously saying almost nothing had been paying the utmost of attentionpart of prince henris errand to france is thought to have been to take soundings on those matters on which france proves altogether willing if able and now in the general emotion about passau friedrich jots down in a note to hertzberg the above idea with order to put it into form a little and consult about it in the reich with parties interested hertzberg took the thing up with zeal instructed the prussian envoys to inquire cautiously everywhere

segur says with lively curiosity i gazed at this man there as he stood great in genius small in stature stooping and as it were bent down under the weight of his laurels and of his long toils his blue coat old and worn like his body his long boots coming up above the knee his waistcoat covered with snuff formed an odd but imposing whole by the fire of his eyes you recognized that in essentials he had not grown old though bearing himself like an invalid you felt that he could strike like a young soldier in his small figure you discerned a spirit greater than any other mans  if used at all to intercourse with the great world and possessed of any elevation of mind you have no embarrassment in speaking to a king but to a great man you present yourself not without fear friedrich in his private sphere was of sufficiently unequal humor wayward wilful open to prejudices indulged in mockery often enough epigrammatic upon the frenchagreeable in a high degree to strangers whom he pleased to favor but bitterly piquant for those he was prepossessed against or who without knowing it had illchosen the hour of approaching him to me luck was kind in all these points my interview delightful

on josephs notions of making the reich a reality his reforms and ambitions had thenceforth to take other directions and leave the poor old reich at peace a mighty reformer he had been the greatest of his day broke violently in upon quiescent austrian routine on every side monkeries schoolpedantries trademonopolies serfagesall things military and civil spiritual and temporal he had resolved to make perfect in a minimum of time austria gazed on him its admiration not unmixed with terror he rushed incessantly about hardy as a charles twelfth slept on his bearskin on the floor of any inn or hutflew at the throat of every absurdity however broadbased or dangerously armed disappear i say will hurl you an official of rank where need is into the pillory sets him in one actual instance to permanent sweeping of the streets in vienna a most prompt severe and yet beneficent and charitable kind of man immensely ambitious that must be said withal a great admirer of friedrich bent to imitate him with profit very clever indeed says friedrich but has the fault a terribly grave one of generally taking the second step without having taken the first  a troublesome neighbor he proved to everybody not by his reforms aloneand ended pretty much as here in the furstenbund by having in all matters to give in and desist in none of his foreign ambitions could he succeed in none of his domestic reforms in regard to these latter somebody remarks no austrian man or thing articulately contradicted his fine efforts that way but inarticulately the whole weight of austrian vis inertiae bore day and night against himwhereby as we now see he bearing the other way with the force of a steamram a hundred tons to the square inch the one result was to dislocate every joint in the austrian edifice and have it ready for the napoleonic earthquakes that ensued in regard to ambitions abroad it was no better the dutch fired upon his scheld frigate war if you will you most aggressive kaiser but this toll is ours his netherlands revolted against him can holy religion and old useandwont be tumbled about at this rate his grand russian copartneries and turk war went to water and disaster his reforms one and all had to be revoked for the present poor joseph brokenhearted for his private griefs were many too lay down to die you may put for epitaph said he with a tone which is tragical and pathetic to us here lies joseph the grandly attempting joseph who could succeed in nothing died at vienna 20th february 1790 still under fiftyborn there 13th march 1741 hormayr oesterreichischer plutarch iv 2tes 125223 and five or six recent lives of joseph none of which that i have seen was worth reading in comparison a man of very high qualities and much too conscious of them a man of an ambition without bounds one of those fatal men fatal to themselves first of all who mistake halfgenius for whole and rush on the second step without having made the first cannot trouble the old king or us any more     chapter ixfriedrichs last illness and death  to the present class of readers furstenbund is become a nothing to all of us the grand something now is strangely enough that incidental item which directly followed of reviewing the silesian soldieries who had so angered his majesty last year if i be alive next year said the king to tauentzien the king kept his promise and the fates had appointed that in doing so he was to find hisbut let us not yet pronounce the word  august 16th 1785 some three weeks after finishing the furstenbund friedrich set out for silesia towards strehlen long known to him and us allat grosstinz a village in that neighborhood the camp and review are to be he goes by crossen glogau in a circling direction glogau schweidnitz silberberg glatz all his fortresses are to be inspected as well and there is much miscellaneous business by the road at hirschberg not on the military side we have sight of him the account of which is strange to read  thursday august 18th says a private letter from that little town given in extenso rodenbeck iii 331333 he passed through here concourse of many thousands from all the country about had been waiting for him several hours outriders came at last then he himself the unique and with the liveliest expression of reverence and love all eyes were directed on one point i cannot describe to you my feelings which of course were those of everybody to see him the aged king in his weak hand the hat in those grand eyes such a fatherly benignity of look over the vast crowd that encircled his carriage and rolled tidelike accompanying it looking round when he was past i saw in various eyes a tear trembling alas we shant have him long  his affability his kindliness to whoever had the honor of speech with this great king who shall describe it after talking a good while with the merchantsdeputation from the hill country he said is there anything more then from anybody upon which the president kaufmannsalteste merchantseldest lachmann from greiffenberg which had been burnt lately and helped by the king to rebuild itself stepped forward and said the burntout inhabitants of greiffenberg had charged him to express once more their most submissive gratitude for the gracious help in rebuilding their word of thanks truly was of no importance but they daily prayed god to reward such royal beneficence the king was visibly affected and said you dont need to thank me when my subjects fall into misfortune it is my duty to help them up again for that reason am i here  saturday 20th he arrived at tinz had a small cavalry manoeuvre next day and on monday the review proper began lasted four days22d25th august monday to thursday both inclusive headquarter was in the dorfschulzes village mayors house and there were many strangers of distinction quartered in the country mansions round grosstinz is about 12 miles straight north from strehlen and as far straight east from the zobtenberg grosstinz and its review of august 1785 ought to be long memorable  how the review turned out as to proficiency recovered i have not heard and only infer by symptoms that it was not unsatisfactory the sure fact and the forever memorable is that on wednesday the third day of it from 4 in the morning when the manoeuvres began till well after 10 when they ended there was a rain like noahs rain falling as from buckets and waterspouts and that friedrich and perhaps most others too so intent upon his business paid not the least regard to it but rode about intensely inspecting in lynxeyed watchfulness of everything as if no rain had been there was not at the pains even to put on his cloak six hours of such downpour and a weakly old man of 73 past of course he was wetted to the bone on returning to headquarters his boots were found full of water when pulled off it came pouring from them like a pair of pails  he got into dry clothes presided in his usual way at dinner which soon followed had many generals and guestslafayette lord cornwallis duke of yorkand as might be expected felt unusually feverish afterwards hot chill quite poorly all afternoon glad to get to bedwhere he fell into deep sleep into profuse perspiration as his wont was and awoke next morning greatly recovered altogether well again as he supposed well enough to finish his review comfortably and start for home wentround by neisse inspection not to be omitted there though it doubles the distanceto brieg that day a drive of 80 miles inspectionwork included thence at breslan for three days more with dinners of state balls illuminations in honor of the duke of yorkour as yet last duke of york then a brisk young fellow of twentytwo to whom by accident among his other distinctions may belong this of having most involuntarily helped to kill friedrich the great  back to potsdam friedrich pushed on with business and complained of nothing was at berlin in about ten days september 9th for an artillery review saw his sister amelia saw various public works in a state of progressbut what perhaps is medically significant went in the afternoon to a kind of spa well they have at berlin and slept not at the palace but at this spa in the hostelry or lodginghouse attached rodenbeck in die next day september 10th the artillery manoeuvre was done and the king left berlinlittle guessing he had seen berlin for the last time  the truth is his health unknown to him though that of taking a night at the spa well probably denotes some guess or feeling of the kind on his part must have been in a dangerous or almost ruinous state accordingly soon afterwards september 18th19th in the nighttime he was suddenly aroused by a fit of suffocation what they call stickfluss and for some hours till relief was got everybody feared he would perish next day there came gout which perhaps he regarded almost as a friend but it did not prove such it proved the captain of a chaotic company of enemies and friedrichs end i suppose was already inexorably near at the grand potsdam review 22d23d september chief review of all and with such an affluence of strangers to it this autumn he was quite unable to appear prescribed the manoeuvres and procedures and sorrowfully kept his room this of 23d september 1785 is what printcollectors know loosely as friedrichs last reviewone cunningham an english painter son of a jacobite ditto and himself of wandering habitat and clemens a prussian engraver having done a very large and highly superior print of it by way of speculation in military portraits berlin 1787 in which among many others there figures the crediblest likeness known to me of friedrich in old age though friedrich himself was not there see preuss iv 242 especially see rodenbeck iii 337 nas crownprince friedrich had sat to pesne never afterwards to any artist  friedrich was always something of a doctor himself he had little faith in professional doctors though he liked to speak with the intelligent sort and was curious about their science and it is agreed he really had good notions in regard to it in particular that he very well understood his own constitution of body knew the effects of causes there at any rate and the fit regimens and methodsas an old man of sense will usually do the complaint is that he was not always faithful to regimen that in his old days at least he loved strong soups hot spicy meatsfinding i suppose a kind of stimulant in them as others do in wine a sudden renewal of strength which might be very tempting to him there has been a great deal of unwise babble on this subject which i find no reason to believe except as just said in the fall of this year as usual perhaps rather later than usualnot till november 8th for what reason so delaying marwitz told us alreadyhe withdrew from sanssouci his summercottage shut himself up in potsdam palace old palace for the winter it was known he was very ailing and that he never stirred outbut this was not quite unusual in late winters and the rumors about his health were vague and various now as always he himself except to his doctors was silent on that subject various military doctors theden frese and others of eminence were within reach but it is not known to me that he consulted any of them  not till january 1786 when symptoms worse than ever of asthma of dropsy began to manifest themselves did he call in selle the chief berlin doctor and a man of real sagacity as is still evident who from the first concluded the disease to be desperate but of course began some alleviatory treatment the skilfulest possible to him christian gottlieb selle krankheitsgeschichte des hochstseeligen konigs van preussen friedrichs des zweyten majestat berlin 1786 a very small pamphlet now very raregiving in the most distinct intelligent modest and conclusive way an account of everything pertinent and rigorously of nothing else selle when questioned kept his worst fears carefully to himself but the king noticed selles real opinionwhich probably was the kings own tooand finding little actual alleviation a good deal of trouble and no possibility of a victorious result by this warfare on the outworks began to be weary of selle and to turn his hopeswhat hopes he yet hadon the fine weather soon due he had a continual short small cough which much troubled him there was fear of new suffocationfit the breathing always difficult  but spring came unusually mild the king sat on the southern balconies in the genial sun and air looking over the bright sky and earth and new birth of things were i at sanssouci amid the gardens thought he april 17th he shifted thither not in a sedan as marwitz told us of the former journey but in his carriage very early in the morning making a long roundabout through various villages with new relaysprobably with the motive marwitz assigns here are two contemporaneous excerpts  1 mirabeau at sanssouci this same day april 17th it appears preuss in oeuvres de frederic xxv 328 n the king saw mirabeau for the second and last time mirabeau had come to berlin 19th january last his errand not very preciseexcept that he infinitely wanted employment and that at paris the controllergeneral calonne since so famous among mankind had evidently none to offer him there he seems to have intended russia and employment with the czarinaafter viewing berlin a little with the great flashy eyesight he had he first saw friedrich january 25th there pass in all between friedrich and him seven letters or notes two of them by the king and on poor mirabeaus side it must be owned there is a massively respectful truthful and manly physiognomy which probably has mended friedrichs first opinion of him  is coming to me today one of those loosetongued fellows i suppose who write for and against all the world friedrich to prince henri 25 january 1786 oeuvres de frederic xxvi 522 this day april 17th 1786 he is at potsdam so far on the road to france againmirabeau senior being reported dangerously ill my dialogue with the king say the mirabeau papers was very lively but the king was in such suffering and so straitened for breath i was myself anxious to shorten it that same evening i travelled on  mirabeau senior did not die at this time and controllergeneral calonne now again eager to shake off an importunate and far too clearsighted mirabeau junior said to the latter back to berlin could nt you their king is dying a new king coming highly important to usand poor mirabeau went left paris again in may with money furnished but no other outfit and more in the character of newspaper vulture than of diplomatic envoy rodenbeck iii 343 fils adoptif memoires de mirabeau paris 1834 iv 288292 296 as perhaps we may transiently see  2 marie antoinette at versailles to her sister christine at brussels husband and she duke and duchess of sachsenteschen are governors of the netherlands  march 20th 1786 there has been arrested at geneva one villette who played a great part in that abominable affair of the diamond necklace now emerging on an astonished queen and world carlyles miscellanies library edition v 396 diamond necklace the wretched cardinal de rohan was arrested at versailles and put in the bastille august 15th 1785 the day before friedrich set out for his silesian review ever since which the arrestments and judicial investigations have continuedcontinue till may 10th 1786 when sentence was given m target advocate of the enchanted cardinal is coming out with his memoir he does his function and god knows what are the lies he will produce upon us there is a memoir by that quack of a cagliostro too these are at this moment the theme of all talk  april 6th the memoirs the lies succeed each other and the business grows darker not clearer such a cardinal of the church he brazenly maintains his distracted story about the bosquet interview with me in person in that hornbeam arbor at versailles to me inconceivable not yet knowing of a demoiselle doliva from the streets who had acted my part there and my assent to purchase the necklace for me his impudence and his audacity surpass belief o sister i need all my strength to support such cruel assaults the king of prussias condition much engages attention preoccupe here and must do at vienna too his death is considered imminent i am sure you have your eyes open on that side  april 17th just while the mirabeau interview at potsdam is going on king of prussia thought to be dying i am weary of the political discussions on this subject as to what effects his death must produce he is better at this moment but so weak he cannot resist long physique is gone but his force and energy of soul they say have often supported him and in desperate crises have even seemed to increase liking to him i never had his ostentatious immorality immoralite affichee ah madame has much hurt public virtue public orthodoxy i mean and there have been related to me by mendacious or illinformed persons barbarities which excite horror he has done us all a great deal of ill he has been a king for his own country but a troublefeast for those about himsetting up to be the arbiter of europe always undertaking on his neighbors and making them pay the expense as daughters of maria theresa it is impossible we can regret him nor is it the court of france that will

sanssouci the king did appear again on horseback rode out several times conde a fine english horse one of his favorites carrying himthe conde who had many years of sinecure afterwards and was well known to touring people the rides were short once to the new palace to look at some new vinery there thence to the gate of potsdam which he was for entering but finding masons at work and the street encumbered did not and rode home instead this of not above two miles was his longest ride of all selles attendance less and less in esteem with the king and less and less followed by him did not quite cease till june 4th that day the king had said to selle or to himself it is enough that longest of his rides was in the third week after june 22d midsummerday july 4th he rode again and it was for the last time about two weeks after conde was again brought out but it would not do adieu my conde not possible as things are  during all this while and to the very end friedrichs affairs great and small were in every branch and item guided on by him with a perfection not surpassed in his palmiest days he saw his ministers saw all who had business with him many who had little and in the sore coil of bodily miseries as hertzberg observed with wonder never was the kings intellect clearer or his judgment more just and decisive of his disease except to the doctors he spoke no word to anybody the body of friedrich is a ruin but his soul is still here and receives his friends and his tasks as formerly asthma dropsy erysipelas continual want of sleep for many months past he has not been in bed but sits day and night in an easychair unable to get breath except in that posture he said one morning to somebody entering if you happened to want a nightwatcher i could suit you well  his multifarious military businesses come first then his three clerks with the civil and political these three he latterly instead of calling about 6 or 7 oclock has had to appoint for 4 each morning my situation forces me his message said to give them this trouble which they will not have to suffer long my life is on the decline the time which i still have i must employ it belongs not to me but to the state preuss iv 257 n about 11 business followed by short surgical details or dressings sadly insisted on in those books and in themselves sufficiently sad being all donehis friends or daily company are admitted five chiefly or not counting minister hertzberg four lucchesini schwerin pinto gortz who sit with him about one hour now and two hours in the evening againdreary company to our minds perhaps not quite so dreary to the kings but they are all he has left and he talks cheerfully with them on literature history on the topics of the day or whatever topic rises as if there were no sickness here a man adjusted to his hard circumstances and bearing himself manlike and kinglike among them  he well knew himself to be dying but some think expected that the end might be a little farther off there is a grand simplicity of stoicism in him coming as if by nature or by long secondnature finely unconscious of itself and finding nothing of peculiar in this new trial laid on it from of old life has been infinitely contemptible to him in death i think he has neither fear nor hope atheism truly he never could abide to him as to all of us it was flatly inconceivable that intellect moral emotion could have been put into him by an entity that had none of its own but there pretty much his theism seems to have stopped instinctively too he believed no man more firmly that right alone has ultimately any strength in this world ultimately yesbut for him and his poor brief interests what good was it hope for himself in divine justice in divine providence i think he had not practically any that the unfathomable demiurgus should concern himself with such a set of paltry illgiven animalcules as oneself and mankind are this also as we have often noticed is in the main incredible to him  a sad creed this of the kingshe had to do his duty without fee or reward yes readerand what is well worth your attention you will have difficulty to find in the annals of any creed a king or man who stood more faithfully to his duty and till the last hour alone concerned himself with doing that to poor friedrich that was all the law and all the prophets and i much recommend you to surpass him if you by good luck have a better copy of those inestimable documentsinarticulate notions fancies transient aspirations he might have in the background of his mind one day sitting for a while out of doors gazing into the sun he was heard to murmur perhaps i shall be nearer thee soonand indeed nobody knows what his thoughts were in these final months there is traceable only a complete superiority to fear and hope in parts too are halfglimpses of a great motionless interior lake of sorrow sadder than any tears or complainings which are altogether wanting to it  friedrichs dismissal of selle june 4th by no means meant that he had given up hope from medicine on the contrary two days after he had a letter on the road for zimmermann at hanover whom he always remembers favorably since that dialogue we read fifteen years ago his first note to zimmermann is of june 6th would you consent to come for a fortnight and try upon me zimmermanns overjoyed answer yes thrice surely yes is of june 10th friedrichs second is of june 16th come then and zimmermann came accordinglyas is still too well known arrived 23d june stayed till 10th july had thirtythree interviews or dialogues with him one visit the last day two morning and evening every preceding dayand published a book about them which made immense noise in the world and is still read with little profit or none by inquirers into friedrich ritter von zimmermann uber friedrich den grossen und meine unterredungen mit ihm kurz von seinem tode 1 vol 8vo leipzig 1788followed by fragmente uber friedrich den grossen 3 vols 12mo leipzig 1790 and by c c thirtythree dialogues throwing no new light on friedrich none of them equal in interest to the old specimen known to us  in fact the book turns rather on zimmermann himself than on his royal patient and might be entitled as it was by a satirist dialogues of zimmermann i and friedrich ii an unwise book abounding in exaggeration breaking out continually into extraneous sallies and extravaganciesthe source of which is too plainly an immense conceit of oneself zimmermann is fifteen years older since we last saw him a man now verging towards sixty but has not grown wiser in proportion in hanover though miraculously healed of that leibesschade and full of high hopes he has had his new tribulations new compensationsboth of an agitating character there arose he says in reference to some medical reviewarticle he wrote a weiberepidemik a universal shrieking combination of all the women against mea frightful accident while it lasted then his little daughter died on his hands his son had disorders nervous imbecilitiesdid not die but did worse went into hopeless idiotcy and so lived for many years zimmermann being dreadfully miserable hypochondriac what not his friends he himself passive it would seem managed to get a young wife for him thirty years younger than hewhose performances however in this difficult post are praised  lastly not many months ago leipzig 1785 the big final edition of solitude four volumes has come out to the joy and enthusiasm of all philanthropicphilosophic and other circulatinglibrary creaturesa copy of which came by course of nature not by zimmermanns help into the hands of catharine of russia sublime imperial letter thereupon with valuable diamond ring invitation to come to petersburg with charges borne declined on account of health to be imperial physician likewise declinedin fine continued correspondence with catharine trying enough for a vain head and knighthood of the order of st wladimirso that at least doctor zimmermann is ritter zimmermann henceforth and now here has come his new visit to friedrich the greatwhich with the issues it had and the tempestuous cloud of tumid speculations and chaotic writings it involved him in quite upset the poor ritter doctor so that hypochondrias deepening to the abysmal his fine intellect sank altogetherand only death which happily followed soon could disimprison him at this moment there is in zimmermann a worse dropsy of the spiritual kind than this of the physical which he has come in relief of  excerpts of those zimmermann dialogues lie copiously round me ready long agonay i understand there is or was an english translation of the whole of them better or worse for behoof of the curiousbut on serious consideration now i have to decide that they are but as a scene of clowns in the elder dramatists which even were it not overdone as it is cannot be admitted in this place and is plainly impertinent in the tragedy that is being acted here something of farce will often enough in this irreverent world intrude itself on the most solemn tragedy but in pity even to the farce there ought at least to be closed doors kept between them  enough for us to say that ritter zimmermannwho is a physician and a man of literary genius and should not have become a tragic zanydid with unspeakable emotions terrors prayers to heaven and paroxysms of his own ridiculous kind prescribe syrup of dandelion to the king talked to him soothingly musically successfully found the king a most pleasant talker but a very wilful perverse kind of patient whose errors in point of diet especially were enormous to a degree truth is the kings appetite for food did still surviveand this might have been you would think the one hopeful basis of zimmermanns whole treatment if there were still any hope but no zimmermann merely with uncommon emphasis lyrically recognizes such amazing appetite in an old man overwhelmed by diseasestrumpets it abroad for ignorant persons to regard as a crime or perhaps as a type generally of the mans past life and makes no other attempt upon itstands by his extract of dandelion boiled to the consistency of honey and on the seventeenth day july 10th voiceless from emotion heart just breaking takes himself away and ceases one of our notes says  zimmermann went by dessau and brunswick at brunswick if he made speed thither zimmermann might perhaps find mirabeau who is still there and just leaving for berlin to be in at the deathbut if the doctor and he missed each other it was luckier as they had their controversies afterwards mirabeau arrived at berlin july 21st mirabeau histoire secrete de la cour de berlin tome iii of oeuvres de mirabeau paris 1821 lettre v p 37 vastly diligent in picking up news

hertzberg had come out to potsdam in permanence hertzberg is privately thenceforth in communication with the successor altogether privately though no doubt friedrich knew it well enough and saw it to be right of course all manner of poor creatures are diligent about their own bits of interests and saying to themselves a new reign is evidently nigh yes my friendsand a precious reign it will prove in comparison sensualities unctuous religiosities ostentations imbecilities culminating in jena twenty years hence  zimmermann haggles to tell us what his report was at brunswick says he set the duke erbprinz who is now duke these six years past sobbing and weeping though towards the widow duchess there must have been some hope held out as we shall now see the duchesss letter or letters to her

who had been in waiting so long and gave with his old precision the orders wantedone to rohdich commandant of potsdam about a review of the troops there next day order minutely perfect in knowledge of the ground in foresight of what and how the evolutions were to be which was accordingly performed on the morrow the cabinet work he went through with the like possession of himself giving on every point his three clerks their directions in a weak voice yet with the old power of spiritdictated to one of them among other things an instruction for some ambassador just leaving four quarto pages which says hertzberg would have done honor to the most experienced minister and in the evening he signed his missives as usual this evening stillbutno evening more we are now at the last scene of all which ends this strange eventful history  wednesday morning generaladjutants secretaries commandant were there at their old hours but word came out secretaries are to wait king is in a kind of sleep

parole as usual tried twice perhaps three times but found he could not speakand with a glance of sorrow which seemed to say it is impossible then turned his head and sank back into the corner of his chair rohdich burst into tears the king again lay slumberousthe rattle of death beginning soon after which lasted at intervals all day selle in berlin was sent for by express he arrived about three of the afternoon king seemed a little more conscious knew those about him his face red rather than pale in his eyes still something of their old fire towards evening the feverishness abated to selle i suppose a fatal symptom the king fell into a soft sleep with warm perspiration but on awakening complained of cold repeatedly of cold demanding wrappage after wrappage kissen soft quilt of the old fashionand on examining feet and legs one of the doctors made signs that they were in fact cold up nearly to the knee what said he of the feet murmured the king some time afterwards the doctor having now stepped out of sight much the same as before answered some attendant the king shook his head incredulous  he drank once grasping the goblet with both hands a draught of fennelwater his customary drink and seemed relieved by ithis last refection in this world towards nine in the evening there had come on a continual short cough and a rattling in the breast breath more and more difficult why continue friedrich is making exit on the common terms you may hear the curtain rustling down for most part he was unconscious never more than half conscious as the wallclock above his head struck 11

ingenious man as they all seem to be and excellently chosen for the object strutzki to save the king from hustling down as he always did into the corner of his chair where with neck and chest bent forward breathing was impossibleat last took the king on his knee kneeling on the ground with his other knee for the purposekings right arm round strutzkis neck strutzkis left arm round the kings back and supporting his other shoulder in which posture the faithful creature for above two hours sat motionless till the end came within doors all is silence except this breathing around it the dark earth silent above it the silent stars at 20 minutes past 2 the breathing pausedwavered ceased friedrichs lifebattle is fought out instead of suffering and sore labor here is now rest thursday morning 17th august 1786 at the dark hour just named on the 31st of may last this king had reigned 46 years he has lived counts rodenbeck 74 years 6 months and 24 days  his death seems very stern and lonelya man of such affectionate feelings too a man with more sensibility than other men but so had his whole life been stern and lonely such the severe law laid on him nor was it inappropriate that he found his death in that poor silesian review punctually doing as usual the work that had come in hand nor that he died now rather than a few years later in these final days of his we have transiently noticed

smelling eagerly for news had ridden out towards potsdam met the page riding furiously for selle one horse already broken down say the peasants about and with beak powerful beyond any other vultures mirabeau perceived that here the end now was and thereupon rushed off to make arrangements for a courier for flying pigeons and the other requisites and appeared that night at the queens soiree in

buried at sanssouci in the tomb which he had built for himself why not nobody clearly says by his own express will there was no embalming two regimentsurgeons washed the corpse decently prepared it for interment at 8 that same evening friedrichs body dressed in the uniform of the first battalion of guards and laid in its coffin was borne to potsdam in a hearse of eight horses twelve noncommissioned officers of the guard escorting all potsdam was in the streets the soldiers of their own accord formed rank and followed the hearse many a rugged face unable to restrain tears for the
