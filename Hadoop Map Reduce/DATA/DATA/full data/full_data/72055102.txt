marries     marriage  chapter the first  a day with the popes   § 1  an extremely pretty girl occupied a secondclass compartment in one of those trains which percolate through the rural tranquillities of middle england from ganford in oxfordshire to rumbold junction in kent she was going to join her family at buryhamstreet after a visit to some gloucestershire friends her father mr pope once a leader in the coachbuilding world and now by retirement a gentleman had taken the buryhamstreet vicarage furnished for two months beginning on the fifteenth of july at his maximum summer rental of seven guineas a week his daughter was on her way to this retreat  at first she had been an animated traveller erect and keenly regardful of every detail upon the platforms of the stations at which her conveyance lingered but the tedium of the journey and the warmth of the sunny afternoon had relaxed her pose by imperceptible degrees and she sat now comfortably in the corner with her neat toes upon the seat before her ready to drop them primly at the first sign of a fellowtraveller her expression lapsed more and more towards an almost somnolent reverie she wished she had not taken a secondclass ticket because then she might have afforded a cup of tea at reading and so fortified herself against this insinuating indolence  she was travelling second class instead of third as she ought to have done through one of those lapses so inevitable to young people in her position the two carmel boys and a cousin two greyhounds and a chow had come to see her off they had made a brilliant and prosperous group on the platform and extorted the manifest admiration of two youthful porters and it had been altogether too much for marjorie pope to admit it was the family customexcept when her fathers nerves had to be consideredto go third class so she had made a hasty calculationshe knew her balance to a penny because of the recent tippingand found it would just run to it fourpence remainedand there would be a porter at buryhamstreet  her mother had said you will have ample well opinions of amplitude vary with numerous details fresh in her mind marjorie decided it would be wiser to avoid financial discussion during her first few days at buryhamstreet  there was much in marjories equipment in the key of travelling second class at the sacrifice of afternoon tea there was for example a certain quiet goodness of style about her clothes though the skirt betrayed age and an entire absence of style about her luggage which was all in the compartment with her and which consisted of a distended holdall a very good tennis racquet in a stretcher a portmanteau of cheap white basketwork held together by straps and a very new expensivelooking and meretricious dressingbag of imitation morocco which had been one of her chief financial errors at oxbridge the collection was eloquent indeed of incompatible standards  marjorie had a chin that was small in size if resolute in form and a mouth that was not noticeably soft and weak because it was conspicuously soft and pretty her nose was delicately aquiline and very subtly and finely modelled and she looked out upon the world with steady greyblue eyes beneath broad level brows that contradicted in a large measure the hint of weakness below she had an abundance of copperred hair which flowed back very prettily from her broad low forehead and over her delicate ears and she had that warmtinted clear skin that goes so well with reddish hair she had a very dainty neck and the long slender lines of her body were full of the promise of a riper beauty she had the good open shoulders of a tennisplayer and a swimmer some day she was to be a tall ruddy beautiful woman she wore simple clothes of silvery grey and soft green and about her waist was a belt of grey leather in which there now wilted two creamypetalled roses  that was the visible marjorie somewhere out of time and space was an invisible marjorie who looked out on the world with those steady eyes and smiled or drooped with the soft red lips and dreamt and wondered and desired   § 2  what a queer thing the invisible human being would appear if by some discovery as yet inconceivable some spiritual xray photography we could flash it into sight long ago i read a book called soul shapes that was full of ingenious ideas but i doubt very much if the thing so revealed would have any shape any abiding solid outline at all it is something more fluctuating and discursive than thatat any rate for every one young enough not to have set and hardened things come into it and become it things drift out of it and cease to be it things turn upside down in it and change and colour and dissolve and grow and eddy about and blend into each other one might figure it i suppose as a preposterous jumble animated by a will a floundering disconnectedness through which an old hump of impulse rises and thrusts unaccountably a river beast of purpose wallowing in a back eddy of mud and weeds and floating objects and creatures drowned now the sunshine of gladness makes it all vivid now it is sombre and grimly insistent under the sky of some darkling mood now an emotional gale sweeps across it and it is one confused agitation  and surely these invisible selves of men were never so jumbled so crowded complicated and stirred about as they are at the present time once i am told they had a sort of order were sphered in religious beliefs crystal clear were arranged in a cosmogony that fitted them as hand fits glove were separated by definite standards of right and wrong which presented life as planned in all its essential aspects from the cradle to the grave things are so no longer that sphere is broken for most of us even if it is tied about and mended again it is burst like a seed case things have fallen out and things have fallen in  can i convey in any measure how it was with marjorie  what was her religion  in college forms and returns and suchlike documents she would describe herself as church of england she had been baptized according to the usages of that body but she had hitherto evaded confirmation into it and although it is a large wealthy and powerful organization with many minds to serve it it had never succeeded in getting into her quick and apprehensive intelligence any lucid and persuasive conception of what it considered god and the universe were up to with her it had failed to catch her attention and state itself to her a number of humorous and other writers and the general trend of talk around her and perhaps her own shrewd little observation of superficial things had on the other hand created a fairly definite belief in her that it wasnt as a matter of fact up to very much at all that what it said wasnt said with that absolute honesty which is a logical necessity in every religious authority and that its hierarchy had all sorts of political and social considerations confusing its treatment of her immortal soul  marjorie followed her father in abstaining from church he too professed himself church of england but he was if we are to set aside merely superficial classifications an irascible atheist with a respect for usage and good taste and an abject fear of the disapproval of other gentlemen of his class for the rest he secretly disliked clergymen on account of the peculiarity of their collars and a certain influence they had with women when marjorie at the age of fourteen had displayed a hankering after ecclesiastical ceremony and emotional religion he had declared we dont want any of that nonsense and sent her into the country to a farm where there were young calves and a bottlefed lamb and kittens at times her mother went to church and displayed considerable orthodoxy and punctilio at times the good lady didnt and at times she thought in a broadminded way that there was a lot in christian science and subjected herself to the ministrations of an american named silas root but his ministrations were too expensive for continuous use and so the old faith did not lose its hold upon the family altogether                                       at school marjorie had been taught what i may best describe as muffled christianitya temperate and discreet system designed primarily not to irritate parents in which the painful symbol of the crucifixion and the riddle of what salvation was to save her from and indeed the coarser aspects of religion generally were entirely subordinate to images of amiable perambulations and a rich mist of finer feelings she had been shielded not only from arguments against her religion but from arguments for itthe two things go togetherand i do not think it was particularly her fault if she was now growing up like the great majority of respectable english people with her religious faculty as it were artificially faded and an acquired disposition to regard any speculation of why she was and whence and whither as rather foolish not very important and in the very worst possible taste  and so the crystal globe being broken which once held souls together you may expect to find her a little dispersed and inconsistent in her motives and with none of that assurance a simpler age possessed of the exact specification of goodness or badness the exact delimitation of right and wrong indeed she did not live in a world of right and wrong or anything so stern horrid and jolly had replaced these archaic orientations in a world where a mercantile gentility has conquered passion and god is neither blasphemed nor adored there necessarily arises this generation of young people a little perplexed indeed and with a sense of something missing but feeling their way inevitably at last to the great releasing question then why shouldnt we have a good time  yet there was something in marjorie as in most human beings that demanded some general idea some aim to hold her life together a girl upon the borders of her set at college was fond of the phrase living for the moment and marjorie associated with it the speakers lax mouth sloelike eyes soft quickflushing boneless face and a habit of squawking and bouncing in a forced and graceless manner marjories natural disposition was to deal with life in a steadier spirit than that yet all sorts of powers and forces were at work in her some exalted some elvish some vulgar some subtle she felt keenly and desired strongly and in effect she came perhaps nearer the realization of that offending phrase than its original exponent she had a clean intensity of feeling that made her delight in a thousand various things in sunlight and textures and the vividly quick acts of animals in landscape and the beauty of other girls in wit and peoples voices and good strong reasoning and the desire and skill of art she had a clear rapid memory that made her excel perhaps a little too easily at school and college an eagerness of sympathetic interest that won people very quickly and led to disappointments and a very strong sense of the primary importance of miss marjorie pope in the world and when any very definite dream of what she would like to be and what she would like to do such as being the principal of a ladies college or the first woman member of parliament or the wife of a barbaric chief in borneo or a great explorer or the wife of a millionaire and a great social leader or george sand or saint teresa had had possession of her imagination for a few weeks an entirely contrasted and equally attractive dream would presently arise beside it and compete with it and replace it it wasnt so much that she turned against the old one as that she was attracted by the new and she forgot the old dream rather than abandoned it simply because she was only one person and hadnt therefore the possibility of realizing both  in certain types marjories impressionability aroused a passion of proselytism people of the most diverse kinds sought to influence her and they invariably did so quite a number of people including her mother and the principal of her college believed themselves to be the leading influence in her life and this was particularly the case with her aunt plessington her aunt plessington was devoted to social and political work of an austere and aggressive sort in which mr plessington participated she was childless and had a movement of her own the good habits movement a progressive movement of the utmost scope and benevolence which aimed at extensive interferences with the food and domestic intimacies of the more defenceless lower classes by means ultimately of legislation and she had marjorie up to see her took her for long walks while she influenced with earnestness and vigour and at times had an air of bequeathing her mantle movement and everything quite definitely to her little madge she spoke of training her niece to succeed her and bought all the novels of mrs humphry ward for her as they appeared in the hope of quickening in her that flame of politicosocial ambition that insatiable craving for dinnerparties with important guests which is so distinctive of the more influential variety of english womanhood it was due rather to her own habit of monologue than to any reserve on the part of marjorie that she entertained the belief that her niece was entirely acquiescent in these projects they went into marjories mind and passed for nearly a week it is true she had dramatized herself as the angel and inspiration of some great modern statesman but this had been ousted by a far more insistent dream begotten by a picture she had seen in some exhibition of a life of careless savagery whose central and constantly recurrent incident was the riding of barebacked horses out of deepshadowed forest into a foamy sunlit seain a costume that would certainly have struck aunt plessington as a mistake  if you could have seen marjorie in her railway compartment with the sunshine sunshine mottled by the dirty window tangled in her hair and creeping to and fro over her face as the train followed the curves of the line you would certainly have agreed with me that she was pretty and you might even have thought her beautiful but it was necessary to fall in love with marjorie before you could find her absolutely beautiful you might have speculated just what business was going on behind those drowsily thoughtful eyes if you areas people sayvictorian you might even have whispered day dreams at the sight of her  she was dreaming and in a sense she was thinking of beautiful things but only mediately she was thinking how very much she would enjoy spending freely and vigorously quite a considerable amount of moneyheaps of money  you see the carmels with whom she had just been staying were shockingly well off they had two motor cars with them in the country and the boys had the use of the second one as though it was just an old bicycle marjorie had had a cheap white dinnerdress made the year before by a chelsea french girl a happy find of her mothers and it was shapely and simple and not at all bad and she had worn her green beads and her egyptian necklace of jade but kitty carmel and her sister had had a new costume nearly every night and pretty bracelets and rubies big pearls and woven gold and half a score of delightful and precious things for neck and hair everything in the place was bright and good and abundant the servants were easy and wellmannered without a trace of hurry or resentment and one didnt have to be sharp about the eggs and things at breakfast in the morning or go without all through the day and even when they had gone to bathe from the smart little white and green shed on the upper lake marjorie had been made to feel the insufficiency of her equipment kitty carmel being twentyone possessed her own chequebook and had accounts running at half a dozen westend shops and both sisters had furnished their own rooms according to their taste with a sense of obvious effect that had set marjorie speculating just how a room might be done by a girl with a real eye for colour and a real brain behind it  the train slowed down for the seventeenth time marjorie looked up and read buryhamstreet   § 3  her reverie vanished and by a complex but almost instantaneous movement she had her basket off the rack and the carriage door open she became teeming anticipations there advancing in a string were daffy her elder sister theodore her younger brother and the dog toupee sydney and rom hadnt come daffy was not copper red like her sister but really quite coarsely redhaired she was bigger than marjorie and with irregular teeth instead of marjories neat row she confessed them in a broad simple smile of welcome theodore was hatless rustily fuzzyheaded and now a wealth of quasihumorous gesture the dog toupee was straining at a leash and doing its best in a yapping confused manner to welcome the wrong people by getting its lead round their legs  toupee cried marjorie waving the basket toupee  they all called it toupee because it was like one but the name was forbidden in her fathers hearing her father had decided that the proper name for a family dog in england is towser and did his utmost to suppress a sobriquet that was at once unprecedented and not in the best possible taste which was why the whole family with the exception of mrs pope of course stuck to toupee  marjorie flashed a seconds contrast with the carmel splendours  hullo old daffy whats it like she asked handing out the basket as her sister came up  its a lark said daffy wheres the dressingbag  thoddy said marjorie following up the dressingbag with the holdall lend a hand  stow it toupee said theodore and caught the holdall in time  in another moment marjorie was out of the train had done the swift kissing proper to the occasion and rolled a hand over toupees headtoupee who after a passionate lunge at a particularly savoury drover from the next compartment was now frantically trying to indicate that marjorie was the one human being he had ever cared for brother and sister were both sketching out the state of affairs at buryhamstreet vicarage in rapid competitive jerks each eager to tell things firstand the whole party moved confusedly towards the station exit things pelted into marjories mind  weve got an old donkeycart i thought we shouldnt get hereever madge we can go up the church tower whenever we like only old daffy wont let me shin up the flagstaff its perfectly safeyou couldnt fall off if you tried had positively to get out at the level crossing and pull him over theres a sort of moat in the garden you never saw such furniture madge and the study its hung with texts and stuffed with books about the scarlet woman pianos rather good its a broadwood the dads got a war on about the tennis net oh frightful youll see it wont keep up hes had a letter kept waiting by the times for a fortnight and its a terror at breakfast says the motor people have used influence to silence him says thats a game two can play at old sid got herself upset stuffing windfalls rather a sell for old sid considering how refined shes getting  there was a brief lull as the party got into the waiting governess cart toupee after a preliminary refusal to enter made a determined attempt on the best seat from which he would be able to bark in a persistent official manner at anything that passed that suppressed and theodores proposal to drive refused they were able to start and attention was concentrated upon daffys negotiation of the station approach marjorie turned on her brother with a smile of warm affection  how are you old theodore  im all right old madge  mummy  every ones all right said theodore if it wasnt for that damned infernal net  ssssh cried both sisters together  he says it said theodore  both sisters conveyed a grave and relentless disapproval  pretty bit of road said marjorie i like that little house at the corner  a pause and the eyes of the sisters met  hes here said daffy  marjorie affected ignorance  whos here  il vostro senior miraculoso  just as though a fellow couldnt understand your kiddy little italian said theodore pulling toupees ear  oh well i thought he might be said marjorie regardless of her brother  oh said daffy i didnt know  both sisters looked at each other and then both glanced at theodore he met marjories eyes with a grimace of profound solemnity  little brothers he said shouldnt know just as though they didnt rot but lets change the subject my dears all the same lemme see there are a new sort of flea on toupee madge that he gets from the hens  is a new sort corrected daffy hes horrider than ever madge he leaves his soap in soak now to make us think he has used it this is the village high street isnt it jolly  corners dont bite people said theodore with a critical eye to the driving  marjorie surveyed the high street while daffy devoted a few moments to theodore  the particular success of the village was its brace of chestnut trees which with that noble disregard of triteness which is one of the charms of villages the whole world over shadowed the village smithy on either side of the roadway between it and the paths was a careless width of vivid grass protected by white posts which gave way to admit a generous access on either hand to a jolly public house leering over red blinds and swinging a painted sign against its competitor several of the cottages had real thatch and most had porches they had creepers nailed to their faces and their gardens crowded now with flowers marigolds begonias snapdragon delphiniums white foxgloves and monkshood seemed almost too good to be true the doctors house was pleasantly georgian and the village shop which was also a post and telegraph office lay back with a slight air of repletion keeping its bulging double shopwindows wide open in a manifest attempt not to fall asleep two score of shockheaded boys and pinafored girls were drilling upon a bald space of ground before the village school and near by the national emotion at the evermemorable diamond jubilee of queen victoria had evoked an artistic drinkingfountain of grey stone beyond the subsequent greenthere were the correctest geese thereonthe village narrowed almost to a normal road again and then recalling itself with a start lifted a little to the churchyard wall about the grey and ample church its just like all the villages that ever were said marjorie and gave a cry of delight when daffy pointing to the white gate between two elm trees that led to the vicarage remarked thats us  in confirmation of which statement sydney and rom the two sisters next in succession to marjorie and with a strong tendency to be twins in spite of the year between them appeared in a state of vociferous incivility opening the way for the donkeycarriage sydney was sydney and rom was just short for romolaone of her mothers favourite heroines in fiction  old madge they said and then throwing respect to the winds old gargoo which was marjories forbidden nickname and short for gargoyle though surely only victorian gothic ever produced a gargoyle that had the remotest right to be associated with the neat brightness of marjories face  she overlooked the offence and the pseudotwins boarded the cart from behind whereupon the already overburthened donkey being old and in a manner wise quickened his pace for the house to get the whole thing over  its really an avenue said daffy but marjorie with her mind strung up to the carmel standards couldnt agree it was like calling a row of boyscouts potsdam grenadiers the trees were at irregular distances of various ages and mostly on one side still it was a shady pleasant approach  and the vicarage was truly very interesting and amusing to these londoners accustomed to live in a state of compression elbows practically touching in a tall narrow foreandaft stucco house all window and staircase in a despondent brompton square there was an effect of maundering freedom about the place of enlargement almost to the pitch of adventure and sunlight to the pitch of intoxication the house itself was long and low as if a london house holidaying in the country had flung itself asprawl it had two disconnected and roomy staircases and when it had exhausted itself completely as a house it turned to the right and began again as rambling empty stables coach house cart sheds mens bedrooms up ladders and outhouses of the most various kinds on one hand was a neglected orchard in the front of the house was a bald worriedlooking lawn area capable of simultaneous tennis and croquet and at the other side a copious and confused vegetable and flower garden full of roses honesty hollyhocks and suchlike herbaceous biennials and perennials lapsed at last into shrubbery where a sickleshaped weedy lagoon of uncertain aims which had evidently as a rustic bridge and a weeping willow confessed aspired to be an ornamental water declined at last to ducks and there was access to the church and the key of the church tower and one went across the corner of the lawn and by a little iron gate into the churchyard to decipher inscriptions as if the tombs of all buryhamstreet were no more than a part of the accommodation relinquished by the vicars household  marjorie was hurried over the chief points of all this at a breakneck pace by sydney and rom and when sydney was called away to the horrors of practicefor sydney in spite of considerable reluctance was destined by her father to be the musical onerom developed a copious affection due apparently to some occult æsthetic influence in marjories silverygrey and green and led her into the unlocked vestry and there prayed in a whisper that she might be given one good hug just oneand so they came out with their arms about each other very affectionately to visit the lagoon again and then rom remembered that marjorie hadnt seen either the walnuttree in the orchard or the hen with nine chicks  somewhere among all these interests came tea and mrs pope  mrs pope kissed her daughter with an air of having really wanted to kiss her half an hour ago but of having been distracted since she was a finefeatured anxiouslooking little woman with a close resemblance to all her children in spite of the fact that they were markedly dissimilar one to the other except only that they took their ruddy colourings from their father she was dressed in a neat blue dress that had perhaps been hurriedly chosen and her method of doing her hair was a manifest compromise between duty and pleasure she embarked at once upon an exposition of the bedroom arrangements which evidently involved difficult issues marjorie was to share a room with daffythat was the gist of itas the only other available apartment originally promised to marjorie had been secured by mr pope for what he called his matutinal ablutions videlicet tub  then when your aunt plessington comes you wont have to move said mrs pope with an air of a special concession your fathers looking forward to seeing you but he mustnt be disturbed just yet hes in the vicars study hes had his tea in there hes writing a letter to the times answering something they said in a leader and also a private note calling attention to their delay in printing his previous communication and he wants to be delicately ironical without being in any way offensive he wants to hint without actually threatening that very probably he will go over to the spectator altogether if they do not become more attentive the times used to print his letters punctually but latterly these automobile people seem to have got hold of it he has the window on the lawn open so that i think perhaps wed better not stay out herefor fear our voices might disturb him  better get right round the other side of the church said daffy  hed hear far less of us if we went indoors said mrs pope   § 4  the vicarage seemed tight packed with human interest for marjorie and her mother and sisters going over houses is one of the amusements proper to her sex and she and all three sisters and her mother as soon as they had finished an inaudible tea went to see the bedroom she was to share with daffy and then examined carefully and in order the furniture and decoration of the other bedrooms went through the rooms downstairs always excepting and avoiding very carefully and closing as many doors as possible on and hushing their voices whenever they approached the study in which her father was being delicately ironical without being offensive to the times none of them had seen any of the vicarage people at allmr pope had come on a bicycle and managed all the negotiationsand it was curious to speculate about the individuals whose personalities pervaded the worn and faded furnishings of the place  the popes keeneyed inspection came at times i think dangerously near prying the ideals of decoration and interests of the vanished family were so absolutely dissimilar to the london standards as to arouse a sort of astonished wonder in their minds some of the things they decided were perfectly hideous some quaint some were simply and weakly silly everything was different from hartstone square daffy was perhaps more inclined to contempt and mrs pope to refined amusement and witty appreciation than marjorie marjorie felt there was something in these people that she didnt begin to understand she needed some missing clue that would unlock the secret of their confused peculiarity she was one of those people who have an almost instinctive turn for decoration in costume and furniture she had already had a taste of how to do things in arranging her rooms at bennett college oxbridge where also she was in great demand among the richer girls as an adviser she knew what it was to try and fail as well as to try and succeed and these people she felt hadnt tried for anything she comprehended she couldnt quite see why it was that there was at the same time an attempt at ornament and a disregard of beauty she couldnt quite do as her mother did and dismiss it as an absurdity and have done with it she couldnt understand too why everything should be as if it were faded and weakened from something originally bright and clear  all the rooms were thick with queer little objects that indicated a quite beaverlike industry in the production of work there were embroidered covers for nearly every article on the washhandstand and mats of wool and crochet wherever anything stood on anything there were tidies everywhere and odd little brackets covered with gilded and varnished fir cones and bearing framed photographs and little jars and all sorts of colourless dusty little objects and everywhere on the walls tacks sustained crossed fans with badly painted flowers or transfer pictures there was a jar on the bedroom mantel covered with varnished postage stamps and containing greyhaired dried grasses there seemed to be a moral element in all this for in the room sydney shared with rom there was a decorative piece of lettering which declared that      something attempted something done     has earned a nights repose  there were a great number of texts that set marjories mind stirring dimly with intimations of a missed significance over her own bed within the lattice of an oxford frame was the photograph of a picture of an extremely composed young woman in a trailing robe clinging to the rock of ages in the midst of histrionically aggressive waves and she had a feeling rather than a thought that perhaps for all the oddity of the presentation it did convey something acutely desirable that she herself had had moods when she would have found something very comforting in just such an impassioned grip and on a framed floriferous card these incomprehensible words           thy grace is sufficient for me        seemed to be saying something to her tantalizingly just outside her range of apprehension  did all these things light up somehow to those dispossessed peoplefrom some angle she didnt attain were they living and moving realities when those others were at home again  the drawingroom had no texts it was altogether more pretentious and less haunted by the faint and faded flavour of religion that pervaded the bedrooms it had however evidences of travel in switzerland and the mediterranean there was a piano in black and gold a little out of tune and surmounted by a benares brass jar enveloping a scarlet geranium in a pot there was a japanese screen of gold wrought upon black that screened nothing there was a framed chromolithograph of jerusalem hot in the sunset and another of jerusalem cold under a subtropical moon and there were gourds roses of jericho sandalwood rosaries and kindred trash from the holy land in no little profusion upon a whatnot such books as the room had contained had been arranged as symmetrically as possible about a large pinkshaded lamp upon the claretcoloured cloth of a round table and were to be replaced mrs pope said at their departure at present they were piled on a sidetable the girls had been through them all and were ready with the choicer morsels for marjories amusement there was black beauty the sympathetic story of a soundly anglican horse and a large bible extraillustrated with photographs of every wellknown scriptural picture from michael angelo to doré and a book of injunctions to young ladies upon their behaviour and deportment that rom and sydney found particularly entertaining marjorie discovered that sydney had picked up a new favourite phrase im afraid were all dreadfully cynical said sydney several times  a more advanced note was struck by a copy of aurora leigh richly underlined in pencil but with exclamation marks at some of the bolder passages  and presently still avoiding the open study window very elaborately this little group of twentieth century people went again into the churchthe church whose foundations were laid in ad 912foundations of rubble and cement that included flat roman bricks from a still remoter basilica their voices dropped instinctively as they came into its shaded quiet from the exterior sunshine marjorie went a little apart and sat in a pew that gave her a glimpse of the one good stainedglass window rom followed her and perceiving her mood to be restful sat a yard away syd began a whispered dispute with her mother whether it wasnt possible to try the organ and whether theodore might not be bribed to blow daffy discovered relics of a lepers squint and a holywater stoup and then went to scrutinize the lettering of the ten commandments of the mosaic law that shone black and red on gold on either side of the ihs monogram behind the whiteclothed communion table that had once been the altar upon a notice board hung about the waist of the portly pulpit were the numbers of hymns that had been sung three days ago the sound protestantism of the vicar had banished superfluous crosses from the building the bible reposed upon the wings of a great brass eagle shining blue and crimson in the window saint christopher carried his lord what a harmonized synthesis of conflicts a country church presents what invisible mysteries of filiation spread between these ancient ornaments and symbols and the new young minds from the whirlpool of the town that looked upon them now with such bright keen eyes wondering a little feeling a little missing so much  it was all so very cool and quiet nowwith something of the immobile serenity of death   § 5  when mr pope had finished his letter to the times he got out of the window of the study treading on a flowerbed as he did sohe was the sort of man who treads on flowerbedspartly with the purpose of reading his composition aloud to as many members of his family as he could assemble for the purpose and so giving them a chance of appreciating the nuances of his irony more fully than if they saw it just in cold print without the advantage of his intonation and partly with the belated idea of welcoming marjorie the law presented a rather discouraging desolation then he became aware that the church tower frothed with his daughters in view of his need of an audience he decided after a brief doubt that their presence there was unobjectionable and waved his ms amiably marjorie flapped a handkerchief in reply  the subsequent hour was just the sort of hour that gave mr pope an almost meteorological importance to his family he began with an amiability that had no fault except perhaps that it was a little forced after the epistolary strain in the study and his welcome to marjorie was more than cordial well little madgecat he said giving her an affectionate but sound and heavy thump on the left shoulderblade got a kiss for the old daddy  marjorie submitted a cheek  thats right said mr pope and now i just want you all to advise me  he led the way to a group of wicker garden chairs youre coming mummy he said and seated himself comfortably and drew out a spectacle case while his family grouped itself dutifully it made a charming little picture of a man and his womankind i dont often flatter myself he said but this time i think ive been neatneats the word for it  he cleared his throat put on his spectacles and emitted a long flat preliminary note rather like the sound of a childs trumpet erdear sir  rom said mrs pope dont creak your chair  its daffy mother said rom  oh rom said daffy  mr pope paused and looked with a warning eye over his left spectacleglass at rom  dont creak your chair rom he said when your mother tells you  i was not creaking my chair said rom  i heard it said mr pope suavely  it was daffy  your mother does not think so said mr pope  oh all right ill sit on the ground said rom crimson to the roots of her hair  me too said daffy id rather  mr pope watched the transfer gravely then he readjusted his glasses cleared his throat again trumpeted and began erdear sir  oughtnt it to be simply sir father for an editor said marjorie  perhaps i didnt explain marjorie said her father with the calm of great selfrestraint and dabbing his left hand on the manuscript in his right that this is a private lettera private letter  i didnt understand said marjorie  it would have been evident as i went on said mr pope and prepared to read again  this time he was allowed to proceed but the interruptions had ruffled him and the gentle stresses that should have lifted the subtleties of his irony into prominence missed the words and he had to go back and do his sentences again then rom suddenly horribly uncontrollably was seized with hiccups at the second hiccup mr pope paused and looked very hard at his daughter with magnified eyes as he was about to resume the third burst its way through the unhappy childs utmost effort  mr pope rose with an awful resignation thats enough he said he regarded the pseudotwin vindictively you havent the selfcontrol of a child of six he said then very touchingly to mrs pope mummy shall we try a game of tennis with the new generation  cant you read it after supper asked mrs pope  it must go by the eight oclock post said mr pope putting the masterpiece into his breast pocket the little masterpiece that would now perhaps never be read aloud to any human being daffy dear do you mind going in for the racquets and balls  the social atmosphere was now sultry and overcast and mr popes decision to spend the interval before daffy returned in seeing whether he couldnt do something to the net which was certainly very unsatisfactory did not improve matters then unhappily marjorie who had got rather keen upon tennis at the carmels claimed her fathers first two services as faults contrary to the etiquette of the family it happened that mr pope had a really very good hard difficult smartlooking serve whose only defect was that it always went either too far or else into the net and so a feeling had been fostered and established by his wife that on the whole it was advisable to regard the former variety as a legitimate extension of a fathers authority naturally therefore mr pope was nettled at marjories ruling and his irritation increased when his next two services to daffy perished in the net damn that net puts ones eye out then marjorie gave him an unexpected soft return which he somehow muffed and then daffy just dropped a return over the top of the net lovegame it was then marjories turn to serve which she did with a new twist acquired from the eldest carmel boy that struck mr pope as unenglish go on he said concisely fifteen love  she was gentle with her mother and they got their first rally and when it was over mr pope had to explain to marjorie that if she returned right up into his corner of the court he would have to run backwards very fast and might fall over down the silly slope at that end she would have to consider him and the court one didnt get everything out of a game by playing merely to win she said all right daddy rather offhandedly and immediately served to him again and he taken a little unawares hit the ball with the edge of his racquet and sent it out and then he changed racquets with daffyit seemed he had known all along she had taken his but he had preferred to say nothinguttered a word of advice to his wife just on her stroke and she failing to grasp his intention as quickly as she ought to have done left the score fortyfifteen he felt better when he returned marjories serve and then before she could control herself she repeated her new unpleasant trick of playing into the corner again whereupon leaping back with an agility that would have shamed many a younger man mr pope came upon disaster he went spinning down the treacherous slope behind twisted his ankle painfully and collapsed against the iron railings of the shrubbery it was too much and he lost control of himself his daughters had one instants glimpse of the linguistic possibilities of a strong mans agony i told her he went on as if he had said nothing tennis  for a second perhaps he seemed to hesitate upon a course of action then as if by a great effort he took his coat from the net post and addressed himself houseward incarnate grand dudgeonlimping  had enough of it mummy he said and added some happily inaudible comment on marjories new style of play  the evenings exercise was at an end  the three ladies regarded one another in silence for some moments  i will take in the racquets dear said mrs pope  i think the other ball is at your end said daffy  the apparatus put away marjorie and her sister strolled thoughtfully away from the house  theres croquet here too said daffy weve not had the things out yet  hell play i suppose  he wants to play  of course said marjorie after a long pause theres no reasoning with dad   § 6  character is one of englands noblest and most deliberate products but some englishmen have it to excess mr pope had  he was one of that large and representative class which imparts a dignity to national commerce by inheriting big businesses from its ancestors he was a coachbuilder by birth and a gentleman by education and training he had been to city merchants and cambridge  throughout the earlier half of the nineteenth century the popes had been the princes of the coachbuilding world mr popes greatgrandfather had been a north london wheelwright of conspicuous dexterity and integrity who had founded the family business his son mr popes grandfather had made that business the occupation of his life and brought it to the pinnacle of preeminence his son who was marjories grandfather had displayed a lesser enthusiasm left the house at the works for a home ten miles away and sent a second son into the church it was in the days of the third pope that the business ceased to expand and began to suffer severely from the competition of an enterprising person who had originally supplied the firm with varnish gradually picked up the trade in most other materials and accessories needed in coachbuilding and passed on by almost imperceptible stages to delivering the article completedispensing at last altogether with the intervention of pope and sonto the customer marjories father had succeeded in the fulness of time to the inheritance this insurgent had damaged  mr pope was a man of firm and resentful temper with an admiration for cato brutus cincinnatus cromwell washington and the sterner heroes generally and by nature a little illused and offended at things he suffered from indigestion and extreme irritability he found himself in control of a business where more flexible virtues were needed the popes based their fame on a heavy proud type of vehicle which the increasing luxury and triviality of the age tended to replace by lighter forms of carriage carriages with diminutive and apologetic names as these lighter forms were not only lighter but less expensive mr pope with a pathetic confidence in the loyalty of the better class of west end customer determined to make a stand against them he was the sort of man to whom making a stand is in itself a sombre joy if he had had to choose his pose for a portrait he would certainly have decided to have one foot advanced the other planted like a british oak behind the arms folded and the brows corrugatedmaking a stand  unhappily the stars in their courses and the general improvement of roads throughout the country fought against him the lighter carriages and especially the lighter carriages of that varnishselling firm which was now absorbing businesses right and left prevailed over mr popes resistance for crossing a mountain pass or fording a river for driving over the scene of a recent earthquake or following a retreating army for being run away with by frantic horses or crushing a personal enemy there can be no doubt the pope carriages remained to the very last the best possible ones and fully worth the inflexible price demanded unhappily all carriages in a civilization essentially decadent are not subjected to these tests and the manufactures of his rivals were not only much cheaper but had a sort of meretricious smartness a disingenuous elasticity above all a levity hateful indeed to the spirit of mr pope yet attractive to the wanton customer business dwindled nevertheless the habitual element in the good class customer did keep things going albeit on a shrinking scale until mr pope came to the unfortunate decision that he would make a stand against automobiles he regarded them as an intrusive nuisance which had to be seen only to be disowned by the landed gentry of england rather than build a car he said he would go out of business he went out of business within five years of this determination he sold out the name good will and other vestiges of his concern to a mysterious buyer who turned out to be no more than an agent for these persistently expanding varnish makers and he retired with a genuine grievance upon the family accumulationschiefly in consols and home railways  he refused however to regard his defeat as final put great faith in the approaching exhaustion of the petrol supply and talked in a manner that should have made the automobile association uneasy of devoting the rest of his days to the purification of england from these aggressive mechanisms it was a mistake he said to let them in he became more frequent at his excellent west end club and directed a certain portion of his capital to largely indecisive but on the whole unprofitable speculations in south african and south american enterprises he mingled a little in affairs he was a tough conventional speaker rich in established phrases and never abashed by hearing himself say commonplace things and in addition to his campaign against automobiles he found time to engage also in quasipolitical activities taking chairs saying a few words and so on cherishing a fluctuating hope that his eloquence might ultimately win him an invitation to contest a constituency in the interests of reaction and the sounder elements in the liberal party  he had a publicspirited side and he was particularly attracted by that mass of modern legislative proposals which aims at a more systematic control of the lives of lower class persons for their own good by their betters indeed in the first enthusiasm of his proprietorship of the pope works at east purblow he had organized one of those benevolent industrial experiments that are now so common he felt strongly against the drink evil that is to say the unrestricted liberty of common people to drink what they prefer and he was acutely impressed by the fact that workingclass families do not spend their money in the way that seems most desirable to upper middleclass critics accordingly he did his best to replace the dangerous freedoms of money by that ideal of the social reformer payment in kind to use his invariable phrase the east purblow experiment did no mean service to the cause of social reform unhappily it came to an end through a prosecution under the truck act that blot upon the statute book designed it would appear even deliberately to vitiate mans benevolent control of his fellow man the lessons to be drawn from that experience however grew if anything with the years he rarely spoke without an allusion to it and it was quite remarkable how readily it could be adapted to illuminate a hundred different issues in the hospitable columns of the spectator   § 7  at seven oclock marjorie found herself upstairs changing into her applegreen frock she had had a good refreshing wash in cold soft water and it was pleasant to change into thinner silk stockings and dainty satin slippers and let down and at last brush her hair and dress loiteringly after the fatigues of her journey and the activities of her arrival she looked out on the big church and the big trees behind it against the golden quiet of a summer evening with extreme approval  i suppose those birds are rooks she said  but daffy had gone to see that the pseudotwins had done themselves justice in their muslin frocks and pink sashes they were apt to be a little sketchy with their less accessible buttons  marjorie became aware of two gentlemen with her mother on the lawn below  one was her almost affianced lover will magnet the humorous writer she had been doing her best not to think about him all day but now he became an unavoidable central fact she regarded him with an almost perplexed scrutiny and wondered vividly why she had been so excited and pleased by his attentions during the previous summer  mr magnet was one of those quiet deliberately unassuming people who do not even attempt to be beautiful not for him was it to pretend but to prick the bladder of pretence he was a fairish man of forty pale with a large protuberant observant grey eyei speak particularly of the leftand a face of quiet animation warily alert for the wits opportunity his nose and chin were pointed and his lips thin and quaintly pressed together he was dressed in grey with a lowcollared silken shirt showing a thin neck and a flowing black tie and he carried a grey felt hat in his joined hands behind his back she could hear the insinuating cadences of his voice as he talked in her mothers ear the other gentleman silent on her mothers right must she knew be mr wintersloan whom mr magnet had proposed to bring over his dress betrayed that modest gaiety of disposition becoming in an artist and indeed he was one of mr magnets favourite illustrators he was in a dark bluishgrey suit a black tie that was quite unusually broad went twice around his neck before succumbing to the bow and his waistcoat appeared to be of some gailypatterned orange silk marjories eyes returned to mr magnet hitherto she had never had an opportunity of remarking that his hair was more than a little attenuated towards the crown it was funny how his tie came out under his chin to the right  what an odd thing mens dress had become she thought why did they wear those ridiculous collars and ties why didnt they always dress in flannels and look as fine and slender and active as the elder carmel boy for example mr magnet couldnt be such an illshaped man why didnt every one dress to be just as beautiful and splendid as possibleinstead of wearing queer things  coming down said daffy a vision of sulphuryellow appearing in the doorway  let them go first said marjorie with a finer sense of effect and theodore we dont want to make part of a comic entry with theodore daffy  accordingly the two sisters watched discreetlythey had to be wary on account of mr magnets increasingly frequent glances at the windowsand when at last all the rest of the family had appeared below they decided their cue had come mr pope strolled into the group with no trace of his recent debacle except a slight limp he was wearing a jacket of damsoncoloured velvet which he affected in the country and all traces of his grand dudgeon were gone but then he rarely had grand dudgeon except in the sanctities of family life and hardly ever when any other man was about  well his daughters heard him say with a witty allusiveness that was difficult to follow so the magnet has come to the mountain againeh  come on madge said daffy and the two sisters emerged harmoniously together from the house  it would have been manifest to a meaner capacity than any present that evening that mr magnet regarded marjorie with a distinguished significance he had two eyes but he had that mysterious quality so frequently associated with a bluishgrey iris which gives the effect of looking hard with one large orb a sort of grey searchlight effect and he used this eye ray now to convey a respectful but firm admiration in the most unequivocal manner he saluted daffy courteously and then allowed himself to retain marjories hand for just a second longer than was necessary as he saidvery simplyi am very pleased indeed to meet you againvery  a slight embarrassment fell between them  you are staying near here mr magnet  at the inn said mr magnet and then i chose it because it would be near you  his eye pressed upon her again for a moment  is it comfortable said marjorie  so charmingly simple said mr magnet i love it  a tinkling bell announced the preparedness of supper and roused the others to the consciousness that they were silently watching mr magnet and marjorie  its quite a simple farmhouse supper said mrs pope   § 8  there were ducks green peas and adolescent new potatoes for supper and afterwards stewed fruit and cream and junket and cheese bottled beer gilbeys burgundy and homemade lemonade mrs pope carved because mr pope splashed too much and bones upset him and made him want to show up chicken in the times so he sat at the other end and rallied his guests while mrs pope distributed the viands he showed not a trace of his recent umbrage theodore sat between daffy and his mother because of his table manners and marjorie was on her fathers right hand and next to mr wintersloan while mr magnet was in the middle of the table on the opposite side in a position convenient for looking at her both maids waited  the presence of magnet invariably stirred the latent humorist in mr pope he felt that he who talks to humorists should himself be humorous and it was his private persuasion that with more attention he might have been to use a favourite form of expression no mean jester quite a lot of little things of his were cherished as good both by himself and with occasional inaccuracies by mrs pope he opened out now in a strain of rich allusiveness  what will you drink mr wintersloan he said wine of the country yclept beer red wine from france or my wifes potent brew from the golden lemon  mr wintersloan thought he would take burgundy mr magnet preferred beer      ive heard theres iron in the beer     and i believe it  misquoted mr pope and nodded as it were to the marker to score daffy and marjorie are still in the lemonade stage will you take a little burgundy tonight mummy  mrs pope decided she would and was inspired to ask mr wintersloan if he had been in that part of the country before topography ensued mr wintersloan had a style of his own and spoke of the buryhamstreet district as a pooty little countrypooty little hills with a swirl in them  this pleased daffy and marjorie and their eyes met for a moment  then mr magnet with a ray full on marjorie said he had always been fond of surrey i think if ever i made a home in the country i should like it to be here  mr wintersloan said surrey would tire him it was too bossy and curly too flocculent he would prefer to look on broader simpler lines with just a sudden catch in the breath in themif you understand me  marjorie did and said so  a sobsuch as you get at the break of a pinewood on a hill  this baffled mr pope but marjorie took it or the short dry cough of a cliff she said  exactly said mr wintersloan and having turned a little deliberate closelipped smile on her for a moment resumed his wing  so long as a landscape doesnt sneeze said mr magnet in that irresistible dry way of his and rom and sydney at any rate choked  now is the hour when landscapes yawn mused mr pope coming in all right at the end  then mrs pope asked mr wintersloan about his route to buryhamstreet and then mr pope asked mr magnet whether he was playing at a new work or working at a new play  mr magnet said he was dreaming over a play he wanted to bring out the more serious side of his humour go a little deeper into things than he had hitherto done  mingling smiles and tears said mr pope approvingly  mr magnet said very quietly that all true humour did that  then mrs pope asked what the play was to be about and mr magnet who seemed disinclined to give an answer turned the subject by saying he had to prepare an address on humour for the next dinner of the literati its to be a humourists dinner and theyve made me the guest of the eveningby way of a joke to begin with he said with that dry smile again  mrs pope said he shouldnt say things like that she then said syd quietly but sharply to sydney who was making a disdainful squinting face at theodore and told the parlourmaid to clear the plates for sweets mr magnet professed great horror of public speaking he said that whenever he rose to make an afterdinner speech all the ices he had ever eaten seemed to come out of the past and sit on his backbone  the talk centered for awhile on mr magnets address and apropos of tests of humour mr pope who in his way was no mean raconteur related the story of the man who took the salad dressing with his hand and when his host asked why he did that replied oh i thought it was spinach  many people added mr pope wouldnt see the point of that and if they dont see the point they cantand the more they try the less they do  all four girls hoped secretly and not too confidently that their laughter had not sounded hollow  and then for a time the men told stories as they came into their heads in an easy irresponsible way mr magnet spoke of the humour of the omnibusdriver who always dangled and twiddled his badge by way of a joke when he passed the conductor whose father had been hanged and mr pope perhaps a little irrelevantly told the story of the little boy who was asked his fathers last words and said mother was with him to the end which particularly amused mrs pope mr wintersloan gave the story of the woman who was taking her son to the hospital with his head jammed into a saucepan and explained to the other people in the omnibus you see what makes it so annoying its me only saucepan then they came back to the sense of humour with the dentist who shouted with laughter and when asked the reason by his patient choked out wrong tooth and then mr pope reminded them of the heartless husband who suddenly informed that his motherinlaw was dead exclaimed oh dont make me laugh please ive got a split lip   § 9  the conversation assumed a less anecdotal quality with the removal to the drawingroom on mr magnets initiative the gentlemen followed the ladies almost immediately and it was mr magnet who remembered that marjorie could sing  both the elder sisters indeed had sweet clear voices and they had learnt a number of those jolly songs the english made before the dull hanoverians came syd accompanied and rom sat back in the low chair in the corner and fell deeply in love with mr wintersloan the three musicians in their green and sulphuryellow and white made a pretty group in the light of the shaded lamp against the black and gold broadwood the tawdry screen its pattern thin glittering upon darkness and the deep shadows behind marjorie loved singing and forgot herself as she sang      i love and he loves me again       yet dare i not tell who     for if the nymphs should know my swain       i fear theyd love him too  she sang and mr magnet could not conceal the intensity of his admiration  mr pope had fallen into a pleasant musing several other ripe old yarns dear delicious old things had come into his mind that he felt he might presently recall when this unavoidable display of accomplishments was overpast and it was with one of them almost on his lips that he glanced across at his guest he was surprised to see mr magnets face transfigured he was sitting forward looking up at marjorie and he had caught something of the expression of those blessed boys who froth at the feet of an assumption for an instant mr pope did not understand  then he understood it was marjorie he had a twinge of surprise and glanced at his own daughter as though he had never seen her before he perceived in a flash for the first time that this troublesome clever disrespectful child was tall and shapely and sweet and indeed quite a beautiful young woman he forgot his anecdotes his being was suffused with pride and responsibility and the sense of virtue rewarded he did not reflect for a moment that marjorie embodied in almost equal proportions the very best points in his mother and his motherinlaw and avoided his own more salient characteristics with so neat a dexterity that from top to toe except for the one matter of colour not only did she not resemble him but she scarcely even alluded to him he thought simply that she was his daughter that she derived from him that her beauty was his she was the outcome of his meritorious preparations he recalled all the moments when he had been kind and indulgent to her all the bills he had paid for her all the stresses and trials of the coachbuilding collapse all the fluctuations of his speculative adventures became things he had faced patiently and valiantly for her sake he forgot the endless times when he had been viciously cross with her all the times when he had pished and tushed and sworn in her hearing he had on provocation and in spite of her mothers protests slapped her pretty vigorously but such things are better forgotten nor did he recall how bitterly he had opposed the college education which had made her now so clear in eye and thought nor the frightful shindy only three months since about that identical green dress in which she now stood delightful he forgot these petty details as an idealist should there she was his daughter an immense benevolence irradiated his soulfor marjoriefor magnet his eyes were suffused with a not ignoble tenderness the man he knew was worth at least thirtyfive thousand pounds a discussion of investments had made that clear and he must be making at least five thousand a year a beautiful girl a worthy man a good fellow a sound good fellow a careful fellow tooas these fellows went  old daddy would lose his treasure of course  well a father must learn resignation and he for one would not stand in the way of his girls happiness a day would come when very beautifully and tenderly he would hand her over to magnet his favourite daughter to his trusted friend well my boy theres no one in all the world he would begin  it would be a touching parting dont forget your old father maggots he would say at such a moment that quaint nickname would surely not be resented  he reflected how much he had always preferred marjorie to daffy she was brightermore like him daffy was unresponsive with a touch of bitterness under her tongue  he was already dreaming he was a widower rather infirm the object of magnets and marjories devoted care when the song ceased and the wife he had for the purpose of reveries just consigned so carelessly to the cemetery proposed that they should have a little game that every one could play at a number of pencils and slips of paper appeared in her hands she did not want the girls to exhaust their repertory on this first occasionand besides mr pope liked games in which one did things with pencils and strips of paper mr magnet wished the singing to go on he said but he was overruled  so for a time every one played a little game in which mr pope was particularly proficient indeed it was rare that any one won but mr pope it was called the great departed and it had such considerable educational value that all the children had to play at it whenever he wished  it was played in this manner one of the pseudo twins opened a book and dabbed a finger on the page and read out the letter immediately at the tip of her finger then all of them began to write as hard as they could writing down the names of every great person they could think of whose name began with that letter at the end of five minutes mr pope said stop and then began to read his list out beginning with the first name everybody who had that name crossed it out and scored one and after his list was exhausted all the surviving names on the next list were read over in the same way and so on the names had to be the names of dead celebrated people only one monarch of the same name of the same dynasty was allowed and mr pope adjudicated on all doubtful cases it was great fun  the first two games were won as usual by mr pope and then mr wintersloan who had been a little distraught in his manner brightened up and scribbled furiously  the letter was d and after mr pope had rehearsed a tale of nine and twenty names mr wintersloan read out his list in that curious voice of his which suggested nothing so much as some mobile drink glucking out of the neck of a bottle held upside down  dahl he began  who was dahl asked mr pope  vented dahlias said mr wintersloan with a sigh danton  forgot him said mr pope  davis  davis  davis straits doe  who  john doe richard roe  legal fiction im afraid said mr pope  dam said mr wintersloan and added after a slight pause anthony van  mr pope made an interrogative noise  paintereighteenth centurydutch dam jan van his son dam frederich van dam

aquarellist denton dibbs  er said mr pope  the warwick claude you know died 1823  dickson dunting john dickery peter dickery william docki beg your pardon  mr pope was making a protesting gesture but mr wintersloans bearing was invincible and he proceeded  in the end he emerged triumphant with fortynine names mostly painters for whose fame he answered but whose reputations were certainly new to every one else present i can go on like that said mr wintersloan with any letter and turned that hard little smile full on marjorie i didnt see how to do it at first i just cast about but i know a frightful lot of painters no end shall we try again  marjorie glanced at her father mr wintersloans methods were all too evident to her a curious feeling pervaded the room that mr pope didnt think mr wintersloans conduct honourable and that he might even go some way towards saying so  so mrs pope became very brisk and stirring and said she thought that now perhaps a charade would be more amusing it didnt do to keep on at a game too long she asked rom and daphne and theodore and mr wintersloan to go out and they all agreed readily particularly rom come on said rom to mr wintersloan everybody else shifted into an audiencelike group between the piano and the whatnot mr magnet sat at marjories feet while syd played a kind of voluntary and mr pope leant back in his chair with his brows knit and lips moving trying to remember something  the charade was very amusing the word was catarrh and mr wintersloan as the patient in the last act being given gruel surpassed even the childrens very high expectations rom as his nurse couldnt keep her hands off him then the younger people kissed round and were packed off to bed and the rest of the party went to the door upon the lawn and admired the night it was a glorious summer night deep blue and rimmed warmly by the afterglow moonless and with a few big lamplike stars above the black still shapes of trees  mrs pope said they would all accompany their guests to the gate at the end of the avenuein spite of the cockchafers  mr popes ankle however excused him the cordiality of his parting from mr wintersloan seemed a trifle forced and he limped thoughtfully and a little sombrely towards the study to see if he could find an encyclopædia or some such book of reference that would give the names of the lesser lights of dutch italian and english painting during the last two centuries  he felt that mr wintersloan had established an extraordinarily bad precedent   § 10  marjorie discovered that she and mr magnet had fallen a little behind the others she would have quickened her pace but mr magnet stopped short and said marjorie  when i saw you standing there and singing said mr magnet and was short of breath for a moment  marjories natural gift for interruption failed her altogether  i felt i would rather be able to call you minethan win an empire  the pause seemed to lengthen between them and marjories remark when she made it at last struck her even as she made it as being but poorly conceived she had some weak idea of being selfdepreciatory  i think you had better win an empire mr magnet she said meekly  then before anything more was possible they had come up to daffy and mr wintersloan and her mother at the gate  as they returned mrs pope was loud in the praises of will magnet she had a little clearcut voice very carefully and very skilfully controlled and she dilated on his modesty his quiet helpfulness at table his ready presence of mind she pointed out instances of those admirable traits incidents small in themselves but charming in their implications when somebody wanted junket he had made no fuss he had just helped them to junket so modest and unassuming sang mrs pope youd never dream he was quite rich and famous yet every book he writes is translated into russian and german and all sorts of languages i suppose hes almost the greatest humorist we have that play of his what is it calledour owd womanhas been performed nearly twelve hundred times i think that is the most wonderful of gifts think of the people it has made happy  the conversation was mainly monologue both marjorie and daffy were unusually thoughtful   § 11  marjorie ended the long day in a worldly mood  penny for your thoughts said daffy abruptly brushing the long firelit rapids of her hair  not for sale said marjorie and roused herself ive had a long day  its always just the time i particularly wish i was a man she remarked after a brief return to meditation fancy no hairpins no brushing no tieup to get lost about no strings i suppose they havent strings  they havent said daffy with conviction  she met marjories interrogative eye father would swear at them she explained hed naturally tie himself upand we should hear of it  i didnt think of that said marjorie and stuck out her chin upon her fists sound induction  she forgot this transitory curiosity  suppose one had a maid daffya real maid  a maid who mended your things  did your hair while you read  oh here goes and she stood up and grappled with the task of undressing     chapter the second  the two proposals of mr magnet   § 1  it was presently quite evident to marjorie that mr magnet intended to propose marriage to her and she did not even know whether she wanted him to do so  she had met him first the previous summer while she had been staying with the petleycresthams at high windower and it had been evident that he found her extremely attractive she had never had a real grown man at her feet before and she had found it amazingly entertaining she had gone for a walk with him the morning before she came awaya frank and ingenuous proceeding that made mrs petleycrestham say the girl knew what she was about and she had certainly coquetted with him in an extraordinary manner at golfcroquet after that oxbridge had swallowed her up and though he had called once on her mother while marjorie was in london during the christmas vacation he hadnt seen her again he had writtenwhich was excitinga long friendly humorous letter about nothing in particular with an air of its being quite the correct thing for him to do and she had answered and there had been other exchanges but all sorts of things had happened in the interval and marjorie had let him get into quite a back place in her thoughtsthe fact that he was a member of her fathers club had seemed somehow to remove him from a great range of possibilitiesuntil a drift in her mothers talk towards him and a letter from him with an indefinable change in tone towards intimacy had restored him to importance now here he was in the foreground of her world again evidently more ardent than ever and with a portentous air of being about to do something decisive at the very first opportunity what was he going to do what had her mother been hinting at and what in fact did the whole thing amount to  marjorie was beginning to realize that this was going to be a very serious affair indeed for herand that she was totally unprepared to meet it  it had been very amusing very amusing indeed at the petleycresthams but there were moments now when she felt towards mr magnet exactly as she would have felt if he had been one of the oxbridge tradesmen hovering about her with a little account full of apparently exaggerated items  her thoughts and feelings were all in confusion about this business her mind was full of scraps every sort of idea every sort of attitude contributed something to that twentieth century jumble for example and so far as its value went among motives it was by no means a trivial consideration she wanted a proposal for its own sake daffy had had a proposal last year and although it wasnt any sort of eligible proposal still there it was and she had given herself tremendous airs but marjorie would certainly have preferred some lighter kind of proposal than that which now threatened her she felt that behind mr magnet were sanctions that she wasnt free to deal with this proposal as she liked he was at buryhamstreet almost with the air of being her parents guest  less clear and more instinctive than her desire for a proposal was her inclination to see just all that mr magnet was disposed to do and hear all that he was disposed to say she was curious he didnt behave in the least as she had expected a lover to behave but then none of the boys the others with whom she had at times stretched a hand towards the hem of emotion had ever done that she had an obscure feeling that perhaps presently mr magnet must light up be stirred and stirring even now his voice changed very interestingly when he was alone with her his breath seemed to goas though something had pricked his lung if it hadnt been for that new disconcerting realization of an official pressure behind him i think she would have been quite ready to experiment extensively with his emotions  but she perceived as she lay awake next morning that she wasnt free for experiments any longer what she might say or do now would be taken up very conclusively and she had no idea what she wanted to say or do  marriage regarded in the abstractthat is to say with mr magnet out of focuswas by no means an unattractive proposal to her it was very much at the back of marjories mind that after oxbridge unless she was prepared to face a very serious row indeed and go to teach in a schooland she didnt feel any call whatever to teach in a schoolshe would probably have to return to hartstone square and share daffys room again and assist in the old collective wearisome task of propitiating her father the freedoms of oxbridge had enlarged her imagination until that seemed an almost unendurably irksome prospect she had tasted life as it could be in her fathers absence and she was beginning to realize just what an impossible person he was marriage was escape from all that it meant not only respectful parents but a house of her very own furniture of her choice great freedom of movement an authority an importance she had seen what it meant to be a prosperously married young woman in the person of one or two resplendent old girls revisiting bennett college scattering invitations offering protections and opportunities  of course there is love  marjorie told herself as she had been trained to tell herself to be sensible but something within her repeated there is love  of course she liked mr magnet she really did like mr magnet very much she had had her girlish dreams had fallen in love with pictures of men and actors and a music master and a man who used to ride by as she went to school but wasnt this desolating desire for selfabandonment rather sillysomething that one left behind with much else when it came to putting up ones hair and sensible living something to blush secretly about and hide from every eye  among other discrepant views that lived together in her mind as cats and rats and parrots and squirrels and so forth used to live together in those happy family cages unseemly men in less wellregulated days were wont to steer about our streets was one instilled by quite a large proportion of the novels she had read that a girl was a sort of selfgiving prize for high moral worth mr magnet she knew was good was kind was brave with that truer courage moral courage which goes with his type of physique he was modest unassuming well off and famous and very much in love with her his true self as mrs pope had pointed out several times must be really very beautiful and in some odd way a line of shakespeare had washed up in her consciousness as being somehow effectual on his behalf      love looks not with the eye but with the mind  she felt she ought to look with the mind nice people surely never looked in any other way it seemed from this angle almost her duty to love him  perhaps she did love him and mistook the symptoms she did her best to mistake the symptoms but if she did truly love him would it seem so queer and important and antagonistic as it did that his hair was rather thin upon the crown of his head  she wished she hadnt looked down on him  poor marjorie she was doing her best to be sensible and she felt herself adrift above a clamorous abyss of feared and forbidden thoughts down there she knew well enough it wasnt thus that love must come deep in her soul the richest thing in her life indeed and the best thing she had to give humanity was a craving for beauty that at times became almost intolerable a craving for something other than beauty and yet inseparably allied with it a craving for deep excitement for a sort of glory in adventure for passionfor things akin to great music and heroic poems and bannered traditions of romance she had hidden away in her an immense tumultuous appetite for life an immense tumultuous capacity for living to be loved beautifully was surely the crown and climax of her being  she did not dare to listen to these deeps yet these insurgent voices filled her even while she drove her little crocodile of primly sensible thoughts to their sane appointed conclusion her blood and nerves and all her being were protesting that mr magnet would not do that whatever other worthiness was in him regarded as a lover he was preposterous and flat and foolish and middleaged and that it were better never to have lived than to put the treasure of her life to his meagre lips and into his hungry unattractive arms the ugliness of it the spiritless horror of it so dumbly and formlessly the rebel voices urged  one has to be sensible said marjorie to herself suddenly putting down shaws book on municipal trading which she imagined she had been reading  perhaps all marriage was horrid and one had to get over it  that was rather what her mother had conveyed to her   § 2  mr magnet made his first proposal in form three days later after coming twice to tea and staying on to supper he had played croquet with mr pope he had been beaten twelve times in spite of twinges in the sprained ankleheroically bornehad had three victories lucidly explained away and heard all the particulars of the east purblow experiment three times over first in relation to the new labour exchanges then regarded at rather a different angle in relation to female betting tallymen and the sanctities of the home generally and finally in a more exhaustive style to show its full importance from every side and more particularly as demonstrating the gross injustice done to mr pope by the neglect of its lessons a neglect too systematic to be accidental in the social reform literature of the time moreover mr magnet had been made to understand thoroughly how several later quasicharitable attempts of a similar character had already become or must inevitably become unsatisfactory through their failure to follow exactly in the lines laid down by mr pope  mr pope was really very anxious to be pleasant and agreeable to mr magnet and he could think of no surer way of doing so than by giving him an unrestrained intimacy of conversation that prevented anything more than momentary intercourse between his daughter and her admirer and not only did mr magnet find it difficult to get away from mr pope without offence but whenever by any chance mr pope was detached for a moment mr magnet discovered that marjorie either wasnt to be seen or if she was she wasnt to be isolated by any device he could contrive before the unappeasable return of mr pope  mr magnet did not get his chance therefore until lady petchworths little gathering at summerhay park  lady petchworth was mrs popes oldest friend and one of those brighter influences which save our english countryside from lassitude she had been more fortunate than mrs pope for while mr pope with that aptitude for disadvantage natural to his temperament had he said been tied to a business that never gave him a chance lady petchworths husband had been a reckless investor of exceptional goodluck in particular led by a dream he had put most of his money into a series of nitrate deposits in caves in saghalien haunted by benevolent penguins and had been rewarded beyond the dreams of avarice his foresight had received the fitting reward of a knighthood and sir thomas after restoring the parish church at summerhay in a costly and destructive manner spent his declining years in an enviable contentment with lady petchworth and the world at large and died long before infirmity made him really troublesome  good fortune had brought out lady petchworths social aptitudes summerhay park was everything that a clever woman inspired by that gardening literature which has been so abundant in the opening years of the twentieth century could make it it had rosaries and rock gardens sundials and yew hedges pools and ponds lead figures and stone urns box borderings and wilderness corners and hundreds and hundreds of feet of prematurelyaged redbrick wall with broad herbaceous borders the walks had primroses primulas and cowslips in a quite disingenuous abundance and in spring the whole extent of the park was gay here with thousands of this sort of daffodil just bursting out and here with thousands of that sort of narcissus just past its prime and every patch ready to pass itself off in its naturalized way as the accidental native flower of the field if only it hadnt been for all the other different varieties coming on or wiltingoff in adjacent patches  her garden was only the beginning of lady petchworths activities she had a model dairy and all her poultry was white and so far as she was able to manage it she made summerhay a model village she overflowed with activities it was astonishing in one so plump and blonde and meeting followed meeting in the artistic little redbrick and greenstained timber village hall she had erected now it was the national theatre and now it was the national mourning now it was the break up of the poor law and now the majority report now the mothers union and now socialism and now individualism but always something progressive and beneficial she did her best to revive the old village life and brought her very considerable powers of compulsion to make the men dance in simple old morris dances dressed up in costumes they secretly abominated and to induce the mothers to dress their children in artcoloured smocks instead of the prints and blue serge frocks they preferred she did not despair she said of creating a spontaneous peasant art movement in the district springing from the people and expressing the people but so far it had been necessary to import not only instructors and material but workers to keep the thing going so sluggish had the spontaneity of our english countryside become  her little gatherings were quite distinctive of her they were a sort of garden party extending from midday to six or seven there would be a nucleus of house guests and the highways and byeways on every hand would be raided to supply persons and interests she had told her friend to bring the girls over for the day and flung an invitation to mr pope who had at once excused himself on the score of his ankle mr pope was one of those men who shun social gatheringsostensibly because of a sterling simplicity of taste but really because his intolerable egotism made him feel slighted and neglected on these occasions he told his wife he would be far happier with a book at home exhorted her not to be late and was seen composing himself to read the vicar of wakefieldwhenever they published a new book mr pope pretended to read an old oneas the hired waggonette took the rest of his familytheodore very unhappy in buff silk and a wide stuart collardown the avenue  they found a long lunch table laid on the lawn beneath the chestnuts and in full view of the poppies and forgetmenots around the stone obelisk a butler and three men servants with brass buttons and red and white striped waistcoats gave dignity to the scene and beyond on the terrace amidst abundance of deckchairs cane chairs rugs and cushions a miscellaneous and increasing company seethed under lady petchworths plump but entertaining hand there were of course mr magnet and his friend mr wintersloanlady petchworth had been given to understand how the land lay and there was mr bunford paradise the musician who was doing his best to teach a sullen holiday class in the village schoolroom to sing the artless old folk songs of surrey again in spite of the invincible persuasion of everybody in the class that the songs were rather indelicate and extremely silly there were the rev jopling baynes and two cambridge undergraduates in flannels and a doctor something or other from london there was also the hon charles muskett lord pottingers cousin and estate agent in tweeds and very helpful the ladies included mrs raff the wellknown fashion writer in a wonderful costume the anonymous doctors wife three or four neighbouring mothers with an undistinguished daughter or so and two quietmannered middleaged ladies whose names marjorie could not catch and whom lady petchworth in that wellcontrolled voice of hers addressed as kate and julia and seemed on the whole disposed to treat as humorous there was also fraulein schmidt in charge of lady petchworths three tall and already abundant children prunella prudence and mary and a young newlymarried couple of cousins who addressed each other in soft undertones and sat apart these were the chief items that became distinctive in marjories survey but there were a number of other people who seemed to come and go split up fuse change their appearance slightly and behave in the way inadequately apprehended people do behave on these occasions  marjorie very speedily found her disposition to take a detached and amused view of the entertainment in conflict with more urgent demands from the outset mr magnet loomed upon herhe loomed nearer and nearer he turned his eye upon her as she came up to the wealthy expanse of lady petchworths presence like some sort of obsolescent ironclad turning a dullgrey respectful loving searchlight upon a fugitive torpedo boat and thereafter he seemed to her to be looking at her without intermission relentlessly and urging himself towards her she wished he wouldnt she hadnt at all thought he would on this occasion  at first she relied upon her natural powers of evasion and the presence of a large company then gradually it became apparent that lady petchworth and her mother yesand the party generally and the gardens and the weather and the stars in their courses were of a mind to cooperate in giving opportunity for mr magnets unmistakable intentions  and marjorie with that instability of her sex which has been a theme for masculine humour in all ages suddenly and with an extraordinary violence didnt want to make up her mind about mr magnet she didnt want to accept him and as distinctly she didnt want to refuse him she didnt even want to be thought about as making up her mind about himwhich was so to speak an enlargement of her previous indisposition she didnt even want to seem to avoid him or to be thinking about him or aware of his existence  after the greeting of lady petchworth she had succeeded very clumsily in not seeing mr magnet and had addressed herself to mr wintersloan who was standing a little apart looking under his hand with one eye shut at the view between the tree stems towards buryhamstreet he told her that he thought he had found something pooty that hadnt been done and she did her best to share his artistic interests with a vivid sense of mr magnets tentative incessant approach behind her  he joined them and she made a desperate attempt to entangle mr wintersloan in a threecornered talk in vain he turned away at the first possible opportunity and left her to an embarrassed and eloquently silent têteàtête mr magnets professional wit had deserted him its nice to see you again he said after an immense interval shall we go and look at the aviary  i hate to see birds in cages said marjorie and its frightfully jolly just here do you think mr wintersloan will paint this he does paint doesnt he  i know him best in black and white said mr magnet  marjorie embarked on entirely insincere praises of mr wintersloans manner and personal effect magnet replied tepidly with an air of reserving himself to grapple with the first conversational opportunity  its a splendid day for tennis said marjorie i think i shall play tennis all the afternoon  i dont play well enough for this publicity  its glorious exercise said marjorie almost as good as dancing and she decided to stick to that resolution i never lose a chance of tennis if i can help it  she glanced round and detected a widening space between themselves and the next adjacent group  theyre looking at the goldfish she said let us join them  everyone moved away as they came up to the little round pond but then marjorie had luck and captured prunella and got her to hold hands and talk until fraulein schmidt called the child away and then marjorie forced mr magnet to introduce her to mr bunford paradise she had a bright idea of sitting between prunella and mary at the lunch table but a higher providence had assigned her to a seat at the end between juliaor was it kateand mr magnet however one of the undergraduates was opposite and she saved herself from undertones by talking across to him boldly about newnham though she hadnt an idea of his name or college from that she came to tennis to her inflamed imagination he behaved as if she was under a taboo but she was desperate and had pledged him and his friend to a foursome before the meal was over  dont you play said the undergraduate to mr magnet  very little said mr magnet very little  at the end of an hour she was conspicuously and publicly shepherded from the tennis court by mrs pope  other people want to play said her mother in a clear little undertone  mr magnet fielded her neatly as she came off the court  you play tennis likea wild bird he said taking possession of her  only marjories entire freedom from irish blood saved him from a vindictive repartee   § 3  shall we go and look at the aviary said mr magnet reverting to a favourite idea of his and then remembered she did not like to see caged birds  perhaps we might see the water garden he said the water garden is really very delightful indeedanyhow you ought to see that  on the spur of the moment marjorie could think of no objection to the water garden and he led her off  i often think of that jolly walk we had last summer said mr magnet and how you talked about your work at oxbridge  marjorie fell into a sudden rapture of admiration for a butterfly  twice more was mr magnet baffled and then they came to the little pool of water lilies with its miniature cascade of escape at the head and source of the water garden one of lady petchworths great successes said mr magnet  i suppose the lotus is like the waterlily said marjorie with no hope of staving off the inevitable  she stood very still by the little pool and in spite of her pensive regard of the floating blossoms stiffly and intensely aware of his relentless regard  marjorie came his voice at last strangely softened there is something i want to say to you  she made no reply  ever since we met last summer  a clear cold little resolution not to stand this had established itself in marjories mind if she must decide she would decide he had brought it upon himself  marjorie said mr magnet i love you  she lifted a clear unhesitating eye to his face im sorry mr magnet she said  i wanted to ask you to marry me he said  im sorry mr magnet she repeated  they looked at one another she felt a sort of scared exultation at having done it her mother might say what she liked  i love you very much he said at a loss  im sorry she repeated obstinately  i thought you cared for me a little  she left that unanswered she had a curious feeling that there was no getting away from this splashing babbling pool that she was fixed there until mr magnet chose to release her and that he didnt mean to release her yet in which case she would go on refusing  im disappointed he said  marjorie could only think that she was sorry again but as she had already said that three times she remained awkwardly silent  is it because he began and stopped  it isnt because of anything please lets go back to the others mr magnet im sorry if im disappointing  and by a great effort she turned about  mr magnet remained regarding heri can only compare it to the searching preliminary gaze of an artistic photographer for a crucial minute in his life marjorie hated him i dont understand he said at last  then with a sort of naturalness that ought to have touched her he said is it possible marjoriethat i might hopethat i have been inopportune  she answered at once with absolute conviction  i dont think so mr magnet  im sorry he said to have bothered you  im sorry said marjorie  a long silence followed  im sorry too he said  they said no more but began to retrace their steps it was over abruptly mr magnets bearing had become despondentconspicuously despondent i had hoped he said and sighed  with a thrill of horror marjorie perceived he meant to look rejected let every one see he had been rejectedafter encouragement  what would they think how would they look what conceivably might they not say something of the importance of the thing she had done became manifest to her she felt first intimations of regret they would all be watching mother daffy lady petchworth she would reappear with this victim visibly suffering beside her what could she say to straighten his back and lift his chin she could think of nothing ahead at the end of the shaded path she could see the copious white form the agitated fair wig and red sunshade of lady petchworth   § 4  mrs popes eye was relentless nothing seemed hidden from it nothing indeed was hidden from it mr magnets back was diagrammatic marjorie was a little flushed and brighteyed and professed herself eager with an unnatural enthusiasm to play golfcroquet it was eloquently significant that mr magnet did not share her eagerness declined to play and yet when she had started with the rev jopling baynes as partner stood regarding the game with a sort of tender melancholy from the shade of the big chestnuttree  mrs pope joined him unobtrusively  youre not playing mr magnet she remarked  im a lookeron this time he said with a sigh  marjories winning i think said mrs pope  he made no answer for some seconds  she looks so charming in that blue dress he remarked at last and sighed from the lowest deeps  that birdsegg blue suits her said mrs pope ignoring the sigh shes clever in her girlish way she chooses all her own dressescolours material everything  and also though mrs pope had not remarked it she concealed her bills  there came a still longer interval which mrs pope ended with the slightest of shivers she perceived mr magnet was heavy for sympathy and ripe to confide i think she said its a little cool here shall we walk to the water garden and see if there are any white lilies  there are said mr magnet sorrowfully and they are very beautifulquite beautiful  he turned to the path along which he had so recently led marjorie  he glanced back as they went along between lady petchworths herbaceous border and the poppy beds shes so full of life he said with a sigh in his voice  mrs pope knew she must keep silent  i asked her to marry me this afternoon mr magnet blurted out i couldnt help it  mrs pope made her silence very impressive  i know i ought not to have done so without consulting youhe went on lamely im very much in love with her itsits done no harm  mrs popes voice was soft and low i had no idea mr magnet you know she is very young twenty a mother  i know said magnet i can quite understand but ive done no harm she refused me i shall go away tomorrow go right away for ever im sorry  another long silence  to me of course shes just a child mrs pope said at last she is only a child mr magnet she could have had no idea that anything of the sort was in your mind  her words floated away into the stillness  for a time they said no more the lilies came into sight dreaming under a rich green shade on a limpid pool of brown water water that slept and brimmed over as it were unconsciously into a cool splash and ripple of escape how beautiful cried mrs pope for a moment genuine  i spoke to her here said mr magnet  the fountains of his confidence were unloosed  now ive spoken to you about it mrs pope he said i can tell you just how ioh its the only wordadore her she seems so sweet and easyso graceful  mrs pope turned on him abruptly and grasped his hands she was deeply moved i cant tell you she said what it means to a mother to hear such things  words failed her and for some moments they engaged in a mutual pressure  ah said mr magnet and had a queer wish it was the mother he had to deal with  are you sure mr magnet mrs pope went on as their emotions subsided that she really meant what she said girls are very strange creatures  she seems so clear and positive  her manner is always clear and positive  yes i know  i know she has cared for you  no  a mother sees when your name used to be mentioned but these are not things to talk about there is somethingsomething sacred  yes he said yes onlyof course one thing  mrs pope seemed lost in the contemplation of waterlilies  i wondered said mr magnet and paused again  then almost breathlessly i wondered if there should be perhapssome one else  she shook her head slowly i should know she said  are you sure  i know i should know  perhaps recently  i am sure i should know a mothers intuition  memories possessed her for awhile a girl of twenty is a mass of contradictions i can remember myself as if it was yesterday often one says no or yesout of sheer nervousness i am sure there is no other attachment  it occurred to her that she had said enough what a dignity that old goldfish has she remarked he waves his tailas if he were a beadle waving little boys out of church   § 5  mrs pope astonished marjorie by saying nothing about the all too obvious event of the day for some time but her manner to her second daughter on their way home was strangely gentle it was as if she had realized for the first time that regret and unhappiness might come into that young life after supper however she spoke they had all gone out just before the children went to bed to look for the new moon daffy was showing the pseudotwins the old moon in the new moons arms and marjorie found herself standing by her mothers side i hope dear said mrs pope that its all for the bestand that youve done wisely dear  marjorie was astonished and moved by her mothers tone  its so difficult to know what is for the best mrs pope went on  i had to doas i did said marjorie  i only hope you may never find you have made a great mistake dear he cares for you very very much  oh we see it now cried rom we see it now mummy have you seen it like a little old round ghost being nursed  when marjorie said goodnight mrs pope kissed her with an unaccustomed effusion  it occurred to marjorie that after all her mother had no selfish end to serve in this affair   § 6  the idea that perhaps after all she had made a great mistake the mistake of her life it might be was quite firmly established in its place among all the other ideas in marjories mind by the time she had dressed next morning subsequent events greatly intensified this persuasion a pair of new stockings she had trusted sprang a bad hole as she put them on she found two unmistakable bills from oxbridge beside her plate and her father was horrid at breakfast  her father it appeared had bought the ordinary shares of a cuban railway very extensively on the distinct understanding that they would improve in a decent universe with a proper respect for meritorious gentlemen these shares would have improved accordingly but the weather had seen fit to shatter the wisdom of mr pope altogether the sugar crop had collapsed the bears were at work and every morning now saw his nominal capital diminished by a dozen pounds or so i do not know what mr pope would have done if he had not had his family to help him bear his trouble as it was he relieved his tension by sending theodore from the table for dropping a knife telling rom when she turned the plate round to pick the largest banana that she hadnt the selfrespect of a child of five and remarking sharply from behind the times when daffy asked marjorie if she was going to sketch oh for gods sake dont whisper then when mrs pope came round the table and tried to take his coffee cup softly to refill it without troubling him he snatched at it wrenched it roughly out of her hand and said with his mouth full and strangely in the manner of a snarling beast no ready yet half foo  marjorie wanted to know why every one didnt get up and leave the room she glanced at her mother and came near to speaking  and very soon she would have to come home and live in the midst of this againindefinitely  after breakfast she went to the tumbledown summerhouse by the duckpond and contemplated the bills she had not dared to open at table one was boots nearly three pounds the other books over seven i know thats wrong said marjorie and rested her chin on her hand knitted her brows and tried to remember the details of orders and deliveries  marjorie had fallen into the net prepared for our sons and daughters by the delicate modesty of the oxbridge authorities in money matters and she was for her circumstances rather heavily in debt but i must admit that in marjories nature the oxbridge conditions had found an eager and adventurous streak that rendered her particularly apt to these temptations  i doubt if reticence is really a virtue in a teacher but this is a fearful world and the majority of those who instruct our youth have the painful sensitiveness of the cloistered soul to this spirit of terror in things the young need particularly to be told truthfully and fully all we know of three fundamental things the first of which is god the next their duty towards their neighbours in the matter of work and money and the third sex these things and the adequate why of them and some sort of adequate how make all that matters in education but all three are obscure and deeply moving topics topics for which the donnish mind has a kind of special ineptitude and which it evades with the utmost skill and delicacy the middle part of this evaded triad was now being taken up in marjories case by the oxbridge tradespeople  the oxbridge shopkeeper is peculiar among shopkeepers in the fact that he has to do very largely with shy and immature customers with an extreme and distinctive ignorance of most commercial things they are for the most part short of cash but with vague and often large probabilities of credit behind them for most people even quite straitened people will pull their sons and daughters out of altogether unreasonable debts at the end of their university career and so the oxbridge shopkeeper becomes a sort of propagandist of the charms and advantages of insolvency alone among retailers he dislikes the sight of cash declines it affects to regard it as a coarse ignorant truncation of a budding relationship begs to be permitted to wait so the youngster just up from home discovers that money may stay in the pocket be used for cab and train fares and light refreshments all the rest may be had for the asking marjorie with her innate hunger for good fine things with her quite insufficient pocketmoney and the irregular habits of expenditure a spasmodically financed hardup home is apt to engender fell very readily into this new delightful custom of having it put down whatever it happened to be she had all sorts of things put down she and the elder carmel girl used to go shopping together having things put down she brightened her rooms with colourprints and engravings got herself pretty and becoming clothes acquired a fitted dressingbag already noted in this story and one or two other trifles of the sort revised her footwear created a very nice little bookshelf and although at times she felt a little astonished and scared at herself resolutely refused to estimate the total of accumulated debt she had attained indeed until the bills came in it was impossible to do that because following the splendid example of the carmel girl she hadnt even inquired the price of quite a number of things  she didnt dare think now of the total she lied even to herself about that she had fixed on fifty pounds as the unendurable maximum it is less than fifty pounds she said and added must be but something in her below the threshold of consciousness knew that it was more  and now she was in her third year and the oxbridge tradesman generally satisfied with the dimensions of her account and no longer anxious to see it grow was displaying the less obsequious side of his character he wrote remarks at the bottom of his account remarks about settlement about having a bill to meet about having something to go on with he asked her to give the matter her early attention she had a disagreeable persuasion that if she wanted many more things anywhere she would have to pay ready money for them she was particularly short of stockings she had overlooked stockings recently  daffy unfortunately was also short of stockings  and now back with her family again everything conspired to remind marjorie of the old stringent habits from which she had had so delightful an interlude she saw daffy eye her possessions reflect this morning something of the awfulness of her position came to her  at oxbridge she had made rather a joke of her debts  id swear i havent had three pairs of house shoes said marjorie but what can one do  and about the whole position the question was what can one do  she proceeded with tense nervous movements to tear these two distasteful demands into very minute pieces then she collected them all together in the hollow of her hand and buried them in the loose mould in a corner of the summerhouse  madge said theodore appearing in the sunshine of the doorway aunt plessingtons coming shes sent a wire someones got to meet her by the twelveforty train   § 7  aunt plessingtons descent was due to her sudden discovery that buryhamstreet was in close proximity to summerhay park indeed only three miles away she had promised a lecture on her movement for lady petchworths village room in summerhay and she found that with a slight readjustment of dates she could combine this engagement with her promised visit to her husbands sister and an evening or so of influence for her little madge so she had sent hubert to telegraph at once and here she said triumphantly on the platform after a hard kiss at marjories cheek we are again  there at any rate she was and uncle hubert was up the platform seeing after the luggage in his small anxious way  aunt plessington was a tall lean woman with firm features a high colour and a bright eye who wore hats to show she despised them and carefully dishevelled hair her dress was always good but extremely old and grubby and she commanded respect chiefly by her voice her voice was the true governingclass voice a strangulated contralto abundant and authoritative it made everything she said clear and important so that if she said it was a fine morning it was like leaded print in the times and she had over her large front teeth lips that closed quietly and with a slight effort after her speeches as if the words she spoke tasted well and left a peaceful secure sensation in the mouth  uncle hubert was a less distinguished figure and just a little reminiscent of the small attached husbands one finds among the lower crustacea he was much shorter and rounder than his wife and if he had been left to himself he would probably have been comfortably fat in his quiet little way but aunt plessington had made him a haigite which is one of the fiercer kinds of hygienist just in the nick of time he had round shoulders a large nose and glasses that made him look astonishedand she said he had a great gift for practical things and made him see after everything in that line while she did the lecturing his directions to the porter finished he came up to his niece hello marjorie he said in a peculiar voice that sounded as though his mouth was full though of course poor dear it wasnt hows the first class  a seconds good enough for me uncle hubert said marjorie and asked if they would rather walk or go in the donkey cart which was waiting outside with daffy aunt plessington with an air of great bonhomie said shed ride in the donkey cart and they did but no pseudotwins or theodore came to meet this arrival as both uncle and aunt had a way of asking how the lessons were getting on that they found extremely disagreeable also their aunt measured them and incited them with loud encouraging noises to grow one against the other in an urgent disturbing fashion  aunt plessingtons being was consumed by thoughts of getting on she was like bernard shaws life force and she really did not seem to think there was anything in existence but shoving she had no idea what a lark life can be and occasionally how beautiful it can be when you do not shove if only which becomes increasingly hard each year you can get away from the shovers she was one of an energetic family of eight sisters who had maintained themselves against a mutual pressure by the use of their elbows from the cradle they had all married against each other all sorts of people two had driven their husbands into bishoprics and made quite typical bishops wives one got a leading barrister one a high waroffice official and one a rich jew and aunt plessington after spending some years in just missing a rich and only slightly demented baronet had pouncedits the only word for iton uncle hubert a woman is nothing without a husband she said and took him he was a fairly comfortable oxford don in his furtive way and bringing him out and using him as a basis she specialized in intellectual philanthropy and evolved her movement it was quite remarkable how rapidly she overhauled her sisters again  what the movement was varied considerably from time to time but it was always aggressively beneficial towards the lower strata of the community among its central ideas was her belief that these lower strata can no more be trusted to eat than they can to drink and that the licensing monopoly which has made the poor mans beer thick lukewarm and discreditable and so greatly minimized its consumption should be extended to the solid side of his dietary she wanted to place considerable restrictions upon the sale of all sorts of meat upon groceries and the less hygienic and more palatable forms of bread which do not sufficiently stimulate the coatings of the stomach to increase the present difficulties in the way of tobacco purchasers and to put an end to that wanton and deleterious consumption of sweets which has so bad an effect upon the enamel of the teeth of the younger generation closely interwoven with these proposals was an adoption of the principle of the east purblow experiment the principle of payment in kind she was quite in agreement with mr pope that poor people when they had money frittered it away and so she proposed very extensive changes in the truck act which could enable employers under suitable safeguards and with the advice of a small body of spinster inspectors to supply hygienic housing approved clothing of moral and wholesome sort various forms of insurance edifying rations cuisine medical aid and educational facilities as circumstances seemed to justify in lieu of the wages the employees handled so ill  as no people in england will ever admit they belong to the lower strata of society aunt plessingtons movement attracted adherents from every class in the community  she now as they drove slowly to the vicarage recounted to marjorieshe had the utmost contempt for daffy because of her irregular teeth and a general lack of progressive activitythe steady growth of the movement and the increasing respect shown for her and hubert in the world of politicosocial reform some of the meetings she had addressed had been quite full various people had made various remarks about her hostile for the most part and yet insidiously flattering and everybody seemed quite glad to come to the little dinners she gave in order she said to gather social support for her reforms she had been staying with the mastersteins who were keenly interested and after she had polished off lady petchworth she was to visit lady rosenbaum it was all going on swimmingly these newer english gentry were eager to learn all she had to teach in the art of breaking in the anglosaxon villagers and now how was marjorie going on and what was she going to do in the world  marjorie said she was working for her final  and what then asked aunt plessington  not very clear aunt yet  looking around for something to take up  yes aunt  well youve time yet and its just as well to see how the land lies before you begin it saves going back youll have to come up to london with me for a little while and see things and be seen a little  i should love to  ill give you a good time said aunt plessington nodding promisingly theodore getting on in school  hes had his remove  and hows sydney getting on with the music  excellently  and rom rom getting on  marjorie indicated a more restrained success  and whats daffy doing  oh get on said daffy and suddenly whacked the donkey rather hard i beg your pardon aunt  i asked what you were up to daffy  dusting auntand the virtues said daffy  you ought to find something better than that  father tells me a lot about the east purblow experiment said daffy after a perceptible interval  ah cried aunt plessington with a loud encouraging note but evidently making the best of it thats better sociological observation  yes aunt said daffy and negotiated a corner with exceptional care   § 8  mrs pope who had an instinctive disposition to pad when aunt plessington was about had secured the presence at lunch of mr magnet who was after all staying on in buryhamstreet and the rev jopling baynes aunt plessington liked to meet the clergy and would always if she could win them over to an interest in the movement she opened the meal with a brisk attack upon him come mr baynes she said what do your people eat here hubert and i are making a study of the gluttonous side of village life and we find that no one knows so much of that as the vicarnot even the doctor  the reverend jopling baynes was a clergyman of the evasive type with a quite distinguished voice he pursed his lips and made his eyes round well mrs plessington he said and fingered his glass its the usual dietary the usual dietary  too much and too rich badly cooked and eaten too fast said aunt plessington and what do you think is the remedy  we make an effort said the rev jopling baynes we make an effort a hint here a word there  nothing organized  no said the rev jopling baynes and shook his head with a kind of resignation  we are going to alter all that said aunt plessington briskly and went on to expound the movement and the diverse way in which it might be possible to control and improve the domestic expenditure of the working classes  the rev jopling baynes listened sympathetically across the table and tried to satisfy a healthy appetite with as abstemious an air as possible while he did so aunt plessington passed rapidly from general principles to a sketch of the success of the movement and hubert who had hitherto been busy with his lunch became audible from behind the exceptionally large floral trophy that concealed him from his wife bubbling confirmatory details she was very bright and convincing as she told of this prominent man met and subdued that leading antagonist confuted and how the bishops were coming in she made it clear in her swift way that an intelligent cleric resolved to get on in this world en route for a better one hereafter might do worse than take up her movement and this touched in she turned her mind to mr magnet  that floral trophy i should explain by the by was exceptionally large because of mrs popes firm conviction that aunt plessington starved her husband accordingly she masked him and so was able to heap second and third helpings upon his plate without aunt plessington discovering his lapse the avidity with which hubert ate confirmed her worst suspicions and evinced so far as anything ever did evince his gratitude  well mr magnet she said i wish i had your sense of humour  i wish you had said mr magnet  i should write tracts said aunt plessington  i knew it was good for something said mr magnet and daffy laughed in a tentative way  i mean it said aunt plessington brightly think if we had a dickensand you are the nearest man alive to dickenson the side of social reform today  mr magnets light manner deserted him we do what we can mrs plessington he said  how much more might be done said aunt plessington if humour could be organized  hear hear said mr pope  if all the humorists of england could be induced to laugh at something together  they doat times said mr magnet but the atmosphere was too serious for his light touch  they could laugh it out of existence said aunt plessington  it was evident mr magnet was struck by the idea  of course he said in punch to which i happen to be an obscure occasional contributor  mrs pope was understood to protest that he should not say such things  we do remember just what we can do either in the way of advertising or injury i dont think youll find us up against any really solid institutions  but do you think mr magnet you are sufficiently kind to the new aunt plessington persisted  i think we are all grateful to punch said the rev jopling baynes suddenly and sonorously for its steady determination to direct our mirth into the proper channels i do not think that any one can accuse its editor of being unmindful of his great responsibilities  marjorie found it a very interesting conversation  she always met her aunt again with a renewal of a kind of admiration that loud authoritative rudeness that bold thrusting forward of the movement until it became the sole criterion of worth or success this annihilation by disregard of all that aunt plessington wasnt and didnt and couldnt always in the intervals seemed too good to be true of course this really was the way people got on and made a mark but she felt it must be almost as trying to the nerves as aeronautics suppose somewhere up there your engine stopped how aunt plessington dominated the table marjorie tried not to catch daffys eye daffy was unostentatiously keeping things going watching the mustard rescuing the butter restraining theodore and i am afraid not listening very carefully to aunt plessington the children were marvellously silent and jumpily wellbehaved and mr pope in a very unusual state of subdued amiability sat at the end of the table with the east purblow experiment on the tip of his tongue he liked aunt plessington and she was good for him they had the same inherent distrust of the intelligence and good intentions of their fellow creatures and she had the knack of making him feel that he too was getting on that she was saying things on his behalf in influential quarters and in spite of the almost universal conspiracy based on jealousy to ignore his stern oldworld virtues he might still be able to battle his way to the floor of the house of commons and there deliver himself before he died of a few sorely needed hometruths about motor cars decadence and frivolity generally   § 9  after lunch aunt plessington took her little madge for an energetic walk and showed herself far more observant than the egotism of her conversation at that meal might have led one to suppose or perhaps she was only better informed aunt plessington loved a good hard walk in the afternoon and if she could get any one else to accompany her then hubert stayed at home and curled up into a ball on a sofa somewhere and took a little siesta that made him all the brighter for the intellectual activities of the evening the thought of a young life new untarnished just at the outset just addressing itself to the task of getting on always stimulated her mind extremely and she talked to marjorie with a very real and effectual desire to help her to the utmost of her ability  she talked of a start in life and the sort of start she had had she showed how many people who began with great advantages did not shove sufficiently and so dropped out of things and werent seen and mentioned she defended herself for marrying hubert and showed what a clever shoving thing it had been to do it startled people a little and made them realize that here was a woman who wanted something more in a man than a handsome organgrinder she made it clear that she thought a clever marriage if not a startlingly brilliant one the first duty of a girl it was a girls normal gambit she branched off to the things single women might do in order to justify this view she did not think single women could do very much they might perhaps shove as suffragettes but even there a husband helped tremendouslyif only by refusing to bail you out she ran over the cases of a number of prominent single women  and what said aunt plessington do they all amount to a girl is so hampered and an old maid is so neglected said aunt plessington  she paused  why dont you up and marry mr magnet marjorie she said with her most brilliant flash  it takes two to make a marriage aunt said marjorie after a slight hesitation  my dear child he worships the ground you tread on said aunt plessington  hes rathergrown up said marjorie  not a bit of it hes not forty hes just the age  im afraid its a little impossible  impossible  you see ive refused him aunt  naturallythe first time but i wouldnt send him packing the second  there was an interval  marjorie decided on a blunt question do you really think aunt i should do well to marry mr magnet  hed give you everything a clever woman needs said aunt plessington everything  with swift capable touches she indicated the sort of life the future mrs magnet might enjoy hes evidently a man who wants helping to a position she said of course his farces and things im told make no end of money but hes just a crude gift by himself money like that is nothing with a clever wife he might be all sorts of things without one hell just subsideyou know the sort of thing this sort of man does a rather eccentric humorous house in the country golf croquet horseriding rosegrowing queer hats  isnt that rather what he would like to do aunt said marjorie  thats not our business madge said aunt plessington with humorous emphasis  she began to sketch out a different and altogether smarter future for the fortunate humorist there would be a house in a good central position in london where marjorie would have bright successful lunches and dinners very unpretending and very good and tempt the clever smart with the lure of the interestingly clever there would be a bright little country cottage in some pretty accessible place to which aunt and uncle plessington and able and influential people generally could be invited for gaily recreative and yet extremely talkative and helpful weekends both places could be made centres of intrigue conspiracies for getting on and helping and exchanging help could be organized people could be warned against people whose gettingon was undesirable in the midst of it all dressed with all the natural wit she had and an enlarging experience would be marjorie shining like a rising planet it wouldnt be long if she did things well before she had permanent officials and young cabinet ministers mingling with her salad of writers and humorists and the plessington connexion  then said aunt plessington with a joyous lift in her voice youll begin to weed a little  for a time the girls mind resisted her  but marjorie was of the impressionable sex at an impressionable age and there was something overwhelming in the undeviating conviction of her aunt in the clear assurance of her voice that this life which interested her was the real life the only possible successful life the world reformed itself in marjories fluent mind until it was all a scheme of influence and effort and ambition and triumphs dinnerparties and receptions men wearing orders cabinet ministers more than a little in love asking her advice beautiful robes a great blaze of lights why she might be said aunt plessington rising to enthusiasm another marcella the life was not without its adventurous side it wasnt in any way dull aunt plessington to illustrate that point told amusing anecdotes of how two almost impudent invitations on her part had succeeded and how she had once scored off her elder sister by getting a coveted celebrity through their close family resemblance after accepting he couldnt very well refuse because i wasnt somebody else she ended gleefully so he cameand stayed as long as anybody  what else was there for marjorie to contemplate if she didnt take this by no means unattractive line what was the alternative some sort of employment after a battle with her father a parsimonious life and even then the oxbridge tradesmen and their immortal bills  aunt plessington was so intent upon her theme that she heeded nothing of the delightful little flowers she trampled under foot across the down nor the jolly squirrel with an artistic temperament who saw fit to give an uninvited opinion upon her personal appearance from the security of a beechtree in the wood but marjorie noting quite a number of such things with the corner of her mind and being now well under the plessington sway wished she had more concentration  in the evening after supper the customary games were suspended and mr and mrs plessington talked about getting on and work and efficiency generally and explained how soandso had spoilt his chances in life and why soandso was sure to achieve nothing and how this man ate too much and that man drank too much and on the contrary what promising and capable people the latest adherents of and subscribers to the movement were until two glasses of hot water cameaunt plessington had been told it was good for her digestion and she thought it just as well that hubert should have some tooand it was time for every one to go to bed   § 10  next morning an atmosphere of getting on and strenuosity generally prevailed throughout the vicarage the plessingtons were preparing a memorandum on their movement for the reformers year book every word was of importance and might win or lose adherents and subscribers and they secured the undisturbed possession of the drawingroom from which the higher notes of aunt plessingtons voice explaining the whole thing to hubert who had to write it out reached a spur to effort into every part of the house  their influence touched every one  marjorie struck by the idea that she was not perhaps getting on at oxbridge so fast as she ought to do went into the summerhouse with marshalls principles of economics read for two hours and did not think about her bills for more than a quarter of the time rom who had already got up early and read through about a third of aurora leigh now set herself with dogged determination to finish that great poem syd practised an extra ten minutesfor aunt plessington didnt mind practice so long as there wasnt a tune mrs pope went into the kitchen and made a longneeded fuss about the waste of rice mr pope began the pamphlet he had had in contemplation for some time upon the advantages to public order of payment in kind theodore who had washed behind his ears and laced his boots in all the holes went into the yard before breakfast and hit a tennis ball against the wall and back five hundred and twentytwo timesa record he would have resumed this after breakfast but his father came round the corner of the house with a pen in his mouth and asked him indistinctly but fiercely what the devil he was doing so he went away and after a fretful interval set himself to revise his latin irregular verbs by twelve he had done wonders  later in the day the widening circle of aggressive urgency reached the kitchen and at two the cook gave notice in order she said to better herself  lunch unconscious of this impending shadow was characterized by a virtuous cheerfulness and aunt plessington told in detail how her seven and twenty nephews and nieces the children of her various sisters were all getting on on the whole they were not getting on so brilliantly as they might have done which indeed is apt to be the case with the children of people who have loved not well but too wisely and it was borne in upon the mind of the respectfully listening marjorie that to borrow an easy colloquialism of her aunts she might take the shine out of the lot of them with a very little zeal and effortand of course mr magnet  the lecture in the evening at summerhay was a great success  the chair was taken by the rev jopling baynes lady petchworth was enthroned behind the table hubert was in charge of his wifes notesif notes should be neededand mr pope expectant of an invitation at the end to say a few words about the east purblow experiment also occupied a chair on the platform lady petchworth with her abundant soft blond hair brightly blond still in spite of her fiftyfive years her delicate features her plump hands her numerous chins and her entirely inaudible voice made a pleasing contrast with aunt plessingtons resolute personality she had perhaps an even greater assurance of authority but it was a quiet assurance you felt that she knew that if she spoke in her sleep she would be obeyed that it was quite unnecessary to make herself heard the two women indeed the one so assertive the other so established were at the opposite poles of authoritative british womanhood and harmonized charmingly the little room struck the note of a wellregulated brightness at every point it had been decorated in a keltic but entirely respectful style by one of lady petchworths artistic discoveries it was lit by paraffin lamps that smelt hardly at all and it was gay with colour prints illustrating the growth of the british empire from the battle of ethandune to the surrender of cronje the hall was fairly full few could afford to absent themselves from these brightening occasions but there was a tendency on the part of the younger and the less thoughtful section of the village manhood to accumulate at the extreme back and rumble in what appeared to be a slightly ironical spirit so far as it had any spirit with its feet  the rev jopling baynes opened proceedings with a few wellchosen remarks in which he complimented every one present either singly or collectively according to their rank and importance and then aunt plessington came forward to the centre of the platform amidst a hectic flush of applause and said haw in a loud clear ringing tone  she spoke without resorting to the notes in huberts little fist very freely and easily her strangulated contralto went into every corner of the room and positively seemed to look for and challenge inattentive auditors she had come over she said and she had been very glad to come over and talk to them that night because it meant not only seeing them but meeting her very dear delightful friend lady petchworth loud applause and staying for a day or so with her brotherinlaw mr pope unsupported outburst of applause from mr magnet to whom she and social reform generally owed so much she had come to talk to them that night about the national good habits movement which was attracting so much attention and which bore so closely on our national life and character she happened to behere aunt plessington smiled as she spokea humble person connected with that movement just a mere woman connected with it she was going to explain to them as well as she could in her womanly way and in the time at her disposal just what it was and just what it was for and just what means it adopted and just what ends it had in view well they all knew what habits were and that there were good habits and bad habits and she supposed that the difference between a good man and a bad man was just that the good man had good habits and the bad one had bad habits everybody she supposed wanted to get on if a man had good habits he got on and if he had bad habits he didnt get on and she supposed it was the same with a country if its people had good habits they got on and if its people had bad habits they didnt get on for her own part she and her husband hubert gave a little selfconscious jump had always cultivated good habits and she had to thank him with all her heart for his help in doing so applause from the front seats now the whole idea of her movement was to ask how can we raise the standard of the national habits how can we get rid of bad habits and cultivate good ones here there was a slight interruption due to some one being suddenly pushed off the end of a form at the back and coming to the floor with audible violence after which a choked and obstructed tittering continued intermittently for some time  some of her audience she remarked had not yet acquired the habit of sitting still  laughter and a coarse vulgar voice good old billy punt  well to resume she and her husband had made a special and careful study of habits they had consulted all sorts of people and collected all sorts of statistics in fact they had devoted themselves to this question and the conclusion to which they came was this that good habits were acquired by training and bad habits came from neglect and carelessness and leaving people who werent fit for such freedom to run about and do just whatever they liked and so she went on with a note of complete demonstration the problem resolved itself into the question of how far they could get more training into the national life and how they could check extravagant and unruly and wasteful and unwise ways of living hear hear from mr pope and this was the problem she and her husband had set themselves to solve  scuffle and a boys voice at the back saying oh shut it nuts shut it  well she and her husband had worked the thing out and they had come to the conclusion that what was the matter with the great mass of english people was first that they had rather too much loose money and secondly that they had rather too much loose time a voice what o and the rev jopling baynes suddenly extended his neck knitted his brows and became observant of the interrupter she did not say they had too much money a second voice not arf but too much loose money she did not say they had too much time but too much loose time that is to say they had money and time they did not know how to spend properly and so they got into mischief a great number of people in this country she maintained and this was especially true of the lower classes did not know how to spend either money or time they bought themselves wasteful things and injurious things and they frittered away their hours in all sorts of foolish unprofitable ways and after the most careful and scientific study of this problem she and her husband had come to the conclusion that two main principles must underlie any remedial measures that were attempted the first of which was the principle of payment in kind which had already had so interesting a trial at the great carriage works of east purblow and the second the principle of continuous occupation which had been recognized long ago in popular wisdom by that admirable proverbor rather quotationshe believed it was a quotation though she gave she feared very little time to poetry better employed from mr pope      satan finds some mischief still     for idle hands to do  irrepressible outbreak of wild and sustained applause from the back seats and in a sudden lull a female voice asking in a flattened thwarted tone aint there to be no lantern then  the lecturer went on to explain what was meant by either member of what perhaps they would permit her to call this doublebarrelled social remedy  it was an admirable piece of lucid exposition slowly the picture of a better happier more disciplined england grew upon the minds of the meeting first she showed the new sort of employer her movement would evoke an employer paternal philanthropic vaguely responsible for the social order of all his dependants lady petchworth was seen to nod her head slowly at this only in the last resort and when he was satisfied that his worker and his workers family were properly housed hygienically clothed and fed attending suitable courses of instruction and free from any vicious inclinations would he pay wages in cash in the discharge of the duties of payment he would have the assistance of expert advice and the stimulus of voluntary inspectors of his own class he would be the natural clanmaster the captain and leader adviser and caretaker of his banded employees responsibility would stimulate him and if responsibility did not stimulate him inspectors both men and women inspectors would the worker on the other hand would be enormously more healthy and efficient under the new régime his home designed by qualified and officially recognized architects would be prettier as well as more convenient and elevating to his taste his children admirably trained and dressed in the new and more beautiful clothing with which lady petchworth applause had done so much to make them familiar his vital statistics compared with current results would be astonishingly good his mind free from any anxiety but the proper anxiety of a man in his position to get his work done properly and earn recognition from those competent and duly authorized to judge it of all this she spoke with the inspiring note of absolute conviction all this would follow payment in kind and continuous occupation as days follow sunrise and there would alwaysand here aunt plessingtons voice seemed to brightenbe something for the worker to get on with something for him to do lectures classes readingrooms improving entertainments his time would be filled the proper authorities would see that it was filledand filled in the right way never for a moment need he be bored he would never have an excuse for being bored that was the second great idea the complementary idea to the first and here it is she said turning a large encouraging smile on lady petchworth that the work of a national theatre instructive stimulating well regulated and morally sustaining would come in he wouldnt of course be compelled to go but there would be his seat part of his payment in kind and the publichouse would be shut most other temptations would be removed  the lecture reached its end at last with only one other interruption some wouldbe humorist suddenly inquired à propos of nothing whats the fare to america billy and a voice presumably billys answered him morn youll ev av in you pocket  the rev jopling baynes before he called upon mr pope for his promised utterance about east purblow could not refrain from pointing out how silly in every sense of the word these wanton interruptions were what he asked had english social reform to do with the fare to americaand having roused the meeting to an alert silence by the length of his pause answered in a voice of ringing contempt nothingwhatsoever then mr pope made his few remarks about east purblow with the ease and finish that comes from long practice much he said had to be omitted in view of the restricted time at his disposal but he did not grudge that the time had been better filled no no from aunt plessington yes yesby the lucid and delightful lecture they had all enjoyed and he not least among them applause   § 11  they came out into a luminous blue night with a crescent young moon high overhead it was so fine that the popes and the plessingtons and mr magnet declined lady petchworths proffered car and walked back to buryhamstreet across the park through a sleeping pallid cornfield and along by the edge of the pine woods mr pope would have liked to walk with mr magnet and explain all that the pressure on his time had caused him to omit from his speech and why it was he had seen fit to omit this part and include that some occult power however baffled this intention and he found himself going home in the company of his brotherinlaw and daffy with aunt plessington and his wife like a barrier between him and his desire marjorie on the other hand found mr magnets proximity inevitable they fell a little behind and were together again for the first time since her refusal  he behaved she thought with very great restraint and indeed he left her a little doubtful on that occasion whether he had not decided to take her decision as final he talked chiefly about the lecture which had impressed him very deeply mrs plessington he said was so splendidmade him feel trivial he felt stirred up by her wanted to help in this social work this picking up of helpless people from the muddle in which they wallowed  he seemed not only extraordinarily modest but extraordinarily gentle that night and the warm moonshine gave his face a shadowed earnestness it lacked in more emphatic lights she felt the profound change in her feelings towards him that had followed her rejection of him it had cleared away his effect of oppression upon her she had no longer any sense of entanglement and pursuit and all the virtues his courtship had obscured shone clear again he was kindly he was patientand she felt something about him a woman is said always to respect he gave her an impression of ability after all he could banish the trouble that crushed and overwhelmed her with a movement of his little finger of all her load of debt he could earn the payment in a day  your aunt goes tomorrow he said  marjorie admitted it  i wish i could talk to her more shes so inspiring  you know of our little excursion for friday he asked after a pause  she had not heard friday was theodores birthday she knew it only too well because she had had to part with her stamp collectionwhich very luckily had chanced to get packed and come to buryhamstreetto meet its demand mr magnet explained he had thought it might be fun to give a picnic in honour of the anniversary  how jolly of you said marjorie  theres a pretty bit of river between wamping and friston hangerive wanted you to see it for a long time and friston hanger church has the prettiest view the tower gets the bend of the river  he told her all he meant to do as if he submitted his plans for her approval they would drive to wamping and get a very comfortable little steam launch one could hire there wintersloan was coming down again an idle day of this kind just suited his temperament theodore would like it wouldnt he  theodore will think he is king of surrey  ill have a rod and line if he wants to fish i dont want to forget anything i want it to be his day really and truly  the slightest touch upon the pathetic note she could not tell  but that evening brought marjorie nearer to loving magnet than she had ever been before she went to sleep that night she had decided he was quite a tolerable person again she had been too nervous and unjust with him after all his urgency and awkwardness had been just a part of his sincerity perhaps the faint doubt whether he would make his request again gave the zest of uncertainty to his devotion of course she told herself he would ask again and then the blissful air of limitless means she might breathe the blessed release  she was suddenly fast asleep   § 12  friday was after all not so much theodores day as mr magnets  until she found herself committed there was no shadow of doubt in marjories mind of what she meant to do before i see you again said aunt plessington at the parting kiss i hope youll have something to tell me she might have been hymen thinly disguised as an aunt waving from the departing train she continued by vigorous gestures and unstinted display of teeth and a fluttering handkerchief to encourage marjorie to marry mr magnet until the curve of the cutting hid her from view  fortune favoured mr magnet with a beautiful day and the excursion was bright and successful from the outset it was done well and what perhaps was more calculated to impress marjorie it was done with lavish generosity from the outset she turned a smiling countenance upon her host she did her utmost to suppress a reviving irrational qualm in her being to maintain clearly and simply her overnight decision that he should propose again and that she should accept him  yet the festival was just a little dreamlike in its quality to her perceptions she found she could not focus clearly on its details  two waggonettes came from wamping there was room for everybody and to spare and wamping revealed itself a pleasant small country town with stocks under the market hall and just that tint of green paint and that loafing touch the presence of a boating river gives  the launch was brilliantly smart with abundant crimson cushions and a tasselled awning and away to the left was a fine old bridge that dated in its essentials from plantagenet times  they started with much whistling and circling and went away up river under overhanging trees that sometimes swished the funnel splashing the meadow path and making the reeds and bulrushes dance with their wash they went through a reluctant lock steamed up a long reach they passed the queerly painted potwell inn with its picturesque group of poplars and its absurd new noticeboard of omlets  theodore was five stone of active happiness he and the pseudotwins strictly under his orders as the universal etiquette of birthdays prescribes clambered round and round the boat clutching the awning rail and hanging over the water in an entirely secure and perilous looking manner no one unless his father happened to be upset by something would check him he knew on this auspicious day mr magnet sat with the grey eye on marjorie and listened a little abstractedly to mr pope who was telling very fully what he would say if the liberal party were to ask his advice at the present juncture mrs pope attended discreetly and daffy and marjorie with a less restrained interest to mr wintersloan who showed them how to make faces out of a fist tied up in a pockethandkerchief how to ventriloquize how to conjure with halfpencewhich he did very amusinglyand what the buttons on a mans sleeve were for theodore clambering at his back discovered what he was at and by right of birthday made him do all the faces and tricks over again then mr wintersloan told stories of all the rivers along which he said he had travelled in steamboats the rhine the danube the hoogly and the fall river and particularly how he had been bitten by a very young crocodile its the smell of the oil brings it all back to me he said and the kind of sway it gives you  he made sinuous movements of his hand and looked at marjorie with that wooden yet expressive smile  friston hanger proved to be even better than wamping it had a character of its own because it was built very largely of a warm buff coloured local rock instead of the usual brick and the outhouses at least of the little inn at which they landed were thatched most of the cottages had casement windows with diamond panes and the streets were cobbled and very upanddown hill the place ran to high walls richly suggestive of hidden gardens overhung by big trees and pierced by secretive important looking doors and over it all rose an unusually big church with a tall buttressed tower surmounted by a lantern of pierced stone  well go through the town and look at the ruins of the old castle beyond the church said mr magnet to marjorie and then i want you to see the view from the church tower  and as they went through the street he called her attention again to the church tower in a voice that seemed to her to be inexplicably charged with significance i want you to go up there he said  how about something to eat mr magnet remarked theodore suddenly and everybody felt a little surprised when mr magnet answered who wants things to eat on your birthday theodore  but they saw the joke of that when they reached the castle ruins and found in the old tilting yard with its ivycovered arch framing a view of the town and stream a table spread with a white cloth that shone in the sunshine glittering with glass and silver and gay with a bowl of salad and flowers and cold pies and a jug of claretcup and an ice paila silver pail containing two promising looking bottles in the charge of two real live waiters in evening dress as waiters should be but with straw hats to protect them from the sun and weather oh cried mrs pope what a splendid idea mr magnet when the destination of the feast was perfectly clear and even theodore seemed a little overawedalmost as if he felt his birthday was being carried too far and might provoke a judgment later manifestly mr magnet must have ordered this in london and have had it sent down waiters and all theodore knew he was a very wonderful little boy in spite of the acute criticism of four devoted sisters and mr magnet had noticed him before at times but this was well rather immense look at the piecrusts old man and on the piecrusts and on the icing of the cake their munificent host had caused to be done in little raised letters of dough and chocolate the word theodore  oh mr magnet said marjoriehis eye so obviously invited her to say something mr pope tried a nebulous joke about groaning boards of frisky hanger and only mr wintersloan restrained his astonishment and admiration you could have got those chaps in livery he saidunheeded the lunch was as a matter of fact his idea he had refused to come unless it was provided and he had somehow counted on blue coats brass buttons and yellow waistcoatsbut everybody else of course ascribed the whole invention to mr magnet  well said mr pope with a fine air of epigram the only thing i can say isto eat it and prepared to sit down  melon cried mr magnet to the waiters well begin with the melon have you ever tried melon with pepper and salt mrs pope  you put salt in everything admired mr pope salt from those attics of yoursattic salt  or theres ginger said mr magnet after a whisper from the waiter  mr pope said something classical about ginger hot in the mouth  some of these days said mr wintersloan when i have exhausted all other sensations i mean to try melon and mustard  rom made a wonderful face at him  i can think of worse things than that said mr wintersloan with a hard brightness  not till after lunch mr wintersloan said rom heartily  the claret cups all right for theodore mrs pope said magnet its a special twelve year old brand he thought of everything  mummy said mr pope youd better carve this pie i think  i want very much said mr magnet in marjories ear and very confidentially to show you the view from the church tower i thinkit will appeal to you  rom said theodore uncontrollably in a tremendous stage whisper theres peaches there on the hamper  champagne mam said the waiter suddenly in mrs popes ear wiping icewater from the bottle  but what could it have cost him   § 13  marjorie would have preferred that mr magnet should not have decided with such relentless determination to make his second proposal on the church tower his purpose was luminously clear to her from the beginning of lunch onward and she could feel her nerves going under the strain of that long expectation she tried to pull herself together tried not to think about it tried to be amused by the high spirits and nonsense of mr wintersloan and syd and rom and theodore but mr magnet was very pervasive and her mother didnt ever look at her looked past her and away from her and all round her in a profoundly observant manner marjorie felt chiefly anxious to get to the top of that predestinate tower and have the whole thing over and it was with a start that she was just able to prevent one of the assiduous waiters filling her glass with champagne for the third time  there was a little awkwardness in dispersing after lunch mr pope his heart warmed by the champagne and mellowed by a subsequent excellent cigar wanted very much to crack what he called a postprandial jest or so with the great humorist while theodore also deeply impressed with the discovery that there was more in mr magnet than he had supposed displayed a strong disposition to attach himself more closely than he had hitherto done to this remarkable person and study his quiet but enormous possibilities with greater attention mrs pope with a still alertness did her best to get people adjusted but syd and rom had conceived a base and unnatural desire to subjugate the affections of the youngest waiter and wouldnt listen to her proposal that they should take theodore away into the town mr wintersloan displayed extraordinary cunning and resource in evading a têteàtête with mr pope that would have released mr magnet now mrs pope came to think of it mr wintersloan never had had the delights of a good talk with mr pope he knew practically nothing about the east purblow experiment except for what mr magnet might have retailed to him and she was very greatly puzzled to account for his almost manifest reluctance to go into things thoroughly daffy remained on hand available but useless and mrs pope smiling at the landscape and a prey to management within was suddenly inspired to take her eldest daughter into her confidence daffy she said with a guileful finger extended and pointing to the lower sky as though she was pointing out the less obvious and more atmospheric beauties of surrey get theodore away from mr magnet if you can he wants to talk to marjorie  daffy looked round shall i call him she said  no said mrs pope do itjustquietly  ill try said daffy and stared at her task and mrs pope feeling that this might or might not succeed but that anyhow she had done what she could strolled across to her husband and laid a connubial touch upon his shoulder all the young people she said are burning to climb the church tower i never can understand this activity after lunch  not me said mr pope eh magnet  im game said theodore come along mr magnet  i think said mr magnet looking at marjorie i shall go up i want to show marjorie the view  well stay here mummy eh said mr pope with a quite unusual geniality and suddenly put his arm round mrs popes waist her motherly eye sought daffys and indicated her mission ill come with you theodore said daffy there isnt room for everyone at once up that tower  ill go with mr magnet said theodore relying firmly on the privileges of the day  for a time they played for position with the intentions of mr magnet showing more and more starkly through the moves of the game at last theodore was lured down a side street by the sight of a huge dummy fish dangling outside a tackle and bait shop and mr magnet and marjorie already with a dreadful feeling of complicity made a movement so rapid it seemed to her almost a bolt for the church tower whatever mr magnet desired to say and whatever elasticity his mind had once possessed with regard to it there can be no doubt that it had now become so rigid as to be sayable only in that one precise position and in the exact order he had determined upon but when at last they got to that high serenity mr magnet was far too hot and far too much out of breath to say anything at all for a time except an almost explosive gust or so of approbation of the scenery shor breath he said winey stairs alwaysthat fect on mebuful scenysuwylike it always  marjorie found herself violently disposed to laugh indeed she had never before been so near the verge of hysterics  its a perfectly lovely view she said no wonder you wanted me to see it  naturally said mr magnet wanted you to see it  marjorie with a skill her mother might have envied wriggled into a halfsitting position in an embrasure and concentrated herself upon the broad wooded undulations that went about the horizon and mr magnet mopped his face with surreptitious gestures and took deep restoring breaths  ive always wanted to bring you here he said ever since i found it in the spring  it was very kind of you mr magnet said marjorie  you see he explained whenever i see anything fine or rich or splendid or beautiful now i seem to want it for you his voice quickened as though he were repeating something that had been long in his mind i wish i could give you all this country i wish i could put all that is beautiful in the world at your feet  he watched the effect of this upon her for a moment  marjorie he said did you really mean what you told me the other day that there was indeed no hope for me i have a sort of feeling i bothered you that day that perhaps you didnt mean all  he stopped short  i dont think i knew what i meant said marjorie and magnet gave a queer sound of relief at her words i dont think i know what i mean now i dont think i can say i love you mr magnet i would if i could i like you very much indeed i think you are awfully kind youre more kind and generous than anyone i have ever known  saying he was kind and generous made her through some obscure association of ideas feel that he must have understanding she had an impulse to put her whole case before him frankly i wonder she said if you can understand what it is to be a girl  then she saw the absurdity of her idea of any such miracle of sympathy he was entirely concentrated upon the appeal he had come prepared to make  marjorie he said i dont ask you to love me yet all i ask is that you shouldnt decide not to love me  marjorie became aware of theodore hotly followed by daffy in the churchyard below i know hes up there theodore was manifestly saying  marjorie faced her lover gravely  mr magnet she said i will certainly promise you that  i would rather be your servant rather live for your happiness than do anything else in all the world said mr magnet if you would trust your life to me if you would deign he paused to recover his thread if you would deign to let me make life what it should be for you take every care from your shoulders face every responsibility  marjorie felt she had to hurry she could almost feel the feet of theodore coming up that tower  mr magnet she said you dont understand you dont realize what i am you dont know how unworthy i amwhat a mere ignorant child  let me be judge of that cried mr magnet  they paused almost like two actors who listen for the prompter it was only too obvious that both were aware of a little medley of imperfectly subdued noises below theodore had got to the ladder that made the last part of the ascent and there daffy had collared him my birthday said theodore come down you shant go up there said daffy you mustnt theodore why not there was something like a scuffle and whispers then it would seem theodore wentreluctantly and with protests but the conflict receded  marjorie said mr magnet as though there had been no pause if you would consent only to make an experiment if you would try to love me suppose you tried an engagement i do not care how long i waited  he paused will you try he urged upon her distressed silence  she felt as though she forced the word yes she said in a very low voice  then it seemed to her that mr magnet leapt upon her she felt herself pulled almost roughly from the embrasure and he had kissed her she struggled in his embrace mr magnet she said he lifted her face and kissed her lips marjorie he said and she had partly released herself  oh dont kiss me she cried dont kiss me yet  but a kiss  i dont like it  i beg your pardon he said i forgot but you you i couldnt help it  she was suddenly wildly sorry for what she had done she felt she was going to cry to behave absurdly  i want to go down she said  marjorie you have made me the happiest of men all my life all my strength i will spend in showing you that you have made no mistake in trusting me  yes she said yes and wondered what she could say or do it seemed to him that her shrinking pose was the most tenderly modest thing he had ever seen  oh my dear he said and restrained himself and took her passive hand and kissed it  i want to go down to them she insisted  he paused on the topmost rungs of the ladder looking unspeakable things at her then he turned to go down and for the second time in her life she saw that incipient thinness  i am sure you will never be sorry he said  they found mr and mrs pope in the churchyard mr pope was reading with amusement for the third time an epitaph that had caught his fancy      lands ever bright days ever fair     and yet we weep that he is there  he read you know thats really good that ought to be printed somewhere  mrs pope glanced sharply at her daughters white face and found an enigma then she looked at mr magnet  there was no mistake about mr magnet marjorie had accepted him whatever else she had felt or done   § 14  marjories feelings for the rest of the day are only to be accounted for on the supposition that she was overwrought she had a preposterous reaction she had done this thing with her eyes open after days of deliberation and now she felt as though she was caught in a trap the clearest thing in her mind was that mr magnet had taken hold of her and kissed her kissed her on the lips and that presently he would do it again and also she was asking herself with futile reiteration why she had got into debt at oxbridge why she had got into debt for such silly little things too  nothing definite was said in her hearing about the engagement but everybody seemed to understand mr pope was the most demonstrative he took occasion to rap her hard upon the back his face crinkled with a resolute kindliness ah he said sly maggots  he also administered several resounding blows to magnets shoulder blades and irradiated the party with a glow of benevolent waggery marjorie submitted without an answer to these paternal intimations mrs pope did no more than watch her daughter invisible but overwhelming forces were busy in bringing marjorie and her glowing lover alone together again it happened at last as he was departing she was almost to her inflamed imagination thrust out upon him had to take him to the gate and there in the shadows of the trees he kissed her good night with passionate effusion  madge he said madge  she made no answer she submitted passively to his embrace and then suddenly and dexterously disengaged herself from him ran in and without saying goodnight to anyone went to her room to bed  mr pope was greatly amused by this departure from the customary routine of life and noted it archly  when daffy came up marjorie was ostentatiously going to sleep  as she herself was dropping off daffy became aware of an odd sound somehow familiar and yet surprising and disconcerting  suddenly wide awake again she started up yes there was no mistake about it and yet it was very odd  madge whats up  no answer  i say you arent crying madge are you  then after a long interval madge  an answer came in a muffled voice almost as if marjorie had something in her mouth oh shut it old daffy  but madge said daffy after reflection  shut it do shut it leave me alone i say cant you leave me alone ohand for a moment she let her sobs have way with herdaffy dont worry me old daffy please  daffy sat up for a long time in the stifled silence that ensued and then like a sensible sister gave it up and composed herself again to slumber  outside watching the window in a state of nebulous ecstasy was mr magnet moonlit and dewy it was a high serene night with a growing moon and a scattered company of major stars and if no choir of nightingales sang there was at least a very active nightjar more than i hoped whispered mr magnet more than i dared to hope he was very sleepy but it seemed to him improper to go to bed on such a nighton such an occasion     chapter the third  the man who fell out of the sky   § 1  for the next week marjorie became more nearly introspective than she had ever been in her life before she began to doubt her hitherto unshaken conviction that she was a single consistent human being she found such discords and discrepancies between mood and mood between the conviction of this hour and the feeling of that that it seemed to her she was rather a collection of samples of emotion and attitude than anything so simple as an individual  for example there can be no denying there was one marjorie in the bundle who was immensely set up by the fact that she was engaged and going to be at no very remote date mistress of a london house she was profoundly plessingtonian and quite the vulgarest of the lot the new status she had attained and the possibly beautiful house and the probably successful dinnerparties and the arrangements and the importance of such a life was the substance of this creatures thought she designed some queenly dresses this was the marjorie most in evidence when it came to talking with her mother and daphne i am afraid she patronized daphne and ignored the fact that daphne who had begun with a resolute magnanimity was becoming annoyed and resentful  and she thought of things she might buy and the jolly feeling of putting them about and making fine effects with them one thing she told daphne she had clearly resolved upon the house should be always full and brimming over with beautiful flowers ive always wished mother would have more flowersand not keep them so long when she has them  another marjorie in the confusion of her mind was doing her sincerest narrow best to appreciate and feel grateful for and return the devotion of mr magnet this marjorie accepted and even elaborated his views laid stress on his voluntary subjection harped upon his goodness brought her to kiss him  i dont deserve all this love this side of marjorie told magnet but i mean to learn to love you  my dear one cried magnet and pressed her hand  a third marjorie among the many was an altogether acuter and less agreeable person she was a sprite of pure criticism and in spite of the utmost efforts to suppress her she declared night and day in the inner confidences of marjories soul that she did not believe in mr magnets old devotion at all she was antimagnet a persistent insurgent she was dreadfully unsettling it was surely this marjorie that wouldnt let the fact of his baldness alone and who discovered and insisted upon a curious unbeautiful flatness in his voice whenever he was doing his best to speak from the heart and as for this devotion what did it amount to a persistent unimaginative besetting of marjorie a growing air of ownership an expansive indulgent smiling disposition to thwart and control and he was always touching her whenever he came near her she would wince at the freedoms a large kind hand might take with her elbow or wrist at a possible sudden clumsy pat at some erring strand of hair  then there was an appraising satisfaction in his eye  on the third day of their engagement he began quite abruptly to call her magsy well end this scandal of a girl pope he said magsy magnet youll bemm no women mps for us magsy  she became acutely critical of his intellectual quality she listened with a new alertness to the conversations at the dinnertable the bouts of wit with her father she carried off utterances and witticism for maturer reflection she was amazed to find how little they could withstand the tests and acids of her mind so many things such wide and interesting fields he did not so much think about as cover with a large enveloping shallowness  he came strolling around the vicarage into the garden one morning about eleven though she had not expected him until lunchtime and she was sitting with her feet tucked up on the aged but still practicable gardenseat reading shaws common sense of municipal trading he came and leant over the back of the seat and she looked up said good morning isnt it perfectly lovely and indicated by a book still open that her interest in it remained alive  whats the book magsy he asked took it out of her slightly resisting hand closed it and read the title um he said isnt this a bit stiff for little womens brains  all the rebel marjories were up in arms at that  dreadful word municipal i dont like it he shook his head with a grimace of humorous distaste  i suppose women have as good brains as men said marjorie if it comes to that  better said magnet thats why they shouldnt trouble about horrid things like municipal and trading on a day like this  dont you think this sort of thing is interesting  oh he said and flourished the book come and besidesshaw  he makes a very good case  but hes such amountebank  does that matter he isnt a mountebank there  hes not sincere i doubt if you had a serious book on municipal trading magsy whether youd make head or tail of it its a stiff subject shaw just gets his chance for a smart thing or so id rather you read a good novel  he really had the air of taking her reading in hand  you think i ought not to read an intelligent book  i think we ought to leave those things to the people who understand  but we ought to understand  he smiled wisely theres a lot of things you have to understand he said nearer home than this  marjorie was ablaze now what a silly thing to say she cried with an undergraduates freedom really you are talking nonsense i read that book because it interests me if i didnt i should read something else do you mean to suggest that im reading like a child who holds a book upside down  she was so plainly angry that he was taken aback i dont mean to suggest he began and turned to greet the welcome presence the interrogative eye of mrs pope  here we are he said having a quarrel  marjorie said mrs pope  oh its serious said mr magnet and added with a gleam its about municipal trading  mrs pope knew the wicked little flicker in marjories eye better than mr magnet she had known it from the nursery and yet she had never quite mastered its meaning she had never yet realized it was marjorie she had always regarded it as something marjorie some other marjorie ought to keep under control so now she adopted a pacificatory tone  oh lovers quarrels she said floating over the occasion lovers quarrels you mustnt ask me to interfere  marjorie already a little ashamed of her heat thought for an instant she ought to stand that and then decided abruptly with a return to choler that she would not do so she stood up and held out her hand for her book  mr magnet she said to her mother with remarkable force and freedom as she took it has been talking unutterable nonsense i dont call that a lovers quarrelanyhow  then confronted with a double astonishment and having no more to say she picked up her skirt quite unnecessarily and walked with a heavenward chin indoors  im afraid explained mr magnet i was a little too free with one of magsys favourite authors  which is the favourite author now asked mrs pope after a reflective pause with a mothers indulgent smile  shaw he raised amused eyebrows its just the age i suppose  shes frightfully loyal while it lasts said mrs pope no one dare say a word against them  i think its adorable of her said mr magnetwith an answering loyalty and gusto   § 2  the aviation accident occurred while mrs pope her two eldest daughters and mr magnet were playing golfcroquet upon the vicarage lawn it was a serene hot afternoon a little too hot to take a game seriously and the four little figures moved slowly over the green and grouped and dispersed as the game required mr magnet was very fond of golfcroquet he displayed a whimsical humour and much invention at this game it was not too exacting physically and he could make his ball jump into the air in the absurdest manner occasionally he won a laugh from marjorie or daffy no one else was in sight the pseudotwins and theodore and toupee were in the barn and mr pope was six miles away at wamping lying prone nibbling grass blades and watching a county cricket match as every good englishman who knows what is expected of him loves to do click went ball and mallet and then after a long interval click it seemed incredible that anything could possibly happen before tea  but this is no longer the world it was suddenly this tranquil scene was slashed and rent by the sound and vision of a monoplane tearing across the heavens  a purring and popping arrested mr magnet in mid jest and the monster came sliding up the sky over the trees beside the church to the east already near enough to look big a great stiff shape big buff sails stayed with glittering wire and with two odd little wheels beneath its body it drove up the sky rising with a sort of upward heaving until the croquet players could see the driver and a passenger perched behind him quite clearly it passed a little to the right of the church tower and only a few yards above the level of the flagstaff there wasnt fifty feet of clearance altogether and as it did so marjorie could see both driver and passenger making hasty movements it became immense and overshadowing and every one stood rigid as it swept across the sun above the vicarage chimneys then it seemed to drop twenty feet or so abruptly and then both the men cried out as it drove straight for the line of poplars between the shrubbery and the meadow oh oh oh cried mrs pope and daffy evidently the aviator was trying to turn sharply the huge thing banked but not enough and came about and slipped away until its wing was slashing into the tree tops with a thrilling swish of leaves and the snapping of branches and stays  run cried magnet and danced about the lawn and the three ladies rushed sideways as the whole affair slouched down on them it came on its edge hesitated whether to turn over as a whole then crumpled and amidst a volley of smashing and snapping came to rest amidst ploughedup turf a clamorous stench of petrol and a cloud of dust and blue smoke within twenty yards of them the two men had jumped to clear the engine had fallen headlong and were now both covered by the fabric of the shattered wing  it was all too spectacular for word or speech until the thing lay still even then the croquet players stood passive for awhile waiting for something to happen it took some seconds to reconcile their minds to this sudden loss of initiative in a monster that had been so recently and threateningly full of go it seemed quite a long time before it came into marjories head that she ought perhaps to act in some way she saw a tall young man wriggling on all fours from underneath the wreckage of fabric he stared at her rather blankly she went forward with a vague idea of helping him he stood up swayed doubtfully on his legs turned and became energetic struggling mysteriously with the edge of the left wing he gasped and turned fierce blue eyes over his shoulder  help me to hold the confounded thing up he cried with a touch of irritation in his voice at her attitude  marjorie at once seized the edge of the plane and pushed the second man in a peculiar buttonshaped headdress was lying crumpled up underneath his ear and cheek were bright with blood and there was a streak of blood on the ground near his head  thats right can you hold it if i use only one hand  marjorie gasped yes with a terrific weight as it seemed suddenly on her wrists  right o and the tall young man had thrust himself backwards under the plane until it rested on his back and collared the prostrate man keep it up he said fiercely when marjorie threatened to give way he seemed to assume that she was there to obey orders and with much grunting and effort he had dragged his companion clear of the wreckage  the mans face was a mass of blood and he was sickeningly inert to his companions lugging  let it go said the tall young man and marjorie thanked heaven as the broken wing flapped down again  she came helpfully to his side and became aware of daffy and her mother a few paces off magnetit astonished herwas retreating hastily but he had to go away because the sight of blood upset himso much that it was always wiser for him to go away  is he hurt cried mrs pope  we both are said the tall young man and then as though these other people didnt matter and he and marjorie were old friends he said can we turn him over  i think so marjorie grasped the damaged mans shoulder and got him over skilfully  will you get some water said the tall young man to daffy and mrs pope in a way that sent daffy off at once for a pail  he wants water she said to the parlourmaid who was hurrying out of the house  the tall young man had gone down on his knees by his companion releasing his neck and making a hasty first examination of his condition the pneumatic cap must have saved his head he said throwing the thing aside lucky he had it he cant be badly hurt just rubbed his face along the ground silly thing to have come as we did  he felt the heart and tried the flexibility of an arm  thats all right he said  he became judicial and absorbed over the problems of his friends side um he remarked he knelt back and regarded marjorie for the first time thundering smash he said his face relaxed into an agreeable smile he only bought it last week  is he hurt  rib i thinkor two ribs perhaps stunned rather all thisjust his nose  he regarded marjorie and marjorie him for a brief space he became aware of mrs pope on his right hand then at a clank behind he turned round to see daphne advancing with a pail of water the two servants were now on the spot and the oddjob man and the old lady who did out the church and magnet hovered doubtfully in the distance suddenly with shouts and barks of sympathetic glee the pseudotwins theodore and toupee shot out of the house new thoughts were stirring in the young aviator he rose wincing a little as he did so im afraid im a little rude he said  i do hope your friend isnt hurt said mrs pope feeling the duty of a hostess  hes not hurt muchso far as i can see havent we made rather a mess of your lawn  oh not at all said mrs pope  we have if that is your gardener over there it would be nice if he kept back the people who seem to be hesitating beyond those trees there will be more presently im afraid i must throw myself on your hands he broke into a chuckle for a moment i have you know is it possible to get a doctor my friends not hurt so very much but still he wants expert handling hes sir rupert solomonson fromhe jerked his head backover beyond tunbridge wells my names trafford  im mrs pope and these are my daughters  trafford bowed we just took the thing out for a lark he said  marjorie had been regarding the prostrate man his mouth was a little open and he showed beautiful teeth apart from the dry blood upon him he was not an illlooking man he was manifestly a jew a squarerigged jew you have remarked of course that there are squarerigged jews whose noses are within bounds and foreandaft jews whose noses arent with not so much a bullethead as a roundshot cropped like the head of a capuchin monkey suddenly she was down and had his head on her knee with a quick movement that caught traffords eye hes better she said his eyelids flickered daffy bring the water  she had felt a queer little repugnance at first with this helpless man but now that professional nurse who lurks in the composition of so many women was uppermost give me your handkerchief she said to trafford and with daffy kneeling beside her and also interested and mrs pope a belated but more experienced and authoritative third sir rupert was soon getting the best of attention  wathall  said sir rupert suddenly and tried again wathall a third effort gave wathall about eh  if we could get him into the shade said marjorie  woosh cried sir rupert weeeooo  thats all right said trafford its only a rib or two  eeeeeyoooo said sir rupert  exactly were going to carry you out of the glare  dont touch me said sir rupert gooo  it took some little persuasion before sir rupert would consent to be moved and even then he was for a timeoh crusty but presently trafford and the two girls had got him into the shade of a large bush close to where in a circle of rugs and cushions the tea things lay prepared there they camped the helpful oddjob man was ordered to stave off intruders from the village water towels pillows were forthcoming mr magnet reappeared as tentative assistance and solomonson became articulate and brave and said hed nothing but a stitch in his side in his present position he wasnt at all uncomfortable only he didnt want any one near him he enforced that by an appealing smile the twins invited to fetch the doctor declined proffering theodore they had conceived juvenile passions for the tall young man and did not want to leave him he certainly had a very nice face so theodore after walking twice round the wreckage tore himself away and departed on roms bicycle enquiry centred on solomonson for a time his face hair and neck were wet but no longer bloody and he professed perfect comfort so long as he wasnt moved and no one came too near him he was very clear about that though perfectly polite and scrutinized their faces to see if they were equally clear satisfied upon this point he closed his eyes and spoke no more he looked then like a capuchin monkey lost in pride there came a pause every one was conscious of having risen to an emergency and behaved well under unusual circumstances the young mans eye rested on the adjacent teathings lacking nothing but the coronation of the teapot  why not he remarked have tea  if you think your friend began mrs pope  oh hes all right arent you solomonson theres nothing more now until the doctor  only want to be left alone said solomonson and closed his heavy eyelids again  mrs pope told the maids with an air of dismissal to get tea  we can keep an eye on him said trafford  marjorie surveyed her first patient with a pretty unconscious mixture of maternal gravity and girlish interest and the twins to avoid too openly gloating upon the good looks of trafford chose places and secured cushions round the teathings calculating to the best of their ability how they might secure the closest proximity to him mr magnet and toupee had gone to stare at the monoplane they were presently joined by the oddjob man in an interrogative mood pretty complete smash sir said the oddjob man and then perceiving heads over the hedge by the churchyard turned back to his duty of sentinel daffy thought of the need of more cups and plates and went in to get them and mrs pope remarked that she did hope sir rupert was not badly hurt  extraordinary all this is remarked mr trafford now here we were after lunch twenty miles awaysmoking cigars and with no more idea of having tea with you thani was going to sayflying but thats out of date now then we just thought wed try the thing like a dream  he addressed himself to marjorie i never feel that life is quite real until about three days after things have happened never two hours ago i had not the slightest intention of ever flying again  but havent you flown before asked mrs pope  not much i did a little at sheppey but its so hard for a poor man to get his hands on a machine and here was solomonson with this thing in his hangar eating its head off lets take it out i said and go once round the park and here we are i thought it wasnt wise for him to come  sir rupert without opening his eyes was understood to assent  do you know said trafford the sight of your tea makes me feel frightfully hungry  i dont think the engines damaged he said cheerfully do you as magnet joined them the ailerons are in splinters and the left wings not much better but thats about all except the wheels one falls so much lighter than you might supposefrom the smash lucky it didnt turn over then you know the engine comes on the top of you and youre done   § 3  the doctor arrived after tea with a bag and a stethoscope in a small coffinlike box and the popes and mr magnet withdrew while sir rupert was carefully sounded tested scrutinized questioned watched and examined in every way known to medical science the outcome of the conference was presently communicated to the popes by mr trafford and the doctor sir rupert was not very seriously injured but he was suffering from concussion and shock two of his ribs were broken and his wrist sprained unless perhaps one of the small bones was displaced he ought to be bandaged up and put to bed  couldnt we said mrs pope but the doctor assured her his own house was quite the best place there sir rupert could stay for some days at present the crosscountry journey over the downs or by the south eastern railway would be needlessly trying and painful he would with the popes permission lie quietly where he was for an hour or so and then the doctor would come with a couple of men and a carrying bed he had and take him off to his own house there he would be as mr trafford said as right as ninepence and mr trafford could put up either at the red lion with mr magnet or in the little cottage next door to the doctor mr trafford elected for the latter as closer to his friend as for the smashed aeroplane telegrams would be sent at once to sir ruperts engineers at chesilbury and they would have all that cleared away by midday tomorrow  the doctor departed sir rupert after stimulants closed his eyes and mr trafford seated himself at the teathings for some more cake as though introduction by aeroplane was the most regular thing in the world  he had very pleasant and easy manners an entire absence of selfconsciousness and a quick talkative disposition that made him very rapidly at home with everybody he described all the sensations of flight his early lessons and experiments and in the utmost detail the events of the afternoon that had led to this disastrous adventure he made his suggestion of trying the thing seem the most natural impulse in the world the bulk of the conversation fell on him mr magnet save for the intervention of one or two jests was quietly observant the rest were well disposed to listen and as mr trafford talked his eye rested ever and again on marjorie with the faintest touch of scrutiny and perplexity and she too found a curious little persuasion growing up in her mind that somewhere somehow she and he had met and had talked rather earnestly but how and where eluded her altogether  they had sat for an hourthe men from the doctors seemed never comingwhen mr pope returned unexpectedly from his cricket match which had ended a little prematurely in a rot on an overdry wicket he was full of particulars of the days play and how wiper had got a most amazing catch and held it though he fell how jenks had deliberately bowled at a mans head he believed and little gibbs thrown a man out from slip he was burning to tell all this in the utmost detail to magnet and his family so that they might at least share the retrospect of his pleasure he had thought out rather a good pun on wiper and he was naturally a little thwarted to find all this good rich talk crowded out by a more engrossing topic  at the sight of a stranger grouped in a popular manner beside the teathings he displayed a slight acerbity which was if anything increased by the discovery of a prostrate person with large brown eyes and an expression of oriental patience and disdain in the shade of a bush near by at first he seemed scarcely to grasp mrs popes explanations and regarded sir rupert with an expression that bordered on malevolence then when his attention was directed to the smashed machine upon the lawn he broke out into a loud indignant good god what next  he walked towards the wreckage disregarding mr trafford beside him a man cant go away from his house for an hour he complained  i can assure you we did all we could to prevent it said trafford  ought never to have had it to prevent said mr pope is your friend hurt  a riband shock said trafford  wellhe deserves it said mr pope rather than launch myself into the air in one of those infernal things id be stood against a wall and shot  tastes differ of course said trafford with unruffled urbanity  youll have all this cleared away said mr pope  mechanicsoh a complete breakdown partyare speeding to us in fast motors said trafford thanks to the kindness of your domestic in taking a telegram for me  hope they wont kill any one said mr pope and just for a moment the conversation hung fire and your friend he asked  he goes in the next ten minuteswell whenever the litter comes from the doctors poor old solomonson  solomonson  sir rupert  oh said mr pope is that the pigmentation solomonson  i believe he does do some beastly company of that sort said trafford isnt it amazing we didnt smash our engine  sir rupert solomonson was indeed a familiar name to mr pope he had organized the exploitation of a number of pigment and byeproduct patents and the ordinary and deferred shares of his syndicate has risen to so high a price as to fill mr pope with the utmost confidence in their future indeed he had bought considerably withdrawing capital to do so from an argentine railway whose stock had awakened his distaste and a sort of moral aversion by slumping heavily after a bad wheat and linseed harvest this discovery did much to mitigate his first asperity his next remark to trafford was almost neutral and he was even asking sir rupert whether he could do anything to make him comfortable when the doctor returned with a litter borne by four hastily compiled bearers   § 4  some brightness seemed to vanish when the buoyant mr trafford still undauntedly cheerful limped off after his more injured friend and disappeared through the gate marjorie found herself in a world whose remaining manhood declined to see anything but extreme annoyance in this gay exciting rupture of the afternoon good god said mr pope what next what next  registration i hope said mr magnetand relegation to the desert of sahara  one good thing about it said mr popeit all wastes petrol and when the petrol supply gives outtheyre done  certainly we might all have been killed said mrs pope feeling she had to bear her witness against their visitors and added if we hadnt moved out of the way that is  there was a simultaneous movement towards the shattered apparatus about which a small contingent of villagers who had availed themselves of the withdrawal of the sentinel had now assembled  look at it said mr pope with bitter hostility look at it  everyone had anticipated his command  theyll never come to anything said mr pope after a pause of silent hatred  but they have to come to something said marjorie  theyve come to smash said mr magnet with the true humorists air  but consider the impudence of this invasion the wildobjectionableness of it  theyre nasty things said mr magnet nasty things  a curious spirit of opposition stirred in marjorie it seemed to her that men who play golfcroquet and watch cricket matches have no business to contemn men who risk their lives in the air she sought for some controversial opening  isnt the engine rather wonderful she remarked  mr magnet regarded the engine with his head a little on one side its the usual sort he said  there werent engines like that twenty years ago  there werent people like you twenty years ago said mr magnet smiling wisely and kindly and turned his back on the thing  mr pope followed suit he was filled with the bitter thought that he would never now be able to tell the history of the remarkable match he had witnessed it was all spoilt for himspoilt for ever everything was disturbed and put out  theyve left us our tennis lawn he said with a not unnatural resentment passing to invitation what do you say magnet now youve begun the game you must keep it up  if marjorie or mrs pope or daffy said magnet  mrs pope declared the house required her and so with the gravest apprehensions and an insincere compliment to their fathers energy daffy and marjorie made up a foursome for that healthy and invigorating game but that evening mr pope got his serve well into the bay of the sagging net almost at once and with marjorie in the background taking anything he left her he won quite easily and everything became pleasant again magnet gloated upon marjorie and served her like a missionary giving bibles to heathen children he seemed always looking at her instead of the ball and except for a slight disposition on the part of daffy to slash nothing could have been more delightful and at supper mr pope rather crushing his wifes attempt to recapitulate the more characteristic sayings and doings of sir rupert and his friend did after all succeed in giving every one a very good idea indeed of the more remarkable incidents of the cricket match at wamping and made the pun he had been accustomed to use upon the name of wiper in a new and improved form a general talk about cricket and the immense good of cricket followed mr pope said he would make cricketplaying compulsory for every english boy  everyone it seemed to marjorie was forgetting that dark shape athwart the lawn and all the immense implication of its presence with a deliberate and irrational skill and she noted that the usual move towards the garden at the end of the evening was not made   § 5  in the night time marjorie had a dream that she was flying about in the world on a monoplane with mr trafford as a passenger  then mr trafford disappeared and she was flying about alone with a curious uneasy feeling that in a minute or so she would be unable any longer to manage the machine  then her father and mr magnet appeared very far below walking about and disapproving of her mr magnet was shaking his head very very sagely and saying rather a stiff job for little marjorie and her father was saying she would be steadier when she married and then she wasnt clear how the engine refused to work until her bills were paid and she began to fall and fall and fall towards mr magnet she tried frantically to pay her bills she was falling down the fronts of skyscrapers and precipicesand mr magnet was waiting for her below with a quiet kindly smile that grew wider and wider and wider  she woke up palpitating   § 6  next morning a curious restlessness came upon marjorie conceivably it was due to the absence of magnet who had gone to london to deliver his long promised address on the characteristics of english humour to the literati club conceivably she missed his attentions but it crystallized out in the early afternoon into the oddest form a powerful craving to go to the little town of pensting five miles off on the other side of buryhamstreet to buy silk shoelaces  she decided to go in the donkey cart she communicated her intention to her mother but she did not communicate an equally definite intention to be reminded suddenly of sir rupert solomonson as she was passing the surgery and make an inquiry on the spur of the momentit wouldnt surely be anything but a kindly and justifiable impulse to do that she might see mr trafford perhaps but there was no particular harm in that  it is also to be remarked that finding theodore a little disposed to encumber her vehicle with his presence she expressed her delight at being released from the need of going and abandoned the whole expedition to himknowing as she did perfectly well that if theodore hated anything more than navigating the donkey cart alone it was going unprotected into a shop to buy articles of feminine appareluntil he chucked the whole project and went fishingif one can call it fishing when there are no fish and the fisherman knows itin the decadent ornamental water  and it is also to be remarked that as marjorie approached the surgery she was seized with an absurd and powerful shyness so that not only did she not call at the surgery she did not even look at the surgery she gazed almost rigidly straight ahead telling herself however that she merely deferred that kindly impulse until she had bought her laces and so it happened that about half a mile beyond the end of buryhamstreet she came round a corner upon trafford and by a singular fatality he also was driving a donkey or rather was tracing a fanlike pattern on the road with a donkeys hoofs it was a very similar donkey to marjories but the vehicle was a governess cart and much smarter than marjories turnout his ingenuous face displayed great animation at the sight of her and as she drew alongside he hailed her with an almost unnatural ease of manner  hullo he cried im taking the air you seem to be able to drive donkeys forward how do you do it i cant never done anything so dangerous in my life before ive just been missed by two motor cars and hung for a terrible minute with my left wheel on the very verge of an unfathomable ditch i could hear the little ducklings far far below and bits of mould dropping i tried to count before the splash arent youwhite  but why are you doing it  one must do something im bandaged up and cant walk it hurt my leg more than i knewyour doctor says solomonson wont talk of anything but how he feels and i dont care a rap how he feels so i got this thing and came out with it  marjorie made her inquiries there came a little pause  some day no one will believe that men were ever so foolish as to trust themselves to draught animals he remarked hullo look out the horror of it  a large oil vana huge drum on wheelsmotordriven had come round the corner and after a preliminary and quite insufficient hoot bore down upon them and missing trafford as it seemed by a miracle swept past both drivers did wonderful things with whips and reins and found themselves alone in the road again with their wheels locked and an indefinite future  i leave the situation to you said trafford or shall we just sit and talk until the next motor car kills us  we ought to make an effort said marjorie cheerfully and descended to lead the two beasts  assisted by an elderly hedger who had been taking a disregarded interest in them for some time she separated the wheels and got the two donkeys abreast the old hedgers opinion of their safety on the kings highway was expressed by his action rather than his words he directed the beasts towards a shady lane that opened at right angles to the road he stood by their bridles while marjorie resumed her seat  it seems to me clearly a case for compromise said trafford you want to go that way i want to go that way let us both go this way it is by such arrangements that civilization becomes possible  he dismissed the hedger generously and resumed his reins  shall we race he asked  with your leg she inquired  no with the donkeys i say this is rather a lark at first i thought it was both dangerous and dull but things have changed i am in beastly high spirits i feel there will be a cry before night but still i ami wanted the companionship of an unbroken person its so jolly to meet you again  again  after the year before last  after the year before last  you didnt know said trafford i had met you before how aggressive i must have seemed well i wasnt quite clear i spent the greater part of last nightmy ankle being foolish in the small hoursin trying to remember how and where  i dont remember said marjorie  i remembered you very distinctly and some things i thought about you but not where it had happened then in the night i got it it is a puzzle isnt it you see i was wearing a black gown and i had been out of the sunlight for some monthsand my eye i remember it acutely was bandaged im usually bandaged somewhere      i was a king in babylon     and you were a christian slave  i mean a candidate  marjorie remembered suddenly youre professor trafford  not in this atmosphere but i am at the romeike college and as soon as i recalled examining you i remembered itminutely you were intelligent though unsoundabout cryohydrates it was ah you remember me now as most young women are correct by rote and unintelligent in such questions and as it doesnt matter a rap about anything of that sort whether you are correct or not as long as the mental gesture is right he paused for a moment as though tired of his sentence i remembered you  he proceeded in his easy and detached manner that seemed to make every topic possible to tell her his first impressions of her and show how very distinctly indeed he remembered her  you set me philosophizing id never examined a girls school before and i was suddenly struck by the spectacle of the fifty of you whats going to become of them all  i thought he went on how bright you were and how keen and eager you wereyou i mean in particularand just how certain it was your brightness and eagerness would be swallowed up by some silly ordinariness or otherstuffy marriage or stuffy domestic duties the old old storydone over again with a sort of threadbare badness nothing to say against it if its done well i got quite sentimental and pathetic about lifes breach of faith with women odd isnt it how ones mind runs on but thats what i thought its all come back to me  marjories bright clear eye came round to him i dont see very much wrong with the lot of women she reflected things are different nowadays anyhow  she paused  you dont want to be a man  no  she was emphatic  some of us cut more sharply at life than you think he said plumbing her unspoken sense  she had never met a man before who understood just how a girl can feel the slow obtuseness of his sex it was almost as if he had found her out at something  oh she said perhaps you do and looked at him with an increased interest  im halffeminine i believe he said for instance ive got just a womans joy in textures and little significant shapes i know how you feel about that i can spend hours even now in crystal gazingi dont mean to see some silly revelation of some silly persons proceedings somewhere but just for the things themselves i wonder if you have ever been in the natural history museum at south kensington and looked at ruskins crystal collection i saw it when i was a boy and it becamei cant help the wordan obsession the inclusions like moss and like trees and all sorts of fantastic things and the cleavages and enclosures with little bubbles and the lights and shimmerwhat were we talking about oh about the keen way your feminine perceptions cut into things and yet somehow i was throwing contempt on the feminine intelligence i dont do justice to the order of my thoughts never mind weve lost the thread but i wish you knew my mother  he went on while marjorie was still considering the proper response to this  you see im her only son and she brought me up and we know each otheroh very well she helps with my work she understands nearly all of it she makes suggestions and to this day i dont know if shes the most original or the most parasitic of creatures and thats the way with all women and girls it seems to me youre as critical as light and as undiscriminating i say do i strike you as talking nonsense  not a bit said marjorie but you do go rather fast  i know he admitted but somehow you excite me ive been with solomonson a week and hes dull at all times it was that made me take out that monoplane of his but it did him no good  he paused  they told me after the exam said marjorie you knew more about crystallographythan anyone  does that strike you as a dull subject  no said marjorie in a tone that invited justifications  it isnt i thinknaturally that the world one goes into when one studies molecular physics is quite the most beautiful of wonderlands i can assure you i work sometimes like a man who is exploring a magic palace do you know anything of molecular physics  you examined me said marjorie  the sense one has of exquisite and wonderful rhythmsjust beyond sound and sight and theres a taunting suggestion of its being all there displayed and confessed if only one were quick enough to see it why for instance when you change the composition of a felspar almost imperceptibly do the angles change whats the correspondence between the altered angle and the substituted atom why does this bit of clear stuff swing the ray of light so much out of its path and that swing it more then what happens when crystals gutter down and go into solution the endless launching of innumerable little craft think what a clear solution must be if only one had ultramicroscopic eyes and could see into it see the extraordinary patternings the swimming circling constellations and then the path of a ray of polarized light beating through it it takes me like music do you know anything of the effects of polarized light the sight of a slice of olivinegabbro for instance between crossed nicols  ive seen some rock sections said marjorie i forget the names of the rocks  the colours  oh yes the colours  is there anything else so rich and beautiful in all the world and every different mineral and every variety of that mineral has a different palette of colours a different scheme of harmoniesand is telling you something  if only you understood  exactly all the ordinary stuff of lifeyou knowthe carts and motor cars and dusty roads andcinder sifting seems so blank to mewith that persuasion of swing and subtlety beneath it all as if the whole world was fire and crystal and aquiverwith some sort of cotton wrappers thrown over it  dust sheets said marjorie i know  or like a diamond painted over  with that sort of grey paint very full of bodythat lasts  yes he smiled at her i cant help apologetics most people think a professor of science is just  a professor of science  yes something all pedantries and phrases i want to clear my character as though it is foolish to follow a vortex ring into a vacuum and wise to whack at a dirty golf ball on a suburban railway bank oh their golf under high heaven you dont play golf do you by any chance  only the womans part said marjorie  and they despise us he said solomonson can hardly hide how he despises us nothing is more wonderful than the way these people go on despising us who do research who have this fever of curiosity who wont be content withwhat did you call those wrappers  dust sheets  yes dust sheets what a life swaddling bands dust sheets and a shroud you know research and discovery arent nearly so difficult as people thinkif only you have the courage to say a thing or try a thing now and then that it isnt usual to say or try and after all he went off at a tangent these confounded ordinary people arent justified in their contempt we keep on throwing them things over our shoulders electric bells telephones marconigrams look at the beautiful electric trains that come towering down the london streets at nightfall ships of light in full sail twenty years ago they were as impossible as immortality we conquer the seas for thesegolfers puts arms in their hands that will certainly blow them all to bits if ever the idiots go to war with them come sailing out of the air on them  he caught marjories eye and stopped  falling out of the air on them corrected marjorie very softly  that was only an accident said mr trafford  so they began a conversation in the lane where the trees met overhead that went on and went on like a devious path in a shady wood and touched upon all manner of things   § 7  in the end quite a number of people were aggrieved by this dialogue in the lane that led nowhither  sir rupert solomonson was the first to complain trafford had been away three mortal hours no one had come near him not a soul and there hadnt been even a passing car to cheer his ear  sir rupert admitted he had to be quiet but not so damned quiet  id have been glad said sir rupert if a hen had laid an egg and clucked a bit you might have thought there had been a resurrection or somethin and cleared off everybody lord it was deadly id have sung out myself if it hadnt been for these infernal ribs  mrs pope came upon the affair quite by accident  well marjorie she said as she poured tea for the family did you get your laces  never got there mummy said marjorie and paused fatally  didnt get there said mrs pope thats worse than theodore wouldnt the donkey go poor dear  there was nothing to colour about and yet marjorie felt the warm flow in neck and cheek and brow she threw extraordinary quantities of candour into her manner i had a romantic adventure she said rather quietly i was going to tell you  sensation  you see it was like this said marjorie i ran against mr trafford  she drank tea and pulled herself together for a lively description of the wheellocking and the subsequent conversation a bright ridiculous account which made the affair happen by implication on the high road and not in a byeway and was adorned with every facetious ornament that seemed likely to get a laugh from the children but she talked rather fast and she felt she forced the fun a little however it amused the children all right and theodore created a diversion by choking with his tea from first to last marjorie was extremely careful to avoid the affectionate scrutiny of her mothers eye and had this lasted the whole afternoon asked mrs pope oh theyd talked for halfanhour said marjorie or more and had driven back very slowly together he did all the talking you saw what he was yesterday and the donkeys seemed too happy together to tear them away  but what was it all about asked daffy curious  he asked after you daffy most affectionately said marjorie and added several times though trafford had as a matter of fact displayed a quite remarkable disregard of all her family  and she went on getting a plausible idea at last he explained all about aeroplanes and all that sort of thing has daddy gone to wamping for some more cricket  but none of this was lost on mrs pope   § 8  mr magnets return next day was heralded by nearly twothirds of a column in the times  the lecture on the characteristics of humour had evidently been quite a serious affair and a very imposing list of humorists and of prominent people associated with their industry had accepted the hospitality of the literati  marjorie ran her eyes over the chairmans flattering introduction then with a queer faint flavour of hostility she reached her destined husbands utterance she seemed to hear the flat full tones of his voice as she read and automatically the desiccated sentences of the reporter filled out again into those rich quietly deliberate unfoldings of sound that were already too familiar to her ear  mr magnet had begun with modest disavowals there was a story he saidso the report beganwhose hallowed antiquity ought to protect it from further exploitation but he was tempted to repeat it because it offered certain analogies to the present situation there were three characters in the story a bluebottle and two scotsmen laughter the bluebottle buzzed on the pane otherwise a profound silence reigned this was broken by one of the scotsmen trying to locate the bluebottle with zoölogical exactitude said this scotsman sandy i am thinking if yon fly is a birdie or a beastie the other replied man dont spoil good whiskey with religious conversation laughter he was tempted mr magnet resumed to ask himself and them why it was that they should spoil the aftereffects of a most excellent and admirably served dinner by an academic discussion on british humour at first he was pained by the thought that they proposed to temper their hospitality with a demand for a speech a closer inspection showed that he was to introduce a debate and that others were to speak and that was a new element in their hospitality further he was permitted to choose the subject so that he could bring their speeches within the range of his comprehension laughter his was an easy task he could make it easier the best thing to do would be to say nothing at all laughter  for a space the reporter seemed to have omitted largelyperhaps he was changing places with his reliefand the next sentence showed mr magnet engaged as it were in revising a hortus siccus of jokes there was the humour of facts and situations he was saying or that humour of expression for which there was no human responsibility as in the case of irish humour he spoke of the humour of the soil which found its noblest utterance in the bull humour depended largely on contrast there was a humour of form and expression which had many local varieties american humour had been characterized by exaggeration the suppression of some link in the chain of argument or narrative and a wealth of simile and metaphor which had been justly defined as the poetry of a pioneer race  marjories attention slipped its anchor and caught lower down upon in england there was a near kinship between laughter and tears their mental relations were as close as their physical abroad this did not appear to be the case it was different in france but perhaps on the whole it would be better to leave the humour of france and what some people still unhappily chose to regard as matters open to controversyhe referred to choice of subjectout of their discussion altogether hear hear and cheers  attention wandered again then she remarkedit reminded her in some mysterious way of a dropped hairpinit was noticeable that the pun to a great extent had become démodé  at this point the flight of marjories eyes down the column was arrested by her fathers hand gently but firmly taking possession of the times she yielded it without reluctance turned to the breakfast table and never resumed her study of the social relaxations of humorists  indeed she forgot it her mind was in a state of extreme perplexity she didnt know what to make of herself or anything or anybody her mind was full of trafford and all that he had said and done and all that he might have said and done and it was entirely characteristic that she could not think of magnet in any way at all except as a barlike shadow that lay across all her memories and all the bright possibilities of this engaging person  she thought particularly of the mobile animation of his face the keen flash of enthusiasm in his thoughts and expressions  it was perhaps more characteristic of her time than of her that she did not think she was dealing so much with a moral problem as an embarrassment and that she hadnt as yet felt the first stirrings of selfreproach for the series of disingenuous proceedings that had rendered the yesterdays encounter possible but she was restless wildly restless as a bird whose nest is taken she could abide nowhere she fretted through the morning avoided daffy in a marked manner and inflicted a stinging and only partially merited rebuke upon theodore for slouching humping andof all trite grievancesnot washing behind his ears as if any chap washed behind his ears she thought tennis with the pseudotwins might assuage her but she broke off after losing two sets and then she went into the garden to get fresh flowers and picked a large bunch and left them on the piano until her mother reminded her of them she tried a little shaw she struggled with an insane wish to walk through the wood behind the village and have an accidental meeting with someone who couldnt possibly appear but whom it would be quite adorable to meet anyhow she conquered that  she had a curious and rather morbid indisposition to go after lunch to the station and meet mr magnet as her mother wished her to do in order to bring him straight to the vicarage to early tea but here again reason prevailed and she went  mr magnet arrived by the 227 and to marjories eye his alighting presence had an effect of being not so much covered with laurels as distended by them his face seemed whiter and larger than ever he waved a great handful of newspapers  hullo magsy he said theyve given me a thumping press im nearer swelled head than ive ever been so mind how you touch me  well take it down at croquet said marjorie  theyve cleared that thing away  and made up the lawn like a billiard table she said  that makes for skill he said waggishly i shall save my head after all  for a moment he seemed to loom towards kissing her but she averted this danger by a businesslike concern for his bag he entrusted this to a porter and reverted to the triumph of overnight so soon as they were clear of the station he was overflowing with kindliness towards his fellow humorists who had appeared in force and very generously at the banquet and had said the most charming thingssome of which were in one report and some in another and some the reporters had missed altogethersome of the kindliest  its a pleasant feeling to think that a lot of good fellows think you are a good fellow said mr magnet  he became solicitous for her how had she got on while he was away she asked him how one was likely to get on at buryhamstreet monoplanes didnt fall every day and as she said that it occurred to her she was behaving meanly but he was going on to his next topic before she could qualify  ive got something in my pocket he remarked and playfully guess  she did but she wouldnt she had a curious sinking of the heart  i want you to see it before anyone else he said then if you dont like it it can go back its a sapphire  he was feeling nervously in his pockets and then the little box was in her hand  she hesitated to open it it made everything so dreadfully concrete and this time the sense of meanness was altogether acuter hed bought this in london hed brought it down hoping for her approval yes it washorrid but what was she to do  itsawfully pretty she said with the glittering symbol in her hand and indeed he had gone to one of those artistic women who are reviving and improving upon the rich old roman designs its so beautifully made  im so glad you like it you really do like it  i dont deserve it  oh but you do like it  enormously  ah i spent an hour in choosing it  she could see him she felt as though she had picked his pocket  only i dont deserve it mr magnet indeed i dont i feel i am taking it on false pretences  nonsense magsy nonsense slip it on your finger girl  but i dont she insisted  he took the box from her pocketed it and seized her hand she drew it away from him  no she said i feel like a cheat you know i dontim sure i dont love  ill love enough for two he said and got her hand again no he said at her gesture youll wear it why shouldnt you  and so marjorie came back along the vicarage avenue with his ring upon her hand and mr pope was evidently very glad to see him  the family was still seated at tea upon rugs and wraps and still discussing humorists at play when professor trafford appeared leaning on a large stick and limping but resolute by the church gate pish said mr pope marjorie tried not to reveal a certain dismay there was dumb rich approval in daphnes eyes and the pleasure of theodore and the pseudotwins was only too scandalously evident hooray said theodore with illconcealed relief  mrs pope was the incarnate invocation of tact as trafford drew near  i hope he said with obvious insincerity i dont invade you but solomonson is frightfully concerned and anxious about your lawn and whether his men cleared it up properly and put things right his eye went about the party and rested on marjorie how are you he said in a friendly voice  well we seem to have got our croquet lawn back said mr pope and our nerves are recovering how is sir rupert  a little fractious said trafford with the ghost of a smile  youll take some tea said mrs pope in the pause that followed  thank you said trafford and sat down instantly  i saw your jolly address in the standard he said to magnet i havent read anything so amusing for some time  rom dear said mrs pope will you take the pot in and get some fresh tea  mr trafford addressed himself to the flattery of magnet with considerable skill he had detected a lurking hostility in the eyes of the two gentlemen that counselled him to propitiate them if he meant to maintain his footing in the vicarage and now he talked to them almost exclusively and ignored the ladies modestly but politely in the way that seems natural and proper in a british middleclass house of the better sort but as he talked chiefly of the improvement of motor machinery that had recently been shown at the engineering exhibition he did not make that headway with marjories father that he had perhaps anticipated mr pope fumed quietly for a time and then suddenly spoke out  im no lover of machines he said abruptly slashing across mr traffords description all our troubles began with villainous saltpetre im an oldfashioned man with a noseand a neck and i dont want the one offended or the other broken no dont ask me to be interested in your valves and cylinders what do you say magnet it starts machinery in my head to hear about them  on such occasions as this when mr pope spoke out his horror of an anticlimax or any sort of contradiction was apt to bring the utterance to a culmination not always to be distinguished from a flight and now he rose to his feet as he delivered himself  whos for a game of tennis he said in this last uncontaminated patch of air i and marjorie will give you a match daffyif magnet isnt too tired to join you  daffy looked at marjorie for an instant  well want you theodore to look after the balls in the potatoes said mr pope lest that ingenuous mind should be corrupted behind his back  mrs pope found herself left to entertain a slightly disgruntled trafford rom and syd hovered on the off chance of notice at the corner of the croquet lawn nearest the tea things mrs pope had already determined to make certain little matters clearer than they appeared to be to this agreeable but superfluous person and she was greatly assisted by his opening upon the subject of her daughters jolly tennis looks he said  dont they said mrs pope i think it is such a graceful game for a girl  mr trafford glanced at mrs popes face but her expression was impenetrable  they both like it and play it so well she said their father is so skillful and interested in games marjorie tells me you were her examiner a year or so ago  yes she struck my memoryher work stood out  of course she is clever said mrs pope or we shouldnt have sent her to oxbridge there shes doing quite wellquite well everyone says so i dont know of course if mr magnet will let her finish there  mr magnet  shes just engaged to him of course shes frightfully excited about it and naturally he wants her to come away and marry theres very little excuse for a long engagement no  her voice died in a musical little note and she seemed to be scrutinizing the tennis with an absorbed interest theyve got new balls she said as if to herself  trafford had rolled over and she fancied she detected a change in his voice when it came isnt it rather a waste not to finish a university career he said  oh it wouldnt be wasted of course a girl like that will be hand and glove with her husband shell be able to help him with the scientific side of his jokes and all that i sometimes wish it had been daffy who had gone to college though i sometimes think weve sacrificed daffy a little shes not the bright quickness of marjorie but theres something quietly solid about her mindsomething stable perhaps i didnt want her to go away from me mr magnet is doing wonders at the net hes just begun to playto please marjorie dont you think hes a dreadfully amusing man mr trafford he says such quiet things   § 9  the effect of this éclaircissement upon mr trafford was not what it should have been properly he ought to have realized at once that marjorie was for ever beyond his aspirations and if he found it too difficult to regard her with equanimity then he ought to have shunned her presence but instead after his first shock of incredulous astonishment his spirit rose in a rebellion against arranged facts that was as unenglish as it was ungentlemanly he went back to solomonson with a mood of thoughtful depression giving place to a growing passion of indignation he presented it to himself in a generalized and altruistic form what the deuce is the good of all this talk of eugenics he asked himself aloud if they are going to hand over that shining girl to that beastly little area sneak  he called mr magnet a beastly little area sneak  nothing could show more clearly just how much he had contrived to fall in love with marjorie during his brief sojourn in buryhamstreet and the acuteness of his disappointment and nothing could be more eloquent of his forcible and undisciplined temperament and out of ten thousand possible abusive epithets with which his mind was no doubt stored this one i think had come into his head because of the alert watchfulness with which mr magnet followed a conversation as he waited his chance for some neat but brilliant flash of comment  trafford like marjorie was another of those undisciplined young people our age has produced in such significant quantity he was just sixandtwenty but the facts that he was big of build had as an only child associated much with grownup people and was already a conspicuous success in the world of microchemical research had given him the selfreliance and assurance of a much older man he had still to come his croppers and learn most of the important lessons in life and so far he wasnt aware of it he was naturally cleanminded very busy and interested in his work and on remarkably friendly and confidential terms with his mother who kept house for him and though he had had several small love disturbances this was the first occasion that anything of the kind had ploughed deep into his feelings and desires  traffords father had died early in life he had been a brilliant pathologist one of that splendid group of scientific investigators in the middle victorian period which shines ever more brightly as our criticism dims their associated splendours and he had died before he was thirty through a momentary slip of the scalpel his wifeshe had been his wife for five yearsfound his child and his memory and the quality of the life he had made about her too satisfying for the risks of a second marriage and she had brought up her son with a passionate belief in the high mission of research and the supreme duty of seeking out and expressing truth finely and here he was calling mr magnet a beastly little area sneak  the situation perplexed him marjorie perplexed him it was had he known it the beginning for him of a lifetime of problems and perplexities he was absolutely certain she didnt love magnet why then had she agreed to marry him such pressures and temptations as he could see about her seemed light to him in comparison with such an undertaking  were they greater than he supposed  his method of coming to the issue of that problem was entirely original he presented himself next afternoon with the air of an invited guest drove mr pope who was suffering from liver to expostulatory sulking in the study and expressed a passionate craving for golfcroquet in spite of mrs popes extreme solicitude for his still bandaged ankle he was partnered with daffy and for a long time he sought speech with marjorie in vain at last he was isolated in a corner of the lawn and with the thinnest pretence of inadvertence in spite of daffys despairing cry of she plays next he laid up within two yards of her he walked across to her as she addressed herself to her ball and speaking in an incredulous tone and with the air of a comment on the game he said i say are you engaged to that chap magnet  marjorie was amazed but remarkably not offended something in his tone set her trembling she forgot to play and stood with her mallet hanging in her hand  punish him came the voice of magnet from afar  yes she said faintly  his remark came low and clear it had a note of angry protest why  marjorie by the way of answer hit her ball so that it jumped and missed his ricochetted across the lawn and out of the ground on the further side  im sorry if ive annoyed you said trafford as marjorie went after her ball and daffy thanked heaven aloud for the respite  they came together no more for a time and trafford observant with every sense found no clue to the riddle of her grave intent bearing she played very badly and with unusual care and deliberation he felt he had made a mess of things altogether and suddenly found his leg was too painful to go on partner he asked will you play out my ball for me i cant go on i shall have to go  marjorie surveyed him while daffy and magnet expressed solicitude he turned to go mallet in hand and found marjorie following him  is that the heavier mallet she asked and stood before him looking into his eyes and weighing a mallet in either hand  mr trafford youre one of the worst examiners ive ever met she said  he looked puzzled  i dont know why said marjorie i wonder as much as you but i am and seeing the light dawning in his eyes she turned about and went back to the debacle of her game   § 10  after that mr trafford had one clear desire in his being which ruled all his other desires he wanted a long frank unembarrassed and uninterrupted conversation with marjorie he had a very strong impression that marjorie wanted exactly the same thing for a week he besieged the situation in vain after the fourth day solomonson was only kept in buryhamstreet by sheer willpower exerted with a brutality that threatened to end that friendship abruptly he went home on the sixth day in his largest car but trafford stayed on beyond the limits of decency to perform some incomprehensible service that he spoke of as clearing up  i want he said to clear up  but what is there to clear up my dear boy  solomonson youre a pampered plutocrat said trafford as though everything was explained  i dont see any sense in it at all said solomonson and regarded his friend aslant with thick black eyebrows raised  im going to stay said trafford  and solomonson said one of those unhappy and entirely disregarded things that ought never to be said  theres some girl in this said solomonson  your bedrooms always waiting for you at riplings he said when at last he was going off  traffords conviction that marjorie also wanted with an almost equal eagerness the same opportunity for speech and explanations that he desired sustained him in a series of unjustifiable intrusions upon the seclusion of the popes but although the manner of mr and mrs pope did change considerably for the better after his next visit it was extraordinary how impossible it seemed for him and marjorie to achieve their common end of an encounter  always something intervened  in the first place mrs popes disposition to optimism had got the better of her earlier discretions and a casual glance at daphnes face when their visitor reappeared started quite a new thread of interpretations in her mind she had taken the opportunity of hinting at this when mr pope asked over his shirtstud that night what the devil thatthat chauffeur chap meant by always calling in the afternoon  now that will magnet monopolizes marjorie she said after a little pause and a rustle or so i dont see why daffy shouldnt have a little company of her own age  mr pope turned round and stared at her i didnt think of that he said but anyhow i dont like the fellow  he seems to be rather clever said mrs pope though he certainly talks too much and after all it was sir ruperts aeroplane he was only driving it to oblige  hell think twice before he drives another said mr pope wrenching off his collar  once mrs pope had turned her imagination in this more and more agreeable direction she was rather disposed i am afraid to let it bolt with her and it was a deflection that certainly fell in very harmoniously with certain secret speculations of daphnes trafford too being quite unused to any sort of social furtiveness did perhaps in order to divert attention from his preoccupation with marjorie attend more markedly to daphne than he would otherwise have done and so presently he found daphne almost continuously on his hands so far as she was concerned he might have told her the entire history of his life and every secret he had in the world without let or hindrance mrs pope too showed a growing appreciation of his company became sympathetic and confidential in a way that invited confidence and threw a lot of light on her family history and daffys character she had found daffy a wonderful study she said mr pope too seemed partly reconciled to him the idea that after all both motor cars and monoplane were sir ruperts and not traffords had produced a reaction in the latter gentlemans favour moreover it had occurred to him that traffords accident had perhaps disposed him towards a more thoughtful view of mechanical traction and that this tendency would be greatly helped by a little genial chaff so that he ceased to go indoors when trafford was there and hung about meditating and delivering sly digs at this new victim of his ripe oldfashioned humour  nor did it help trafford in his quest for marjorie and a free outspoken delivery that the pseudotwins considered him a person of very considerable charm and that theodore though indisposed to suck up to him publiclyi write here in theodoresedid so desire intimate and solitary communion with him more particularly in view of the chances of an adventitious aeroplane ride that seemed to hang about himas to stalk him persistentlyhovering on the verge of groups playing a waiting game with a tennis ball and an old racquet strolling artlessly towards the gate of the avenue when the time seemed ripening for his appearance or departure  on the other hand marjorie was greatly entangled by magnet  magnet was naturally an attentive lover he was full of small encumbering services and it made him none the less assiduous to perceive that marjorie seemed to find no sort of pleasure in all the little things he did he seemed to think that if picking the very best rose he could find for her did not cause a very perceptible brightening in her then it was all the more necessary quietly to force her racquet from her hand and carry it for her or help her ineffectually to cross a footwide ditch or offer to read her in a rich abundant well modulated voice some choice passage from the forest lovers of mr maurice hewlett and behind these devotions there was a streak of jealousy he knew as if by instinct that it was not wise to leave these two handsome young people together he had a queer little disagreeable sensation whenever they spoke to one another or looked at one another whenever trafford and marjorie found themselves in a group there was magnet in the midst of them he knew the value of his marjorie and did not mean to lose her  being jointly baffled in this way was oddly stimulating to marjories and traffords mutual predisposition if you really want to throw people together the thing to dothank god for irelandis to keep them apart by the fourth day of this emotional incubation marjorie was thinking of trafford to the exclusion of all her reading and trafford was lying awake at nightsoh for half an hour and morethinking of bold decisive ways of getting at marjorie and bold decisive things to say to her when he did  but why she should be engaged to magnet continued nevertheless to puzzle him extremely it was a puzzle to which no complete solution was ever to be forthcoming   § 11  at last that opportunity came marjorie had come with her mother into the village and while mrs pope made some purchases at the general shop she walked on to speak to mrs blythe the washerwoman trafford suddenly emerged from the red lion with a soda syphon under each arm she came forward smiling  i say he said forthwith i want to talk with youbadly  and i she said unhesitatingly with you  how can we  theres always people about its absurd  well have to meet  yes  i have to go away tomorrow i ought to have gone two days ago where can we meet  she had it all prepared  listen she said there is a path runs from our shrubbery through a little wood to a stile on the main road he nodded either i will be there at three or about halfpast five ortheres one more chance while father and mr magnet are smoking at nine i might get away  couldnt i write  no impossible  ive no end of things to say  mrs pope appeared outside her shop and trafford gesticulated a greeting with the syphons all right he said to marjorie im shopping he cried as mrs pope approached   § 12  all through the day marjorie desired to go to trafford and could not do so it was some minutes past nine when at last with a swift rustle of skirts that sounded louder than all the world to her she crossed the dimly lit hall between diningroom and drawingroom and came into the dreamland of moonlight upon the lawn she had told her mother she was going upstairs at any moment she might be missed but she would have fled now to trafford if an army pursued her her heart seemed beating in her throat and every fibre of her being was aquiver she flitted past the diningroom window like a ghost she did not dare to glance aside at the smokers within and round the lawn to the shrubbery and so under a blackness of trees to the gate where he stood waiting and there he was dim and mysterious and wonderful holding the gate open for her and she was breathless and speechless and near sobbing she stood before him for a moment her face moonlit and laced with the shadows of little twigs and then his arms came out to her  my darling he said oh my darling  they had no doubt of one another or of anything in the world they clung together their lips came together fresh and untainted as those first lovers in the garden  i will die for you he said i will give all the world for you  they had thought all through the day of a hundred statements and explanations they would make when this moment came and never a word of it all was uttered all their anticipations of a highly strung eventful conversation vanished phrases of the most striking sort went like phantom leaves before a gale he held her and she clung to him between laughing and sobbing and both were swiftly and conclusively assured their lives must never separate again   § 13  marjorie never knew whether it was a moment or an age before her father came upon them he had decided to take a turn in the garden when magnet could no longer restrain himself from joining the ladies and he chanced to be stick in hand because that was his habit after twilight so it was he found them she heard his voice falling through love and moonlight like something that comes out of an immense distance  good god he cried what next  but he still hadnt realized the worst  daffy he said what in the name of goodness  marjorie put her hands before her face too late  good lord he cried with a rising inflection its madge  trafford found the situation difficult i should explain  but mr pope was giving himself up to a towering rage you damned scoundrel he said what the devil are you doing he seized marjorie by the arm and drew her towards him my poor misguided girl he said and suddenly she was tensely alive a little cry of horror in her throat for her father at a loss for words and full of heroic rage had suddenly swung his stick with passionate force and struck at traffords face she heard the thud saw trafford wince and stiffen for a perfectly horrible moment it seemed to her these men their faces queerly distorted by the shadows of the branches in the slanting moonlight might fight then she heard traffords voice sounding cool and hard and she knew that he would do nothing of the kind in that instant if there had remained anything to win in marjorie it was altogether won i asked your daughter to meet me here he said  be off with you sir cried mr pope dont tempt me further sir and swung his stick again but now the force had gone out of him trafford stood with a hand out ready for him and watched his face  i asked your daughter to meet me here and she came i am prepared to give you any explanation  if you come near this place again  for some moments marjories heart had been held still now it was beating violently she felt this scene must end mr trafford she said will you go go now nothing shall keep us apart  mr pope turned on her silence girl he said  i shall come to you tomorrow said trafford  yes said marjorie tomorrow  marjorie said mr pope will you go indoors  i have done nothing  be off sir  i have done nothing  will you be off sir and you marjoriewill you go indoors  he came round upon her and after one still moment of regard for traffordand she looked very beautiful in the moonlight with her hair a little disordered and her face alightshe turned to precede her father through the shrubbery  mr pope hesitated whether he should remain with trafford  a perfectly motionless man is very disconcerting  be off sir he said over his shoulder lowered through a threatening second and followed her  but trafford remained stiffly with a tingling temple down which a little thread of blood was running until their retreating footsteps had died down into that confused stirring of little sounds which makes the stillness of an english wood at night  then he roused himself with a profound sigh and put a hand to his cut and bruised cheek  well he said     chapter the fourth  crisis   § 1  crisis prevailed in buryhamstreet that night on half a dozen sleepless pillows souls communed with the darkness and two at least of those pillows were wet with tears  not one of those wakeful heads was perfectly clear about the origins and bearings of the trouble not even mr pope felt absolutely sure of himself it had come as things come to people nowadays because they will not think things out much less talk things out and are therefore in a hopeless tangle of values that tightens sooner or later to a knot  what an uncharted perplexity for example was the mind of that excellent woman mrs pope  poor lady she hadnt a stable thing in her head it is remarkable that some queer streak in her composition sympathized with marjories passion for trafford but she thought it such a pity she fought that sympathy down as if it were a wicked thing and she fought too against other ideas that rose out of the deeps and did not so much come into her mind as cluster at the threshold the idea that marjorie was in effect grown up a dozen queer criticisms of magnet and a dozen subtle doubts whether after all marjorie was going to be happy with him as she assured herself the girl would be so far as any one knew trafford might be an excellent match and behind these wouldbe invaders of her guarded mind prowled even worse ones doubts horrible disloyal doubts about the wisdom and kindness of mr pope  quite early in life mrs pope had realized that it is necessary to be very careful with ones thoughts they lead to trouble she had clipped the wings of her own mind therefore so successfully that all her conclusions had become evasions all her decisions compromises her profoundest working conviction was a belief that nothing in the world was of value but tact and that the art of living was to tide things over but here it seemed almost beyond her strength to achieve any sort of tiding over  why couldnt mr pope lie quiet  whatever she said or did had to be fitted to the exigencies of mr pope  availing himself of the privileges of matrimony her husband so soon as mr magnet had gone and they were upstairs together had explained the situation with vivid simplicity and had gone on at considerable length and with great vivacity to enlarge upon his daughters behaviour he ascribed this moral disasterhe presented it as a moral disaster of absolutely calamitous dimensionsentirely to mrs popes faults and negligences warming with his theme he had employed a number of homely expressions rarely heard by decent women except in these sacred intimacies to express the deep indignation of a strong man moved to unbridled speech by the wickedness of those near and dear to him still warming he raised his voice and at last shouted out his more forcible meanings until she feared the servants and children might hear waved a clenched fist at imaginary traffords and scoundrels generally and giving way completely to his outraged virtue smote and kicked blameless articles of furniture in a manner deeply impressive to the feminine intelligence  finally he sat down in the little armchair between her and the cupboard where she was accustomed to hang up her clothes stuck out his legs very stiffly across the room and despaired of his family in an obtrusive and impregnable silence for an enormous time  all of which awakened a deep sense of guilt and unworthiness in mrs popes mind and prevented her going to bed but did not help her in the slightest degree to grasp the difficulties of the situation  she would have lain awake anyhow but she was greatly helped in this by mr popes restlessness he was now turning over from left to right or from right to left at intervals of from four to seven minutes and such remarks as damned scoundrel get out of this or my daughter and degrade yourself in this way or never let me see your face again plight your troth to one man and fling yourself shamelesslyi repeat it marjorie shamelesslyinto the arms of another kept mrs pope closely in touch with the general trend of his thoughts  she tried to get together her plans and perceptions rather as though she swept up dead leaves on a gusty day she knew that the management of the whole situation rested finally on her and that whatever she did or did not do or whatever arose to thwart her arrangements its entire tale of responsibility would ultimately fall upon her shoulders she wondered what was to be done with marjorie with mr magnet need he know could that situation be saved everything at present was raw in her mind except for her husbands informal communications she did not even know what had appeared what daffy had seen what magnet thought of marjories failure to bid him goodnight for example had mr magnet noticed mr popes profound disturbance she had to be ready to put a face on things before morning and it seemed impossible she could do so in times of crisis as every woman knows it is always necessary to misrepresent everything to everybody but how she was to dovetail her misrepresentations get the best effect from them extract a working system of rights and wrongs from them she could not imagine  oh she did so wish mr pope would lie quiet  but he had no doubts of what became him he had to maintain a splendid and irrational rageat any costto anybody   § 2  a few yards away a wakeful marjorie confronted a joyless universe she had a baffling realization that her life was in a hopeless mess that she really had behaved disgracefully and that she couldnt for a moment understand how it had happened she had intended to make quite sure of traffordand then put things straight  only her father had spoilt everything  she regarded her father that night with a want of natural affection terrible to record why had he come just when he had just as he had why had he been so violent so impossible  of course she had no business to be there  she examined her character with a new unprecedented detachment wasnt she after all rather a mean human being it had never occurred to her before to ask such a question now she asked it with only too clear a sense of the answer she tried to trace how these multiplying threads of meanness had first come into the fabric of a life she had supposed herself to be weaving in extremely bright honourable and adventurous colours she ought of course never to have accepted magnet  she faced the disagreeable word was she a liar  at any rate she told lies  and shed behaved with extraordinary meanness to daphne she realized that now she had known as precisely as if she had been told how daphne felt about trafford and shed never given her an inkling of her own relations she hadnt for a moment thought of daphne no wonder daffy was sombre and bitter whatever she knew she knew enough she had heard traffords name in urgent whispers on the landing i suppose you couldnt leave him alone daffy had said after a long hostile silence that was all just a sentence without prelude or answer flung across the bedroom revealing a perfect understandingdeeps of angry disillusionment marjorie had stared and gasped and made no answer  would she ever see him again after this horror of rowdy intervention she didnt deserve to she didnt deserve anything oh the tangle of it all the tangle of it all and those bills at oxbridge she was just dragging trafford down into her own miserable morass of a life  her thoughts would take a new turn i love him she whispered soundlessly i would die for him i would like to lie under his feetand him not know it  her mind hung on that for a long time not know it until afterwards she corrected  she liked to be exact even in despair  and then in her memory he was struck again and stood stiff and still she wanted to kneel to him imagined herself kneeling  and so on quite inconclusively round and round through the interminable night hours   § 3  the young man in the village was if possible more perplexed roundeyed and generally inconclusive than anyone else in this series of nocturnal disturbances he spent long intervals sitting on his windowsill regarding a world that was scented with nightstock and seemed to be woven of moonshine and gossamer being an inexpert and infrequent soliloquist his only audible comment on his difficulties was the repetition in varying intonations of his fervent unalterable conviction that he was damned but behind this simple verbal mask was a great fury of mental activity  he had something of marjories amazement at the position of affairs  he had never properly realized that it was possible for any one to regard marjorie as a daughter to order her about and resent the research for her society as criminal it was a new light in his world some day he was to learn the meaning of fatherhood but in these night watches he regarded it as a hideous survival of mediæval darknesses  of course he said entirely ignoring the actual quality of their conversation she had to explain about the magnet affair cant oneconverse  he reflected through great intervals  i will see her why on earth shouldnt i see her  i suppose they cant lock her up  for a time he contemplated a writ of habeas corpus he saw reason to regret the gaps in his legal knowledge  can any one get a writ of habeas corpus for any oneit doesnt matter whommore especially if you are a young man of sixandtwenty anxious to exchange a few richly charged words with a girl of twenty who is engaged to someone else  the night had no answer  it was nearly dawn when he came to the entirely inadvisable conclusioni use his own wordsto go and have it out with the old ruffian he would sit down and ask him what he meant by it alland reason with him if he started flourishing that stick again it would have to be taken away  and having composed a peroration upon the institution of the family of a character which he fondly supposed to be extraordinarily tolerant reasonable and convincing but which was indeed calculated to madden mr pope to frenzy mr trafford went very peacefully to sleep   § 4  came dawn with a noise of birds and afterwards a little sleep and then day and heavy eyes opened again and the sound of frying and the smell of coffee recalled our actors to the stage mrs pope was past her worst despair always the morning brings courage and a clearer grasp of things and she could face the world with plans shaped subconsciously during those last healing moments of slumber  breakfast was difficult but not impossible mr pope loomed like a thundercloud but marjorie pleaded a headache very wisely and was taken a sympathetic cup of tea the pseudotwins scented trouble but theodore was heedless and overfull of an entertaining noise made by a moorhen as it dived in the ornamental water that morning you could make it practically sotto voce and it amused syd he seemed to think the times opaque to such small sounds and learnt better only to be dismissed underfed and ignominiously from the table to meditate upon the imperfections of his soul in the schoolroom there for a time he was silent and then presently became audible again playing with a ball and presumably marjories tennis racquet  directly she could disentangle herself from breakfast mrs pope with all her plans acute went up to the girls room she found her daughter dressing in a leisurely and meditative manner she shut the door almost confidentially marjorie she said i want you to tell me all about this  i thought i heard father telling you said marjorie  he was too indignant said mrs pope to explain clearly you see marjorieshe paused before her efforthe knows thingsabout this professor trafford  what things asked marjorie turning sharply  i dont know my dearand i cant imagine  she looked out of the window aware of marjories entirely distrustful scrutiny  i dont believe it said marjorie  dont believe what dear  whatever he says  i wish i didnt said mrs pope and turned oh madge she cried you cannot imagine how all this distresses me i cannoti cannot conceive how you came to be in such a position surely honour think of mr magnet how good and patient he has been you dont know that man you dont know all he is and all that it means to a girl he is good and honourable andpure he is kindness itself it seemed to me that you were to be so happyrich honoured  she was overcome by a rush of emotion she turned to the bed and sat down  there she said desolately its all ruined shattered gone  marjorie tried not to feel that her mother was right  if father hadnt interfered she said weakly  oh dont my dear speak so coldly of your father you dont know what he has to put up with you dont know his troubles and anxietiesall this wretched business she paused and her face became portentous marjorie do you know if these railways go on as they are going he may have to eat into his capital this year just think of that and the worry he has and this last shame and anxiety  her voice broke again marjorie listened with an expression that was almost sullen  but what is it she asked that father knows about mr trafford  i dont know dear i dont know but its something that mattersthat makes it all different  well may i speak to mr trafford before he leaves buryhamstreet  my dear never see him dearnever think of him again your father would not dreamsome day marjorie you will rejoiceyou will want to thank your father on your bended knees that he saved you from the clutches of this man  i wont believe anything about mr trafford she said slowly until i know  she left the sentence incomplete  she made her declaration abruptly i love mr trafford she said with a catch in her voice and i dont love mr magnet  mrs pope received this like one who is suddenly stabbed she sat still as if overwhelmed one hand pressed to her side and her eyes closed then she said as if she gasped involuntarily  its too dreadful marjorie she said i want to ask you to do something after all a mother has some claim will you wait just a little will you promise me to do nothingnothing i mean to commit youuntil your father has been able to make inquiries dont see him for a little while very soon youll be oneandtwenty and then perhaps things may be different if he cares for you and you for him a little separation wont matter until your father has inquired  mother said marjorie i cant  mrs pope drew in the air sharply between her teeth as if in agony  but mothermother i must let mr trafford know that im not to see him i cant suddenly cease if i could see him once  dont said mrs pope in a hollow voice  marjorie began weeping hed not understand she said if i might just speak to him  not alone marjorie  marjorie stood still wellbefore you  mrs pope conceded the point and then marjorie she said  id keep my word mother said marjorie and began to sob in a manner she felt to be absurdly childishuntiluntil i am oneandtwenty id promise that  mrs pope did a brief calculation marjorie she said its only your happiness i think of  i know said marjorie and added in a low voice and father  my dear you dont understand your father i believei do firmly believeif anything happened to any of you girlsanything badhe would kill himself and i know he means that you arent to go about so much as you used to do unless we have the most definite promises of course your fathers ideas arent always my ideas marjorie but its your dutyyou know how hasty he is andquick just as you know how good and generous and kind he isshe caught marjories eye and added a little lamelyat bottom  she thought i think i could get him to let you say just one word with mr trafford it would be very difficult but  she paused for a few seconds and seemed to be thinking deeply  marjorie she said mr magnet must never know anything of this  but mother  nothing  i cant go on with my engagement  mrs pope shook her head inscrutably  but how can i mother  you need not tell him why marjorie  but  just think how it would humiliate and distress him you cant marjorie you must find some excuseoh any excuse but not the truthnot the truth marjorie it would be too dreadful  marjorie thought look here mother i may see mr trafford again i may really speak to him  havent i promised  then ill do as you say said marjorie   § 5  mrs pope found her husband seated at the desk in the ultraprotestant study meditating gloomily  ive been talking to her she said shes in a state of terrible distress  she ought to be said mr pope  philip you dont understand marjorie  i dont  you think she was kissing that man  well she was  you can think that of her  mr pope turned his chair to her but i saw  mrs pope shook her head she wasnt she was struggling to get away from him she told me so herself ive been into it with her you dont understand philip a man like that has a sort of fascination for a girl he dazzles her its the way with girls but youre quite mistaken quite its a sort of hypnotism shell grow out of it of course she loves mr magnet she does indeed ive not a doubt of it but  youre sure she wasnt kissing him  positive  then why didnt you say so  a girls so complex you didnt give her a chance shes fearfully ashamed of herselffearfully but its just because she is ashamed that she wont admit it  ill make her admit it  you ought to have had all boys said mrs pope oh shell admit it some dayreadily enough but i believe a girl of her spirit would rather die than begin explaining you cant expect it of her really you cant  he grunted and shook his head slowly from side to side  she sat down in the armchair beside the desk  i want to know just exactly what we are to do about the girl philip i cant bear to think of herup there  how he asked up there  yes she answered with that skilful inconsecutiveness of hers and let a brief silence touch his imagination do you think that man means to come here again she asked  chuck him out if he does said mr pope grimly  she pressed her lips together firmly she seemed to be weighing things painfully i wouldnt she said at last  what do you mean asked mr pope  i do not want you to make an open quarrel with mr trafford  not quarrel  not an open one said mrs pope of course i know how nice it would be if you could use a horsewhip dear theres such a lot of thingsif we only just slash butit wont help get him to go away shes consented never to see him againpractically shes ready to tell him so herself part them against their willoh and the thing may go on for no end of time but treat it as it ought to be treatedshell be very tragic for a week or so and then shell forget him like a dream he is a dreama girls dream if only we leave it alone shell leave it alone   § 6  things were getting straight mrs pope felt she had now merely to add a few touches to the tranquillization of daphne and the misdirection of the twins curiosity these touches accomplished it seemed that everything was done after a brief reflection she dismissed the idea of putting things to theodore she ran over the possibilities of the servants eavesdropping and found them negligible yes everything was doneeverything and yet  the queer string in her nature between religiosity and superstition began to vibrate she hesitated then she slipped upstairs fastened the door fell on her knees beside the bed and put the whole thing as acceptably as possible to heaven in a silent simple but lucidly explanatory prayer  she came out of her chamber brighter and braver than she had been for eighteen long hours she could now she felt await the developments that threatened with the serenity of one who is prepared at every point she went almost happily to the kitchen only about fortyfive minutes behind her usual time to order the days meals and see with her own eyes that economies prevailed and it seemed to her on the whole consoling and at any rate a distraction when the cook informed her that after all she had meant to give notice on the day of aunt plessingtons visit   § 7  the unsuspecting magnet fatigued but happyfor three hours of solid humorous writing omitting every unpleasant suggestion and mingling in the most acceptable and saleable proportions smiles and tears had added its quota to the intellectual heritage of england made a simple light lunch cooked in homely villageinn fashion lit a well merited cigar and turned his steps towards the vicarage he was preceded at some distance along the avenuesque drive by the back of mr trafford which he made no attempt to overtake  mr trafford was admitted and disappeared and a minute afterwards magnet reached the door  mrs pope appeared radiantabout the weather a rather tiresome man had just called upon mr pope about business matters she said and he might be detained five or ten minutes marjorie and daffy were upstairsresting they had been disturbed by bats in the night  isnt it charmingly rural said mrs pope bats  she talked about bats and the fear she had of their getting in her hair and as she talked she led the way brightly but firmly as far as possible out of earshot of the windows of the ultra protestant study in which mr pope was now she did so hope temperately interviewing mr trafford   § 8  directly mr trafford had reached the front door it had opened for him and closed behind him at once he had found himself with mrs pope you wish to see my husband she had said and had led him to the study forthwith she had returned at once to intercept mr magnet  trafford found mr pope seated sternly at the centre of the writing desk regarding him with a threatening brow  well sir said mr pope breaking the silence you have come to offer some explanation  while awaiting this encounter mr pope had not been insensitive to the tactical and scenic possibilities of the occasion in fact he had spent the latter half of the morning in intermittent preparations arranging desks books hassocks in advantageous positions and not even neglecting such small details as the stamp tray the articles of interest from jerusalem and the rockcrystal cenotaph which he had exhibited in such a manner as was most calculated to damp chill and subjugate an antagonist in the exposed area towards the window he had also arranged the chairs in a highly favourable pattern  mr trafford was greatly taken aback by mr popes juridical manner and by this form of address and he was further put out by mr pope saying with a regal gesture to the best illuminated and most isolated chair be seated sir  mr traffords exordium vanished from his mind he was at a loss for words until spurred to speech by mr popes almost truculent well  i am in love sir with your daughter  i am not aware of it said mr pope and lifted and dropped the paperweight my daughter sir is engaged to marry mr magnet if you had approached me in a proper fashion before presuming to attemptto attempt his voice thickened with indignationliberties with her you would have been duly informed of her positionand everyone would have been savedhe lifted the paperweight everything that has happened bump  mr trafford had to adjust himself to the unexpected elements in this encounter oh he said  yes said mr pope and there was a distinct interval  is your daughter in love with mr magnet asked mr trafford in an almost colloquial tone  mr pope smiled gravely i presume so sir  she never gave me that impression anyhow said the young man  it was neither her duty to give nor yours to receive that impression said mr pope  again mr trafford was at a loss  have you come here sir merely to bandy words asked mr pope drumming with ten fingers on the table  mr trafford thrust his hands into his pockets and assumed a fictitious pose of ease he had never found any one in his life before quite so provocative of colloquialism as mr pope  look here sir this is all very well he began but why cant i fall in love with your daughter im a doctor of science and all that sort of thing ive a perfectly decent outlook my father was rather a swell in his science im an entirely decent and respectable person  i beg to differ said mr pope  but i am  again said mr pope with great patience and a slight forward bowing of the head i beg to differ  welldiffer but all the same  he paused and began again and for a time they argued to no purpose they generalized about the position of an engaged girl and the rights and privileges of a father then mr pope to cut all this short told him frankly he wasnt wanted his daughter did not want him nobody wanted him he was an invader he had to be got rid ofif possible by peaceful means trafford disputed these propositions and asked to see marjorie mr pope had been leading up to this and at once closed with that request  she is as anxious as any one to end this intolerable siege he said he went to the door and called for marjorie who appeared with conspicuous promptitude she was in a dress of green linen that made her seem very cool as well as very dignified to trafford she was tense with restrained excitement and eitherfor these things shade into each otherentirely without a disposition to act her part or acting with consummate ability trafford rose at the sight of her and remained standing mr pope closed the door and walked back to the desk mr trafford has to be told he said that you dont want him in buryhamstreet he arrested marjories forward movement towards trafford by a gesture of the hand seated himself and resumed his drumming on the table well he said  i dont think you ought to stay in buryhamstreet mr trafford said marjorie  you dont want me to  it will only cause troubleand scenes  you want me to go  away from here  you really mean that  marjorie did not answer for a little time she seemed to be weighing the exact force of all she was going to say  mr trafford she answered everything ive ever said to youeverythingive meant more than ive ever meant anything everything  a little flush of colour came into traffords cheeks he regarded marjorie with a brightening eye  oh well he said i dont understand but im entirely in your hands of course  marjories pose and expression altered for an instant she was a miracle of instinctive expression she shone at him she conveyed herself to him she assured him her eyes met his she stood warmly flushed and quite unconqueredvisibly magnificently his she poured into him just that riotous pride and admiration that gives a man altogether to a woman then it seemed as if a light passed and she was just an everyday marjorie standing there  ill do anything you want me to said trafford  then i want you to go  ah said mr pope  yes said trafford with his eyes on her selfpossession  ive promised not to write or send to you orthink more than i can help of you until im twentyonenearly two months from now  and then  i dont know how can i  you hear sir from mr pope in the pause of mutual scrutiny that followed  one question said mr trafford  youve surely asked enough sir said mr pope  are you still engaged to magnet  sir  please father said marjorie with unusual daring and in her mothers voice mr trafford after what ive told youyou must leave that to me  she is engaged to mr magnet said mr pope tell him outright marjorie make it clear  i think i understand said trafford with his eyes on marjorie  ive not seen mr magnet since last night said marjorie and sonaturallyim still engaged to him  precisely said mr pope and turned with a face of harsh interrogation to his importunate caller mr trafford seemed disposed for further questions i dont think we need detain you madge said mr pope over his shoulder  the two young people stood facing one another for a moment and i am afraid that they were both extremely happy and satisfied with each other it was all right they were quite sureall right their lips were almost smiling then marjorie made an entirely dignified exit she closed the door very softly and mr pope turned to his visitor again with a bleak politeness i hope that satisfies you he said  there is nothing more to be said at present i admit said mr trafford  nothing said mr pope  both gentlemen bowed mr pope rose ceremoniously and mr trafford walked doorward he had a sense of latent absurdities in these tremendous attitudes they passed through the hallprocessionally but just at the end some lower strain in mr traffords nature touched the fine dignity of the occasion with an inappropriate remark  goodbye sir said mr pope holding the housedoor wide  goodbye sir said mr trafford and then added with a note of untimely intimacy in his voice with an inexcusable levity upon his lips you knowtheres nobodyno man in the worldid sooner have for a fatherinlaw than you  mr pope caught unprepared on the spur of the moment bowed in a cold and distant manner and then almost immediately closed the door to save himself from violence  from first to last neither gentleman had made the slightest allusion to a considerable bruise upon mr traffords left cheek and a large abrasion above his ear   § 9  that afternoon marjorie began her difficult task of getting disengaged from mr magnet it was difficult because she was pledged not to tell him of the one thing that made this line of action not only explicable but necessary magnet perplexed and disconcerted and secretly sustained by her mothers glancing sidelights on the feminine character and the instability of girlish whims remained at buryhamstreet until the family returned to hartstone square the engagement was endedformallybut in such a manner that magnet was left a rather pathetic and invincibly assiduous besieger he lavished little presents upon both sisters he devised little treats for the entire family he enriched theodore beyond the dreams of avarice and he discussed his love and admiration for marjorie and the perplexities and delicacies of the situation not only with mrs pope but with daphne at first he had thought very little of daphne but now he was beginning to experience the subtle pleasures of a confidential friendship she understood he felt it was quite wonderful how she understood he found daffy much richer in response than marjorie and far less disconcerting in reply  mr pope for all marjories submission to his wishes developed a grand dudgeon of exceptionally fine proportions when he heard of the breach of the engagement he ceased to speak to his daughter or admit himself aware of her existence and the grand dudgeons blighting shadow threw a chill over the life of every one in the house he made it clear that the grand dudgeon would only be lifted by marjories reengagement to magnet and that whatever blight or inconvenience fell on the others was due entirely to marjories wicked obstinacy using mrs pope as an intermediary he also conveyed to marjorie his decision to be no longer burthened with the charges of her education at oxbridge and he made it seem extremely doubtful whether he should remember her approaching twentyfirst birthday  marjorie received the news of her severance from oxbridge mrs pope thought with a certain hardness  i thought he would do that said marjorie hes always wanted to do that and said no more     chapter the fifth  a telephone call   § 1  trafford went back to solomonson for a day or so and then to london to resume the experimental work of the research he had in hand but he was so much in love with marjorie that for some days it was a very dazed mind that fumbled with the apparatusarranged it and rearranged it and fell into daydreams that gave the utmost concern to durgan the bottlewasher  hes not going straight at things said durgan the bottlewasher to his wife he usually goes so straight at things its a pleasure to watch it he told me he was going down into kent to think everything out mr durgan paused impressively and spoke with a sigh of perplexity he hasnt  but later durgan was able to report that trafford had pulled himself together the work was moving  i was worried for a bit said mr durgan but i think its all right again i believe its all right again   § 2  trafford was one of those rare scientific men who really ought to be engaged in scientific research  he could never leave an accepted formula alone his mind was like some insatiable corrosive that ate into all the hidden inequalities and plastered weaknesses of accepted theories and bit its way through every plausibility of appearance he was extraordinarily fertile in exasperating alternative hypotheses his invention of destructive test experiments was as happy as the respectful irony with which he brought them into contact with the generalizations they doomed he was already at sixandtwenty hated abused obstructed and respected he was still outside the royal society of course and the editors of the scientific periodicals admired his papers greatly and delayed publication but it was fairly certain that that pressure of foreign criticism and competition which prevents english scientific men of good family and social position from maintaining any such national standards as we are able to do in art literature and politics would finally carry him in and since he had a small professorship worth three hundred a year which gave him the command of a sufficient research laboratory and the services of mr durgan a private income of nearly three hundred more a devoted mother to keep house for him and an invincible faith in truth he had every prospect of winning in his particular struggle to inflict more truth new lucidities and fresh powers upon this fractious and unreasonable universe  in the world of science now even more than in the world of literature and political thought the thing that is alive struggles halfsuffocated amidst a copious production of things born dead the endowment of research the organization of scientific progress the creation of salaried posts and the assignment of honours has attracted to this field just that type of man which is least gifted to penetrate and discover and least able to admit its own defect or the quality of a superior such men are producing great bulky masses of imitative research futile inquiries and monstrous entanglements of technicality about their subjects and it is to their instinctive antagonism to the idea of a gift in such things that we owe the preposterous conception of a training for research the manufacture of mental blinkers that is to say to avoid what is the very soul of brilliant inquiryapplicable discursiveness the trained investigator is quite the absurdest figure in the farce of contemporary intellectual life he is like a bathchair perpetually starting to cross the himalayas by virtue of a licence to do so for such enterprises one must have wings organization and genius are antipathetic the vivid and creative mind by virtue of its qualities is a spasmodic and adventurous mind it resents blinkers and the mere implication that it can be driven in harness to the unexpected it demands freedom it resents regular attendance from ten to four and punctualities in general and all those paralyzing minor tests of conduct that are vitally important to the imagination of the authoritative dull consequently it is being eliminated from its legitimate field and it is only here and there among the younger men that such a figure as trafford gives any promise of a renewal of that enthusiasm that intellectual enterprise which were distinctive of the great age of scientific advance  trafford was the only son of his parents his father had been a young surgeon more attracted by knowledge than practice who had been killed by a scratch of the scalpel in an investigation upon ulcerative processes at the age of twentynine trafford at that time was three years old so that he had not the least memory of his father but his mother by a thousand almost unpremeditated touches had built up a figure for him and a tradition that was shaping his life she had loved her husband passionately and when he died her love burnt up like a flame released and made a god of the good she had known with him she was then a very beautiful and activeminded woman of thirty and she did her best to reconstruct her life but she could find nothing so living in the world as the clear courage the essential simplicity and tender memories of the man she had lost and she was the more devoted to him that he had had little weaknesses of temper and bearing and that an outrageous campaign had been waged against him that did not cease with his death he had in some medical periodical published drawings of a dead dog clamped to display a deformity and these had been seized upon by a group of antivivisection fanatics as the representation of a vivisection a libel action had been pending when he died but there is no protection of the dead from libel that monstrous lie met her on pamphlet cover on hoardings in sensational appeals it seemed immortal and she would have suffered the pains of a dozen suttees if she could have done so to show the world how the power and tenderness of this alleged tormentor of helpless beasts had gripped one womans heart it counted enormously in her decision to remain a widow and concentrate her life upon her son  she watched his growth with a care and passionate subtlety that even at sixandtwenty he was still far from suspecting she dreaded his becoming a mothers pet she sent him away to school and fretted through long terms alone that he might be made into a man she interested herself in literary work and social affairs lest she should press upon him unduly she listened for the crude expression of growing thought in him with an intensity that was almost anguish she was too intelligent to dream of forming his mind he browsed on every doctrine to find his own but she did desire most passionately she prayed she prayed in the darkness of sleepless nights that the views the breadths the spacious emotions which had ennobled her husband in her eyes should rise again in him  there were years of doubt and waiting he was a good boy and a bad boy now brilliant now touching now disappointing now gloriously reassuring and now heartrending as only the children of our blood can be he had errors and bad moments lapses into sheer naughtiness phases of indolence attacks of contagious vulgarity but more and more surely she saw him for his fathers son she traced the same great curiosities the same keen dauntless questioning whatever incidents might disturb and perplex her his intellectual growth went on strong and clear and increasing like some sacred flame that is carried in procession halting perhaps and swaying a little but keeping on over the heads of a tumultuous crowd  he went from his school to the royal college of science thence to successes at cambridge and thence to berlin he travelled a little in asia minor and persia had a journey to america and then came back to her and london sunburnt moustached manly and a little strange when he had been a boy she had thought his very soul pellucid it had clouded opaquely against her scrutiny as he passed into adolescence then through the period of visits and departures travel together separations he grew into something detached and admirable a man curiously reminiscent of his father unexpectedly different she ceased to feel what he was feeling in his mind had to watch him infer guess speculate about him she desired for him and dreaded for him with an undying tenderness but she no longer had any assurance that she could interfere to help him he had his fathers trick of falling into thought her brown eyes would watch him across the flowers and delicate glass and silver of her dinner table when he dined at home with her sometimes he seemed to forget she existed sometimes he delighted in her talked to amuse her petted her sometimes and then it was she was happiest he talked of plays and books with her discussed general questions spoke even of that broadly conceived scheme of work which engaged so much of his imagination she knew that it was distinguished and powerful work old friends of her husband spoke of it to her praised its inspired directness its beautiful simplicity since the days of wollaston they said no one had been so witty an experimenter no one had got more out of mere scraps of apparatus or contrived more ingenious simplifications  when he had accepted the minor professorship which gave him a footing in the world of responsible scientific men she had taken a house in a quiet street in chelsea which necessitated a daily walk to his laboratory it was a little old georgian house with worn and graceful rooms a dignified front door and a fine gateway of sussex ironwork much painted and eaten away she arranged it with great care she had kept most of her furniture and his study had his fathers bureau and the selfsame agate paperweight that had pressed the unfinished paper he left when he died she was a woman of persistent friendships and there came to her old connections of those early times trailing fresher and younger people in their wake sons daughters nephews disciples her son brought home all sorts of interesting men and it was remarkable to her that amidst the talk and discussion at her table she discovered aspects of her son and often quite intimate aspects she would never have seen with him alone  she would not let herself believe that this indian summer of her life could last for ever he was no passionless devotee of research for all his silence and restraints she had seen him kindle with anger at obstacles and absurdities and quicken in the presence of beauty she knew how readily and richly he responded to beauty things happened to have run smoothly with him so far that was all of course she said he must fall in love it cannot be long before he falls in love  once or twice that had seemed to happen and then it had come to nothing  she knew that sooner or later this completion of his possibilities must come that the present steadfastness of purpose was a phase in which forces gathered that love must sweep into his life as a deep and passionate disturbance she wondered where it would take him whether it would leave him enriched or devastated she saw at times how young he was she had as i suppose most older people have about their juniors the profoundest doubt whether he was wise enough yet to be trusted with a thing so good as himself he had flashes of highspirited indiscretion and at times a wildfire of humour flared in his talk so far that had done no worse for him than make an enemy or so in scientific circles but she had no idea of the limits of his excitability she would watch him and fear for himshe knew the wreckage love can makeand also she desired that he should lose nothing that life and his nature could give him   § 3  in the two months of separation that ensued before marjorie was oneandtwenty traffords mind went through some remarkable phases at first the excitement of his passion for marjorie obscured everything else then with his return to london and his laboratory the immense inertia of habit and slowly developed purposes the complex yet convergent system of ideas and problems to which so much of his life had been given began to reassert itself his love was vivid and intense a light in his imagination a fever in his blood but it was a new thing it had not crept into the flesh and bones of his being it was away there in surrey the streets of london his home the whitewalled chamber with its skylight and high windows and charts of constants in which his apparatus was arranged had no suggestion of her she was outsidean adventurea perplexing incommensurable with all these things  he had left buryhamstreet with marjorie riotously in possession of his mind he could think of nothing but marjorie in the train and how she had shone at him in the study and how her voice had sounded when she spoke and how she stood and moved and the shape and sensation of her hands and how it had felt to hold her for those brief moments in the wood and press lips and body to his and how her face had gleamed in the laced shadows of the moonlight soft and wonderful  in fact he thought of marjorie  he thought she was splendid courageous wise by instinct he had no doubt of her or that she was to be hiswhen the weeks of waiting had passed by she was his and he was marjories that had been settled from the beginning of the world it didnt occur to him that anything had happened to alter his life or any of his arrangements in any way except that they were altogether alteredas the world is altered without displacement when the sun pours up in the east he was glorifiedand everything was glorified  he wondered how they would meet again and dreamt a thousand impossible and stirring dreams but he dreamt them as dreams  at first to durgans infinite distress he thought of her all day and then as the old familiar interests grappled him again he thought of her in the morning and the evening and as he walked between his home and the laboratory and at all sorts of incidental timesand even when the closelocked riddles of his research held the foreground and focus of his thoughts he still seemed to be thinking of her as a radiant background to ions and molecules and atoms and interwoven systems of eddies and quivering oscillations deep down in the very heart of matter  and always he thought of her as something of the summer the rich decays of autumn came the chelsea roads were littered with variegated leaves that were presently wet and dirty and slippery the twilight crept down into the day towards five oclock and four but in his memory of her the leaves were green the evenings were long the warm quiet of rural surrey in high august filled the air so that it was with a kind of amazement he found her in london and in november close at hand he was called to the college telephone one day from a conversation with a proposed research student it was a middleaged woman bachelor anxious for the dsc who wished to occupy the further bench in the laboratory but she had no mental fire and his mind was busy with excuses and discouragements  he had no thought of marjorie when she answered and for an instant he did not recognize her voice  yes im mr trafford  who is it he reiterated with a note of irascibility who  the little voice laughed why im marjorie it said  then she was back in his life like a lantern suddenly become visible in a wood at midnight  it was like meeting her as a china figure neat and perfect and two inches high it was her voice very clear and very bright and quite characteristic as though he was hearing it through the wrong end of a telescope it was her voice clear as a bell confident without a shadow  its me marjorie im twentyone today  it was like a little arrow of exquisite light shot into the very heart of his life  he laughed back are you for meeting me then marjorie   § 4  they met in kensington gardens with an air of being clandestine and defiant it was one of those days of amber sunlight soft air and tender beauty with which london relieves the tragic glooms of the years decline there were still a residue of warmtinted leaves in puffs and clusters upon the tree branches a boat or two ruffled the blue serpentine and the waterfowl gave colour and animation to the selvage of the water the sedges were still a greenish yellow  the two met shyly they were both a little unfamiliar to each other trafford was blackcoated silkhatted umbrellad a decorous young professor in the place of the cheerful aeronaut who had fallen so gaily out of the sky marjorie had a new tailormade dress of russetgreen and a little cloth toque ruled and disciplined the hair he had known as a ruddy confusion they had dreamt i think of extended arms and a wild rush to embrace one another instead they shook hands  and so said trafford we meet again  i dont see why we shouldnt meet said marjorie  there was a slight pause  lets have two of those jolly little green chairs said trafford  they walked across the grass towards the chairs he had indicated and both were full of the momentous things they were finding it impossible to say  there ought to be squirrels here as there are in new york he said at last  they sat down there was a moments silence and then traffords spirit rose in rebellion and he plunged at thisthis stranger beside him  look here he said do you still love me marjorie  she looked up into his face with eyes in which surprise and scrutiny passed into something altogether beautiful i love youaltogether she said in a steady low voice  and suddenly she was no longer a stranger but the girl who had flitted to his arms breathless unhesitating through the dusk his blood quickened he made an awkward gesture as though he arrested an impulse to touch her my sweetheart he said my dear one  marjories face flashed responses its you he said  me she answered  do you remember  everything  my dear  i want to tell you things said marjorie what are we to do  he tried afterwards to retrace that conversation he was chiefly ashamed of his scientific preoccupations during that london interval he had thought of a thousand things marjorie had thought of nothing else but love and him her happy assurance her absolute confidence that his desires would march with hers reproached and confuted every adverse thought in him as though it was a treachery to love he had that sense which i suppose comes at times to every man of entire unworthiness for the straight unhesitating decision the clear simplicity of a womans passion he had dreamt vaguely unsubstantially the while he had arranged his pressures and temperatures and infinitesimal ingredients and worked with goniometer and trial models and the new calculating machine he had contrived for his research but she had thought clearly definitely fullyof nothing but coming to him she had thought out everything that bore upon that reasons for preciptance reasons for delay she had weighed the rewards of conformity against the glamour of romance it became more and more clear to him as they talked that she was determined to elope with him to go to italy and there have an extraordinarily picturesque and beautiful time her definiteness shamed his poverty of anticipation her enthusiasm carried him with her of course it was so that things must be done  when at last they parted under the multiplying lamps of the november twilight he turned his face eastward he was afraid of his mothers eyeshe scarcely knew why he walked along kensington gore and the clustering confused lights of street and house white and golden and orange and pale lilac the moving lamps and shining glitter of the traffic the luminous interiors of omnibuses the reflection of carriage and hoarding the fading daylight overhead the phantom trees to the left the deepening shadows and blacknesses among the houses on his right the bobbing heads of wayfarers were just for him the stir and hue and texture of fairyland all the world was fairyland he went to his club and dined there and divided the evening between geography as it is condensed in baedeker and murray on north italy italian switzerland and the italian riviera and a study of the marriage laws as they are expounded in whitakers almanac the encyclopædia britannica and other convenient works of reference he replaced the books as he used them and went at last from the library into the smokingroom but seeing a man who might talk to him there he went out at once into the streets and fetched a wide compass by baker street oxford street and hyde park home  he was a little astonished at himself and everything  but it was going to besplendid  what poor things words can be   § 5  he found his mother still up she had been rereading the old wives tale and she sat before a ruddy fire in the shadow beyond the lit circle of a greenshaded electric light thinking with the book put aside in the dimness above was his fathers portrait time you were in bed mother he said reprovingly and kissed her eyebrow and stood above her whats the book he asked and picked it up and put it down forgotten their eyes met she perceived he had something to say she did not know what where have you been she asked  he told her and they lapsed into silence she asked another question and he answered her and the indifferent conversation ended again the silence lengthened then he plunged i wonder mother if it would put you out very much if i brought home a wife to you  so it had come to thisand she had not seen it coming she looked into the glowing recesses of the fire before her and controlled her voice by an effort id be glad for you to do it dearif you loved her she said very quietly he stared down at her for a moment then he knelt down beside her and took her hand and kissed it my dear she whispered softly stroking his head and her tears came streaming for a time they said no more  presently he put coal on the fire and then sitting on the hearthrug at her feet and looking away from her into the flamesin an attitude that took her back to his boyhoodhe began to tell her brokenly and awkwardly of marjorie  its so hard mother to explain these things he began one doesnt half understand the things that are happening to one i want to make you in love with her dear just as i am and i dont see how i can  perhaps i shall understand my dear perhaps i shall understand better than you think  shes such a beautiful thingwith something about her you know those steel blades you can bend back to the hiltand theyre steel and shes tender its as if someone had taken tears mother and made a spirit out of them  she caressed and stroked his hand my dear she said i know  and a sort of dancing daring in her eyes  yes she said but tell me where she comes from and how you met herand all the circumstantial things that a sensible old woman can understand  he kissed her hand and sat down beside her with his shoulder against the arm of her chair his fingers interlaced about his knee she could not keep her touch from his hair and she tried to force back the thought in her mind that all these talks must end that very soon indeed they would end and she was glad full of pride and joy too that her son was a lover after her heart a clean and simple lover as his father had been before him he loved this unknown marjorie finely sweetly bravely even as she herself could have desired to have been loved she told herself she did not care very greatly even if this marjorie should prove unworthy so long as her son was not unworthy  he pieced his story together he gave her a picture of the popes marjorie in her family like a jewel in an ugly setting so it seemed to him and the queer dull rage of her father and all that they meant to do she tried to grasp his perplexities and advise but chiefly she was filled with the thought that he was in love if he wanted a girl he should have her and if he had to take her by force well wasnt it his right she set small store upon the popes that nightor any circumstances and since she herself had married on the slightest of security she was concerned very little that this great adventure was to be attempted on an income of a few hundreds a year it was outside her philosophy that a wife should be anything but glad to tramp the roads if need be with the man who loved her he sketched out valiant plans was for taking marjorie away in the teeth of all opposition and bringing her back to london it would have to be done decently of course but it would have he thought to be done mrs trafford found the prospect perfect never before had he sounded and looked so like that dim figure which hung still and sympathetic above them ever and again she glanced up at her husbands quiet face  on one point she was very clear with him  youll live with us mother he said abruptly  not with you as near as you like but one house one woman ill have a little flat of my ownfor you both to come to me  oh nonsense mother youll have to be with us living alone indeed  my dear id prefer a flat of my own you dont understandeverything it will be better for all of us like that  there came a little pause between them and then her hand was on his head again oh my dear she said i want you to be happy and life can be difficult i wont give a chancefor things to go wrong youre hers dear and youve got to be hersbe each others altogether ive watched so many people and thats the best the very best you can have theres just the loversthe real enduring lovers and the uncompleted people whove failed to find it   § 6  traffords second meeting with marjorie which by the by happened on the afternoon of the following day brought them near to conclusive decisions the stiffness of their first encounter in london had altogether vanished she was at her prettiest and in the highest spiritsand she didnt care for anything else in the world a gauzy silk scarf which she had bought and not paid for that day floated atmospherically about her straight trim body her hair had caught the infection of insurrection and was waving rebelliously about her ears as he drew near her his grave discretion passed from him as clouds pass from a hillside she smiled radiantly he held out both his hands for both of hers and never did a maiden come so near and yet not get a public and shameless kissing  one could as soon describe music as tell their conversation it was a matter of tones and feelings but the idea of flight together of the bright awakening in unfamiliar sunshine with none to come between them had gripped them both a certain sober gravity of discussion only masked that deeper inebriety it would be easy for them to get away he had no lectures until february he could he said make arrangements leave his research she dreaded disputation she was for a simple disappearance notes on pincushions and defiantly apologetic letters from boulogne but his mothers atmosphere had been a gentler one than her homes with a more powerful disposition to dignity he still couldnt understand that the cantankerous egotism of pope was indeed the essential man it seemed to him a crust of bad manners that reason ought to pierce  the difference in their atmospheres came out in their talkin his desire for a handsome and dignified weddingthough the very heavens protestedand her resolve to cut clear of every one to achieve a sort of gaol delivery of her life make a new beginning altogether with the minimum of friction and the maximum of surprise unused to fighting he was magnificently prepared to fight she with her intimate knowledge of chronic domestic conflict was for the evasion of all the bickerings scoldings and misrepresentations his challenge would occasion he thought in his innocence a case could be stated and discussed but no family discussion she had ever heard had even touched the realities of the issue that occasioned it  i dont like this underhand preparation he said  nor i she echoed but what can one do  well oughtnt i to go to your father and give him a chance why shouldnt i itsthe dignified way  it wont be dignified for father said marjorie anyhow  but what right has he to object  he isnt going to discuss his rights with you he will object  but why  oh because hes started that way he hit you i havent forgotten it well if he goes back on that nowhed rather die than go back on it you see hes ashamed in his heart it would be like confessing himself wrong not to keep it up that youre the sort of man one hits he just hates you because he hit you i havent been his daughter for twentyone years for nothing  im thinking of us said trafford i dont see we oughtnt to go to him just because hes likely to beunreasonable  my dear do as you please hell forbid and shout and hit tables until things break suppose he locks me up  oh habeas corpus and my strong right arm hes much more likely to turn you outofdoors  not if he thinks the other will annoy you more ill have to bear a storm  not for long  hell bully mother till she cries over me but do as you please shell come and shell beg medo as you please perhaps im a coward id far rather i could slip away  trafford thought for a moment id far rather you could he answered in a voice that spoke of inflexible determinations  they turned to the things they meant to do italy she whispered italy her face was alight with her burning expectation of beauty of love of the new heaven and the new earth that lay before them the intensity of that desire blazing through her seemed to shame his dull discretions he had to cling to his resolution lest it should vanish in that contagious intoxication  you understand i shall come to your father he said as they drew near the gate where it seemed discreet for them to part  it will make it harder to get away she said with no apparent despondency it wont stop us oh do as you please  she seemed to dismiss the question and stood handinhand with him in a state of glowing gravity she wouldnt see him again for fourandtwenty hours then a thought came into her heada point of great practical moment  oh she said of course you wont tell father youve seen me  she met his eye really you mustnt she said you seehell make a row with mother for not having watched me better i dont know what he isnt likely to do it isnt myselfthis is a confidential communicationall this no one in this world knows i am meeting you if you must go to him go to him  for myself  she nodded with her open eyes on hiseyes that looked now very blue and very grave and her lips a little apart  she surprised him a little but even this sudden weakness seemed adorable  all right he said  you dont think that im shirking she asked a little too eagerly  you know your father best he answered ill tell you all he says and all the terror of him here tomorrow afternoon   § 7  in the stillness of the night trafford found himself thinking over marjorie it was a new form of mental exercise which was destined to play a large part in his existence for many subsequent years there had come a shadow on his confidence in her she was a glorious person she had a kind of fire behind her and in hershining through her like the lights in a fireopal buthe wished she had not made him promise to conceal their meeting and their close cooperation from her father why did she do that it would spoil his case with her father and it could forward things for them in no conceivable way and from that in some manner too subtle to trace he found his mind wandering to another problem which was destined to reappear with a slowly dwindling importance very often in this procedure of thinking over marjorie in the small hours it was the riddleit never came to him in the daytime but only in those intercalary and detachedly critical periods of thoughtwhy exactly had she engaged herself to magnet why had she he couldnt imagine himself in marjories position doing anything of the sort marjorie had ways of her own she was different well anyhow she was splendid and loving and full of courage he had got no further than this when at last he fell asleep   § 8  traffords little attempt to regularise his position was as creditable to him as it was inevitably futile he sought out 29 hartstone square in the morning on his way to his laboratory and he found it one of a great row of stucco houses each with a portico and a diningroom window on the ground floor and each with a railed area from which troglodytic servants peeped collectively the terrace might claim a certain ugly dignity of restraint there was none of your queen anne nonsense of art or beauty about it and the narrow height the subterranean kitchens of each constituent house told of a steep relentless staircase and the days before the pampering of the lower classes began the houses formed a square as if the british square so famous at waterloo for its dogged resistance to all the forces of the universe had immortalized itself in buildings and they stared upon a severely railed garden of hardy shrubs and gravel to which the tenants had the inestimable privilege of access they did not use it much that was their affair but at any rate they had keys and a nice sense of rights assured and at least it kept other people out  trafford turned out of a busy high road full of the mixed exhilarating traffic of our time and came along a quiet street into this place and it seemed to him he had come into a corner of defence and retreat into an atmosphere of obstinate and unteachable resistances but this illusion of conservativism in its last ditch was dispelled altogether in mr popes portico youth flashed out of these solemnities like a dart shot from a cave trafford was raising his hand to the solid brass knocker when abruptly it was snatched from his fingers the door was flung open and a small boy with a number of dirty books in a strap flew out and hit him with projectile violence  blow said the young gentleman recoiling and trafford recovering said hullo theodore  lord said theodore breathless its you what a lark your names never mentionedno how what did you do wish i could stop and see it im ten minutes late ave atque vale so long  he vanished with incredible velocity and mr trafford was alone in possession of the open doorway except for toupee who after a violent outbreak of hostility altered his mind and cringed to his feet in abject and affectionate propitiation a pseudotwin appeared said hello and vanished and then he had an instants vision of mr pope newspaper in hand appearing from the diningroom his expression of surprise changed to malevolence and he darted back into the room from which he had emerged trafford decided to take the advice of a small brass plate on his left hand and ring also  a housemaid came out of the bowels of the earth very promptly and ushered him up two flights of stairs into what was manifestly mr popes study  it was a narrow rather dark room lit by two crimsoncurtained windows and with a gas fire before which mr popes walking boots were warming for the day the apartment revealed to traffords cursory inspection many of the stigmata of an englishman of active intelligence and literary tastes there in the bookcase were the collected works of scott a good large illustrated shakespeare in numerous volumes and a complete set of bound punches from the beginning a pile of back numbers of the times stood on a cane stool in a corner and in a little bookcase handy for the occupier of the desk were whitaker wisden and an old peerage the desk bore traces of recent epistolary activity and was littered with the printed matter of aunt plessingtons movements two or three recent issues of the financial review of reviews were also visible about the room hung steel engravings apparently of defunct judges or at any rate of exceedingly grim individuals and over the mantel were trophies of athletic prowess a bat witnessing that mr pope had once captained the second eleven at harrogby  mr pope entered with a stern expression and a sentence prepared well sir he said with a note of ironical affability to what may i ascribe thisintrusion  mr trafford was about to reply when mr pope interrupted will you be seated he said and turned his desk chair about for himself and occupying it crossed his legs and pressed the finger tips of his two hands together well sir he said  trafford remained standing astraddle over the boots before the gas fire  look here sir he said i am in love with your daughter shes one and twenty and i want to see herand in fact he found it hard to express himself he could think only of a phrase that sounded ridiculous i wantin factto pay my addresses to her  well sir i dont want you to do so that is too mild i object stronglyvery strongly my daughter has been engaged to a very distinguished and able man and i hope very shortly to hear that that engagementpractically it is still going on i dont want you to intrude upon my daughter further  but look here sir theres a certain justicei mean a certain reasonableness  mr pope held out an arresting hand i dont wish it let that be enough  of course it isnt enough im in love with herand she with me im an entirely reputable and decent person  may i be allowed to judge what is or is not suitable companionship for my daughterand what may or may not be the present state of her affections  well thats rather the point we are discussing after all marjorie isnt a baby i want to do all thisthis affair openly and properly if i can but you know i mean to marry marjorieanyhow  there are two people to consult in that matter  ill take the risk of that  permit me to differ  a feeling of helplessness came over trafford the curious irritation mr pope always roused in him began to get the better of him his face flushed hotly oh really really this isthis is nonsense he cried i never heard anything so childish and pointless as your objection  be careful sir cried mr pope be careful  im going to marry marjorie  if she marries you sir she shall never darken my doors again  if you had a thing against me  havent i  what have you  there was a quite perceptible pause before pope fired his shot  does any decent man want the name of trafford associated with his daughter trafford look at the hoardings sir  a sudden blaze of anger lit trafford my god he cried and clenched his fists and seemed for a moment ready to fall upon the man before him then he controlled himself by a violent effort you believe in that libel on my dead father he said with white lips  has it ever been answered  a hundred times and anyhowconfound it i dont believeyou believe it youve raked it upas an excuse you want an excuse for your infernal domestic tyranny thats the truth of it you cant bear a creature in your household to have a will or preference of her own i tell you sir you are intolerableintolerable  he was shouting and pope was standing now and shouting too leave my house sir get out of my house sir you come here to insult me sir  a sudden horror of himself and pope seized the younger man he stiffened and became silent never in his life before had he been in a bawling quarrel he was amazed and ashamed  leave my house cried pope with an imperious gesture towards the door  trafford made an absurd effort to save the situation i am sorry sir i lost my temper i had no business to abuse you  youve said enough  i apologise for that ive done what i could to manage things decently  will you go sir threatened mr pope  im sorry i came said trafford  mr pope took his stand with folded arms and an expression of weary patience  i did what i could said trafford at the door  the staircase and passage were deserted the whole house seemed to have caught from mr pope that same quality of seeing him out  confound it said trafford in the street how on earth did all this happen  he turned eastward and then realized that work would be impossible that day he changed his direction for kensington gardens and in the flowerbordered walk near the albert memorial he sat down on a chair and lugged at his moustache and wondered he was extraordinarily perplexed as well as ashamed and enraged by this uproar how had it begun of course he had been stupidly abusive but the insult to his father had been unendurable did a man of popes sort quite honestly believe that stuff if he didnt he deserved kicking if he did of course he was entitled to have it cleared up but then he wouldnt listen was there any case for the man at all had he trafford really put the thing so that pope would listen he couldnt remember what was it he had said in reply to pope what was it exactly that pope had said  it was already vague it was a confused memory of headlong words and answers what wasnt vague what rang in his ears still was the hoarse discord of two shouting voices  could marjorie have heard   § 9  so marjorie carried her point she wasnt to be married tamely after the common fashion which trails home and all ones beginnings into the new life she was to be eloped with romantically and splendidly into a glorious new world she walked on shining clouds and if she felt some remorse it was a very tender and satisfactory remorse and with a clear conviction below it that in the end she would be forgiven  they made all their arrangements elaborately and carefully trafford got a license to marry her she was to have a new outfit from top to toe to go away with on that eventful day it accumulated in the shop and they marked the clothes mt she was watched she imagined but as her father did not know she had seen trafford nothing had been said to her and no attempt was made to prohibit her going out and coming in trafford entered into the conspiracy with a keen interest a certain amusement and a queer little feeling of distaste he hated to hide any act of his from any human being the very soul of scientific work you see is publication but marjorie seemed to justify all things and when his soul turned against furtiveness he reminded it that the alternative was bawling  one eventful afternoon he went to the college and marjorie slipped round by his arrangement to have tea with mrs trafford  he returned about seven in a state of nervous apprehension came upstairs two steps at a time and stopped breathless on the landing he gulped as he came in and his eyes were painfully eager shes been he asked  but marjorie had won mrs trafford  shes been she answered yes shes all right my dear  oh mother he said  shes a beautiful creature dearand such a child oh such a child and god bless you dear god bless you  i think all young people are children i want to take you both in my arms and save you im talking nonsense dear  he kissed her and she clung to him as if he were something too precious to release   § 10  the elopement was a little complicated by a surprise manoeuvre of mrs popes she was more alive to the quality of the situation poor lady than her daughter suspected she was watching dreading perhaps even furtively sympathizing and trying to arrangeoh trying dreadfully to arrange she had an instinctive understanding of the deep blue quiet in marjories eyes and the girls unusual tenderness with daffy and the children she peeped under the blind as marjorie went out noted the care in her dress watched her face as she returned never plumbed her with a question for fear of the answer she did not dare to breathe a hint of her suspicions to her husband but she felt things were adrift in swift smooth water and all her soul cried out for delay so presently there came a letter from cousin susan pendexter at plymouth the weather was beautiful marjorie must come at once pack up and come and snatch the last best glow of the dying autumn away there in the west marjories jerrybuilt excuses her manifest chagrin and reluctance confirmed her mothers worst suspicions  she submitted and went and mrs pope and syd saw her off  i do not like to tell how a week later marjorie explained herself and her dressingbag and a few small articles back to london from plymouth suffice it that she lied desperately and elaborately her mother had never achieved such miracles of misstatement and she added a vigour that was all her own it is easier to sympathize with her than exonerate her she was in a state of intense impatience andwhat is strangeextraordinarily afraid that something would separate her from her lover if she did not secure him she was in a fever of determination she could not eat or sleep or attend to anything whatever she was occupied altogether with the thought of assuring herself to trafford he towered in her waking vision over town and land and sea  he didnt hear the lies she told he only knew she was magnificently coming back to him he met her at paddington a whitefaced tired splendidly resolute girl and they went to the waiting registrars forthwith  she bore herself with the intentness and dignity of one who is taking the cardinal step in life they kissed as though it was a symbol and were keenly businesslike about cabs and luggage and trains at last they were alone in the train together they stared at one another  weve done it mrs trafford said trafford  she snapped like an overtaut string crumpled clung to him and without a word was weeping passionately in his arms  it surprised him that she could weep as she did and still more to see her as she walked by his side along the folkestone pier altogether recovered erect a little flushed and excited like a child she seemed to miss nothing oh smell the sea she said look at the lights listen to the swish of the water below she watched the luggage spinning on the wire rope of the giant crane and he watched her face and thought how beautiful she was he wondered why her eyes could sometimes be so blue and sometimes dark as night  the boat cleared the pier and turned about and headed for france they walked the upper deck together and stood side by side she very close to him  ive never crossed the sea before she said  old england she whispered its like leaving a nest a little row of lights and thats all the world ive ever known shrunken to that already  presently they went forward and peered into the night  look she said italy theres sunshine and all sorts of beautiful things ahead warm sunshine wonderful old ruins green lizards she paused and whispered almost noiselessly love  they pressed against each other  and yet isnt it strange all you can see is darkness and cloudsand big waves that hiss as they come near   § 11  italy gave all her best to welcome them it was a late year a golden autumn with skies of such blue as marjorie had never seen before they stayed at first in a pretty little italian hotel with a garden on the lake and later they walked over salvator to morcote and by boat to ponte tresa and thence they had the most wonderful and beautiful tramp in the world to luino over the hills by castelrotto to the left of them all day was a broad valley with lowlying villages swimming in a luminous mist to the right were purple mountains they passed through paved streets with houses the colour of flesh and ivory with balconies hung with corn and gourds with tall church campaniles rising high and great archways giving upon the blue lowlands they tramped along avenues of sweet chestnut and between stretches of exuberant vineyard in which men and women were gathering grapespurple grapes a hatful for a soldo that rasped the tongue everything was strange and wonderful to marjories eyes now it would be a wayside shrine and now a yoke of softgoing dewlapped oxen now a chapel hung about with ex votos and now some unfamiliar cultivationor a gipsyeyed childor a scorpion that scuttled in the dust the very names of the villages were like jewels to her varasca croglio ronca sesia monteggio they walked or sat by the wayside and talked or rested at the friendly table of some kindly albergo a woman as beautiful as ceres with a white neck all open made them an omelette and then fetched her baby from its cradle to nurse it while she talked to them as they made their meal and afterwards she filled their pockets with roasted chestnuts and sent them with melodious good wishes upon their way and always high over all against the translucent blue hung the white shape of monte rosa that warmed in colour as the evening came  marjories head was swimming with happiness and beauty and with every fresh delight she recurred again to the crowning marvel of this cleanlimbed man beside her who smiled and carried all her luggage in a huge rucksack that did not seem to exist for him and watched her and caressed herand was hers hers  at baveno there were letters they sat at a little table outside a café and read them suddenly mindful of england again incipient forgiveness showed through mrs popes reproaches and there was also a simple tender loveletter there is no other word for it from old mrs trafford to her son  from baveno they set off up monte mottaronewhence one may see the alps from visto to ortler spitztrusting to find the inn still open and if it was closed to get down to orta somehow before night or at the worst sleep upon the mountain side  monte mottarone just for a moment taste the sweet italian name upon your lips these were the days before the funicular from stresa when one trudged up a rude path through the chestnuts and walnuts  as they ascended the long windings through the woods they met an old poet and his wife coming down from sunset and sunrise there was a word or two about the inn and they went upon their way the old man turned ever and again to look at them  adorable young people he said adorable happy young people  did you notice dear how she held that dainty little chin of hers  pride is such a good thing my dear clear straight pride like theirsand they were both so proud  isnt it good dear to think that once you and i may have looked like that to some passerby i wish i could bless themsweet swift young things i wish dear it was possible for old men to bless young people without seeming to set up for saints         book the second     marjorie married     chapter the first  settling down   § 1  it was in a boat among reeds upon the lake of orta that trafford first became familiarized with the idea that marjorie was capable of debt  oh i ought to have told you she began apropos of nothing  her explanation was airy she had let the thing slip out of her mind for a time but there were various debts to oxbridge tradespeople how much well rather a lot of course the tradespeople were rather enticing when first one went uphow much anyhow  oh about fifty pounds said marjorie after her manner not more ive not kept all the bills and some havent come in you know how slow they are  these things will happen said trafford though as a matter of fact nothing of the sort had happened in his case however youll be able to pay as soon as you get home and get them all off your mind  i think fifty pounds will clear me said marjorie clinging to her longestablished total if youll let me have that  oh we dont do things like that said trafford im arranging that my current account will be a sort of joint account and your signature will be as good as minefor the purpose of drawing at least youll have your own chequebook  i dont understand quite said marjorie  youll have your own chequebook and write cheques as you want them that seems the simplest way to me  of course said marjorie but isnt thisrather unusual father always used to allowance mother  its the only decent way according to my ideas said trafford a man shouldnt marry when he cant trust  of course not said marjorie something between fear and compunction wrung her do you think youd better she asked very earnestly  better  do this  why not  itsits so generous  he didnt answer he took up an oar and began to push out from among the reeds with something of the shy awkwardness of a boy who becomes apprehensive of thanks he stole a glance at her presently and caught her expressionthere was something very solemn and intent in her eyesand he thought what a grave fine thing his marjorie could be  but indeed her state of mind was quite exceptionally confused she was disconcertedand horribly afraid of herself  do you mean that i can spend what i like asked marjorie  just as i may he said  i wonder said marjorie again if id better  she was tingling with delight at this freedom and she knew she was not fit for its responsibility she just came short of a passionate refusal of his proposal he was still so new to her and things were so wonderful or i think she would have made that refusal  youve got to said trafford and ended the matter  so marjorie was silentmaking good resolutions   § 2  perhaps some day it may be possible to tell in english again in the language of shakspeare and herrick of the passion the tenderness the beauty and the delightful familiarizations of a happy honeymoon suffice it now in this delicate period to record only how our two young lovers found one day that neither had a name for the other he said she could be nothing better than marjorie to him and she after a number of unsuccessful experiments settled down to the old schoolboy nickname made out of his initials r a g  dick she said is too birdlike and boylike andrew i cant abide goodwin gives one no chances for current use rag you must be mag and ragpoor innocents old rag  mag he said has its drawbacks the streetboy in london says shut your mag no i think i shall stick to marjorie  all honeymoons must end at last so back they came to london still very bright and happy and then marjorie whose eyes had changed from flashing stones to darkly shining pools of blue but whose soul had still perhaps to finds its depths set herself to the business of decorating and furnishing the little house mrs trafford had found for them within ten minutes of her own meanwhile they lived in lodgings  there can be no denying that marjorie began her furnishing with severely virtuous intentions she was very particular to ask trafford several times what he thought she might spend upon the enterprise he had already a bedroom and a study equipped and he threw out three hundred pounds as his conception of an acceptable figure very well said marjorie with a note of great precision now i shall know and straightway that sum took a place in her imagination that was at once definitive and protective just as her estimate of fifty pounds for her oxbridge debts had always been she assured herself she was going to do things and she assured herself she was doing things on three hundred pounds at times the astonishment of two or three school friends who joined her in her shopping stirred her to a momentary surprise at the way she was managing to keep things within that limit and following a financial method that had after all in spite of some momentary and already nearly forgotten distresses worked very well at oxbridge she refrained from any additions until all the accounts had come to hand  it was an immense excitement shopping to make a home there was in her composition a strain of constructive artistry with such concrete things a strain that had hitherto famished she was making a beautiful secure little home for trafford for herself for possibilitiesremote perhaps but already touching her imagination with the anticipation of warm new wonderful delights there should be simplicity indeed in this home but no bareness no harshness never an ugliness nor a discord she had always loved colour in the skies in the landscapes in the texture of stuffs and garments now out of the chaotic skein of countless shops she could choose and pick and mingle her threads in a glow of feminine selfexpression  on three hundred pounds that is to sayas a maximum  the house she had to deal with was like mrs traffords old and rather small it was partly to its lack of bedroom accommodation but much more to the invasion of the street by the back premises of messrs siddons  thrale the great chelsea outfitters that the lowness of the rent was due a lowness which brought it within the means of trafford marjorie knew very clearly that her father would say her husband had taken her to live in a noisy slum and that made her all the keener to ensure that every good point in the interior told to its utmost and that whatever was to be accessible to her family should glow with a refined but warm prosperity the room downstairs was shapely and by ripping off the papered canvas of the previous occupier some very dilapidated but admirably proportioned panelling was brought to light the diningroom and study door on the ground floor by a happy accident were of mahogany with really very beautiful brass furnishings and the diningroom window upon the minute but by no means offensive paved garden behind was curved and had a little shallow balcony of ironwork half covered by a devitalized but leafy grapevine moreover the previous occupier had equipped the place with electric light and a bathroom of almost american splendour on the landing glassshelved whitetiled and white painted so that it was a delight to go into  marjories mind leapt very rapidly to the possibilities of this little establishment the panelling must be done and done well anyhow that would be no more than a wise economy seeing it might at any time help them to relet it would be painted white of course and thus set the key for a clean brightness of colour throughout the furniture would stand out against the softly shining white and its line and proportions must be therefore the primary qualities to consider as she bought it the study was much narrower than the diningroom and so the passage which the agent called the hall was much broader and more commodious behind the happily wide staircase than in front and she was able to banish out of the sight of the chance visitor all that litter of hatstand and umbrellastand letters boxes arriving and parcels to post which had always offended her eye at home at home there had been often the most unsightly things visible one of theos awful caps or his school books and not infrequently her fathers wellworn and all too fatally comfortable house slippers a good effect at first is half the victory of a well done house and marjorie accomplished another of her real economies here by carpeting hall and staircase with a finetoned richfeeling and rather highpriced blue carpet held down by very thick brass stairrods she hung up four wellchosen steel engravings put a single chippendale chair in the hall and a dark old dutch clock that had turned out to be only five pounds when she had expected the shopman to say eleven or twelve on the halflanding that was all round the corner by the study door was a mahogany slab and the litter all went upon a capacious but very simple darkstained hatstand and table that were out of the picture entirely until you reached the stairs  her diningroom was difficult for some time she had equipped that with a dark oak welsh dresser made very bright with a dessert service that was in view of its extremely decorative quality remarkably cheap and with some very pretty silvertopped glass bottles and flasks this dresser and a number of simple but shapely facsimiles of old chairs stood out against a nearly primrose paper very faintly patterned and a dark blue carpet with a margin of dead blackstained wood over the mantel was a german colourprint of waves full of sunlight breaking under cliffs and between this and the window were dark bookshelves and a few brightcoloured books on the wall blackframed were four very good japanese prints rich in greenishblues and blueishgreys that answered the floor and the window curtains took up some of the colours of the german print but something was needed towards the window she felt to balance the warmly shining plates upon the dresser the deep rosered of the cherries that adorned them was too isolated usurped too dominating a value and while this was weighing upon her mind she saw in a window in regent street a number of bokhara hangings very nobly displayed they were splendid pieces of needlework particularly glorious in their crimsons and reds and suddenly it came to her that it was just one of these one that had great ruby flowers upon it with deadblue interlacings that was needed to weld her gaycoloured scheme together she hesitated went halfway to piccadilly circus turned back and asked the prices the prices were towering prices ten fifteen eighteen guineas and when at last the shopman produced one with all the charm of colour she sought at eight it seemed like ten guineas snatched back as they dropped from her hands and still hesitating she had three that pleased her most sent home on approval before she decided finally to purchase one of them but the trial was conclusive and then struck with a sudden idea she carried off a long narrow one she had had no idea of buying before into the little study behind suppose she thought instead of hanging two curtains as anybody else would do in that window she ran this glory of rich colour across from one side on a great rod of brass  she was giving the study the very best of her attention after she had lapsed in some other part of the house from the standards of rigid economy she had set up she would as it were restore the balance by adding something to the gracefully dignified arrangement of this den he was to use and the brass rod of the bokhara hanging that was to do instead of curtains released her mind somehow to the purchase of certain old candlesticks she had hitherto resisted they were to stand bored to carry candle electric lights on either corner of the low bookcase that faced the window they were very heavy very shapely candlesticks and they cost thirtyfive shillings they looked remarkably well when they were put up except that a sort of hollowness appeared between them and clamoured for a delightful old brassfooted workbox she had seen in a shop in baker street enquiry confirmed her quick impression that this was a genuine piece of quite exceptional genuineness and that the pricethey asked five pounds ten and came down to five guineaswas in accordance with this it was a little difficult in spite of the silent hunger between the candlesticks to reconcile this particular article with her dominating idea of an austerely restrained expenditure until she hit upon the device of calling it a hors doeuvre and regarding it not as furniture but as a present from herself to trafford that happened to fall in very agreeably with the process of house furnishing she decided she would some day economise its cost out of her dress allowance the bookcase on which it stood was a happy discovery in kensington just five feet high and with beautiful oval glass fronts and its capacity was supplemented and any excess in its price at least morally compensated by a very tall narrow distinguishedlooking set of open shelves that had been made for some special corner in another house and which anyhow were really and truly dirt cheap the desk combined grace and good proportions to an admirable extent the fender of pierced brass looked as if it had always lived in immediate contact with the shapely old white marble fireplace and the two armchairs were marvels of dignified comfort by the fireplace were a bannershaped needlework firescreen a white sheepskin hearthrug a little patch and powder table adapted to carry books and a greenshaded lamp grouped in a common inaudible demand for a reader in slippers trafford when at last the apartment was ready for his inspection surveyed these arrangements with a kind of dazzled admiration  by jove he said how little people know of the homes of the poor  marjorie was so delighted with his approval that she determined to show mrs trafford next day how prettily at least her son was going to live the good lady came and admired everything and particularly the bokhara hangings she did not seem to appraise but something set marjorie talking rather nervously of a bargainhunters good fortune mrs trafford glanced at the candlesticks and the low bookcase and returned to the glowing piece of needlework that formed the symmetrical window curtain in the study she took it in her hand and whispered beautiful  but arent these rather good asked mrs trafford  marjorie answered after a little pause theyre not too good for him she said   § 3  and now these young people had to resume life in london in earnest the orchestral accompaniment of the world at large began to mingle with their hitherto unsustained duet it had been inaudible in italy in chelsea it had sounded faintly perhaps but distinctly from their very first inspection of the little house a drawingroom speaks of callers a diningroom of lunchparties and dinners it had swayed marjorie from the front door inward  during their honeymoon they had been gloriously unconscious of comment now marjorie began to show herself keenly sensitive to the advent of a score of personalities and very anxious to show just how completely successful in every sense her romantic disobedience had been she knew she had been approved of admired condemned sneered at thoroughly discussed she felt it her first duty to trafford to all who had approved of her flight to every one herself included to make this marriage obviously indisputably a success a success not only by her own standards but by the standards of anyonesoever who chose to sit in judgment on her  there was trafford she felt she had to extort the admission from every one that he was the handsomest finest ablest most promising and most delightful man a prominent humorist was ever jilted for she wanted them to understand clearly just all that trafford wasand that involved she speedily found in practice making them believe a very great deal that as yet trafford wasnt she found it practically impossible not to anticipate his election to the royal society and the probability of a more important professorship she felt that anyhow he was an frs in the sight of god  it was almost equally difficult not to indicate a larger income than facts justified  it was entirely in marjories vein in those early days that she would want to win on every score and by every standard of reckoning if marjorie had been a general she would have counted no victory complete if the struggle was not sustained and desperate and if it left the enemy with a single gun or flag or herself with so much as a man killed or wounded the people she wanted to impress varied very widely she wanted to impress the carmel girls and the carmel girls she knew with their racial trick of acute appraisement were only to be won by the very highest quality all round they had she knew two standards of quality cost and distinction as far as possible she would give them distinction but whenever she hesitated over something on the verge of cheapness the thought of those impending judgments tipped the balance the carmel girls were just two influential representatives of a host she wanted to impress quite a number of other school and college friends there were various shy plasticspirited emotional creatures of course for the most part with no confidence in their own appearance who would be impressed quite adequately enough by traffords good looks and witty manner and easy temper they might perhaps fall in love with him and become slavish to her after the way of their kind and anyhow they would be provided for but there were plenty of others of a harder texture whose tests would be more difficult to satisfy there were girls who were the daughters of prominent men who must be made to understand that trafford was prominent girls who were well connected who must be made to realize the subtle excellence of traffords blood as she thought of constance graham for example or ottiline winchelsea she felt the strongest disposition to thicken the by no means well authenticated strands that linked trafford with the traffords of traffordoverlea she went about the house dreaming a little apprehensively of these coming calls and the pitiless light of criticism they would bring to bear not indeed upon her happinessthat was assuredbut upon her success  the social side of the position would have to be strained to the utmost marjorie felt with aunt plessington the thought of aunt plessington made her peculiarly apprehensive aunt plessington had to the fullest extent that contempt for merely artistic or scientific people which sits so gracefully upon the administrative english you see people of that sort do not get on in the sense that a young lawyer or barrister gets on they do not make steps they boast and quarrel and are jealous perhaps but that steady patient shove upward seems beyond their intelligence the energies god manifestly gave them for shoving they dissipate in the creation of weak beautiful things and unremunerative theories or in the establishment of views sometimes diametrically opposed to the ideas of influential people and they are queersocially they just moon about doing this socalled work of theirs and even when the judgment of eccentric people forces a kind of reputation upon themheaven knows whythey make no public or social use of it it seemed to aunt plessington that the artist and the scientific man were dealt with very neatly and justly in the parable of the buried talent moreover their private lives were often scandalous they married for love instead of interest often quite disadvantageously and their relationships had all the instability that is natural upon such a foundation and after all what good were they she had never met an artist or a prominent imaginative writer or scientific man that she had not been able to subdue in a minute or so by flat contradiction and if necessary slightly raising her voice they had little or no influence even upon their own public appointments  the thought of the invasion of her agreeable little back street establishment by this britannic system of judgments filled marjories heart with secret terrors she felt she had to grapple with and overcome aunt plessington or be for ever fallenat least so far as that amiable ladys report went and she knew it went pretty far she wandered about the house trying to imagine herself aunt plessington  immediately she felt the gravest doubts whether the whole thing wasnt too graceful and pretty a rich and rather massive ugliness of course would have been the thing to fetch aunt plessington happily it was aunt plessingtons habit to veil her eyes with her voice she might not see very much  the subjugation of aunt plessington was difficult but not altogether hopeless marjorie felt provided her rejection of magnet had not been taken as an act of personal ingratitude there was a case on her side she was discovering for example that trafford had a really very considerable range of acquaintance among quite distinguished people big figures like evesham and machaldo for example were intelligently interested in the trend of his work she felt this gave her a basis for plessingtonian justifications she could produce those peopleas one shows ones loot she could imply oh love and all that nonsense certainly not this is what i did it for with skill and care and good luck and a word here and there in edgeways she believed she might be able to represent the whole adventure as the wellcalculated opening of a campaign on soundly plessingtonian lines her marriage to trafford she tried to persuade herself might be presented as something almost as brilliant and startling as her aunts swoop upon her undistinguished uncle  she might pretend that all along she had seen her way to things to coveted dinnertables and the familiarity of coveted guests to bringing people together and contriving arrangements to influence and prominence to culminations and intrigues impossible in the comparatively specialized world of a successful humorist and playwright and so at last to those high freedoms of authoritative and if necessary offensive utterance in a strangulated contralto and from a position of secure eminence which is the goal of all virtuously ambitious englishwomen of the governing classesthat is to say of all virtuously ambitious englishwomen   § 4  and while such turbid solicitudes as these were flowing in again from the london world to which she had returned and fouling the bright romantic clearness of marjories life trafford in his ampler less detailed way was also troubled about their coming reentry into society he too had his old associations  for example he was by no means confident of the favourable judgments of his mother upon marjories circle of school and college friends whom he gathered from marjories talk were destined to play a large part in this new phase of his life she had given him very ample particulars of some of them and he found them interesting rather than richly attractive personalities it is to be noted that while he thought always of marjorie as a beautiful grownup woman and his mate and equal he was still disposed to regard her intimate friends as schoolgirls of an advanced and aggressive type  then that large circle of distinguished acquaintances which marjorie saw so easily and amply utilized for the subjugation of aunt plessington didnt present itself quite in that service to traffords private thoughts he hadnt that certitude of command over them nor that confidence in their unhesitating approval of all he said and did just as marjorie wished him to shine in the heavens over all her people so in regard to his associates he was extraordinarily anxious that they should realize and realize from the outset without qualification or hesitation how beautiful brave and delightful she was and you know he had already begun to be aware of an evasive feeling in his mind that at times she did not altogether do herself justicehe scarcely knew as yet how or why  she was very young  one or two individuals stood out in his imagination representatives and symbols of the rest particularly there was that old giant sir roderick dover who had been until recently the professor of physics in the great oxford laboratories dover and trafford had one of those warm friendships which spring up at times between a richminded man whose greatness is assured and a young man of brilliant promise it was all the more affectionate because dover had been a friend of traffords father these two and a group of other carelessminded able distinguished and uninfluential men at the winton club affected the end of the smokingroom near the conservatory in the hours after lunch and shared the joys of good talk and fine jesting about the big fireplace there under dovers broad influence they talked more ideas and less gossip than is usual with english club men twaddle about appointments about reputations topics from the mornings papers london architecture and the commerce in good stories took refuge at the other end in the window bays or by the further fireplace trafford only began to realize on his return to london how large a share this intermittent perennial conversation had contributed to the atmosphere of his existence amidst the romantic circumstances of his flight with marjorie he had forgotten the part these men played in his life and thoughts now he was enormously exercised in the search for a reconciliation between these he felt incommensurable factors  he was afraid of what might be sir rodericks unspoken judgment on marjorie and the house she had madethough what was there to be afraid of he was still more afraidand this was even more remarkableof the clear little judgmentshard as loose small diamonds in a bedthat he thought marjorie might pronounce on sir roderick he had never disguised from himself that sir roderick was fatnobody who came within a hundred yards of him could be under any illusion about thatand that he drank a good deal ate with a cosmic spaciousness loved a cigar and talked and laughed with a freedom that sometimes drove delicateminded new members into the corners remotest from the historical fireplace trafford knew himself quite definitely that there was a joy in dovers laugh and voice a beauty in his face that was somehow mixed up with his healthy corpulence and a breadth a charity a leonine courage in his mind that was somehow mixed up with his careless freedom of speech that made him an altogether satisfactory person  but supposing marjorie didnt see any of that  still he was on the verge of bringing sir roderick home when a talk at the club one day postponed that introduction of the two extremes of traffords existence for quite a considerable time  those were the days of the first enthusiasms of the militant suffrage movement and the occasional smashing of a downing street window or an assault upon a minister kept the question of womans distinctive intelligence and character persistently before the public godley buzard the feminist novelist had been the guest of some member to lunch and the occasion was too provocative for any one about dovers fireplace to avoid the topic buzards presence perhaps drove dover into an extreme position on the other side he forgot traffords newwedded condition and handled this great argument an argument which has scarcely progressed since its beginning in the days of plato and aristophanes with the freedoms of an ancient greek and the explicitness of a modern scientific man  he opened almost apropos of nothing women he said are inferiorand you cant get away from it  you can deny it said buzard  in the face of the facts said sir roderick to begin with theyre several inches shorter several pounds lighter theyve less physical strength in footpounds  more endurance said buzard  less sensitiveness merely all those are demonstrable thingsamenable to figures and apparatus then they stand nervous tensions worse the breakingpoint comes sooner they have weaker inhibitions and inhibition is the test of a creatures position in the mental scale  he maintained that in the face of buzards animated protest buzard glanced at their moral qualities more moral cried dover more selfrestraint not a bit of it their desires and passions are weaker even than their controls thats all weaken restraints and they show their quality a drunken woman is far worse than a drunken man and as for their biological significance  they are the species said buzard and we are the accidents  they are the stolon and we are the individualized branches they are the stem and we are the fruits surely its better to exist than just transmit existence and thats a womans business though weve fooled and petted most of em into forgetting it  he proceeded to an attack on the intellectual quality of women he scoffed at the woman artist at feminine research at what he called the joke of feminine philosophy buzard broke in with some sentences of reply he alleged the lack of feminine opportunity inferior education  you dont or wont understand me said dover it isnt a matter of education or opportunity or simply that theyre of inferior capacity it lies deeper than that they dont want to do these things theyre different  precisely ejaculated buzard as if he claimed a score  they dont care for these things they dont care for art or philosophy or literature or anything except the things that touch them directly thats their peculiar difference hunger they understand and comfort and personal vanity and desire furs and chocolate and husbands and the extreme importance conferred upon them by having babies at infrequent intervals but philosophy or beauty for its own sake or dreams lord no the mahometans know they havent souls and they say it we know and keep it up that they have havent all we scientific men had em in our laboratories working dont we know the papers they turn out every sane man of five and forty knows something of the disillusionment of the feminine dream but we whove had the beautiful creatures under us weighing rather badly handling rather weakly invariably missing every fine detail and all the implications of our researches never flashing never leaping never being even thoroughly badwere specialists in the subject at the present time there are far more educated young women than educated young men available for research workand who wants them oh the young professors whove still got ideals perhaps and in they come and if theyre dull they just voluminously do nothing and if theyre bright they either marry your demonstrator or get him into a mess and the work its nothing to them no woman ever painted for the love of painting or sang for the sounds she made or philosophized for the sake of wisdom as men do  buzard intervened with instances dover would have none of them he displayed astonishing and distinctive knowledge madame curie clamoured buzard madame curie  there was curie said dover no woman alone has done such things i dont say women arent clever he insisted theyre too clever give them a mans track or a mans intention marked and defined theyll ape him to the life  buzard renewed his protests talking at the same time as dover and was understood to say that women had to care for something greater than art or philosophy they were custodians of life the future of the race  and thats my crowning disappointment cried dover if there was one thing in which you might think women would show a sense of some divine purpose in life it is in the matter of childrenand they show about as much care in that matter ohas rabbits yes rabbits i stick to it look at the things a nice girl will marry look at the mens children shell consent to bring into the world cheerfully proudly for the sake of the home and the clothes nasty little beasts theyll breed without turning a hair all about us we see girls and women marrying ugly men dull and stupid men illtempered dyspeptic wrecks sickly young fools human ratsrats  no no cried trafford to dover  buzards voice clamoured that all would be different when women had the vote  if ever we get a decent care for eugenics it will come from men said a whitefaced little man on the sofa beside trafford in the confidential tone of one who tells a secret  doing it cheerfully insisted dover  trafford in midprotest was suddenly stricken into silence by a memory it was as if the past had thrown a stone at the back of his head and hit it smartly he nipped his sentence in the bud he left the case for women to buzard  he revived that memory again on his way home it had been in his mind overlaid by a multitude of newer fresher things but now he took it out and looked at it it was queer it was really very queer to think that once upon a time not so very long ago marjorie had been prepared to marry magnet of course she had hated it but still  there is much to be discovered about life even by a brilliant and rising young professor of physics  presently dover fingering the little glass of yellow chartreuse he had hitherto forgotten in the heat of controversy took a more personal turn  dont we know he said and made the limpid amber vanish in his pause dont we know weve got to manage and control emjust as weve got to keep em and stand the racket of their misbehaviour dont our instincts tell us doesnt something tell us all that if we let a woman loose with our honour and trust some other man will get hold of her weve tried it long enough now this theory that a womans a partner and an equal weve tried it long enough to see some of the results and does it work does it a womans a prize a possession a responsibility something to take care of and be careful about you chaps if youll forgive me you advanced chaps seem to want to have the women take care of you you seem always to want to force decisions on them make them answerable for things that you ought to decide and answer for if one could if one could if but theyre not helpsthats a dreamtheyre distractions gratifications anxieties dangers undertakings  buzard got in his one effective blow at this point thats why youve never married sir roderick he threw out  the big man was checked for a moment trafford wondered what memory lit that instants pause ive had my science said dover   § 5  mrs pope was of course among the first to visit the new home so soon as it was open to inspection she arrived looking very bright and neat in a new bonnet and some new black furs that suited her bearing up bravely but obviously in a state of dispersed and miscellaneous emotion  in many ways marjories marriage had been a great relief to her mother particularly it had been a financial relief marjorie had been the most expensive child of her family and her cessation had led to increments both of mrs popes and daphnes all too restricted allowances mrs pope had been able therefore to relapse from the orthodox anglicanism into which poverty had driven her and indulge for an hour weekly in the consolations of higher thought these exercises in emancipated religiosity occurred at the house of mr silas root and were greatly valued by a large circle of clients essentially they were orgies of vacuity and they cost six guineas for seven hours they did her no end of good all through the precious weekly hour she sat with him in a silent twilight very very still and feelingoh higher than anything and when she came out she wore an inane smile on her face and was prepared not to worry to lie with facility and to take the easiest way in every eventuality in an entirely satisfactory and exalted manner moreover he was treating her investments acting upon his advice and doing the whole thing quietly with the idea of preparing a pleasant surprise for her husband she had sold out of certain home railway debentures and invested in a company for working the auriferous waste which is so abundant in the drainage of philadelphia a company whose shareholders were chiefly higher thought disciples and whose profits therefore would inevitably be greatly enhanced by their concerted mental action it was to the prospective profits in this that she owed the new black furs she was wearing  the furs and the bonnet and the previous days treatment she had had all helped to brace her up on marjories doorstep for a complex and difficult situation and to carry her through the first tensions of her call she was so much to pieces as it was that she could not help feeling how much more to pieces she might have beenbut for the grace of silas root she knew she ought to have very strong feelings about trafford though it was not really clear to her what feelings she ought to have on the whole she was inclined to believe she was experiencing moral disapproval mixed up with a pathetic and rather hopeless appeal for the welfare of the tender life that had entrusted itself so recklessly to these brutal and discreditable hands though indeed if she had really dared to look inside her mind her chief discovery would have been a keenly jealous appreciation of traffords good looks and generous temper and a feeling of injustice as between her own lot and marjories however going on her assumed basis she managed to be very pale concise and tightlipped at any mention of her soninlaw and to put a fervour of helpless devotion into her embraces of her daughter she surveyed the house with a pained constrained expression as though she tried in vain to conceal from herself that it was all slightly improper and even such objects as the bokhara hangings failed to extort more than an insincere oh very nice dearvery nice  in the bedroom she spoke about mr pope he was dreadfully upset she said his first thought was to come after you both with a pistol ifif he hadnt married you  but dear mummy of course we meant to marry we married right away  yes dear of course but if he hadnt  she paused and marjorie with a momentary flush of indignation in her cheeks did not urge her to conclude her explanation  hes wounded said mrs pope some day perhaps hell come roundyou were always his favourite daughter  i know said marjorie concisely with a faint flavour of cynicism in her voice  im afraid dear at presenthe will do nothing for you  i dont think rag would like him to said marjorie with an unreal serenity ever  for a time im afraid hell refuse to see you he just wants to forget everything  poor old dad i wish he wouldnt put himself out like this still i wont bother him mummy if you mean that  then suddenly into mrs popes unsystematic unstable mind started perhaps by the ring in her daughters voice there came a wave of affectionate feeling that she had somehow to be hostile and unsympathetic to marjorie that she had to pretend that trafford was wicked and disgusting and not be happy in the jolly hope and happiness of this bright little house cut her with a keen swift pain she didnt know clearly why she was taking this coldly hostile attitude or why she went on doing so but the sense of that necessity hurt her none the less she put out her hands upon her daughters shoulders and whimpered oh my dear i do wish things werent so difficultso very difficult  the whimper changed by some inner force of its own to honest sobs and tears  marjorie passed through a flash of amazement to a sudden understanding of her mothers case poor dear mummy she said oh poor dear mummy its a shame of us  she put her arms about her mother and held her for awhile  it is a shame said her mother in a muffled voice trying to keep hold of this elusive thing that had somehow both wounded her and won her daughter back but her poor grasp slipped again i knew youd come to see it she said dabbing with her handkerchief at her eyes i knew you would and then with the habitual loyalty of years resuming its sway hes always been so good to you  but mrs pope had something more definite to say to marjorie and came to it at last with a tactful offhandedness marjorie communicated it to trafford about an hour later on his return from the laboratory i say she said old daffys engaged to magnet  she paused and added with just the faintest trace of resentment in her voice she can have him as far as im concerned  he didnt wait long said trafford tactlessly  no said marjorie he didnt wait long of course she got him on the rebound   § 6  mrs pope was only a day or so ahead of a cloud of callers the carmel girls followed close upon her tall figures of black fur with costlylooking muffs and a rich glitter at neck and wrist marjorie displayed her house talking fluently about other things and watching for effects the carmel girls ran their swift dark eyes over her appointments glanced quickly from side to side of her rooms saw only too certainly that the house was narrow and small but did they see that it was clever they saw at any rate that she meant it to be clever and with true oriental politeness said as much urgently and extravagantly then there were the rambord girls and their mother an unobservant lot who chattered about the ice at princes then constance graham came with a thoroughbred but very dirty aunt and then ottiline winchelsea with an american minor poet who wanted a view of mountains from the windows at the back and said the bathroom ought to be done in pink then lady solomonson came an extremely expensivelooking fair lady with an affectation of cynicism a keen intelligence acutely apt conversation and a queer effect of thinking of something else all the time she was talking she missed nothing  hardly anybody failed to appreciate the charm and decision of marjories use of those bokhara embroideries  they would have been cheap at double the price   § 7  and then our two young people went out to their first dinnerparties together they began with traffords rich friend solomonson who had played so large and so passive a part in their first meeting he had behaved with a sort of magnanimous triumph over the marriage he made it almost his personal affair as though he had brought it about i knew there was a girl in it he insisted and you told me there wasnt oaah and you kept me in that smell of disinfectant and thingswhat a chap that doctor was for spilling stufffor six blessed days  marjorie achieved a dress at once simple and good with great facility by not asking the price until it was all over there is no halfsuccess with dinnerdresses either the thing is a success and inestimable or not worth having at any price at all it was blue with a thread of gold and she had a necklace of blueish moonstones goldset and her hair ceased to be copper and became golden and her eyes unfathomable blue she was radiant with health and happiness no one else there had her clear freshness and her manner was as restrained and dignified and ready as a proud young wifes can be everyone seemed to like her and respect her and be interested in her and trafford kissed her flushed cheek in the hansom as they came home again and crowned her happiness it had been quite a large party and really much more splendid and brilliant than anything she had ever seen before there had been one old gentleman with a coloured button and another with a ribbon there had been a countess with historical pearls and halfadozen other people one might fairly call distinguished the house was tremendous in its way spacious rich glowing with lights abounding in vistas and fine remote backgrounds in the midst of it all she had a sudden thrill at the memory that less than a year ago she had been ignominiously dismissed from the dinnertable by her father for a hiccup  a few days after aunt plessington suddenly asked the traffords to one of her less important but still interesting gatherings not one of those that swayed the world perhaps but one which marjorie was given to understand achieved important subordinate wagging aunt plessington had not called she explained in her note because of the urgent demands the movement made upon her time it was her wonderful hardbreathing way never to call on anyone and it added tremendously to her reputation none the less it appearedthough here the scrawl became illegibleshe meant to shove and steer her dear niece upward at a tremendous pace they were even asked to come a little early so that she might make traffords acquaintance  the dress was duly admired and then aunt plessingtonassuming the hearthrug and forgetting the little matter of their careerexplained quite napoleonic and wonderful things she was going to do with her movement fresh principles fresh applications a big committee of all the namesthey were easy to get if you didnt bother them to do thingsa new and more attractive title payment in kind was to give way to reality of reward and she herself was going to have her hair bleached bright white which would set off her eyes and colour and the general geniality of appearance due to her projecting teeth and so greatly increase her platform efficiency hubert she said was toiling away hard at the detail of these new endeavours he would be down in a few minutes time marjorie she said ought to speak at their meetings it would help both the traffords to get on if marjorie cut a dash at the outset and there was no such dash to be cut as speaking at aunt plessingtons meetings it was catching on all next season it was sure to be the thing so many promising girls allowed themselves to be submerged altogether in marriage for a time and when they emerged everyone had forgotten the promise of their début she had an air of rescuing marjorie from an impending fate by disabusing trafford from injurious prepossessions  presently the guests began to drop in a vegetarian health specialist a rising young woman factory inspector a phrenologist who was being induced to put great talents to better uses under aunt plessingtons influence his dumb obscure but inevitable wife a colonial bishop a baroness with a taste rather than a capacity for intellectual society a wealthy jam and pickle manufacturer and his wife who had subscribed largely to the funds of the movement and wanted to meet the lady of title and the editor of the movements organ upward and on a young gentleman of abundant hair and cadaverous silences whom aunt plessington patted on the shoulder and spoke of as one of our discoveries and then uncle hubert came down looking ruffled and overworked with his readymade dresstiehe was one of those men who can never master the art of tying a bowvery much askew the conversation turned chiefly on the movement if it strayed aunt plessington reached out her voice after it and brought it back in a masterful manner  through soup and fish marjorie occupied herself with the inflexible rigour of the young editor who had brought her down when she could give her attention to the general conversation she discovered her husband a little flushed and tackling her aunt with an expression of quiet determination the phrenologist and the vegetarian health specialist were regarding him with amazement the jam and pickle manufacturers wife was evidently deeply shocked he was refusing to believe in the value of the movement and aunt plessington was manifestly losing her temper  i dont see mrs plessington he was saying that all this amounts to more than a kind of glorious district visiting that is how i see it you want to attack people in their homesbefore they cry out to you you want to compel them by this payment in kind of yours to do what you want them to do instead of trying to make them want to do it now i think your business is to make them want to do it you may perhaps increase the amount of milk in babies and the amount of whitewash in cottages and slums by your methodsi dont dispute the promise of your statisticsbut youre going to do it at a cost of human selfrespect thats out of all proportion  uncle huberts voice with that thick utterance that always suggested a mouthful of plums came booming down the table all these arguments he said have been answered long ago  no doubt said trafford with a faint asperity but tell me the answers  its ridiculous said aunt plessington to talk of the selfrespect of the kind of peopleoh the very dregs  its just because the plant is delicate that youve got to handle it carefully said trafford  heres miss gant said aunt plessington she knows the strata we are discussing shell tell you they have positively no selfrespectnone at all  my people said miss gant as if in conclusive testimony actually conspire with their employers to defeat me  i dont see the absence of selfrespect in that said trafford  but all their interests  im thinking of their pride  the discussion lasted to the end of dinner and made no headway as soon as the ladies were in the drawingroom aunt plessington a little flushed from the conflict turned on marjorie and said i like your husband hes wrongheaded but hes young and hes certainly spirited he ought to get on if he wants to does he do nothing but his researches  he lectures in the spring term said marjorie  ah said aunt plessington with a triumphant note you must alter all that you must interest him in wider things you must bring him out of his shell and let him see what it is to deal with affairs then he wouldnt talk such nonsense about our work  marjory was at a momentary loss for a reply and in the instants respite aunt plessington turned to the jam and pickle lady and asked in a bright encouraging note well and hows the village club getting on  she had another lunge at trafford as he took his leave you must come again soon she said i love a good wrangle and hubert and i never want to talk about our movement to any one but unbelievers you dont know the beginnings of it yet only i warn you they have a way of getting converted i warn you  on this occasion there was no kissing in the cab trafford was exasperated  of all the intolerable women he said and was silent for a time  the astounding part of it is he burst out that this sort of thing this movement and all the rest of it does really give the quality of english public affairs its like a sampledredged thethe cheapness of it raised voices rash assertions sham investigations meetings and committees and meetings thats the stuff of it and politicians really have to attend to it and silly ineffective irritating bills really get drafted and messed about with and passed on the strength of it public affairs are still in the dark ages nobody now would think of getting together a scratch committee of rich old women and miscellaneous conspicuous people to design an electric tram and jabbering and jabbering and jabbering and if any one objectsa note of personal bitterness came into his voicejabbering faster but nobody thinks it ridiculous to attempt the organization of poor peoples affairs in that sort of way this project of the supersession of wages by payment in kindoh its childish if it wasnt it would be outrageous and indecent your uncle and aunt havent thought for a moment of any single one of the necessary consequences of these things they say their confounded movement aims at effects upon the race upon public spirit upon peoples habits and motives theyve just a queer craving to feel powerful and influential which they think they can best satisfy by upsetting the lives of no end of harmless poor peoplethe only people they dare upsetand thats about as far as they go your aunts detestable marjorie  marjorie had never seen him so deeply affected by anything but herself it seemed to her he was needlessly disturbed by a trivial matter he sulked for a space and then broke out again  that confounded woman talks of my physical science he said as if research were an amiable weakness like collecting postage stamps and its changed human conditions more in the last ten years than all the parliamentary wirepullers and legislators and administrative experts have done in two centuries and for all that theres more clerks in whitehall than professors of physics in the whole of england  i suppose its the way that sort of thing gets done said marjorie after an interval  that sort of thing doesnt get done snapped trafford all these people burble about with their movements and jobs and lectures and stuffand things happen like some one getting squashed to death in a crowd nobody did it but anybody in the muddle can claim to have done itif only theyve got the cheek of your aunt plessington  he seemed to have finished  done he suddenly broke out again why people like your aunt plessington dont even know where the handle is if they ventured to look for it theyd give the whole show away done indeed  here we are said marjorie a little relieved to find the hansom turning out of kings road into their own side street  and then marjorie wore the blue dress with great success at the carmels the girls came and looked at it and admired itit was no mere politeness they admitted there was style about it a qualitythere was no explaining youre wonderful madge cried the younger carmel girl  the carmel boy seizing the opportunity of a momentary seclusion in a corner ended a short but rather portentous silence with i say you do look ripping in a voice that implied the keenest regret for the slacknesses of a summer that was now infinitely remote to marjorie it was ridiculous that the carmel boy should have such emotionshe was six years younger than trafford and only a year older than marjorie and yet she was pleased by his manifest wound  there was only one little thing at the back of her mind that alloyed her sense of happy and complete living that night and that was the ghost of an addition sum at home in her pretty bureau a little gathering pile of bills as yet unpaid and an empty chequebook with appealing counterfoils awaited her attention  marjorie had still to master the fact that all the fine braveries and interests and delights of life that offer themselves so amply to the favoured children of civilization trail and since the fall of man at any rate have trailed after them somethingsomething the justification of morality the despair of all easy happy souls the unavoidable drop of bitterness in the cup of pleasurethe reckoning     chapter the second  the child of the ages   § 1  when the intellectual history of this time comes to be written nothing i think will stand out more strikingly than the empty gulf in quality between the superb and richly fruitful scientific investigations that are going on and the general thought of other educated sections of the community i do not mean that the scientific men are as a whole a class of supermen dealing with and thinking about everything in a way altogether better than the common run of humanity but that in their own field they think and work with an intensity an integrity a breadth boldness patience thoroughness and faithfulness that excepting only a few artists puts their work out of all comparison with any other human activity often the field in which the work is done is very narrow and almost universally the underlying philosophy is felt rather than apprehended a scientific man may be large and deepminded deliberate and personally detached in his work and hasty commonplace and superficial in every other relation of life nevertheless it is true that in these particular directions the human mind has achieved a new and higher quality of attitude and gesture a veracity selfdetachment and selfabnegating vigour of criticism that tend to spread out and must ultimately spread out to every other human affair in these uncontroversial issues at least mankind has learnt the rich rewards that ensue from patience and infinite pains  the peculiar circumstances of traffords birth and upbringing had accentuated his natural disposition toward this new thoroughness of intellectual treatment which has always distinguished the great artist and which today is also the essential quality of the scientific method he had lived apart from any urgency to produce and compete in the common business of the world his natural curiosities fed and encouraged by his natural gifts had grown into a steady passion for clarity and knowledge but with him there was no specialization he brought out from his laboratory into the everyday affairs of the world the same sceptical restraint of judgment which is the touchstone of scientific truth this made him a tepid and indeed rather a scornful spectator of political and social life party formulae international rivalries social customs and very much of the ordinary law of our state impressed him as a kind of fungoid growth out of a fundamental intellectual muddle it all maintained itself hazardously changing and adapting itself unintelligently to unseen conditions he saw no ultimate truth in this seething welter of human efforts no tragedy as yet in its defeats no value in its victories it had to go on he believed until the spreading certitudes of the scientific method pierced its unsubstantial thickets burst its delusive films drained away its folly aunt plessingtons talk of order and progress and the influence of her movement impressed his mind very much as the cackle of some larger kind of henwhich cackles because it must only aunt plessington being human simply imagined the egg she laidon the plane of the ideal when the great nonsensical issues between liberal and conservative between socialist and individualist between anglosaxon and teuton between the white race and the yellow race arose in traffords company he would if he felt cheerful take one side or the other as chance or his amusement with his interlocutors determined and jest and gibe at the opponents inconsistencies and if on the other hand he chanced to be irritable he would lose his temper at this chewing of mesembryanthemum and sulk into silence chewing mesembryanthemum was one of traffords favourite imagesno doubt the reader knows that abundant fleshy mediterranean weed and the weakly unpleasant wateriness of its substance he went back to his laboratory and his proper work after such discussions with a feeling of escape as if he shut a door upon a dirty and undisciplined marketplace crowded with mental defectives yet even before he met and married marjorie there was a queer little undertow of thought in his mind which insisted that this business could not end with doorslamming that he didnt altogether leave the social confusion outside his panels when he stood alone before his apparatus and that sooner or later that babble of voices would force his defences and overcome his disdain  his particular work upon the intimate constitution of matter had broadened very rapidly in his hands the drift of his work had been to identify all colloids as liquid solutions of variable degrees of viscosity and to treat crystalline bodies as the only solids he had dealt with oscillating processes in colloid bodies with especial reference to living matter he had passed from a study of the melting and toughening of glass to the molecular structure of a number of elastic bodies and so by a characteristic leap into botanical physiology to the states of resinous and gummy substances at the moment of secretion he worked at first upon a false start and then resumed to discover a growing illumination he found himself in the presence of phenomena that seemed to him to lie near the still undiscovered threshold to the secret processes of living protoplasm he was as it were breaking into biology by way of molecular physics he spent many long nights of deep excitement calculating and arranging the development of these seductive intimations it was this work which his marriage had interrupted and to which he was now returning  he was surprised to find how difficult it was to take it up again he had been only two months away from it and yet already it had not a little of the feeling of a relic taken from a drawer something had faded it was at first as if a film had come over his eyes so that he could no longer see these things clearly and subtly and closely his senses his emotions had been living in a stirring and vivid illumination now in this cool quietude bright clouds of coloured memorystuff swam distractingly before his eyes phantom kisses on his lips the memory of touches and the echoing vibrations of an adorable voice the thought of a gay delightful fireside and the fresh recollection of a companion intensely felt beside him effaced the delicate profundities of this dim place durgan hovered about him helpful and a mute reproach trafford had to force his attention daily for the better part of two weeks before he had fully recovered the fine enchanting interest of that suspended work   § 2  at last one day he had the happiness of possession again he had exactly the sensation one gets when some hitherto intractable piece of a machine one is putting together clicks neatly and beyond all hoping into its place he found himself working in the old style with the hours slipping by disregarded he sent out durgan to get him tobacco and tea and smokedsalmon sandwiches and he stayed in the laboratory all night he went home about halfpast five and found a whitefaced redeyed marjorie still dressed wrapped in a travellingrug and crumpled and asleep in his study armchair beside the grey ashes of an extinct fire  in the instant before she awoke he could see what a fragile and pitiful being a healthy and happy young wife can appear her pose revealed an unsuspected slender weakness of body her face something infantile and wistful he had still to reckon with she awoke with a start and stared at him for a moment and at the room about her oh where have you been she asked almost querulously where have you been  but my dear he said as one might speak to a child why arent you in bed its just dawn  oh she said i waited and i waited it seemed you must come i read a book and then i fell asleep and then with a sob of feeble selfpity and here i am she rubbed the back of her hand into one eye and shivered im cold she said and i want some tea  lets make some said trafford  its been horrible waiting said marjorie without moving horrible where have you been  ive been working i got excited by my work ive been at the laboratory ive had the best spell of work ive ever had since our marriage  but i have been up all night she cried with her face and voice softening to tears how could you how could you  he was surprised by her weeping he was still more surprised by the selfabandonment that allowed her to continue ive been working he repeated and then looked about with a mans helplessness for the tea apparatus one must have hot water and a teapot and a kettle he would find those in the kitchen he strolled thoughtfully out of the room thinking out the further details of teamaking all mixed up with amazement at marjorie while she sat wiping her eyes with a crumpled pockethandkerchief presently she followed him down with the rug about her like a shawl and stood watching him as he lit a fire of wood and paper among the ashes in the kitchen fireplace its been dreadful she said not offering to help  you see he said on his knees id really got hold of my work at last  but you should have sent  i was thinking of my work i clean forgot  forgot  absolutely  forgotme  of course said trafford with a slightly puzzled air you dont see it as i do  the kettle engaged him for a time then he threw out a suggestion well have to have a telephone  i couldnt imagine where you were i thought of all sorts of things i almost came roundbut i was so horribly afraid i mightnt find you  he renewed his suggestion of a telephone  so that if i really want you said marjorie or if i just want to feel youre there  yes said trafford slowly jabbing a piece of firewood into the glow but it was chiefly present in his mind that much of that elaborate experimenting of his wasnt at all a thing to be cut athwart by the exasperating gusts of a telephone bell clamouring for attention hitherto the laboratory telephone had been in the habit of disconnecting itself early in the afternoon  and yet after all it was this instrument the same twisted wire and little quivering tympanum that had brought back marjorie into his life   § 3  and now trafford fell into a great perplexity of mind his banker had called his attention to the fact that his account was overdrawn to the extent of three hundred and thirteen pounds and he had been under that vague sort of impression one always has about ones current account that he was a hundred and fifty or so to the good his first impression was that those hitherto infallible beings those unseen gnomes of the passbook whose lucid figures neat tickings and unrelenting additions constituted banks to his imagination must have made a mistake his second that some one had tampered with a cheque his third thought pointed to marjorie and the easy circumstances of his home for a fortnight now she had been obviously ailing oddly irritable he did not understand the change in her but it sufficed to prevent his taking the thing to her at once and going into it with her as he would have done earlier instead he had sent for his passbook and in the presence of its neat columns realized for the first time the meaning of marjories three hundred pounds including halfadozen cheques to oxbridge tradesmen for her old debts she had spent he discovered nearly seven hundred and fifty  he sat before the little bundle of crumpled strips of pink and white perforated purple stamped and effaced in a state of extreme astonishment it was no small factor in his amazement to note how very carelessly some of those cheques of marjories had been written several she had not even crossed the effect of it all was that shed just spent his moneyfreelywith an utter disregard of the consequences  up to that moment it had never occurred to trafford that anybody one really cared for could be anything but punctilious about money now here with an arithmetical exactitude of demonstration he perceived that marjorie wasnt  it was so tremendous a discovery for him so disconcerting and startling that he didnt for two days say a word to her about it he couldnt think of a word to say he felt that even to put these facts before her amounted to an accusation of disloyalty and selfishness that he hadnt the courage to make his work stopped altogether he struggled hourly with that accusation did she realize there seemed no escape from his dilemma either she didnt care or she didnt understand  his thoughts went back to the lake of orta when he had put all his money at her disposal she had been surprised and now he perceived she had also been a little frightened the chief excuse he could find for her was that she was inexperiencedabsolutely inexperienced  even now of course she was drawing fresh cheques  he would have to pull himself together and go into the whole thingfor all its infinite disagreeablenesswith her  but it was marjorie who broached the subject  he had found work at the laboratory unsatisfactory and after lunching at his club he had come home and gone to his study in order to think out the discussion he contemplated with her she came in to him as he sat at his desk busy she said not very he answered and she came up to him kissed his head and stood beside him with her hand on his shoulder  passbook she asked  he nodded  ive been overrunning  no end  the matter was opened what would she say  she bent to his ear and whispered im going to overrun some more  his voice was resentful you cant he said compactly without looking at her youve spentenough  theresthings  what things  her answer took some time in coming well have to give a wedding present to daffy i shall wantsome more furniture  well he had to go into it now i dont think you can have it he said and then as she remained silent marjorie do you know how much money ive got  six thousand  i had but weve spent nearly a thousand pounds yesone thousand poundsover and above income we meant to spend four hundred and now weve gothardly anything over five  five thousand said marjorie  five thousand  and theres your salary  yes but at this pace  dear said marjorie and her hands came about his neck deartheres something  she broke off an unfamiliar quality in her voice struck into him he turned his head to see her face rose to his feet staring at her  this remarkable young woman had become soft and wonderful as april hills across which clouds are sweeping her face was as if he had never seen it before her eyes bright with tears  oh dont lets spoil things by thinking of money she said ive got something her voice fell to a whisper dont lets spoil things by thinking of money its too good dear to be true its too good to be true it makes everything perfect well have to furnish that little room i didnt dare to hope itsomehow ive been so excited and afraid but weve got to furnish that little room therethat empty little room upstairs dear that we left over oh my dear my dear   § 4  the world of trafford and marjorie was filled and transfigured by the advent of their child  for two days of abundant silences he had been preparing a statement of his case for her he had been full of the danger to his research and all the waste of his life that her extravagance threatened he wanted to tell her just all that his science meant to him explain how his income and life had all been arranged to leave him mind and time and energy free for these commanding investigations his life was to him the service of knowledgeor futility he had perceived that she did not understand this in him that for her life was a blaze of eagerly sought experiences and gratifications so far he had thought out things and had them ready for her but now all this impending discussion vanished out of his world their love was to be crowned by the miracle of parentage this fact flooded his outlook and submerged every other consideration  this manifest probability came to him as if it were an unforeseen marvel it was as if he had never thought of such a thing before as though a fact entirely novel in the order of the universe had come into existence marjorie became again magical and wonderful for him but in a manner new and strange she was grave solemn significant he was filled with a passionate solicitude for her welfare and a passionate desire to serve her it seemed impossible to him that only a day or so ago he should have been accusing her in his heart of disloyalty and searching for excuses and mitigations  all the freshness of his first love for marjorie returned his keen sense of the sweet gallantry of her voice and bearing his admiration for the swift falconlike swoop of her decisions for the grace and poise of her body and the steady frankness of her eyes but now it was all charged with his sense of this new joint life germinating at the heart of her slender vigour spreading throughout her being to change it altogether into womanhood for ever in this new light his passion for research and all the scheme of his life appeared faded and unworthy as much egotism as if he had been devoted to hunting or golf or any such aimless preoccupation fatherhood gripped him and faced him about it was manifestly a monstrous thing that he should ever have expected marjorie to become a mere undisturbing accessory to the selfish intellectualism of his career to shave and limit herself to a mere bachelor income and play no part of her own in the movement of the world he knew better now research must fall into its proper place and for his immediate business he must set to work to supplement his manifestly inadequate resources  at first he could form no plan at all for doing that he determined that research must still have his morning hours until lunchtime and he privately resolved some part of the night the rest of his day he thought he would set aside for a time to moneymaking but he was altogether inexperienced in the methods of moneymaking it was a new problem and a new sort of problem to him altogether he discovered himself helpless and rather silly in the matter the more obvious possibilities seemed to be that he might lecture upon his science or write he communicated with a couple of lecture agencies and was amazed at their scepticism no doubt he knew his science on that point they were complimentary in a profuse unconvincing manner but could he interest like xand here they named a notorious quackcould he draw he offered science notes to a weekly periodical the editor answered that for the purposes of his publication he preferred as between professors and journalists journalists you real scientific men he said are no doubt a thousand times more accurate and novel and all that but as no one seems able to understand you he went to his old fellowstudent gwenn who was editing the scientific review and through him he secured some semipopular lectures which involved he found travelling about twentynine miles weekly at the rate of fourandsixpence a milecounting nothing for the lectures afterwards gwenn arranged for some regular notes on physics and microchemistry trafford made out a weekly timetable on whose white of dignity leisure and the honourable pursuit of knowledge a diaper of red marked the claims of domestic necessity   § 5  it was astonishing how completely this coming child dominated the whole atmosphere and all the circumstances of the traffords it became their central fact to which everything else turned and pointed its effect on marjories circle of school and college friends was prodigious she was the first of their company to cross the mysterious boundaries of a womans life she became to them a heroine mingled with something of the priestess they called upon her more abundantly and sat with her noted the change in her eyes and voice and bearing talking with a kind of awe and a faint diffidence of the promised new life  many of them had been deeply tinged by the womens suffrage movement the feminist note was strong among them and when one afternoon ottiline winchelsea brought round agatha alimony the novelist and agatha said in that deepringing voice of hers i hope it will be a girl so that presently she may fight the battle of her sex there was the profoundest emotion but when marjorie conveyed that to trafford he was lacking in response  i want a boy he said and being pressed for a reason explained oh one likes to have a boy i want him with just your quick eyes and ears my dear and just my own safe and certain hands  mrs pope received the news with that depth and aimless complexity of emotion which had now become her habitual method with marjorie she kissed and clasped her daughter and thought confusedly over her shoulder and said of course dear oh i do so hope it wont annoy your father daffy was nice but vague and sufficiently feminist to wish it a daughter and the pseudotwins said hooray and changed the subject at the earliest possible opportunity but theodore was deeply moved at the prospect of becoming an uncle and went apart and mused deeply and darkly thereon for some time it was difficult to tell just what traffords mother thought she was complex and subtle and evidently did not show marjorie all that was in her mind but at any rate it was clear the prospect of a grandchild pleased and interested her and about aunt plessingtons views there was no manner of doubt at all she thought and remarked judicially as one might criticize a game of billiards that on the whole it was just a little bit too soon   § 6  marjorie kept well throughout march and april and then suddenly she grew unutterably weary and uncomfortable in london the end of april came hot and close and dryit might have been july for the heatthe scrap of garden wilted and the streets were irritating with fine dust and blown scraps of paper and drifting straws she could think of nothing but the shade of trees and cornfields under sunlight and the shadows of passing clouds so trafford took out an old bicycle and wandered over the home counties for three days and at last hit upon a little country cottage near great missenden a cottage a couple of girl artists had furnished and now wanted to let it had a long untidy vegetable garden and a small orchard and dryingground with an old superannuated humbug of a peartree near the centre surrounded by a green seat and high hedges with the promise of honeysuckle and dogroses and gaps that opened into hospitable beechwoodswoods not so thick but that there were glades of bluebells bracken and to be exact in places embattled stingingnettles he took it and engaged a minute active interested philoprogenitive servant girl for it and took marjorie thither in a taxicab she went out wrapped in a shawl and sat under the peartree and cried quietly with weakness and sentiment and the tenderness of afternoon sunshine and forthwith began to pick up wonderfully and was presently writing to trafford to buy her a dog to go for walks with while he was away in london  trafford was still struggling along with his research in spite of a constant gravitation to the cottage and marjories side but he was also doing his best to grapple with the difficulties of his financial situation his science notes which were very uncongenial and difficult to do and his lecturing still left his income far behind his expenditure and the problem of minimising the inevitable fresh inroads on his capital was insistent and distracting he discovered that he could manage his notes more easily and write a more popular article if he dictated to a typist instead of writing out the stuff in his own manuscript dictating made his sentences more copious and open and the effect of the young ladys by no means acquiescent back was to make him far more explicit than he tended to be pen in hand with a pen and alone he felt the boredom of the job unendurably and to be through with it became more and more terse allusive and compactly technical after the style of his original papers one or two articles by him were accepted and published by the monthly magazines but as he took what the editors sent him he did not find this led to any excessive opulence  but his heart was very much with marjorie through all this time hitherto he had taken her health and vigour and companionship for granted and it changed his attitudes profoundly to find her now an ailing thing making an invincible appeal for restraint and consideration and help she changed marvellously she gained a new dignity and her complexion took upon itself a fresh soft beauty he would spend three or four days out of a week at the cottage and long hours of that would be at her side paper and notes of some forthcoming lecture at hand neglected talking to her consolingly and dreamingly his thoughts were full of ideas about education he was obsessed as are most intelligent young parents of the modern type by the enormous possibilities of human improvement that might be achievedif only one could begin with a baby from the outset on the best lines with the best methods training and preparing itpresumably for a cleaned and chastened world indeed he made all the usual discoveries of intelligent modern young parents very rapidly fully and completely and overlooked most of those practical difficulties that finally reduce them to human dimensions again in quite the normal fashion  i sit and muse sometimes when i ought to be computing he said old durgan watches me and grunts but think if we take reasonable care watch its phases stand ready with a kindergarten toy directly it stretches out its handthink what we can make of it  we will make it the most wonderful child in the world said marjorie indeed what else can it be  your eyes said trafford and my hands  a girl  a boy  he kissed her white and passive wrist   § 7  the child was born a little before expectation at the cottage throughout a long summers night and day in early september its coming into the world was a long and painful struggle the general practitioner who had seemed two days before a competent and worthy person enough revealed himself as hesitating oldfashioned and illequipped he had a lingering theological objection to the use of chloroform and the nurse from london sulked under his directions and came and discussed his methods scornfully with trafford from sundown until daylight trafford chafed in the little sittingroom and tried to sleep and hovered listening at the foot of the narrow staircase to the room above he lived through interminable hours of moaning and suspense  the dawn and sunrise came with a quality of beautiful horror for years afterwards that memory stood out among other memories as something peculiarly strange and dreadful day followed an interminable night and broke slowly things crept out of darkness awoke as it were out of mysteries and reclothed themselves in unsubstantial shadows and fainthued forms all through that slow infiltration of the world with light and then with colour the universe it seemed was moaning and endeavouring and a weak and terrible struggle went on and kept on in that forbidden room whose windows opened upon the lightening world dying to a sobbing silence rising again to agonizing cries fluctuating a perpetual obstinate failure to achieve a tormenting end he went out and behold the sky was a wonder of pink flushed level clouds and golden hope and nearly every star except the morning star had gone the supine moon was pale and halfdissolved in blue and the grass which had been grey and wet was green again and the bushes and trees were green he returned and hovered in the passage washed his face listened outside the door for agelong moments and then went out again to listen under the window  he went to his room and shaved sat for a long time thinking and then suddenly knelt by his bed and prayed he had never prayed before in all his life  he returned to the garden and there neglected and wet with dew was the camp chair marjorie had sat on the evening before the shawl she had been wearing the novel she had been reading he brought these things in as if they were precious treasures  light was pouring into the world again now he noticed with an extreme particularity the detailed dewy delicacy of grass and twig the silver edges to the leaves of briar and nettle the soft clearness of the moss on bank and wall he noted the woods with the first warmth of autumn tinting their green the clear calm sky with just a wisp or so of purple cloud waning to a luminous pink on the brightening east the exquisite freshness of the air and still through the open window incessant unbearable came this sound of marjorie moaning now dying away now reviving now weakening again  was she dying were they murdering her it was incredible this torture could go on somehow it must end chiefly he wanted to go in and kill the doctor but it would do no good to kill the doctor  at last the nurse came out looking a little scared to ask him to cycle three miles away and borrow some special sort of needle that the fool of a doctor had forgotten he went outwardly meek and returning was met by the little interested servant very alert and excited and rather superiorfor here was something no man can dowith the news that he had a beautiful little daughter and that all was well with marjorie  he said thank god thank god several times and then went out into the kitchen and began to eat some flabby toast and drink some lukewarm tea he found there he was horribly fatigued is she all right he asked over his shoulder hearing the doctors footsteps on the stairs  they were very pontifical and official with him  presently they brought out a strange wizened little animal wailing very stoutly with a face like a very very old woman and reddish skin and hairit had quite a lot of wet blackish hair of an incredible delicacy of texture it kicked with a stumpy monkeys legs and inturned feet he held it his heart went out to it he pitied it beyond measure it was so weak and ugly he was astonished and distressed by the fact of its extreme endearing ugliness he had expected something strikingly pretty it clenched a fist and he perceived it had all its complement of fingers and ridiculous pretentious little finger nails inside that fist it squeezed his heart he did not want to give it back to them he wanted to protect it he felt they could not understand it or forgive as he could forgive its unjustifiable feebleness  later for just a little while he was permitted to see marjoriemarjorie so spent so unspeakably weary and yet so reassuringly vital and living so full of gentle pride and gentler courage amidst the litter of surgical precaution that the tears came streaming down his face and he sobbed shamelessly as he kissed her little daughter she whispered and smiledjust as she had always smiledthat sweet dear smile of hersand closed her eyes and said no more  afterwards as he walked up and down the garden he remembered their former dispute and thought how characteristic of marjorie it was to have a daughter in spite of all his wishes   § 8  for weeks and weeks this astonishing and unprecedented being filled the traffords earth and sky very speedily its minute quaintness passed and it became a vigorous delightful baby that was as the nurse explained repeatedly and very explicitly not only quite exceptional and distinguished but exactly everything that a baby should be its weight became of supreme importance there was a splendid week when it put on nine ounces and an indifferent one when it added only one and then came a terrible crisis it was ill some sort of infection had reached it an infantile cholera its temperature mounted to a hundred and three and a half it became a flushed misery wailing with a pathetic feeble voice then it ceased to wail marjorie became whitelipped and heavyeyed from want of sleep and it seemed to trafford that perhaps his child might die it seemed to him that the spirit of the universe must be a monstrous calivan since children had to die he went for a long walk through the october beechwoods under a windy sky and in a drift of falling leaves wondering with a renewed freshness at the haunting futilities of life life was not futileanything but that but futility seemed to be stalking it waiting for it when he returned the child was already better and in a few days it was well againbut very light and thin  when they were sure of its safety marjorie and he confessed the extremity of their fears to one another they had not dared to speak before and even now they spoke in undertones of the shadow that had hovered and passed over the dearest thing in their lives     chapter the third  the new phase   § 1  in the course of the next six months the child of the ages became an almost ordinary healthy baby and trafford began to think consecutively about his scientific work againin the intervals of effort of a more immediately practical sort  the recall of molecular physics and particularly of the internal condition of colloids to something like their old importance in his life was greatly accelerated by the fact that a young oxford don named behrens was showing extraordinary energy in what had been for a time traffords distinctive and undisputed field behrens was one of those vividly clever energetic people who are the despair of originative men he had begun as traffords pupil and sedulous ape he had gone on to work that imitated traffords in everything except its continual freshness and now he was ransacking every scrap of suggestion to be found in traffords work and developing it with an intensity of uninspired intelligence that most marvellously simulated originality he was already being noted as an authority sometimes in an article his name would be quoted and traffords omitted in relation to traffords ideas and in every way his emergence and the manner of his emergence threatened and stimulated his model and master a great effort had to be made trafford revived the drooping spirits of durgan by a renewed punctuality in the laboratory he began to stay away from home at night and work late again now however under no imperative inspiration but simply because it was only by such an invasion of the evening and night that it would be possible to make headway against behrens unremitting industry and this new demand upon traffords already strained mental and nervous equipment began very speedily to have its effect upon his domestic life  it is only in romantic fiction that a man can work strenuously to the limit of his power and come home to be sweet sunny and entertaining traffords preoccupation involved a certain negligence of marjorie a certain indisposition to be amused or interested by trifling things a certain irritability   § 2  and now indeed the traffords were coming to the most difficult and fatal phase in marriage they had had that taste of defiant adventure which is the crown of a spirited love affair they had known the sweetness of a maiden passion for a maid and they had felt all those rich and solemn emotions those splendid fears and terrible hopes that weave themselves about the great partnership in parentage and now so far as sex was concerned there might be much joy and delight still but no more wonder no fresh discoveries of incredible new worlds and unsuspected stars love which had been a new garden an unknown land a sunlit sea to launch upon was now a rich treasurehouse of memories and memories although they afford a perpetually increasing enrichment to emotion are not sufficient in themselves for the daily needs of life  for this indeed is the truth of passionate love that it works outs its purpose and comes to an end a day arrives in every marriage when the lovers must face each other disillusioned stripped of the last shred of excitementundisguisedly themselves and our two were married they had bound themselves together under a penalty of scandalous disgrace to take the lifelong consequences of their passionate association  it was upon trafford that this exhaustion of the sustaining magic of love pressed most severely because it was he who had made the greatest adaptations to the exigencies of their union he had crippled he perceived more and more clearly the research work upon which his whole being had once been set and his hours were full of tiresome and trivial duties and his mind engaged and worried by growing financial anxieties he had made these abandonments in a phase of exalted passion for the one woman in the world and her unprecedented child and now he saw in spite of all his desire not to see that she was just a weak human being among human beings and neither she nor little margharita so very marvellous  but while marjorie shrank to the dimensions of reality research remained still a luminous and commanding dream in love one fails or one wins home but the lure of research is for ever beyond the hills every victory is a new desire science has inexhaustibly fresh worlds to conquer  he was beginning now to realize the dilemma of his life the reality of the opposition between marjorie and child and home on the one hand and on the other this big wider thing this remoter severer demand upon his being he had long perceived these were distinct and different things but now it appeared more and more inevitable that they should be antagonistic and mutually disregardful things each claimed him altogether it seemed and suffered compromise impatiently and this is where the particular stress of his situation came in hitherto he had believed that nothing of any importance was secret or inexplicable between himself and marjorie his ideal of his relationship had assumed a complete sympathy of feeling an almost instinctive identity of outlook and now it was manifest they were living in a state of inadequate understanding that she knew only in the most general and opaque forms the things that interested him so profoundly and had but the most superficial interest in his impassioned curiosities and missing as she did the strength of his intellectual purpose she missed too she had no inkling of the way in which her careless expansiveness pressed upon him she was unaware that she was destroying an essential thing in his life  he could not tell how far this antagonism was due to inalterable discords of character how far it might not be an ineradicable sex difference a necessary aspect of marriage the talk of old sir roderick dover at the winton club germinated in his mind a branching and permeating suggestion and then would come a phase of keen sympathy with marjorie she would say brilliant and penetrating things display a swift cleverness that drove all these intimations of incurable divergence clean out of his head again then he would find explanations in the differences between his and marjories training and early associations he perceived his own upbringing had had a steadfastness and consistency that had been altogether lacking in hers he had had the rare advantage of perfect honesty in the teaching and tradition of his home there had never been any shams or sentimentalities for him to find out and abandon from boyhood his mothers hand had pointed steadily to the search for truth as the supreme ennobling fact in life she had never preached this to him never delivered discourses upon his fathers virtues but all her conversation and life was saturated with this idea compared with this atmosphere of high and sustained direction the intellectual and moral quality of the popes he saw was the quality of an agitated rag bag they had thought nothing out joined nothing together they seemed to believe everything and nothing they were neither religious nor irreligious neither moral nor adventurous in the place of a religion and tainting their entire atmosphere they had the decaying remains of a dead anglicanism it was clear they did not believe in its creed and as clear that they did not want to get rid of it it afforded them no guidance but only vague pretensions and the dismal exercises of silas root flourished in its shadows a fungus a postmortem activity of the soul none of them had any idea of what they were for or what their lives as a whole might mean they had no standards but only instincts and an instinctive fear of instincts pope wanted to be tremendously respected and complimented by everybody and get six per cent for his money mrs pope wanted things to go smoothly the young people had a general indisposition to do anything that might look bad and otherwise have a good time but neither marjorie nor any of them had any test for a good time and so they fluctuated in their conceptions of what they wanted from day to day now it was plessingtonian standards now carmel standards now the standards of agatha alimony now it was a stimulating novel now a gleam of æsthetic imaginativeness come heaven knows whence that dominated her mood he was beginning to understand all this at last and to see the need of coherence in marjories mood  he realized the unfairness of keeping his thoughts to himself the need of putting his case before her and making her realize their fatal and widening divergence he wanted to infect her with his scientific passion to give her his sense of the gravity of their practical difficulties he would sit amidst his neglected work in his laboratory framing explanatory phrases he would prepare the most lucid and complete statements and go about with these in his mind for days waiting for an opportunity of saying what he felt so urgently had to be said  but the things that seemed so luminous and effective in the laboratory had a curious way of fading and shrinking beside the bright colours of marjories bokhara hangings in the presence of little margharita pink and warm and entertaining in her bath or amidst the fluttering rustle of the afternoon teaparties that were now becoming frequent in his house and when he was alone with her he discovered they didnt talk now any moreexcept in terms of a constrained and formal affection  what had happened to them what was the matter between himself and marjorie that he couldnt even intimate his sense of their divergence he would have liked to discuss the whole thing with his mother but somehow that seemed disloyal to marjorie  one day they quarrelled  he came in about six in the afternoon jaded from the delivery of a suburban lecture and the consequent tedium of suburban travel and discovered marjorie examining the effect of a new picture which had replaced the german print of sunlit waves over the diningroom mantelpiece it was a painting in the postimpressionist manner and it had arrived after the close of the exhibition in weldon street at which marjorie had bought it she had bought it in obedience to a sudden impulse and its imminence had long weighed upon her conscience she had gone to the show with sydney flor and old mrs flor sydneys mother and a kind of excitement had come upon them at the idea of possessing this particular picture mrs flor had already bought three herbins and her daughter wanted to dissuade her from more but theyre so delightful said mrs flor youre overrunning your allowance said sydney disputing the point they made inquiries for the price and learnt that this bright epigram in colour was going beggingwas even offered at a reduction from the catalogue price a reduced price always had a strong appeal nowadays to marjories mind if you dont get it she said abruptly i shall  the transition from that attitude to ownership was amazingly rapid then nothing remained but to wait for the picture she had dreaded a mistake a blundering discord but now with the thing hung she could see her quick eye had not betrayed her it was a mass of reds browns purples and vivid greens and greys an effect of roof and brick house facing upon a dutch canal and it lit up the room and was echoed and reflected by all the rest of her courageous colour scheme like a coalfire amidst mahogany and metal it justified itself to her completely and she faced her husband with a certain confidence  hullo he cried  a new picture she said what do you think of it  what is it  a town or somethingnever mind look at the colour it heartens everything  trafford looked at the painting with a reluctant admiration  its brilliantand impudent hes an artistwhoever he is he hits the thing buti sayhow did you get it  i bought it  bought it good lord how much  oh ten guineas said marjorie with an affectation of ease it will be worth thirty in ten years time  traffords reply was to repeat ten guineas  their eyes met and there was singularly little tenderness in their eyes  it was priced at thirteen said marjorie ending a pause and with a sinking heart  trafford had left her side he walked to the window and sat down in a chair  i think this is too much he said and his voice had disagreeable notes in it she had never heard before i have just been earning two guineas at croydon of all places administering comminuted science to foolsand here i findthis exploit ten guineas worth of picture to say we cant afford it is just to waste a mild expression itsmad extravagance its waste of moneyitsohmonstrous disloyalty disloyalty he stared resentful at the cheerful unhesitating daubs of the picture for a moment its affected carelessness goaded him to fresh words he spoke in a tone of absolute hostility i think this winds me up to something he said youll have to give up your chequebook marjorie  give up my chequebook  he looked up at her and nodded there was a warm flush in her cheeks her lips panted apart and tears of disappointment and vexation were shining beautifully in her eyes she mingled the quality of an indignant woman with the distress and unreasonable resentment of a child  because ive bought this picture  can we go on like this he asked and felt how miserably he had bungled in opening this question that had been in his mind so long  but its beautiful she said  he disregarded that he felt now that he had to go on with these longpremeditated expostulations he was tired and dusty from his thirdclass carriage his spirit was tired and dusty and he said what he had to say without either breadth or power an undignified statement of personal grievances a mere complaint of the burthen of work that falls upon a man that she missed the high aim in him and all sense of the greatness they were losing had vanished from his thoughts he had too heavy a share of the common burthen and she pressed upon him unthinkingly that was all he could say he girded at her with a bitter and loveless truth it was none the less cruel that in her heart she knew these things he said were true but he went beyond justiceas every quarrelling human being does he called the things she had bought and the harmonies she had created this litter and rubbish for which i am wasting my life that stabbed into her pride acutely and deeply she knew anyhow that it wasnt so simple and crude as that it was not mere witlessness she contributed to their trouble she tried to indicate her sense of that but she had no power of ordered reasoning she made futile interruptions she was inexpressive of anything but emotion she felt gagged against his flow of indignant hostile words they blistered her  suddenly she went to her little desk in the corner unlocked it with trembling hands snatched her chequebook out of a heap of still unsettled bills and having locked that anticlimax safe away again turned upon him here it is she said and stood poised for a moment then she flung down the little narrow grey covernearly empty it was of cheques on the floor before him  take it she cried take it i never asked you to give it me  a memory of orta and its reeds and sunshine and love rose like a luminous mist between them  she ran weeping from the room  he leapt to his feet as the door closed marjorie he cried  but she did not hear him   § 3  the disillusionment about marriage which had discovered trafford a thwarted overworked and worried man had revealed marjorie with time on her hands superabundant imaginative energy and no clear intimation of any occupation with them as with thousands of young couples in london today the breadwinner was overworked and the spending partners duty was chiefly the negative one of not spending you cannot consume your energies merely in not spending money do what she could marjorie could not contrive to make house and child fill the waking hours she was far too active and irritable a being to be beneficial company all day for genial bubbleblowing little margharita she could play with that young lady and lead her into ecstasies of excitement and delight and she could see with an almost instinctive certainty when anything was going wrong but for the rest that little life reposed far more beneficially upon the passive acquiescence of may her pink and wholesome nurse and the household generally was in the hands of a trustworthy cookgeneral who maintained a tolerable routine marjorie did not dare to have an idea about food or domestic arrangements if she touched that routine so much as with her little finger it sent up the bills she could knock off butcher and greengrocer and do every scrap of household work that she could touch in a couple of hours a day she tried to find some work to fill her leisure she suggested to trafford that she might help him by writing up his science notes from rough pencil memoranda but when it became clear that the first step to her doing this would be the purchase of a remington typewriter and a special low table to carry it he became bluntly discouraging she thought of literary work and sat down one day to write a short story and earn guineas and was surprised to find that she knew nothing of any sort of human being about whom she could invent a story she tried a cheap subscription at mudies and novels and they filled her with a thirst for events she tried needlework and found her best efforts aesthetically feeble and despicable and that her mind prowled above the silks and colours like a hungry wolf  the early afternoons were the worst time from two to four before calling began the devil was given great power over marjories early afternoon she could even envy her former home life then and reflect that there at any rate one had a chance of a game or a quarrel with daffy or syd or rom or theodore she would pull herself together and go out for a walk and whichever way she went there were shops and shops and shops a glittering array of tempting opportunities for spending money sometimes she would give way to spending exactly as a struggling drunkard decides to tipple she would fix on some object some object trivial and a little rare and not too costly as being neededwhen she knew perfectly well it wasnt neededand choose the most remotest shops and display the exactest insistence upon her requirements sometimes she would get home from these raids without buying at all after four the worst of the day was over one could call on people or people might telephone and follow up with a call and there was a chance of trafford coming home  one day at the carmels she found herself engaged in a vigorous flirtation with young carmel she hadnt noticed it coming on but there she was in a windowseat talking quite closely to him he said he was writing a play a wonderful passionate play about st francis and only she could inspire and advise him wasnt there some afternoon in the week when she sat and sewed so that he might come and sit by her and read to her and talk to her he made his request with a certain confidence but it filled her with a righteous panic she pulled him up with an abruptness that was almost inartistic on her way home she was acutely ashamed of herself this was the first time she had let any man but trafford think he might be interesting to her but once or twice on former occasions she had been on the verge of such provocative intimations this sort of thing anyhow mustnt happen  but if she didnt dress with any distinctionbecause of the costand didnt flirt and trail men in her wake what was she to do at the afternoon gatherings which were now her chief form of social contact what was going to bring people to her house she knew that she was more than ordinarily beautiful and that she could talk well but that does not count for much if you are rather dowdy and quite uneventfully virtuous  it became the refrain of all her thoughts that she must find something to do  there remained movements  she might take up a movement she was a rather exceptionally good public speaker only her elopement and marriage had prevented her being president of her college debating society if she devoted herself to some movement she would be free to devise an ostentatiously simple dress for herself and stick to it and she would be able to give her little house a significance of her own and present herself publicly against what is perhaps quite the best of all backgrounds for a goodlooking clearvoiced selfpossessed woman a platform yes she had to go in for a movement  she reviewed the chief contemporary movements much as she might have turned over dress fabrics in a drapers shop weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each  london of course is always full of movements essentially they are absorbents of superfluous feminine energy they have a common flavour of progress and revolutionary purpose and common features in abundant meetings officials and organization generally few are expensive and still fewer produce any tangible results in the world they direct themselves at the most various ends the poor that favourite butt either as a whole or in such typical sections as the indigent invalid or the indigent aged the young public health the womans cause the prevention of animal food antivivisection the gratuitous advertisement of shakespear that neglected poet novel but genteel modifications of medical or religious practice dress reform the politer aspects of socialism the encouragement of æronautics universal military service garden suburbs domestic arts proportional representation duodecimal arithmetic and the liberation of the drama they range in size and importance from campaigns on a plessingtonian scale to sober little intellectual beckingham things that arrange to meet halfyearly and die quietly before the second assembly if heaven by some miracle suddenly gave every movement in london all it professed to want our world would be standing on its head and everything would be extremely unfamiliar and disconcerting but as mr roosevelt once remarked the justifying thing about life is the effort and not the goal and few movements involve any real and impassioned struggle to get to the ostensible object they exist as an occupation they exercise the intellectual and moral activities without undue disturbance of the normal routines of life in the days when everybody was bicycling an ingenious mechanism called hackers home bicycle used to be advertised hackers home bicycle was a stand bearing small rubber wheels upon which one placed ones bicycle properly equipped with a cyclometer in such a way that it could be mounted and ridden without any sensible forward movement whatever in bad weather or when the state of the roads made cycling abroad disagreeable hackers home bicycle could be placed in front of an open window and ridden furiously for any length of time whenever the rider tired he could descendcomfortably at home againand examine the cyclometer to see how far he had been in exactly the same way the ordinary london movement gives scope for the restless and progressive impulse in human nature without the risk of personal entanglements or any inconvenient disturbance of the milieu  marjorie considered the movements about her she surveyed the accessible aspects of socialism but that old treasurehouse of constructive suggestion had an effect like a rich château which had been stormed and looted by a mob for a time the proposition that we are all socialists nowadays had prevailed the blackened and discredited frame remained the contents were scattered aunt plessington had a few pieces the tory democrats had taken freely the liberals were in possession of a hastily compiled collection there wasnt she perceived and there never had been a socialist movement the socialist idea which had now become part of the general consciousness had always been too big for polite domestication she weighed aunt plessington too in the balance and found her not so much wanting indeed as excessive she felt that a movement with aunt plessington in it couldnt possibly offer even elbowroom for anybody else philanthropy generally she shunned the movements that aim at getting poor people into rooms and shouting at them in an improving authoritative way aroused an instinctive dislike in her her sense of humour again would not let her patronize shakespear or the stage or raise the artistic level of the country by means of greendyed deal and the influence of trafford on her mind debarred her from attempting the physical and moral regeneration of humanity by means of beans and nut butter it was indeed rather by the elimination of competing movements than by any positive preference that she found herself declining at last towards agatha alimonys section of the suffrage movement it was one of the less militant sections but it held more meetings and passed more resolutions than any two others  one day trafford returning from an afternoon of forced and disappointing work in his laboratoryhis mind had been steadfastly sluggish and inelasticdiscovered marjories dining room crowded with hats and all the rustle and colour which plays so large a part in constituting contemporary feminine personality buzard the feminist writer and a young man just down from cambridge who had written a decadent poem were the only men present the chairs were arranged meetingfashion but a little irregularly to suggest informality the postimpressionist picture was a rosy benediction on the gathering and at a table in the window sat mrs pope in the chair looking quietly tactful in an unusually becoming bonnet supported by her daughter and agatha alimony marjorie was in a simple gown of blueishgrey hatless amidst a froth of foolish bows and feathers and she looked not only beautiful and dignified but deliberately and conscientiously patient until she perceived the new arrival then he noted she was a little concerned for him and made some futile sign he did not comprehend the meeting was debating the behaviour of women at the approaching census and a small earnest palefaced lady with glasses was standing against the fireplace with a crumpled envelope covered with pencil notes in her hand and making a speech trafford wanted his tea badly but he had not the wit to realize that his study had been converted into a refreshment room for the occasion he hesitated and seated himself near the doorway and so he was caught he couldnt he felt get away and seem to slight a woman who was giving herself the pains of addressing him  the small lady in glasses was giving a fancy picture of the mind of mr asquith and its attitude to the suffrage movement and telling with a sort of inspired intimacy just how mr asquith had hoped to bully women down and just how their various attempts to bring home to him the eminent reasonableness of their sex by breaking his windows interrupting his meetings booing at him in the streets and threatening his life had time after time baffled this arrogant hope there had been many signs lately that mr asquiths heart was failing him now here was a new thing to fill him with despair when mr asquith learnt that women refused to be counted in the census then at least she was convinced he must give in when he gave in it would not be longshe had her information upon good authoritybefore they got the vote so what they had to do was not to be counted in the census that was their paramount duty at the present time the women of england had to say quietly but firmly to the census man when he came round no we dont count in an election and we wont count now thank you no one could force a woman to fill in a census paper she didnt want to and for her own part said the little woman with the glasses shed starve first applause for her own part she was a householder with a census paper of her own and across that she was going to write quite plainly and simply what she thought of mr asquith some of those present wouldnt have census papers to fill up they would be sent to the man the socalled head of the house but the wspu had foreseen that each householder had to write down the particulars of the people who slept in his house on sunday night or who arrived home before midday on monday the reply of the women of england must be not to sleep in a house that night where census papers were properly filled and not to go home until the following afternoon all through that night the women of england must be abroad she herself was prepared and her house would be ready there would be coffee and refreshments enough for an unlimited number of refugees there would be twenty or thirty sofas and mattresses and piles of blankets for those who chose to sleep safe from all counting in every quarter of london there would be houses of refuge like hers and so they would make mr asquiths census fail as it deserved to fail as every census would fail until women managed these affairs in a sensible way for she supposed they were all agreed that only women could manage these things in a sensible way that was her contribution to this great and important question applause amidst which the small lady with the glasses resumed her seat  trafford glanced doorward but before he could move another speaker was in possession of the room this was a very young tall fair roundshouldered girl who held herself with an unnatural rigidity fixed her eyes on the floor just in front of the chairwoman and spoke with knitted brows and an effect of extreme strain she remarked that some people did not approve of this proposed boycott of the census she hung silent for a moment as if ransacking her mind for something mislaid and then proceeded to remark that she proposed to occupy a few moments in answering that objectionif it could be called an objection they said that spoiling the census was an illegitimate extension of the woman movement well she objectedshe objected fiercelyto every word of that phrase nothing was an illegitimate extension of the woman movement nothing could be applause that was the very principle they had been fighting for all along so that examined in this way this socalled objection resolved itself into a mere question begging phrase nothing more and her reply therefore to those who made it was that they were begging the question and however well that might do for men it would certainly not do they would find for women applause for the freshly awakened consciousness of women further applause this was a war in which quarter was neither asked nor given if it were not so things might be different she remained silent after that for the space of twenty seconds perhaps and then remarked that that seemed to be all she had to say and sat down amidst loud encouragement  then with a certain dismay trafford saw his wife upon her feet he was afraid of the effect upon himself of what she was going to say but he need have had no reason for his fear marjorie was a seasoned debater selfpossessed with a voice very well controlled and a complete mastery of that elaborate appearance of reasonableness which is so essential to good public speaking she could speak far better than she could talk and she startled the meeting in her opening sentence by declaring that she meant to stay at home on the census night and supply her husband with every scrap of information he hadnt got already that might be needed to make the return an entirely perfect return marked absence of applause  she proceeded to avow her passionate interest in the feminist movement of which this agitation for the vote was merely the symbol a voice no no one could be more aware of the falsity of womans position at the present time than she wasshe seemed to be speaking right across the room to traffordthey were neither pets nor partners but something between the two now indulged like spoilt children now blamed like defaulting partners constantly provoked to use the arts of their sex constantly mischievous because of that provocation she caught her breath and stopped for a moment as if she had suddenly remembered the meeting intervening between herself and trafford no she said there was no more ardent feminist and suffragist than herself in the room she wanted the vote and everything it implied with all her heart with all her heart but every way to get a thing wasnt the right way and she felt with every fibre of her being that this petulant hostility to the census was a wrong way and an inconsistent way and likely to be an unsuccessful wayone that would lose them the sympathy and help of just that class of men they should look to for support the cultivated and scientific men a voice do we want them what was the commonest charge made by the man in the street against womenthat they were unreasonable and unmanageable that it was their way to get things by crying and making an irrelevant fuss and here they were as a body doing that very thing let them think what the census and all that modern organization of vital statistics of which it was the central feature stood for it stood for order for the replacement of guesses and emotional generalization by a clear knowledge of facts for the replacement of instinctive and violent methods by which women had everything to lose a voice no by reason and knowledge and selfrestraint by which women had everything to gain to her the advancement of science the progress of civilization and the emancipation of womanhood were nearly synonymous terms at any rate they were different phases of one thing they were different aspects of one wider purpose when they struck at the census she felt they struck at themselves she glanced at trafford as if she would convince him that this was the real voice of the suffrage movement and sat down amidst a brief polite applause that warmed to rapture as agatha alimony the deepvoiced stirring agatha rose to reply  miss alimony who was wearing an enormous hat with three nodding ostrich feathers a purple bow a gold buckle and numerous minor ornaments of various origin and substance said they had all of them listened with the greatest appreciation and sympathy to the speech of their hostess their hostess was a newcomer to the movement she knew she might say this without offence and was passing through a phase an early phase through which many of them had passed this was the phase of trying to take a reasonable view of an unreasonable situation applause their hostess had spoken of science and no doubt science was a great thing but there was something greater than science and that was the ideal it was womans place to idealize sooner or later their hostess would discover as they had all discovered that it was not to science but the ideal that women must look for freedom consider she said the scientific men of today consider for example sir james crichtonbrowne the physiologist was he on their side on the contrary he said the most unpleasant things about them on every occasion he went out of his way to say them or consider sir almroth wright did he speak well of women or sir ray lankester the biologist who was the chief ornament of the antisuffrage society or sir roderick dover the physicist whoforgetting madame curie a far more celebrated physicist than himself she ventured to say applause had recently gone outside his province altogether to abuse feminine research there were your scientific men mrs trafford had said their anticensus campaign would annoy scientific men well under the circumstances she wanted to annoy scientific men applause she wanted to annoy everybody until women got the vote loud applause the more annoying they were the better when the whole world was impressed by the idea that voteless women were an intolerable nuisance then there would cease to be voteless women enthusiasm mr asquith had said  and so on for quite a long time  buzard rose out of waves of subsiding emotion buzard was a slender longnecked stalkshaped man with gilt glasses uneasy movements and a hypersensitive manner he didnt so much speak as thrill with thought vibrations he spoke like an entranced but still quite gentlemanly sibyl after agathas deep trumpet calls he sounded like a solo on the piccolo he picked out all his more important words with a little stress as though he gave them capitals he said their hostesss remarks had set him thinking he thought it was possible to stew the scientific argument in its own juice there was something he might call the factuarial estimate of values well it was a high factuarial value on their side in his opinion at any rate when anthropologists came and told him that the primitive human society was a matriarchate but it wasnt said trafford to himself it had a high factuarial value when they assured him that every one of the great primitive inventions was made by a woman and that it was to women they owed fire and the early epics and sagas good lord said trafford it had a high factuarial value when they not only asserted but proved that for thousands of years and perhaps for hundreds of thousands of years women had been in possession of articulate speech before men rose to that level of intelligence  it occurred suddenly to trafford that he could go now that it would be better to go that indeed he must go it was no doubt necessary that his mind should have to work in the same world as buzards mental processes but at any rate those two sets of unsympathetic functions need not go on in the same room something might give way he got up and with those elaborate efforts to be silent that lead to the violent upsetting of chairs got himself out of the room and into the passage and was at once rescued by the sympathetic cookgeneral in her most generalized form and given fresh tea in his studywhich impressed him as being catastrophically disarranged   § 4  when marjorie was at last alone with him she found him in a state of extreme mental stimulation your speech he said was all right i didnt know you could speak like that marjorie but it soared like the dove above the waters waters i never heard such a flood of rubbish you know its a mistake to mass women it brings out something silly it affected buzard as badly as any one the extraordinary thing is they have a case if only theyd be quiet why did you get them together  its our local branch  yes but why  well if they talk about thingsdiscussions like this clear up their minds  discussion it wasnt discussion  oh it was a beginning  chatter of that sort isnt the beginning of discussion its the end its the deathrattle nobody was meeting the thoughts of any one i admit buzard whos a man talked the worst rubbish of all that primitive matriarchate of his so it isnt sex ive noticed before that the men in this movement of yours are worse than the women it isnt sex its something else its a foolishness its a sort of irresponsible looseness he turned on her gravely you ought not to get all these people here its contagious before you know it youll find your own mind liquefy and become enthusiastic and slop about youll begin to talk monomania about mr asquith  but its a great movement rag even if incidentally they say and do silly things  my dear arent i feminist dont i want women fine and sane and responsible dont i want them to have education to handle things to vote like men and bear themselves with the gravity of men and these meetingsall hat and flutter these displays of weak untrained hysterical vehemence these gatherings of openmouthed impressionable young girls to be trained in incoherence you cant go on with it  marjorie regarded him quietly for a moment i must go on with something she said  well not this  then what  something sane  tell me what  it must come out of yourself  marjorie thought sullenly for a moment nothing comes out of myself she said  i dont think you realize a bit what my life has become she went on how much im like some one whos been put in a pleasant highclass prison  this house its your own  it doesnt give me an hours mental occupation in the day its all very well to say i might do more in it i cantwithout absurdity or expenditure i cant send the girl away and start scrubbing i cant make jam or do ornamental needlework the shops do it better and cheaper and i havent been trained to it ive been trained not to do it ive been brought up on games and schoolbooks and fed on mixed ideas i cant sit down and pacify myself with a needle as women used to do besides i not only detest doing needlework but i hate itthe sort of thing a woman of my kind does anyhowwhen its done im no artist im not sufficiently interested in outside things to spend my time in serious systematic reading and after four or five novelsoh these meetings are better than that you see youve got a lifetoo much of iti havent got enough i wish almost i could sleep away half the day oh i want something real rag something more than ive got a sudden inspiration came to her will you let me come to your laboratory and work with you  she stopped abruptly she caught up her own chance question and pointed it at him a vitally important challenge will you let me come to your laboratory and work she repeated  trafford thought no he said  why not  because im in love with you i cant think of my work when youre about and youre too much behind oh my dear dont you see how youre behind he paused ive been soaking in this stuff of mine for ten long years  yes assented marjorie flatly  he watched her downcast face and then it lifted to him with a helpless appeal in her eyes and lift in her voice but look here rag she criedwhat on earth am i to do   § 5  at least there came out of these discussions one thing a phrase a purpose which was to rule the lives of the traffords for some years it expressed their realization that instinct and impulse had so far played them false that life for all its rich gifts of mutual happiness wasnt adjusted between them weve got they said to talk all this out between us weve got to work this out they didnt mean to leave things at a misfit and that was certainly their present relation they were already at the problem of their joint lives like a tailor with his pins and chalk marjorie hadnt rejected a humorist and all his works in order to decline at last to the humorous view of life that rather stupid rather pathetic grinandbearit attitude compounded in incalculable proportions of goodwill evasion indolence slovenliness and nevertheless spite masquerading indeed as jesting comment which supplies the fabric of everyday life for untold thousands of educated middleclass people she hated the misfit she didnt for a moment propose to pretend that the ungainly twisted sleeve the puckered back was extremely jolly and funny she had married with a passionate anticipation of things fitting and fine and it was her nature in great matters as in small to get what she wanted strenuously before she counted the cost about both their minds there was something sharp and unrelenting and if marjorie had been disposed to take refuge from facts in swathings of aesthetic romanticism whatever covering she contrived would have been torn to rags very speedily by that fierce and steely veracity which swung down out of the laboratory into her home  one may want to talk things out long before one hits upon the phrases that will open up the matter  there were two chief facts in the case between them and so far they had looked only one in the face the fact that marjorie was unemployed to a troublesome and distressing extent and that there was nothing in her nature or training to supply and something in their circumstances and relations to prevent any adequate use of her energies with the second fact neither of them cared to come to close quarters as yet and neither as yet saw very distinctly how it was linked to the first and that was the steady excess of her expenditure over their restricted means she was secretly surprised at her own weakness week by week and month by month they were spending all his income and eating into that little accumulation of capital that had once seemed so sufficient against the world  and here it has to be told that although trafford knew that marjorie had been spending too much money he still had no idea of just how much money she had spent she was doing her utmost to come to an understanding with him and at the same timei dont explain it i dont excuse itshe was keeping back her bills from him keeping back urgent second and third and fourth demands that she had no chequebook now to stave off even by the most partial satisfaction it kept her awake at nights that catastrophic explanation that all unsuspected by trafford hung over their attempts at mutual elucidation it kept her awake but she could not bring it to the speaking point and she clung in spite of her own intelligence to a persuasion that after they had got something really settled and defined then it would be time enough to broach the particulars of this second divergence  talking ones relations over isnt particularly easy between husband and wife at any time we are none of us so sure of one another as to risk loose phrases or make experiments in expression in matters so vital there is inevitably an excessive caution on the one hand and an abnormal sensitiveness to hints and implications on the other marjories bills were only an extreme instance of these unavoidable suppressions that always occur moreover when two people are continuously together it is amazingly hard to know when and where to begin where intercourse is unbroken it is as a matter of routine being constantly interrupted you cannot broach these broad personalities while you are getting up in the morning or over the breakfasttable while you make the coffee or when you meet again after a multitude of small events at tea or in the evening when one is rather tired and trivial after the work of the day then miss margharita trafford permitted no sustained analysis of life in her presence she synthesized things fallaciously but for the time convincingly she insisted that life wasnt a thing you discussed but pink and soft and jolly which you crowed at and laughed at and addressed as goo even without margharita there were occasions when the traffords were a forgetfulness to one another after an ear has been pinched or a hand has been run through a mans hair or a pretty bare shoulder kissed all sorts of broader interests lapse into a temporary oblivion they found discussion much more possible when they walked together a walk seemed to take them out of the everyday sequence isolate them from their household abstract them a little from one another they set out one extravagant spring sunday to great missenden and once in spring also they discovered the waterlow park on each occasion they seemed to get through an enormous amount of talking but the great missenden walk was all mixed up with a sweet keen wind and beechwoods just shot with spring green and bursting hedges and the extreme earliness of honeysuckle which trafford noted for the first time and a clamorous rejoicing of birds and in the waterlow park there was a great discussion of why the yellow crocus comes before white and purple and the closest examination of the manner in which daffodils and narcissi thrust their green noses out of the garden beds also they found the ugly illserved aggressively propagandist nonalcoholic refreshmentroom in that gracious old house a scandal and disappointment and trafford scolded at the stupidity of officialdom that can control so fine a thing so ill  though they talked on these walks they were still curiously evasive indeed they were afraid of each other they kept falling away from their private thoughts and intentions they generalized they discussed marriage and george gissing and bernard shaw and the suffrage movement and the agitation for the reform of the divorce laws they pursued imaginary cases into distant thickets of contingency remotely far from the personal issues between them   § 6  one day came an incident that marjorie found wonderfully illuminating trafford had a fit of rage stung by an unexpected irritation he forgot himself as people say and swore and was almost physically violent and the curious thing was that so he lit up things for her as no premeditated attempt of his had ever done  a copy of the scientific bulletin fired the explosion he sat down at the breakfasttable with the heaviness of a rather overworked and worried man tasted his coffee tore open a letter and crumpled it with his hand turned to the bulletin regarded its list of contents with a start opened it read for a minute and expressed himself with an extraordinary heat of manner in these amazing and unprecedented words  oh damnation and damnation  then he shied the paper into the corner of the room and pushed his plate from him  damn the whole scheme of things he said and met the blank amazement of marjories eye  behrens he said with an air of explanation  behrens she echoed with a note of inquiry  hes doing my stuff  he sat darkling for a time and then hit the table with his fist so hard that the breakfast things seemed to jump togetherto marjories infinite amazement i cant stand it he said  she waited some moments i dont understand she began what has he done  oh was traffords answer he got up recovered the crumpled paper and stood reading fool and thief he said  marjorie was amazed beyond measure she felt as though she had been effaced from traffords life ugh he cried and slapped back the bulletin into the corner with quite needless violence he became aware of marjorie again  hes doing my work he said  and then as if he completed the explanation and ive got to be in croydon by halfpast ten to lecture to a pack of spinsters and duffers because theyre too stupid to get the stuff from books its all in booksevery bit of it  he paused and went on in tones of unendurable wrong it isnt as though he was doing it right he isnt he cant hes a fool hes a clever greedy dishonest fool with a twist oh the pile the big pile of silly muddled technicalities hes invented already the solemn mess hes making of it and there he is i cant get ahead of him i cant get at him ive got no time ive got no room or leisure to swing my mind in oh curse these engagements curse all these silly fretting entanglements of lecture and article i never get the time i cant get the time i cant get my mind clear im worried im badgered and meanwhile behrens  is he discovering what you want to discover  behrens no hes going through the breaches i made hes guessing out what i meant to do and hes getting it set out all wrongmisleading terminologydistinctions made in the wrong place oh the fool he is  but afterwards  afterwards i may spend my liferemoving the obstacles hes made hell be established and i shant you dont know anything

master of that stuff i had at any rate no one can do what i can do there and when i find myselfoh shut out shut out i come near raving as i think of it i want to rave again he paused then with a swift transition i suppose id better eat some breakfast is that egg boiled  she gave him an egg brought his coffee put things before him seated herself at the table for a little while he ate in silence then he cursed behrens  look here she said bad as i am youve got to reason with me rag i didnt know all this i didnt understand  i dont know what to do  what is there to do  ive got to do something im beginning to see things its just as though everything had become clear suddenly she was weeping oh my dear i want to help you i have so wanted to help you always and its come to this  but its not your

everything to make life beautiful for you  well havent you he thrust out a hand she did not take  ive broken your back she said  an unwonted resolution came into her face her lips whitened dont you know rag she said forcing herself to speakdont you guess you dont know half in that bureau therein there its stuffed with bills unpaid bills  she was weeping with no attempt to wipe the streaming tears away terror made the expression of her wet face almost fierce bills she repeated more than a hundred pounds still yes now now  he drew back stared at her and with no trace of personal animus like one who hears of a common disaster remarked with a quiet emphasis oh damn  i know she said damn and met his eyes there was a long silence between them she produced a handkerchief and wiped her eyes thats what i amount to she said  its your silly upbringing he said after a long pause  and my silly self  she stood up unlocked and opened her littered desk turned and held out the key to him  why he asked  take it you gave me a chequebook of my own and a corner of my own and theythey are just ambushesagainst you  he shook his head  take it said marjorie with quiet insistence  he obeyed she stood with her eyes on the crumpled heap of bills they were not even tidily arranged that seemed to her now an extreme aggravation of her offence  i ought to be sent to the chemists she remarked as one sends a worthless cat  trafford weighed this proposition soberly for some moments youre a bother marjorie he said with his eyes on the desk no end of a bother id better have those bills  he looked at her stood up put his hands on her shoulders drew her to him and kissed her forehead he did it without passion without tenderness with something like resignation in his manner she clung to him tightly as though by clinging she could warm and soften him  rag she whispered all my heart is yours i want to help you and this is what i have done  i know he saidalmost grimly  he repeated his kiss  then he seemed to explode again gods he cried look at the clock i shall miss that croydon lecture he pushed her from him where are my boots   § 7  marjorie spent the forenoon and the earlier part of the afternoon repeating and reviewing this conversation her mind was full of the long disregarded problem of her husbands state of mind she thought with a sympathetic astonishment of his swearing of his startling blow upon the table she hadnt so far known he could swear but this was the real thing the relief of vehement and destructive words his voice saying damnation and damnation echoed and reechoed in her ears somehow she understood that as she had never understood any sober statement of his case such women as marjorie i think have an altogether keener understanding of people who have lost control of themselves than they have of reasoned cases perhaps that is because they themselves always reserve something when they state a reasoned case  she went on to the apprehension of a change in him that hitherto she had not permitted herself to seea change in his attitude to her there had been a time when she had seemed able without an effort to nestle inside his heart now she felt distinctly for the first time that that hadnt happened she had instead a sense of her embrace sliding over a rather deliberately contracted exterior of course he had been in a hurry  she tried to follow him on his journey to croydon now hed have just passed out of london bridge what was he thinking and feeling about her in the train now he would be going into the place wherever it was where he gave his lecture did he think of behrens and curse her under his breath as he entered that tiresome room  it seemed part of the prevailing inconvenience of life that daffy should see fit to pay an afternoon call  marjorie heard the sobs and uproar of an arrested motor and glanced discreetly from the window to discover the dark green car with its greenclad chauffeur which now adorned her sisters life and which might under different circumstances have adorned her own wilkinshis name was wilkins his hair was sandy and his expression discreet and he afforded material for much quiet humorous observationdescended smartly and opened the door daffy appeared in black velvet with a huge black fur muff and an air of being unaware that there were such things as windows in the world  it was just four and the cookgeneral who ought to have been now in her housemaids phase was still upstairs divesting herself of her more culinary characteristics marjorie opened the door  hullo old daffy she said  hullo old madge and there was an exchange of sisterly kisses and a mutual inspection  nothing wrong asked daffy surveying her  wrong  you look pale andtired about the eyes said daffy leading the way into the drawingroom thought you might be a bit off it thats all no offence madge  im all right said marjorie getting her back to the light want a holiday perhaps hows every one  all right were off to lake garda next week this new play has taken it out of will tremendously he wants a rest and fresh surroundings its to be the biggest piece of work hes doneso far and its straining him and people worry him here receptions first nights dinners speeches hes so neat you know in his speeches but it wastes him he wants to get away hows rag  busy  lecturing  and his research of course  oh of course hows the babe  just in come up and see the little beast daffy it is getting so pretty and it talks  margharita dominated intercourse for a time she was one of those tactful infants who exactly resemble their fathers and exactly resemble their mothers and have a charm and individuality quite distinctly their own and she was now beginning to converse with startling enterprise and intelligence  big big bog she said at the sight of daffy  remembers you said marjorie  bog go tata said margharita  there said marjorie and may the nurse in the background smiled unlimited appreciation  bably said margharita  thats herself said marjorie falling on her knees she talks like this all day oh de sweetums den was it  daffy made amiable gestures and canarylike noises with her lips and margharita responded jovially  you darling cried marjorie you delight of life kneeling by the cot and giving the crowing healthy little mite a passionate hug  its really the nicest of babies daffy conceded and reflected  i dont know what i should do with a kiddy said daffy as the infant worship came to an end im really glad we havent oneyet hed love it i know but it would be a burthen in some ways they are a tie as he says the next few years means so much for him of course here his reputation is immense and hes known in germany and there are translations into russian but hes still got to conquer america and he isnt really well known yet in france they read him of course and buy him in america but theyrerestive oh i do so wish theyd give him the nobel prize madge and have done with it it would settle everything still as he says we mustnt think of thatyet anyhow he isnt venerable enough its doubtful he thinks that they would give the nobel prize to any humorist now that mark twain is dead mark twain was different you see because of the german emperor and all that white hair and everything  at this point margharita discovered that the conversation had drifted away from herself and it was only when they got downstairs again that daffy could resume the thread of magnets career which had evidently become the predominant interest in her life she brought out all the worst elements of marjories nature and their sisterly relationship there were moments when it became nakedly apparent that she was magnifying magnet to belittle trafford marjorie did her best to counterbrag she played her chief card in the f r s  they always ask will to the royal society dinner threw out daffy but of course he cant always go hes asked to so many things  five years earlier marjorie would have kicked her shins for that  instead she asked pointedly offensively if magnet was any balder  hes not really bald said daffy unruffled and went on to discuss the advisability of a second motor carpurely for town use i tell him i dont want it said daffy but hes frightfully keen upon getting one   § 8  when daffy had at last gone marjorie went back into traffords study and stood on the hearthrug regarding its appointments with something of the air of one who awakens from a dream she had developed a new appalling thought was daffy really a better wife than herself it was dawning upon marjorie that she hadnt been doing the right thing by her husband and she was as surprised as if it had been suddenly brought home to her that she was neglecting margharita this was her husbands studyand it showed just a little dusty in the afternoon sunshine and everything about it denied the pretensions of serene sustained work that she had always made to herself here were the crumpled galley proofs of his science notes here were unanswered letters there she dare not touch them were computations under a glass paperweight what did they amount to now on the table under the window were back numbers of the scientific bulletin in a rather untidy pile and on the footstool by the armchair she had been accustomed to sit at his feet when he stayed at home to work and look into the fire and watch him furtively and sometimes give way to an overmastering tenderness and make love to him the thought of magnet pampered fenced around revered in his industrious tiresome repetitions variations dramatizations and so forth of the halfdozen dry little old jokes which the british public accepted as his characteristic offering and rewarded him for so highly contrasted vividly with her new realization of traffords thankless work and worried face  and she loved him she loved himso she told herself in the presence of all these facts and without a shadow of doubt in her mind that all she wanted in the world was to make him happy  it occurred to her as a rather drastic means to this end that she might commit suicide  she had already gone some way in the composition of a touching letter of farewell to him containing a luminous analysis of her own defects before her commonsense swept away this imaginative exercise  meanwhile as if it had been working at her problem all the time that this exciting farewell epistle had occupied the foreground of her thoughts her natural lucidity emerged with the manifest conclusion that she had to alter her way of living she had been extraordinarily regardless of him she only began to see that and now she had to take up the problem of his necessities her selfexamination now that it had begun was thorough she had always told herself before that she had made a most wonderful and beautiful little home for him but had she made it for him had he as a matter of fact ever wanted it except that he was glad to have it through her no doubt it had given him delight and happiness it had been a marvellous little casket of love for them but how far did that outweigh the burthen and limitation it had imposed upon him she had always assumed he was beyond measure grateful to her for his home in spite of all her bills but was he it was like sticking a knife into herself to ask that but she was now in a phase heroic enough for the taskwas he she had always seen herself as the giver of bounties greatest bounty of all was margharita she had faced pains and terrors and the shadow of death to give him margharita now with daffys illuminating conversation in her mind she could turn the light upon a haunting doubt that had been lurking in the darkness for a long time had he really so greatly wanted margharita had she ever troubled to get to the bottom of that before hadnt she as a matter of fact wanted margharita ten thousand times more than he had done hadnt she in effect imposed margharita upon him as she had imposed her distinctive and delightful home upon him regardlessly because these things were the natural and legitimate developments of herself  these things were not his ends  had she hitherto ever really cared what his ends might be  a phrase she had heard abundantly enough in current feminist discussion recurred to her mind the economic dependence of women and now for the first time it was charged with meaning she had imposed these things upon him not because she loved him but because these things that were the expansions and consequences of her love for him were only obtainable through him a woman gives herself to a man out of love and remains clinging parasitically to him out of necessity was there no way of evading that necessity  for a time she entertained dreams of marvellous social reconstructions suppose the community kept all its women suppose all property in homes and furnishings and children vested in them that was marjories version of that idea of the endowment of womanhood which has been creeping into contemporary thought during the last two decades then every woman would be a princess to the man she loved he became more definitely personal suppose she herself was rich then she could play the princess to trafford she could have him free unencumbered happy and her lover then indeed her gifts would be gifts and all her instincts and motives would but crown his unhampered life she could not go on from that idea she lapsed into a golden reverie from which she was roused by the clock striking five  in half an hour perhaps trafford would be home again she could at least be so much of a princess as to make his home sweet for his homecoming there should be tea in here where callers did not trouble she glanced at an empty copper vase it ached there was no light in the room there would be just time to dash out into high street and buy some flowers for it before he came   § 9  spring and a renewed and deepened love for her husband were in marjories blood her mind worked rapidly during the next few days and presently she found herself clearly decided upon her course of action she had to pull herself together and help him and if that meant a spartan and strenuous way of living then manifestly she must be spartan and strenuous she must put an end once for all to her recurrent domestic deficits and since this could only be done by getting rid of may she must get rid of may and mind the child herself every day thank heaven margharita became more intelligent more manageable and more interesting then she must also make a far more systematic and thorough study of domestic economy than she had hitherto done and run the shopping and housekeeping on severer lines she bought fruit carelessly they had far too many joints she never seemed able to restrain herself when it came to flowers and in the evenings which would necessarily be very frequently lonely evenings if traffords researches were to go on she would typewrite and either acquire great speed at that or learn shorthand and so save traffords present expenditure on a typist that unfortunately would mean buying a typewriter  she found one afternoon in a twopenny bookbox with which she was trying to allay her craving for purchases a tattered little pamphlet entitled proposals for the establishment of an order of samurai which fell in very exactly with her mood the title dated it carried her mind back to her middle girlhood and the defeats of kuropatki and the futile earnest phase in english thought which followed the boer war the order was to be a sort of selfappointed nobility serving the world it shone with the light of a generous dawn but cast i fear the shadow of the prig its end was the agenda club she read and ceased to readand dreamt  the project unfolded the picture of a new method of conduct to her austere yet picturesque and richly noble these samurai it was intimated were to lead lives of hard discipline and high effort under selfimposed rule and restraint they were to stand a little apart from the excitements and temptations of everyday life to eat sparingly drink water resort greatly to selfcriticism and selfexamination and harden their spirits by severe and dangerous exercises they were to dress simply work hard and be the conscious and deliberate salt of the world they were to walk among mountains incidentally great power was to be given them such systematic effort and selfcontrol as this seemed to marjorie to give just all she wasnt and needed to be to save her life and traffords from a common disaster  it particularly appealed to her that they were to walk among mountains  but it is hard to make a change in the colour of ones life amidst the routine one has already established about oneself in the house that is grooved by ones weaknesses amidst hangings and ornaments living and breathing with the life of an antagonistic and yet insidiously congenial ideal a great desire came upon marjorie to go away with trafford for a time out of their everyday life into strange and cool and spacious surroundings she wanted to leave london and its shops and the home and the movements and the callers and rivalries and even dimpled little margharitas insistent claims and get free and think it was the first invasion of their lives by this conception a conception that was ever afterwards to leave them altogether of retreat and reconstruction she knelt upon the white sheepskin hearthrug at traffords feet one night and told him of her desire he too was tired of his work and his vexations and ripe for this suggestion of an altered life the easter holiday was approaching and nearly twenty unencumbered days mrs trafford they knew would come into the house meanwhile and care for margharita they would go away somewhere together and walk no luggage but a couple of knapsacks no hotel but some homely village inn they would be in the air all day until they were saturated with sweet air and spirit of clean restraints they would plan out their new rule concentrate their aims and i could think said trafford of this new work i cant begin here i might make some notes presently came the question of where the great walk should be manifestly it must be among mountains manifestly and marjories eye saw those mountains with snow upon their summits and cold glaciers on their flanks could they get to switzerland if they travelled second class throughout and took the cheaper way as samurai should   § 10  that holiday seemed to marjorie as if they had found a lost and forgotten piece of honeymoon she had that same sense of fresh beginnings that had made their first walk in italian switzerland so unforgettable she was filled with the happiness of recovering trafford when he had seemed to be slipping from her all day they talked of their outlook and how they might economise away the need of his extra work and so release him for his search again for the first time he talked of his work to her and gave her some intimation of its scope and quality he became enthusiastic with the sudden invention of experimental devices so that it seemed to her almost worth while if instead of going on they bolted back he to his laboratory and she to her nursery and so at once inaugurated the new régime but they went on to finish the holiday out and the delight of being together again with unfettered hours of association they rediscovered each other the sameand a little changed if their emotions were less bright and intense their interest was far wider and deeper  the season was too early for high passes and the weather was changeable they started from fribourg and walked to thun and then back to bulle and so to bultigen saanen montbovon and the lake of geneva they had rain several days the sweet soft windless mountain rain that seemed so tolerable to those who are accustomed to the hard and driven downpours of england and in places they found mud and receding snow the inns were at their homeliest and none the worse for that and there were days of spring sunshine when a multitude of minute and delightful flowers came out as it seemed to meet themit was impossible to suppose so great a concourse universaland spread in a scented carpet before their straying feet the fruit trees in the valleys were powdered with blossom and the new grass seemed rather greentinted sunlight than merely green and they walked with a sort of stout leisureliness knapsacks wellhung and cloaks about them with their faces fresh and bright under the bracing weather and their lungs deep charged with mountain air talking of the new austerer life that was now beginning with great snowcapped mountains in the background streaming precipices overhead and a sward of flowers to go upon that strenuous prospect was altogether delightful they went as it pleased them making detours into valleys coming back upon their steps the interludes of hot bright april sunshine made them indolent and they would loiter and halt where some rock or wall invited and sit basking like happy animals talking very little for long hours together trafford seemed to have forgotten all the strain and disappointment of the past two years to be amazed but in no wise incredulous at this enormous change in her and in their outlook it filled her with a passion of pride and high resolve to think that so she could recover and uplift him  he was now very deeply in love with her again he talked indeed of his research but so that it might interest her and when he thought alone he thought not of it but of her making again the old discoveries his intense delight in the quality of her voice his joy in a certain indescribable gallantry in her bearing he pitied all men whose wives could not carry themselves and whose voices failed and broke under the things they had to say and then again there was the way she moved her arms the way her hands took hold of things the alert lucidity of her eyes and then that faint soft shadow of a smile upon her lips when she walked thinking or observant all unaware that he was watching her  it rained in the morning of their eleventh day and then gave way to warmth and sunshine so that they arrived at les avants in the afternoon a little muddy and rather hot at one of the tables under the trees outside the grand hotel was a small group of people dressed in the remarkable and imposing costume which still in those days distinguished the motorist they turned from their tea to a more or less frank inspection of the traffords and suddenly broke out into cries of recognition and welcome solomonsonfor the most part brown leatheremerged with extended hands and behind him nestling in the midst of immense and costly furs appeared the kindly salience and brightness of his ladys face good luck cried solomonson good luck come and have tea with us but this is a happy encounter  were dirtybut so healthy cried marjorie saluting lady solomonson  you look ohsplendidly well that lady responded  weve been walking  with just that knapsack  its been glorious  but the courage said lady solomonson and did not add the tragic hardship though her tone conveyed it she had all the unquestioning belief of her race in the sanity of comfort she had ingrained in her the most definite ideas of mans position and womans and that any one man or woman should walk in mud except under dire necessity was outside the range of her philosophy she thought marjories thick boots and short skirts quite the most appalling feminine costume she had ever seen she saw only a ruined complexion and damaged womanhood in marjories rainwashed sunbit cheek her benevolent heart rebelled at the spectacle it was dreadful she thought that nice young people like the traffords should have come to this  the rest of the party were now informally introduced they were all very splendid and disconcertingly free from mud one was christabel morrison the actress a graceful figure in a green baize coat and brown fur who looked ever so much more charming than her innumerable postcards and illustratedpaper portraits would have led one to expect her neighbour was solomonsons cousin lee the organizer of the theatre syndicate a browneyed attenuated quickminded little man with an accent that struck trafford as being on the whole rather dutch and the third lady was lady solomonsons sister mrs lee it appeared they were all staying at lees villa above vevey part of an amusing assembly of people who were either vividly rich or even more vividly clever an accumulation which the traffords in the course of the next twenty minutes were three times invited with an increasing appreciation and earnestness to join  from the first our two young people were not indisposed to do so for eleven days they had maintained their duologue at the very highest level seven days remained to them before they must go back to begin the hard new life in england and there was something very attractivethey did not for a moment seek to discover the elements of that attractivenessin this proposal of five or six days of luxurious indolence above the lake a sort of farewell to the worldly side of worldly things before they set forth upon the high and narrow path they had resolved to tread  but weve got no clothes cried marjorie no clothes at all weve these hobnail boots and a pair each of heelless slippers  my dear cried lady solomonson in real distress and as much aside as circumstances permitted my dear my sister can manage all that her voice fell to earnest undertones we can really manage all that the house is packed with things well come to dinner in fancy dress and scott my maid is so clever  but really said marjorie  my dear said lady solomonson everything and she changed places with lee in order to be perfectly confidential and explicit rachel she cried and summoned her sister for confirmatory assurances  but my husband marjorie became audible  weve long persian robes said mrs lee with a glance of undisguised appraisement hell be splendid hell look like a soldan  the rest of the company forced a hectic conversation in order not to seem to listen and presently lady solomonson and her sister were triumphant they packed marjorie into the motor car and trafford and solomonson returned to vevey by train and thence up to the villa by a hired automobile   § 11  they didnt go outside the magic confines of the lees villa for three days and when they did they were still surrounded by their hosts service and possessions they made an excursion to chillon in his motorcars and went in his motorboat to lunch with the maynards in their lakeside villa close to geneva during all that time they seemed lifted off the common earth into a world of fine fabrics agreeable sounds noiseless unlimited service and ample untroubled living it had an effect of enchantment and the long healthy arduous journey thither seemed a tale of incredible effort amidst these sunny excesses the weather had the whim to be serenely fine sunshine like summer and the bluest of skies shone above the white wall and the ilex thickets and cypresses that bounded them in from the great world of crowded homes and sous and small necessities and through the texture of it all for trafford ran a thread of curious new suggestion an intermittent discussion of economics and socialism was going on between himself and solomonson and an agreeable little stammering man in brown named minter who walked up in the afternoon from veveyhe professed to be writing a novelduring the earlier half of the day minter displayed the keenest appreciation of everything in his entertainment and blinked cheerfully and expressed opinions of the extremest socialistic and anarchistic flavour to an accompaniment of grateful selfindulgence your portwine is wonderful lee he would say sipping it a terrible retribution will fall upon you some day for all this  the villa had been designed by lee to please his wife and if it was neither very beautiful nor very dignified it was at any rate very pretty and amusing it might have been built by a parisian dressmakerin the châteauesque style it was of greyishwhite stone with a roof of tiles it had little balconies and acutely roofed turrets and almost burlesque buttresses pierced by doors and gates and suntrap loggias as pleasantly casual as the bows and embroideries of a womans dress and its central hall with an impluvium that had nothing to do with rainwater and its diningroom to which one ascended from this hall between pillars up five broad steps were entirely irrelevant to all its exterior features unobtrusive menservants in grey with scarlet facings hovered serviceably  from the little terrace all set with orangetrees in tubs one could see through the branches and stems of evergreens and over a foreground of budding starting vineyard the clustering roofs of vevey below an agglomeration veiled ever so thinly in the morning by a cobweb of wood smoke against the blue background of lake with its winged sailingboats and sombre alpine distances minter made it all significant by a wave of the hand all this he said and of the crowded workaday life below all that  all this with its rich litter of stuffs and ornaments its fine profusion its delicacies of flower and food and furniture its frequent inconsecutive pleasures its noiseless ready service was remarkably novel and yet remarkably familiar to trafford for a time he could not understand this undertone of familiarity and then a sunlit group of hangings in one of the small rooms that looked out upon the lake took his mind back to his own diningroom and the little inadequate but decidedly good bokhara embroidery that dominated it like a flag that lit it and now lit his understanding like a confessed desire of course mrs leehappy womanwas doing just everything that marjorie would have loved to do marjorie had never confessed as much perhaps she had never understood as much but now in the presence of mrs lees æsthetic exuberances trafford at least understood he surveyed the little room whose harmonies he had at first simply taken for granted noted the lustreware that answered to the gleaming persian tiles the inspiration of a metallic thread in the hangings and the exquisite choice of the deadened paint upon the woodwork and realized for the first time how little aimless extravagance can be and all the timid obstinately insurgent artistry that troubled his wife he stepped through the open window into a little loggia and stared unseeingly over glittering darkgreen leaves to the mysteries of distance in the great masses above st gingolph and it seemed for the first time that perhaps in his thoughts he had done his wife a wrong he had judged her fickle impulsive erratic perhaps merely because her mind followed a different process from his because while he went upon the lines of constructive truth her guide was a more immediate and instinctive sense of beauty  he was very much alive to her now and deeply in love with her he had reached les avants with all his sense of their discordance clean washed and walked out of his mind by rain and sun and a flow of high resolutions and the brotherly swing of their strides together they had come to the lees villa mudsplashed airsweet comrades all unaware of the subtle differences of atmosphere they had to encounter they had no suspicion that it was only about half of each other that had fraternized now here they were in a company that was not only altogether alien to their former mood but extremely interesting and exciting and closely akin to the latent factors in marjories composition their hostess and her sister had the keen quick æsthetic sensibilities of their race with all that freedom of reading and enfranchisement of mind which is the lot of the western women lee had an immense indulgent affection for his wife he regarded her arrangements and exploits with an admiration that was almost american and mrs lees imagination had run loose in pursuit of beautiful and remarkable people and splendours rather than harmonies of line and colour lee like solomonson had that inexplicable alchemy of mind which distils gold from the commerce of the world all this said minter to trafford is an exhalation from all that he accumulated wealth as one grows a beard and found his interest in his uxorious satisfactions and so mrs lee with her bright watchful eyes quick impulsive movements and instinctive command had the utmost freedom to realize her ideals  in the world at large lee and solomonson seemed both a little short and a little stout and a little too black and bright for their entirely conventional clothing but for the dinner and evening of the villa they were now out of consideration for trafford at their ease and far more dignified in oriental robes trafford was accommodated with a long black delicately embroidered garment that reached to his feet and suited something upstanding and fine in his bearing minter who had stayed on from an afternoon call was gorgeous in chinese embroidery the rest of the men clung boldly or bashfully to evening dress  on the evening of his arrival trafford bathed and robed found the rest of the men assembling about an open wood fire in the smaller hall at the foot of the main staircase lee was still upstairs and solomonson with a new grace of gesture begotten by his costume made the necessary introductions a little man with finecut features and a galway accent was rex the playwright a tall greyhaired cleanshaven man was bright from the new york central museum and a bearded giant with a roof of red hair and a remote eye was radlett barns the great portraitpainter who consents to paint your portrait for posterity as the king confers a knighthood these were presently joined by lee and pacey the blondhaired musician and mottersham whose patents and inventions control electric lighting and heating all over the world and then with the men duly gathered and expectant the women came down the wide staircase  the staircase had been planned and lit for these effects and mrs lee meant to make the most of her new discovery her voice could be heard in the unseen corridor above arranging the descent you go first dear will you go with christabel the conversation about the fire checked and ceased with the sound of voices above and the faint rustle of skirts then came christabel morrison her slender grace beautifully contrasted with the fuller beauties of that great lady of the stage marion rufus lady solomonson descended confidently in a group of three with lady mottersham and sharptongued little mrs rex all very rich and splendid after a brief interval their hostess preceded marjorie and was so much of an artist that she had dressed herself merely as a foil to this new creation she wore black and scarlet that made the white face and bright eyes under her sombre hair seem the face of an inspiring spirit a step behind her and to the right of her came marjorie tall and wonderful as if she were the queen of earth and sunshine swathed barbarically in gold and ruddy brown and with her abundant hair bound back by a fillet of bloodstones and gold radlett barns exclaimed at the sight of her she was full of the manifest consciousness of dignity as she descended quite conscious and quite unembarrassed two borrowed golden circlets glittered on her shining arm and a thin chain of gold and garnets broke the contrast of the warm suntouched neck above with the unsullied skin below  she sought and met her husbands astonishment with the faintest remotest of smiles it seemed to him that never before had he appreciated her beauty his daily companion had become this splendour in the sky she came close by him with hand extended to greet sir philip mottersham he was sensible of the glow of her as it were of a scented aura about her he had a first full intimation of the cult and worship of woman and the magnificence of women old as the mediterranean and its goddesses and altogether novel to his mind  christabel morrison found him a pleasant but not very entertaining or exciting neighbor at the dinnertable and was relieved when the time came for her to turn an ear to the artistic compliments of radlett barns but trafford was too interested and amused by the general effect of the dinner to devote himself to the rather heavy business of really exhilarating christabel he didnt give his mind to her he found the transformation of sir rupert into a turbanned oriental who might have come out of a picture by carpaccio gently stimulating and altogether delightful his attention returned again and again to that genial swarthiness mrs lee on his left lived in her eyes and didnt so much talk to him as rattle her mind at him almost absentmindedly as one might dangle keys at a baby while one talked to its mother yet it was evident she liked the look of him her glance went from his face to his robe and up and down the table at the bright dresses the shining arms the glass and light and silver she asked him to tell her just where he had tramped and just what he had seen and he had scarcely begun answering her question before her thoughts flew off to three trophies of china and silver struggling groups of china boys bearing up great silver shells of fruit and flowers that stood down the centre of the table what do you think of my chubby boys she asked theyre german work they came from a show at düsseldorf last week ben saw i liked them and sent back for them secretly and here they are i thought they might be too colourless but are they  no said trafford theyre just cool under that glow of fruit is this saltcellar english cut glass  old dutch said mrs lee isnt it jolly she embarked with a roving eye upon the story of her dutch glass which was abundant and admirable and broke off abruptly to say your wife is wonderful  her hair goes back she said like music you know what i meana sort of easy rhythm you dont mind my praising your wife  trafford said he didnt  and theres a sort of dignity about her all my life mr trafford ive wanted to be tall it stopped my growth  she glanced off at a tangent tell me mr trafford she asked was your wife beautiful like this when you married her i meanof course she was a beautiful girl and adorable and all that but wasnt she just a slender thing  she paused but if she had a habit of asking disconcerting questions she did not at any rate insist upon answers and she went on to confess that she believed she would be a happier woman poor than richnot that ben isnt all he should bebut that then she would have been a fashionable dressmaker people want help she said so much more help than they get they go about with themselveswhat was it mr radlett barns said the other nightohlike people leading horses they darent ride i think he says such good things at times dont you so wonderful to be clever in two ways like that just look now at your wifenow i mean that theyve drawn that peacockcoloured curtain behind her my brotherinlaw has been telling me you keep the most wonderful and precious secrets locked up in your breast that you know how to make gold and diamonds and all sorts of things if i didi should make them  she pounced suddenly upon rex at her left with questions about the keltic renascence was it still going onor what and trafford was at liberty for a time to enjoy the bright effects about him the shadowed profile and black hair of christabel to the right of him and the coruscating refractions and reflections of lady solomonson across the white and silver and ivory and blossom of the table then mrs lee dragged him into a sudden conflict with rex by saying abruptly  of course mr trafford wouldnt believe that  he looked perhaps a little lost  i was telling mrs lee said rex that i dont believe theres any economy of human toil in machinery whatever i mean that the machine itself really embodies all the toil it seems to save toil that went to the making of it and preparing it and getting coal for it   § 12  next morning they found their hostess at breakfast in the diningroom and now the sun was streaming through a high triple window that had been curtained overnight and they looked out through clean bright plateglass upon mountains halfdissolved in a luminous mist and a mistveiled lake below great stone jars upon the terrace bore a blaze of urged and early blossom and beyond were cypresses their hostess presided at one of two round tables at a side table various breakfast dishes kept warm over spirit lamps and two men servants dispensed tea and coffee in the bay of the window was a fruit table with piled fruitplates and fingerbowls  mrs lee waved a welcoming hand and drew marjorie to a seat beside her rex was consuming trout and christabel peaches and solomonson all his overnight orientalism abandoned was in outspoken tweeds and quite under the impression that he was interested in golf trafford got frizzled bacon for marjorie and himself and dropped into a desultory conversation chiefly sustained by christabel about the peculiarly exalting effect of beautiful scenery on christabels mind mrs lee was as usual distraught and kept glancing towards the steps that led up from the hall lady solomonson appeared with a rustle in a wrapper of pink chinese silk i came down after all she said i lay in bed weighing rolls and coffee and relaxed muscles against your english breakfast downstairs and suddenly i remembered your little sausages  she sat down with a distribution of handkerchief bag letters a gold fountain pen and suchlike equipments and trafford got her some of the coveted delicacies mrs lee suddenly cried out here they come here they come and simultaneously the hall resonated with childrens voices and the yapping of a skye terrier  then a gay little procession appeared ascending the steps first came a small but princely little boy of three with a ruddy face and curly black hair behind him was a slender rather awkward girl of perhaps eleven and a sturdier daughter of israel of nine a nurse in artistic purple followed listening inattentively to some private whisperings of a knickerbockered young man of five and then came another purplerobed nurse against contingencies and then a nurse of a different whiteclad and more elaborately costumed sort carrying a sumptuous baby of eight or nine months ah the darlings cried christabel springing up quite beautifully and lady solomonson echoed the cry the procession broke against the tables and split about the breakfast party the small boy in petticoats made a confident rush for marjorie christabel set herself to fascinate his elder brother the young woman of eleven scrutinized trafford with speculative interest and edged towards him coyly and mrs lee interviewed her youngest born the amiable inanities suitable to the occasion had scarcely begun before a violent clapping of hands announced the appearance of lee  it was lees custom mrs lee told marjorie over her massively robed baby to get up very early and work on rolls and coffee he never breakfasted nor joined them until the children came all of them rushed to him for their morning kiss and it seemed to trafford that lee at least was an altogether happy creature as he accepted the demonstrative salutations of this struggling elbowing armful of offspring and emerged at last like a man from a dive flushed and ruffled and smiling to wish his adult guests good morning  come upstairs with us daddy cried the children tugging at him come upstairs  mrs lee ran her eye about her table and rose its the childrens hour she said to marjorie you dont i hope mind children  but said trafford incredulous and with a friendly arm about his admirer is this tall young woman yours  the child shot him a glance of passionate appreciation for this scrap of flattery  we began young said mrs lee with eyes of uncritical pride for the ungainly one and smiled at her husband  upstairs cried the boy of five and the girl of nine upstairs  may we come asked marjorie  may we all come asked christabel determined to be in the movement  rex strolled towards the cigars with disentanglement obviously in his mind  do you really care asked mrs lee you know im so proud of their nursery would you care always i go up at this time  ive my little nursery too said marjorie  of course cried mrs lee i forgot of course and overwhelmed marjorie with inquiries as she followed her husband every one joined the nurseryward procession except rex who left himself behind with an air of inadvertency and escaped to the terrace and a cigar  it was a wonderful nursery a suite of three bedrooms a green and white welllit schoolroom and a vast playroom and hovering about the passage trafford remarked a third purple nurse and a very efficient and seriouslooking swiss governess the schoolroom and the nursery displayed a triumph of judicious shopping and arrangement the best of german and french and english things had been blended into a harmony at once hygienic and pedagogic and humanly charming for once marjorie had to admire the spending of another woman and admit to herself that even she could not have done better with the money  there were clever little desks for the elder children to work at adjustable desks scientifically lit so that they benefited hands and shoulders and eyes there were artistically coloured and artistically arranged pictures and a little library held all the best of lang and lucas rare good things like uncle lubin maurice barings story of forgetmenot johnny crows garden the bad childs book of beasts animal books and bird books costume books and story books colour books and rhyme books abundant yet every one intelligently chosen no costly meretricious printed rubbish such as silly gentile mothers buy then in the great nursery with its cork carpet on which any toy would stand or run was an abundance of admirable possessions and shelving for everything and great fat cloth elephants to ride and gocarts and hooks for a swing marjories quick eye saw and she admired effusively and envied secretly and mrs lee appreciated her appreciation a skirmishing romp of the middle children and lee went on about the two of them and trafford was led off by his admirer into a cubbyhouse in one corner with real glass windows made to open and the muslin curtains were drawn while he was shown a secret under vows lady solomonson discovered some soldiers and was presently on her knees in a corner with the fiveyear old boy  these are like my teddys she was saying my billy has some of these  trafford emerged from the cubbyhouse which was perhaps a little cramped for him and surveyed the room with his admirer lugging at his arm unheeded and whispering come back with me  of course this was the clue to lee and solomonson how extremely happy lee appeared to be enormous vistas of dark philoprogenitive parents and healthy little jews and jewesses seemed to open out to trafford hygienically reared exquisitely trained and educated and he and marjorie had just one little daughterwith a much poorer educational outlook she had no cloth elephant to ride no elaborate cubbyhouse to get into only a halfdozen picture books or so and later she wouldnt when she needed it get that linguistic swiss  he wasnt above the normal human vanity of esteeming his own race and type the best and certain vulgar aspects of what nowadays one calls eugenics crossed his mind   § 13  during those few crowded days of unfamiliar living trafford accumulated a vast confused mass of thoughts and impressions he realized acutely the enormous gulf between his attitudes towards women and those of his host and solomonsonand indeed of all the other men it had never occurred to him before that there was any other relationship possible between a modern woman and a modern man but a frank comradeship and perfect knowledge helpfulness and honesty that had been the continual implication of his mothers life and of all that he had respected in the thought and writing of his time but not one of these men in their placewith the possible exception of minter who remained brilliant but ambiguousbelieved anything of the sort it necessarily involved in practice a share of hardship for women and it seemed fundamental to them that women should have no hardship he sought for a word and hung between chivalry and orientalism he inclined towards chivalry their women were lifted a little off the cold ground of responsibility charm was their obligation a beautiful woman should be beautifully dressed said radlett barns in the course of the discussion of a contemporary portrait painter lee nodded to endorse an obvious truth but she ought to dress herself said barns it ought to be herself to the points of the old lacechosen and assimilated its just through not being that that so many rich women aredetestable heaps of acquisition caddiswomen  trafford ceased to listen he helped himself to a cigar and pinched its end and lit it while his mind went off to gnaw at a beautiful woman should be beautifully dressed as a dog retires with a bone he couldnt escape from its shining truth and withal it was devastating to all the purposes of his life  he rejected the word orientalism what he was dealing with here was chivalry all this was indeed under the thinnest of disguises the castle and the pavilion and lee and solomonson were valiant knights who entered the lists not indeed with spear and shield but with prospectus and ingenious enterprise who drew cheques instead of swords for their ladies honour who held all that in fee and subjection that these exquisite and wonderful beings should flower in rich perfection all these women lived in a magic security and abundance far above the mire and adventure of the world their knights went upon quests for them and returned with villas and pictures and diamonds and historical pearls and not one of them all was so beautiful a being as his marjorie whom he made his squaw whom he expected to aid and follow him and suffer uncomplainingly the rough services of the common life not one was half so beautiful as marjorie nor half so sweet and wonderful  if such thoughts came in lees villa they returned with redoubled force when trafford found himself packed painfully with marjorie in the night train to paris his head ached with the rattle and suffocation of the train and he knew hers must ache more the windows of the compartment and the door were all closed the litigious little commercial traveller in shiny grey had insisted upon that there was no corner seat either for marjorie or himself the dim big package over her head swayed threateningly the green shade over the light kept opening with the vibration of the train the pallid old gentleman with the beard had twisted himself into a ghastly resemblance to a brokennecked corpse and pressed his knees hard and stiffly against trafford and the small sniffing bowlegged little boy beside the rusty widow woman in the corner smelt mysteriously and penetratingly of roquefort cheese for the seventeenth time the little commercial traveller jumped up with an unbecoming expletive and pulled the shade over the light and the silent young man in the fourth corner stirred and readjusted his legs  for a time until the crack of light overhead had widened again every one became a dark headdangling outline  he watched the dim shape before him and noted the weary droop of her pose he wished he had brought water he was intolerably thirsty and his thirst gave him the measure of hers this jolting foetid compartment was a horrible place for her an intolerably horrible place and she was standing it for all her manifest suffering with infinite gallantry and patience what a gallant soul indeed she was whatever else she did she never failed to rise to a challenge her very extravagance that had tried their lives so sorely was perhaps just one aspect of that same quality it is so easy to be saving if one is timid so hard if one is unaccustomed to fear how beautiful she had shone at times in the lights and glitter of that house behind there and now she was back in her weatherstained tweeds again like a shining sword thrust back into a rusty old sheath  was it fair that she should come back into the sheath because of this passion of his for a vast inexhaustible research  he had never asked himself before if it was fair to assume she would follow his purpose and his fortunes he had taken that for granted and she too had taken that for granted which was so generously splendid of her all her disloyalties had been unintentional indeed almost instinctive breaches of her subordination to this aim which was his alone these breaches he realized had been the reality of her nature fighting against her profoundest resolutions  he wondered what lee must think of this sort of married life how ugly and selfish it must seem from that point of view  he perceived for the first time the fundamental incongruity of marjories position she was made to shine elaborately prepared and trained to shine desiring keenly to shine and then imprisoned and hidden in the faded obscurity of a small poor home how conspicuously how extremely he must be wanting in just that sort of chivalry in which lee excelled those business men lived for their women to an extent he had hitherto scarcely dreamt of doing  his want of chivalry was beyond dispute and was there not also an extraordinary egotism in this concentration upon his own purposes a selfesteem a vanity had her life no rights suppose now he were to give hertwo years three years perhaps of his lifealtogether or even four was it too much to grudge her four solomonson had been at his old theme with him a theme the little man had never relinquished since their friendship first began years ago possibilities of a business alliance and the application of a mind of exceptional freshness and penetration to industrial development why shouldnt that be tried why not make money for a brief strenuous time and then come back when marjories pride and comfort were secure  poor dear how weary she looked  he wondered how much more remained of this appalling night it would have made so little difference if they had taken the day train and travelled firstclass wasnt she indeed entitled to travel firstclass pictures of the immense spaciousness the softness cleanliness and dignity of firstclass compartments appeared in his mind  he would have looked at his watch but to get at it would mean disturbing the silent young man on his left  outside in the corridor there broke out a noisy dispute about a missing coupon a dispute in that wonderful language that is known to the facetious as entente cordiale between an englishman and the conductor of the train   § 14  in paris there was a dispute with an extortionate cabman and the crossing from dieppe to newhaven was rough and bitterly cold they were both ill they reached home very dirty and weary and among the pile of letters and papers on traffords desk was a big bundle of science note proofs and two letters from croydon and pinner to alter the hours of his lectures for various plausible and irritating reasons  the little passage looked very small and rather bare as the door shut behind them and the worn places that had begun to be conspicuous during the last six months and which they had forgotten during the swiss holiday reasserted themselves the diningroom after spacious rooms flooded with sunshine betrayed how dark it was and how small those bokhara embroideries that had once shone so splendid now after mrs lees rich and unlimited harmonies seemed skimpy and insufficient mere loincloths for the artistic nakedness of the home they felt too they were beginning to find out their postimpressionist picture they had not remembered it as nearly so crude as it now appeared the hole a flying coal had burnt in the unevenly faded darkblue carpet looked larger than it had ever done before and was indeed the only thing that didnt appear faded and shrunken   § 15  the atmosphere of the lees villa had disturbed marjories feelings and ideas even more than it had traffords she came back struggling to recover those high resolves that had seemed so secure when they had walked down to les avantes there was a curiously tormenting memory of that vast admirable nursery and the princely procession of children that would not leave her mind no effort of her reason could reconcile her to the inferiority of margharitas equipment she had a detestable craving for a uniform for may but may was going  but indeed she was not so sure that may was going  she was no longer buoyantly well she was full of indefinable apprehensions of weakness and failure she struggled to control an insurgence of emotions that rose out of the deeps of her being she had now she knew to take on her share of the burden to become one of the samurai to show her love no longer as a demand but as a service yet from day to day she procrastinated under the shadow of apprehended things she forebore to dismiss may to buy that secondhand typewriter she needed to take any irrevocable step towards the realization of the new way of living she tried to think away her fears but they would not leave her she felt that trafford watched her pale face with a furtive solicitude and wondered at her hesitations she tried in vain to seem cheerful and careless in his presence with an anxiety with premonitions that grew daily  there was no need to worry him unduly  but soon the matter was beyond all doubting one night she gathered her courage together suddenly and came down into his study in her dressinggown with her hair about her shoulders she opened the door and her heart failed her  rag she whispered  yes he said busily from his desk without looking round  i want to speak to you she answered and came slowly and stood beside him silently  well old marjorie he said presently drawing a little intricate pattern in the corner of his blotting paper and wondering whether this was a matter of five pounds or ten  i meant so well she said and caught herself back into silence again  he started at the thought at a depth and meaning in her voice turned his chair about to look at her and discovered she was weeping and choking noiselessly he stood up close to her moving very slowly and silently his eyes full of this new surmise and now without word or gesture from her he knew his thought was right my dear he whispered  she turned her face from him i meant so well she sobbed my dear i meant so well still with an averted face her arms came out to him in a desperate unreasoning appeal for love he took her and held her close to him never mind dear he said dont mind her passion now was unconstrained i thought he began and left the thing unsaid  but your work she said your research  i must give up research he said  oh my dearest  i must give up research he repeated ive been seeing it for days clearer and clearer this dear just settles things evenas we were coming home in the traini was making up my mind at vevey i was talking to solomonson  my dear she whispered clinging to him  i talked to solomonson he had ideasa proposal  no she said  yes he said ive left the thing too long  he repeated i must give up researchfor years i ought to have done it long before  i had meant so well she said i meant to work i meant to deny myself  im glad he whispered glad why should you weep it seemed nothing to him then that so he should take a long farewell to the rare sweet air of that wonderland his mind had loved so dearly all he remembered was that marjorie was very dear to him very dear to him and that all her being was now calling out for him and his strength i had thought anyhow of giving up research he repeated this merely decides it happens to decide i love you dear i put my research at your feet gladly this is the end and i do not care my dear at all i do not care at allseeing i have you  he stood beside her for a moment and then sat down again sideways upon his chair  it isnt you my dear or me he said but life that beats usthat beautiful irrational mother life does not care for research or knowledge but only for life oh the world has to go on yet for tens of thousands of years beforebefore we are free for that ive got to fightas other men fight  he thought in silence for a time oddly regardless of her but if it was not you he said staring at the fireplace with knitted brows if i did not love you thank god i love you dear thank god our children are love children i want to liveto my fingertips but if i didnt love youoh love you then i think nowid be gladid be glad i think to cheat life of her victory  oh my dear she cried and clung weeping to him and caught at him and sat herself upon his knees and put her arms about his head and kissed him passionately with tearsalt lips with her hair falling upon his face  my dear she whispered   § 16  so soon as trafford could spare an afternoon amidst his crowded engagements he went to talk to solomonson who was now back in london solomonson he said you were talking about rubber at vevey  i remember said solomonson with a note of welcome  ive thought it over  i thought you would  ive thought things over im going to give up my professorshipand science generally and come into businessif that is what you are meaning  solomonson turned his paperweight round very carefully before replying then he said you mustnt give up your professorship yet trafford for the restim glad  he reflected and then his bright eyes glanced up at trafford i knew he said you would  i didnt said trafford things have happened since  something was bound to happen youre too goodfor what it gave you i didnt talk to you out there for nothing i saw things lets go into the other room and smoke and talk it over he stood up as he spoke  i thought you would he repeated leading the way i knew you would you seeone has to you cant get out of it  it was all very well before you were married said solomonson stopping short to say it but when a mans married hes got to think he cant go on devoting himself to his art and his science and all thatnot if hes married anything worth having no oh i understand hes got to look about him and forget the distant prospect for a bit i saw youd come to it i came to it had to i had ambitionsjust as you have ive always had an inclination to do a bit of research on my own i like it you know oh i could have done things im sure i could have done things im not a born moneymaker but he became very close and confidential itsthem you said goodbye to science for a bit when you flopped me down on that old croquetlawn trafford he went off to reminiscences lord how we went over no more aviation for me trafford  he arranged chairs and produced cigars after allthis of courseits interesting once you get into the movement of it it takes hold of you its a game  ive thought over all you said trafford began using premeditated phrases bluntlyi want three thousand a year and i dont make eight hundred its come home to me im going to have another child  solomonson gesticulated a congratulation  all the same i hate dropping research its stuff im made to do about that solomonson im almost superstitious i could say i had a call its the maddest state of affairs now that im doing absolutely my best work for mankind work i firmly believe no one else can do i just manage to get six hundrednearly two hundred of my eight hundred is my own what does the world think i could do betterthat would be worth four times as much  the world doesnt think anything at all about it said solomonson  suppose it did  the thought struck sir rupert he knitted his brows and looked hard obliquely at the smoke of his cigar oh it wont he said rejecting a disagreeable idea there isnt any worldnot in that sense thats the mistake you make trafford  its not what your work is worth he explained its what your advantages can get for you people are always going about supposingjust what you supposethat people ought to get paid in proportion to the good they do its forgetting what the world is to do that very likely some day civilization will get to that but it hasnt got to it yet it isnt going to get to it for hundreds and hundreds of years  his manner became confidential civilizations just a fight traffordjust as savagery is a fight and being a wild beast is a fightonly you have paddeder gloves on and theres more rules we arent out for everybody were out for ourselvesand a few friends perhapswithin limits its no good hurrying ahead and pretending civilizations something else when it isnt thats where all these socialists and people come a howler oh i know the socialists i see em at my wifes at homes they come along with the literary people and the artists wives and the actors and actresses and none of them take much account of me because im just a business man and rather dark and short and so i get a chance of looking at them from the side that isnt on show while the others turned to the women and theyre just as fighting as the rest of us only they humbug more and they dont seem to me to have a decent respect for any of the common rules and thats about what it all comes to trafford  sir rupert paused and trafford was about to speak when the former resumed again his voice very earnest his eyes shining with purpose he liked trafford and he was doing his utmost to make a convincing confession of the faith that was in him its when it comes to the women said sir rupert that one finds it out thats where youve found it out you say im going to devote my life to the service of humanity in general youll find humanity in particular in the shape of all the fine beautiful delightful and desirable women you come across preferring a narrower turn of devotion see thats all caeteris paribus of course thats what i found out and thats what youve found out and thats what everybody with any sense in his head finds out and there you are  you put itgraphically said trafford  i feel it graphically i may be all sorts of things but i do know a fact when i see it im here with a few things i want and a woman or so i have and want to keep and the kids upstairs bless em and im in league with all the others who want the same sort of things against any one or anything that upsets us we stand by the law and each other and thats what it all amounts to thats as far as my patch of humanity goes humanity at large humanity be blowed look at it it isnt that im hostile to humanity mind you but that im not disposed to go under as i should do if i didnt say that so i say it and thats about all it is and there you are  he regarded trafford over his cigar drawing fiercely at it for some moments then seeing trafford on the point of speaking he snatched it from his lips demanded silence by waving it at his hearer and went on  i say all this in order to dispose of any idea that you can keep up the openminded telleverybodyeverything scientific attitude if you come into business you cant put business in two words and what is it keeping something from somebody else and making him pay for it  oh look here protested trafford thats not the whole of business  theres making him want it of course advertisement and all that but that falls under making him pay for it really  but a business man organizes public services consolidates economizes  sir rupert made his mouth look very wide by sucking in the corners incidentally he said and added after a judicious pause sometimes  i thought we were talking of making money  go on said trafford  you set me thinking said solomonson its the thing i always like about you i tell you trafford i dont believe that the majority of people who make money help civilization forward any more than the smoke that comes out of the engine helps the train forward if you put it to me i dont ive got no illusions of that sort theyre about as much help asfat they accumulate because things happen to be arranged so  things will be arranged better some day  they arent arranged better now grip that now its a sort of paradox if youve got big gifts and you choose to help forward the world if you choose to tell all you know and give away everything you can do in the way of work youve got to give up the ideas of wealth and security and that means fine women and children youve got to be a deprived sort of man all right you say thats me but how about your wife being a deprived sort of woman eh thats where it gets you and meanwhile you know while you make your sacrifices and do your researches therell be little mean sharp active beasts making money all over you like maggots on a cheese and if everybody whod got gifts and altruistic ideas gave themselves up to it then evidently only the mean and greedy lot would breed and have the glory theyd get everything every blessed thing there wouldnt be an option they didnt hold and the other chaps would produce the art and the science and the literature as far as the men whod got hold of things would let em and perish out of the earth altogether there you are still thats how things are made  but it isnt worth it it isnt worth extinguishing oneself in order to make a world for those others anyhow them and their children is it eh its like building a temple for flies to buzz in there is such a thing as a personal side to eugenics you know  solomonson reflected over the end of his cigar it isnt good enough he concluded  youre infernally right said trafford  very well said solomonson and now we can get to business   § 17  the immediate business was the systematic exploitation of the fact that trafford had worked out the problem of synthesizing indiarubber he had done so with an entire indifference to the commercial possibilities of the case because he had been irritated by the enormous publicity given to behrens assertion that he had achieved this longsought end of course the production of artificial rubbers and rubberlike substances had been one of the activities of the synthetic chemist for many years from the appearance of tildens isoprene rubber onward and there was already a formidable list of collaterals dimethybutadiene and so forth by which the coveted goal could be approached behrens had boldly added to this list as his own a number of variations upon a theme of traffords originally designed to settle certain curiosities about elasticity behrens products were not only more massively rubberlike than anything that had gone before them but also extremely cheap to produce and his bold announcement of success had produced a check in rubber sales and widespread depression in the quiveringly sensitive market of plantation shares solomonson had consulted trafford about this matter at vevey and had heard with infinite astonishment that trafford had already roughly prepared and was proposing to complete and publish unpatented and absolutely unprotected first a smashing demonstration of the unsoundness of behrens claim and then a lucid exposition of just what had to be done and what could be done to make an indiarubber absolutely indistinguishable from the natural product the business man could not believe his ears  my dear chap positivelyyou mustnt solomonson had screamed and he had opened his fingers and humped his shoulders and for all his public school and university training lapsed undisguisedly into the oriental dont you see all you are throwing away he squealed  i suppose its our quality to throw such things away said trafford when at last solomonsons point of view became clear to him they had embarked upon a long rambling discussion of that issue of publication a discussion they were now taking up again when men dropped that idea of concealing knowledge alchemist gave place to chemist said trafford and all that is worth having in modern life all that makes it better and safer and more hopeful than the ancient life began  my dear fellow said solomonson i know i know but to give away the synthesis of rubber to just shove it out of the window into the street gare leau o and when you could do with so much too  now they resumed the divergent threads of that vevey talk  solomonson had always entertained the warmest friendship and admiration for trafford and it was no new thing that he should desire a business cooperation he had been working for that in the old days at riplings he had never altogether let the possibility drop out of sight between them in spite of traffords repudiations he believed himself to be a scientific man turned to business but indeed his whole passion was for organization and finance he knew he could do everything but originate and in trafford he recognized just that rare combination of an obstinate and penetrating simplicity with constructive power which is the essential blend in the making of great intellectual initiatives to trafford belonged the secret of novel and unsuspected solutions what were fixed barriers and unsurmountable conditions to trained investigators and commonplace minds would yield to his gift of magic inquiry he could startle the accepted error into selfbetrayal other men might play the game of business infinitely better than hesolomonson knew indeed quite well that he himself could play the game infinitely better than traffordbut it rested with trafford by right divine of genius to alter the rules if only he could be induced to alter the rules secretly unostentatiously on a business footing instead of making catastrophic plunges into publicity and everything that had made trafford up to the day of his marriage was antagonistic to such strategic reservations the servant of science has as such no concern with personal consequences his business is the steady relentless clarification of knowledge the human affairs he changes the wealth he makes or destroys are no concern of his once these things weigh with him become primary he has lost his honour as a scientific man  but you must think of consequences solomonson had cried during those intermittent talks at vevey here you are shying this cheap synthetic rubber of yours into the worldfor its bound to be cheap any one can see thatlike a bomb into a marketplace whats the good of saying you dont care about the marketplace that your business is just to make bombs and drop them out of the window you smash up things just the same why youll ruin hundreds and thousands of people people living on rubber shares people working in plantations old inadaptable workers in rubber works  sir rupert was now still a little incredulous of traffords change of purpose and for a time argued conceded points then slowly he came to the conditions and methods of the new relationship he sketched out a scheme of cooperation and understandings between his firm and trafford between them both and his associated group in the city  behrens was to have rope and produce his slump in plantation shares then trafford was to publish his criticism of behrens reserving only that catalytic process which was his own originality the process that was to convert the inert theoretically correct synthetic rubber with a mysterious difference in the quality of its phases into the real right thing with behrens exploded plantation shares would recover and while their friends in the city manipulated that trafford would resign his professorship and engage himself to an ostentatious promotion syndicate for the investigation of synthetic rubber his discovery would follow immediately the group had cleared itself of plantation shares indeed he could begin planning the necessary works forthwith the large scale operations in the process were to be protected as far as possible by patents but its essential feature the addition of a specific catalytic agent could be safely dealt with as a secret process  i hate secrecy said trafford  business interjected solomonson and went on with his exposition of the relative advantages of secrecy and patent rights it was all a matter of just how many people you had to trust as that number increased the more and more advisable did it become to put your cards on the table and risk the complex uncertain protection of the patent law they went into elaborate calculations clerks were called upon to hunt up facts and prices and the table was presently littered with waste arithmetic  i believe we can do the stuff at tenpence a pound said solomonson leaning back in his chair at last and rattling his fountain pen between his teeth so soon that is as we deal in quantity tenpence we can lower the price and spread the market sixpence by sixpence in the endthere wont be any more plantations have to grow tea i say lets have an invalid dinner of chicken and champagne and go on with this its fascinating you can telephone  they dined together and solomonson on champagne rather than chicken his mind which had never shown an instants fatigue began to glow and sparkle this enterprise he declared was to be only the first of a series of vigorous exploitations the whole thing warmed him he would rather make ten thousand by such developments than a hundred thousand by mere speculation trafford had but scratched the surface of his mine of knowledge lets think of other things said sir rupert solomonson diamonds no theyve got too many tons stowed away already a diamond nowits an absolutely artificial value at any time a new discovery and one wild proprietor might bust that show lorddiamonds metals of course youve worked the colloids chiefly i suppose theres been more done in metals and alloys than anywhere theres a lot of other substances business has hardly begun to touch substances yet you know traffordflexible glass for example and things like that so far weve always taken substances for granted on our side i mean its extraordinary how narrow the outlook of business and finance isstill it never seems to lead to things never thinks ahead in this case of rubber for example  when men fight for their own hands and for profit and position in the next ten years or so i suppose they tend to become narrow  i suppose they must sir ruperts face glowed with a new idea and his voice dropped a little lower but what a pull they get trafford if perhapsthey dont eh  no said trafford with a smile and a sigh the other sort gets the pull  not this time said solomonson not with you to spot processes and me to figure out the cost he waved his hands to the litter that had been removed to a side tableand generally see how the business end of things is going         book the third     marjorie at lonely hut     chapter the first  successes   § 1  i find it hard to trace the accumulation of moods and feelings that led trafford and marjorie at last to make their extraordinary raid upon labrador in a week more things happen in the thoughts of such a man as trafford changes revocations deflections than one can chronicle in the longest of novels i have already in an earlier passage of this story sought to give an image of the confused content of a modern human mind but that pool was to represent a girl of twenty and trafford now was a man of nearly thirtyfive and touching life at a hundred points for one of the undergraduate marjories perhaps that made him less confused but it certainly made him fuller let me attempt therefore only the broad outline of his changes of purpose and activity until i come to the crucial mood that made these two lives a little worth telling about amidst the many thousands of such lives that people are living today  it took him seven years from his conclusive agreement with solomonson to become a rich and influential man it took him only seven years because already by the mere accidents of intellectual interest he was in possession of knowledge of the very greatest economic importance and because solomonson was full of that practical loyalty and honesty that distinguishes his race i think that in any case traffords vigor and subtlety of mind would have achieved the prosperity he had found necessary to himself but it might have been under less favorable auspices a much longer and more tortuous struggle success and security were never so abundant nor so easily attained by men with capacity and a sense of proportion as they are in the varied and flexible world of today we live in an affluent age with a nearly incredible continuous fresh increment of power pouring in from mechanical invention and compared with our own most other periods have been meagre and anxious and hardup times our problems are constantly less the problems of submission and consolation and continually more problems of opportunity  trafford found the opening campaign the operation with the plantation shares and his explosion of behrens pretensions extremely uncongenial it left upon his mind a confused series of memories of interviews and talks in offices for the most part dingy and slovenly of bales of presscuttings and bluepencilled financial publications of unpleasing encounters with a number of brighteyed flushed excitable and extremely cunning men of having to be reserved and limited in his talk upon all occasions and of all the worst aspects of solomonson all that part of the new treatment of life that was to make him rich gave him sensations as though he had ceased to wash himself mentally until he regretted his old life in his laboratory as a traveller in a crowded night train among filthy people might regret the bathroom he had left behind him  but the development of his manufacture of rubber was an entirely different business and for a time profoundly interesting it took him into a new astonishing world the world of largescale manufacture and industrial organization the actual planning of the works was not in itself anything essentially new to him so far as all that went it was scarcely more than the problem of arranging an experiment upon a huge and permanent scale and all that quick ingenuity that freshness and directness of mind that had made his purely scientific work so admirable had ample and agreeable scope even the importance of cost and economy at every point in the process involved no system of considerations that was altogether novel to him the british investigator knows only too well the necessity for husbanded material and inexpensive substitutes but strange factors came in a new region of interest was opened with the fact that instead of one experimenter working with the alert responsive assistance of durgan a multitude of human beingseven in the first drafts of his project they numbered already two hundred before the handling and packing could be consideredhad to watch control assist or perform every stage in a long elaborate synthesis for the first time in his life trafford encountered the reality of labour as it is known to the modern producer  it will be difficult in the future when things now subtly or widely separated have been brought together by the receding perspectives of time for the historian to realize just how completely out of the thoughts of such a young man as trafford the millions of people who live and die in organized productive industry had been that vast world of toil and weekly anxiety illtrained and stupidly directed effort and mental and moral feebleness had been as much beyond the living circle of his experience as the hosts of genghis khan or the social life of the forbidden city consider the limitations of his world in all his life hitherto he had never been beyond a certain prescribed area of londons immensities except by the most casual and uninstructive straying he knew chelsea and kensington and the north bank and as a boy battersea park and all the strip between kensington and charing cross with some scraps of the strand as far as the law courts a shop or so in tottenham court road and fragments about the british museum and holborn and regents park a range up edgware road to maida vale the routes west and southwest through uxbridge and putney to the country and wimbledon common and putney heath he had never been on hampstead heath nor visited the botanical gardens nor gone down the thames below london bridge nor seen sydenham nor epping forest nor the victoria park take a map and blot all he knew and see how vast is the area left untouched all industrial london all wholesale london great oceans of human beings fall into that excluded area the homes he knew were comfortable homes the poor he knew were the parasitic and dependent poor of the west the shops good retail shops the factories for the most part engaged in dressmaking  of course he had been informed about this vast rest of london he knew that as a matter of fact it existed was populous portentous puzzling he had heard of slums read tales of mean streets and marvelled in a shallow transitory way at such wide wildernesses of life apparently supported by nothing at all in a state of grey darkling but prolific discomfort like the princess who wondered why the people having no bread did not eat cake he could never clearly understand why the population remained there did not migrate to more attractive surroundings he had discussed the problems of those wildernesses as young men do rather confidently very ignorantly had dismissed them recurred to them and forgotten them amidst a press of other interests but now it all suddenly became real to him with the intensity of a startling and intimate contact he discovered this limitless unknown greater london this london of the majority as if he had never thought of it before he went out to inspect favourable sites in regions whose very names were unfamiliar to him travelled on dirty little intraurban railway lines to hitherto unimagined railway stations found parks churches workhouses institutions publichouses canals factories gasworks warehouses foundries and sidings amidst a multitudinous dinginess of mean houses shabby backyards and illkept streets there seemed to be no limits to this threadbare side of london it went on northward eastward and over the thames southward for mile after mileendlessly the factories and so forth clustered in lines and banks upon the means of communication the homes stretched between and infinitude of parallelograms of grimy boxes with publichouses at the corners and churches and chapels in odd places towering over which rose the council schools big blunt truncatedlooking masses the means to an education as blunt and truncated born of tradition and confused purposes achieving by accident what they achieve at all  and about this sordidlooking wilderness went a population that seemed at first as sordid it was in no sense a tragic population but it saw little of the sun felt the wind but rarely and so had a white dull skin that looked degenerate and ominous to a westend eye it was not naked nor barefooted but it wore cheap clothes that were tawdry when new and speedily became faded discoloured dusty and draggled it was slovenly and almost wilfully ugly in its speech and gestures and the food it ate was rough and coarse if abundant the eggs it consumed tastedeverything tasted its milk its beer its bread was degraded by base adulterations its meat was hacked red stuff that hung in the dusty air until it was sold east of the city trafford could find no place where by his standards he could get a tolerable meal tolerably served the entertainment of this eastern london was jingle its religion claptrap its reading feeble and sensational rubbish without kindliness or breadth and if this great industrial multitude was neither tortured nor driven nor cruelly treatedas the slaves and common people of other days have beenyet it was universally anxious perpetually anxious about urgent small necessities and petty dissatisfying things  that was the general effect of this new region in which he had sought out and found the fortunate site for his manufacture of rubber and against this background it was that he had now to encounter a crowd of selected individuals and weld them into a harmonious and successful process they came out from their millions to him dingy clumsy and at first it seemed without any individuality insensibly they took on character rounded off by unaccustomed methods into persons as marked and distinctive as any he had known  there was dowd for instance the technical assistant whom he came to call in his private thoughts dowd the disinherited dowd had seemed a rather awkward potentially insubordinate young man of unaccountably extensive and curiously limited attainments he had begun his career in a crowded home behind and above a bakers shop in hoxton he had gone as a boy into the works of a clerkenwell electric engineer and there he had developed that craving for knowledge which is so common in poor men of the energetic type he had gone to classes read with a sort of fury feeding his mind on the cheap and adulterated instruction of grantearning crammers and on stale meretricious and illchosen books his mental food indeed was the exact parallel of the rough abundant cheap and nasty groceries and meat that gave the eastender his spots and dyspeptic complexion the cheap textbooks were like canned meat and dangerous with intellectual ptomaines the rascally encyclopædias like weak and whitened bread and dowds mental complexion too was leaden and spotted yet essentially he wasnt trafford found by any means bad stuff where his knowledge had had a chance of touching reality it became admirable and he was full of energy in his work and a sort of honest zeal about the things of the mind the two men grew from an acute mutual criticism into a mutual respect  at first it seemed to trafford that when he met dowd he was only meeting dowd but a time came when it seemed to him that in meeting dowd he was meeting all that vast new england outside the range of rulingclass dreams that multitudinous greater england cheaply treated rather out of health angry energetic and now becoming intelligent and critical that england which organized industrialism has created there were nights when he thought for hours about dowd other figures grouped themselves round himmarkham the head clerk the quintessence of eastend respectability who saw to the packing miss peckover an extelegraph operator a woman so entirely reliable and unobservant that the most betraying phase of the secret process could be confidently entrusted to her hands behind them were clerks workmen motorvan men workgirls a crowd of wageearners from amidst which some individual would assume temporary importance and interest by doing something wrong getting into trouble becoming insubordinate and having contributed a little vivid story to traffords gathering impressions of life drop back again into undistinguished subordination  dowd became at last entirely representative  when first trafford looked dowd in the eye he met something of the hostile interest one might encounter in a swordsman ready to begin a duel there was a watchfulness an immense reserve they discussed the work and the terms of their relationship and all the while trafford felt there was something almost threateningly not mentioned  presently he learnt from a silvertown employer what that concealed aspect was dowd was that sort of man who makes trouble disposed to strike rather than not upon a grievance with a taste for openair meetings a member obstinately adherent in spite of friendly remonstrance of the social democratic party this in spite of his clear duty to a wife and two small white knobby children for a time he would not talk to trafford of anything but businesstrafford was so manifestly the enemy not to be trusted the adventurous plutocrat the exploiterwhen at last dowd did open out he did so defiantly throwing opinions at trafford as a mob might hurl bricks at windows at last they achieved a sort of friendship and understanding an amiability as it were in hostility but never from first to last would he talk to trafford as one gentleman to another between them and crossed only by flimsy temporary bridges was his sense of incurable grievances and fundamental injustice he seemed incapable of forgetting the disadvantages of his birth and upbringing the inferiority and disorder of the house that sheltered him the poor food that nourished him the deadened air he breathed the limited leisure the inadequate books implicit in his every word and act was the assurance that but for this handicap he could have filled traffords place while trafford would certainly have failed in his  for all these things dowd made trafford responsible he held him to that inexorably  you sweat us he said speaking between his teeth you limit us you stifle us and away there in the westend you and the women you keep waste the plunder  trafford attempted palliation after all he said its not me so particularly  but it is said dowd  its the system things go upon  youre the responsible part of it you have freedom you have power and endless opportunity  trafford shrugged his shoulders  its because your sort wants too much said dowd that my sort hasnt enough  tell me how to organize things better  much youd care theyll organize themselves everything is drifting to class separation the growing discontent the growing hardship of the masses then youll see  then whats going to happen  overthrow and social democracy  how is that going to work  dowd had been cornered by that before i dont care if it doesnt work he snarled so long as we smash up this were getting too sick to care what comes after  dowd said trafford abruptly im not so satisfied with things  dowd looked at him askance youll get reconciled to it he said its ugly herebut its all right thereat the spending end your sort has got to grab your sort has got to spenduntil the thing works out and the social revolution makes an end of you  and then  dowd became busy with his work  trafford stuck his hands in his pockets and stared out of the dingy factory window  i dont object so much to your diagnosis he said as to your remedy it doesnt strike me as a remedy  its an end said dowd anyhow my god when i think of all the women and shirkers flaunting and frittering away there in the west while here men and women toil and worry and starve he stopped short like one who feels too full for controlled speech  dowd said trafford after a fair pause what would you do if you were me  do said dowd  yes said trafford as one who reconsiders it what would you do  now thats a curious question mr trafford said dowd turning to regard him meaningif i were in your place  yes said trafford what would you do in my place  i should sell out of this place jolly quick he said  sell said trafford softly  yessell and start a socialist daily right off an absolutely independent unbiassed socialist daily  and what would that do  it would stir people up every day it would stir people up  but you see i cant edit i havent the money for half a year of a socialist daily and meanwhile people want rubber  dowd shook his head you mean that you and your wife want to have the spending of six or eight thousand a year he said  i dont make half of that said trafford  wellhalf of that pressed dowd its all the same to me  trafford reflected the point where i dont agree with you he said is in supposing that my scale of livingover there is directly connected with the scale of livingabout here  well isnt it  directly i said no if we just stopped itover therethered be no improvement here in fact for a time it would mean dislocations it might mean permanent hopeless catastrophic dislocation you know that as well as i do suppose the westend becametolstoyan the east would become chaos  not much likelihood sneered dowd  thats another question that we earn together here and that i spend alone over there its unjust and bad but it isnt a thing that admits of any simple remedy where we differ dowd is about that remedy i admit the disease as fully as you do i as much as you want to see the dawn of a great change in the ways of human living but i dont think the diagnosis is complete and satisfactory our problem is an intricate muddle of disorders not one simple disorder and i dont see what treatment is indicated  socialism said dowd is indicated  you might as well say that health is indicated said trafford with a note of impatience in his voice does any one question that if we could have this socialist state in which every one is devoted and every one is free in which there is no waste and no want and beauty and brotherhood prevail universally we wouldnt but you socialists have no scheme of government no scheme of economic organization no intelligible guarantees of personal liberty no method of progress no ideas about marriage no planexcept those little pickpocket plans of the fabians that you despise as much as i dofor making this order into that other order youve never yet taken the trouble to work out even in principle really you know dowd what is the good of pointing at my wifes dresses and waving the red flag at me and talking of human miseries  it seems to wake you up a bit said dowd with characteristic irrelevance   § 2  the accusing finger of dowd followed trafford into his dreams  behind it was his greytoned intelligent resentful face his smouldering eyes his slightly frayed collar and vivid illchosen tie at times trafford could almost hear his flat insistent voice his measured hless speech dowd was so penetratingly rightand so ignorant of certain essentials so wrong in his forecasts and ultimates it was true beyond disputing that trafford as compared with dowd had opportunity power of a sort the prospect and possibility of leisure he admitted the liability that followed on that advantage it expressed so entirely the spirit of his training that with trafford the noble maxim of the older socialists from each according to his ability to each according to his need received an intuitive acquiescence he had no more doubt than dowd that dowd was the victim of a subtle evasive injustice innocently and helplessly underbred underfed cramped and crippled and that all his own surplus made him in a sense dowds debtor  but dowds remedies  trafford made himself familiar with the socialist and labor newspapers and he was as much impressed by their honest resentments and their enthusiastic hopefulness as he was repelled by their haste and ignorance their cocksure confidence in untried reforms and impudent teachers their indiscriminating progressiveness their impulsive lapses into hatred misrepresentation and vehement personal abuse he was in no mood for the humours of human character and he found the illmasked feuds and jealousies of the leaders the sham statecraft of g b magdeberg mp the sham machiavellism of dorvil the sham persistent goodheartedness of will pipes discouraging and irritating altogether it seemed to him the conscious popular movement in politics both in and out of parliament was a mere formless and indeterminate aspiration it was a confused part of the general confusion symptomatic perhaps but exercising no controls and no direction  his attention passed from the consideration of this completely revolutionary party to the general field of social reform with the naïve directness of a scientific man he got together the published literature of half a dozen flourishing agitations and philanthropies interviewed prominent and rather embarrassed personages attended meetings and when he found the speeches too tiresome to follow watched the audience about him he even looked up aunt plessingtons movement and filled her with wild hopes and premature boastings about a promising convert marjories brought him round at last said aunt plessington i knew i could trust my little madge his impression was not the cynics impression of these wide shallows of activity progress and social reform are not he saw mere cloaks of hypocrisy a wealth of good intention lies behind them in spite of their manifest futility there is much dishonesty due to the blundering desire for consistency in people of hasty intention much artless and a little calculated selfseeking but far more vanity and amiable feebleness of mind in their general attainment of failure the plessingtons struck him as being after all very typical of the publicist at large quite devoted very industrious extremely presumptuous and essentially thinwitted they would cheat like illbred children for example on some petty point of reputation but they could be trusted to expend ineffectually indeed but with the extremest technical integrity whatever sums of money their adherents could get together  he emerged from this inquiry into the proposed remedies and palliatives for dowds wrongs with a better opinion of peoples hearts and a worse one of their heads than he had hitherto entertained  pursuing this line of thought he passed from the politicians and practical workers to the economists and sociologists he spent the entire leisure of the second summer after the establishment of the factory upon sociological and economic literature at the end of that bout of reading he attained a vivid realization of the garrulous badness that rules in this field of work and the prevailing slovenliness and negligence in regard to it he chanced one day to look up the article on socialism in the new encyclopædia britannica and found in its entire failure to state the case for or against modern socialism to trace its origins or to indicate any rational development in the movement a symptom of the universal laxity of interest in these matters indeed the writer did not appear to have heard of modern socialism at all he discussed collective and individualist methods very much as a rather illread schoolgirl in a hurry for her college debating society might have done compared with the treatment of engineering or biological science in the same compilation this article became almost symbolical of the prevailing habitual incompetence with which all this system of questions is still handled the sciences were done scantily and carelessly enough but they admitted at any rate the possibility of completeness this did not even pretend to thoroughness  one might think such things had no practical significance and at the back of it all was dowd remarkably more impatient each year confessing the failure of parliamentary methods of trades unionism hinting more and more plainly at the advent of a permanent guerilla war against capital at the general strike and sabotage  its coming to that said dowd its coming to that  whats the good of it he said echoing traffords words its a sort of relief to the feelings why shouldnt we   § 3  but you must not suppose that at any time these huge grey problems of our social foundations and the riddle of intellectual confusion one reaches through them and the yet broader riddles of human purpose that open beyond constitute the whole of traffords life during this time when he came back to marjorie and his home a curtain of unreality fell between him and all these things it was as if he stepped through such boundaries as alice passed to reach her wonderland the other world became a dream again as if he closed the pages of a vivid book and turned to things about him or again it was as if he drew down the blind of a window that gave upon a landscape grave darkling ominous and faced the warm realities of a brightly illuminated room  in a year or so he had the works so smoothly organized and dowd so reconciled trained and encouraged that his own daily presence was unnecessary and he would go only three and then only two mornings a week to conduct those secret phases in the preparation of his catalytic that even dowd could not be trusted to know he reverted more and more completely to his own proper world  and the first shock of discovering that greater london which isnt in it passed away by imperceptible degrees things that had been as vivid and startling as new wounds became unstimulating and ineffective with repetition he got used to the change from belgravia to east ham from east ham to belgravia he fell in with the unusual persuasion in belgravia that given a firm and prompt home secretary east ham could be trusted to go onfor quite a long time anyhow one cannot sit down for all ones life in the face of insoluble problems he had a motorcar now that far outshone magnets and he made the transit from west to east in the minimum of time and with the minimum of friction it ceased to be more disconcerting that he should have workers whom he could dismiss at a weeks notice to want or prostitution than that he should have a servant waiting behind his chair things were so the main current of his lifeand the main current of his life flowed through marjorie and his homecarried him on rubber was his but there were still limitless worlds to conquer he began to take up working under circumstances of considerable secrecy at solomonsons laboratories at riplings to which he would now go by motorcar for two or three days at a time the possibility of a cheap resilient and very tough substance rubber glass that was to be solomonson was assured the road surface of the future   § 4  the confidence of solomonson had made it impossible for trafford to alter his style of living almost directly upon the conclusion of their agreement he went back to marjorie to broach a financially emancipated phase they took a furnished house at shackleford near godalming in surrey and there they lived for nearly a yearusing their chelsea home only as a town apartment for trafford when business held him in london and there it was in the pretty surrey country with the sweet air of pine and heather in marjories blood that their second child was born it was a sturdy little boy whose only danger in life seemed to be the superfluous energy with which he resented its slightest disrespect of his small but important requirements  when it was time for marjorie to return to london spring had come round again and traffords conceptions of life were adapting themselves to the new scale upon which they were now to do things while he was busy creating his factory in the east end marjorie was displaying an equal if a less original constructive energy in sussex square near lancaster gate for there it was the new home was to be established she set herself to furnish and arrange it so as to produce the maximum of surprise and chagrin in daphne and she succeeded admirably the magnets now occupied a flat in whitehall court the furniture magnet had insisted upon buying himself with all the occult cunning of the humorist in these matters and not even daphne could blind herself to the superiority both in arrangement and detail of marjories home that was very satisfactory and so too was the inevitable exaggeration of traffords financial importance he can do what he likes in the rubber world said marjorie in mincing lane where they deal in rubber shares they used to call him and sir rupert the invaders now they call them the conquering heroes of course its mere childs play to godwin but as he said we want money it wont really interfere with his more important interests  i do not know why both those sisters were more vulgarly competitive with each other than with any one else i have merely to record the fact that they were so  the effect upon the rest of marjories family was equally gratifying mr pope came to the housewarming as though he had never had the slightest objection to traffords antecedents and told him casually after dinner that marjorie had always been his favourite daughter and that from the first he had expected great things of her he told magnet who was the third man of the party that he only hoped syd and rom would do as well as their elder sisters afterwards in the drawingroom he whacked marjorie suddenly and very startlingly on the shoulderbladeit was the first bruise he had given her since buryhamstreet days youve made a man of him maggots he said  the quiet smile of the christian scientist was becoming now the fixed expression of mrs popes face and it scarcely relaxed for a moment as she surveyed her daughters splendours she had triumphantly refused to worry over a rather serious speculative disappointment but her faith in her prophets spiritual power had been strengthened rather than weakened by the manifest insufficiency of his financial prestidigitations and she was getting through life quite radiantly now smiling at but not of course giving way to beggars smiling at toothaches and headaches both her own and other peoples smiling away doubts smiling away everything that bows the spirit of those who are still in the bonds of the flesh  afterwards the children came round syd and rom now with skirts down and hair up and rather stiff in the fine big rooms and theodore in a high collar and very anxious to get trafford on his side in his ambition to chuck a proposed bank clerkship and go in for professional aviation  it was pleasant to be respected by her family again but the mind of marjorie was soon reaching out to the more novel possibilities of her changed position she need no longer confine herself to teas and afternoons she could now delightful thought give dinners dinners are mere vulgarities for the vulgar but in the measure of your brains does a dinner become a work of art there is the happy blending of a modern and distinguished simplicity with a choice of items essentially good and delightful and just a little bit not what was expected there is the still more interesting and difficult blending and arrangement of the diners from the first marjorie resolved on a round table and the achievement of that rare and wonderful thing general conversation she had a clear centre with a circle of silver bowls filled with short cut flowers and low shaded old silver candlesticks adapted to the electric light the first dinner was a nervous experience for her but happily trafford seemed unconscious of the importance of the occasion and talked very easily and well at last she attained her old ambition to see sir roderick dover in her house and there was remington the editor of the blue weekly and his silent gracious wife edward crampton the historian full of surprising new facts about kosciusko the solomonsons and mrs millingham and mary gasthorne the novelist it was a good talking lot remington sparred agreeably with the old toryism of dover flank attacks upon them both were delivered by mrs millingham and trafford crampton instanced hungarian parallels and was happily averted by mary gasthorne with travel experiences in the carpathians the diamonds of lady solomonson and mrs remington flashed and winked across the shining table as their wearers listened with unmistakable intelligence and when the ladies had gone upstairs sir rupert solomonson told all the men exactly what he thought of the policy of the blue weekly a balanced commonsense judgment upstairs lady solomonson betrayed a passion of admiration for mrs remington and mrs millingham mumbled depreciation of the same ladys intelligence in mary gasthornes unwilling ear shes passive said mrs millingham she bores him  for a time marjorie found dinnergiving delightfulit is like picking and arranging posies of human flowersand fruitsand perhaps a little dried grass and it was not long before she learnt that she was esteemed a success as a hostess she gathered her earlier bunches in the carmel and solomonson circle with a stiffening from among the literary and scientific friends of trafford and his mother and one or two casual and undervalued blossoms from aunt plessingtons active promiscuities she had soon a gaily flowering garden of her own to pick from its strength and finest display lay in its increasing proportion of political intellectuals men in and about the house who relaxed their minds from the tense detailed alertness needed in political intrigues by conversation that rose at times to the level of the smarter sort of article in the halfcrown reviews the women were more difficult than the men and marjorie found herself wishing at times that girl novelists and playwrights were more abundant or women writers on the average younger these talked generally well and one or two capable women of her own type talked and listened with an effect of talking so many other women either chattered disturbingly or else did not listen with an effect of not talking at all and so made gaps about the table many of these latter had to be asked because they belonged to the class of inevitable wives sinequanons and through them she learnt the value of that priceless variety of kindly unselfish men who can create the illusion of attentive conversation in the most uncomfortable and suspicious natures without producing backwater and eddy in the general flow of talk  indisputably marjories dinners were successful of course the abundance and æsthetic achievements of mrs lee still seemed to her immeasurably out of reach but it was already possible to show aunt plessington how the thing ought really to be done aunt plessington with her narrow lank austerely served table with a sort of quarterdeck at her own end and a subjugated forecastle round hubert and accordingly the plessingtons were invited and shown and to a party too that restrained aunt plessington from her usual conversational prominence  these opening years of traffords commercial phase were full of an engaging activity for marjorie as for him and for her far more completely than for him were the profounder solicitudes of life lost sight of in the bright succession of immediate events  marjorie did not let her social development interfere with her duty to society in the larger sense two years after the vigorous and resentful godwin came a second son and a year and a half later a third thats enough said marjorie now weve got to rear them the nursery at sussex square had always been a show part of the house but it became her crowning achievement she had never forgotten the lee display at vevey the shining splendours of modern maternity the books the apparatus the space and light and air the whole second floor was altered to accommodate these four triumphant beings who absorbed the services of two nurses a swiss nursery governess and two housemaidsnot to mention those several hundred obscure individuals who were yielding a sustaining profit in the east end at any rate they were very handsome and promising children and little margharita could talk three languages with a childish fluency and invent and write a short fable in either french or germanwith only as much misspelling as any child of eight may be permitted  then there sprang up a competition between marjorie and the able pretty wife of halford wallace most promising of undersecretaries they gave dinners against each other they discovered young artists against each other they went to firstnights and dressed against each other marjorie was ruddy and tall mrs halford wallace dark and animated halford wallace admired marjorie trafford was insensible to mrs halford wallace they played for points so vague that it was impossible for any one to say which was winning but none the less they played like artists for all they were worth  traffords rapid prosperity and his implicit promise of still wider activities and successes brought him innumerable acquaintances and many friends he joined two or three distinguished clubs he derived an uncertain interest from a series of weekend visits to ample goodmannered households and for a time he found a distraction in little flashes of travel to countries that caught at his imagination morocco montenegro southern russia  i do not know whether marjorie might not have been altogether happy during this early sussex square period if it had not been for an unconquerable uncertainty about trafford but ever and again she became vaguely apprehensive of some perplexing unreality in her position she had never had any such profundity of discontent as he experienced it was nothing clear nothing that actually penetrated distressing her it was at most an uneasiness for him the whole fabric of life was as it were torn and pieced by a provocative sense of depths unplumbed that robbed it of all its satisfactions for her these glimpses were as yet rare mere moments of doubt that passed again and left her active and assured   § 5  it was only after they had been married six or seven years that trafford began to realize how widely his attitudes to marjorie varied he emerged slowly from a naïve unconsciousness of his fluctuationsa naïve unconsciousness of inconsistency that for most men and women remains throughout life his ruling idea that she and he were friends equals confederates knowing everything about each other cooperating in everything was very fixed and firm but indeed that had become the remotest rendering of their relationship their lives were lives of intimate disengagement they came nearest to fellowship in relation to their children there they shared an immense common pride beyond that was a less confident appreciation of their common house and their joint effect and then they liked and loved each other tremendously they could play upon each other and please each other in a hundred different ways and they did so quite consciously observing each other with the completest externality she was still in many ways for him the bright girl he had admired in the examination still the mysterious dignified transfiguration of that delightful creature on the tragically tender verge of motherhood these memories were of more power with him than the present realities of her fullgrown strength and capacity he petted and played with the girl still he was still tender and solicitous for that early woman he admired and cooperated also with the capable narrowly ambitious beautiful lady into which marjorie had developed but those remoter experiences it was that gave the deeper emotions to their relationship  the conflict of aims that had at last brought trafford from scientific investigation into business had left behind it a little scar of hostility he felt his sacrifice he felt that he had given something for her that she had had no right to exact that he had gone beyond the free mutualities of honest love and paid a price for her he had deflected the whole course of his life for her and he was entitled to repayments unconsciously he had become a slightly jealous husband he resented inattentions and absences he felt she ought to be with him and orient all her proceedings towards him he did not like other people to show too marked an appreciation of her she had a healthy love of admiration and in addition her social ambitions made it almost inevitable that at times she should use her great personal charm to secure and retain adherents he was ashamed to betray the resentments thus occasioned and his silence widened the separation more than any protest could have done  for his own part he gave her no cause for a reciprocal jealousy other women did not excite his imagination very greatly and he had none of the ready disposition to lapse to other comforters which is so frequent a characteristic of the husband out of touch with his lifes companion he was perhaps an exceptional man in his steadfast loyalty to his wife he had come to her as new to love as she had been he had never in his life taken that one decisive illicit step which changes all the aspects of sexual life for a man even more than for a woman love for him was a thing solemn simple and unspoilt he perceived that it was not so for most other men but that did little to modify his own private attitude in his curious scrutiny of the people about him he did not fail to note the drift of adventures and infidelities that glimmers along beneath the even surface of our social life one or two of his intimate friends solomonson was one of them passed through affairs once or twice those dim proceedings splashed upward to the surface in an open scandal there came remingtons startling elopement with isabel rivers the writer which took two brilliant and inspiring contemporaries suddenly and distressingly out of traffords world trafford felt none of that rage and forced and jealous contempt for the delinquents in these matters which is common in the illregulated virtuous mind indeed he was far more sympathetic with than hostile to the offenders he had brains and imagination to appreciate the grim pathos of a process that begins as a hopeful quest full of the suggestion of noble possibilities full of the craving for missed intensities of fellowship and realization that loiters involuntarily towards beauties and delights and ends at last too often after gratification of an appetite in artificially hideous exposures and the pelting misrepresentations of the timidly wellbehaved vile but the general effect of pitiful evasions of unavoidable meannesses of draggled heroics and tortuously insincere explanations confirmed him in his aversion from this labyrinthine trouble of extraneous love  but if trafford was a faithful husband he ceased to be a happy and confident one there grew up in him a vast hinterland of thoughts and feelings an accumulation of unspoken and largely of unformulated things in which his wife had no share and it was in that hinterland that his essential self had its abiding place  it came as a discovery it remained for ever after a profoundly disturbing perplexity that he had talked to marjorie most carelessly easily and seriously during their courtship and their honeymoon he remembered their early intercourse now as an immense happy freedom in love then afterwards a curtain had fallen that almost delirious sense of escaping from oneself of having at last found some one from whom there need be no concealment some one before whom one could stand nakedsouled and assured of love as one stands before ones god faded so that he scarce observed its passing but only discovered at last that it had gone he misunderstood and met misunderstanding he found he could hurt her by the things he said and be exquisitely hurt by her failure to apprehend the spirit of some illexpressed intention and it was so vitally important not to hurt not to be hurt at first he only perceived that he reserved himself then there came the intimation of the question was she also perhaps in such another hinterland as his keeping herself from him  he had perceived the cessation of that first bright outbreak of selfrevelation this relapse into the secrecies of individuality quite early in their married life i have already told of his first efforts to bridge their widening separation by walks and talks in the country and by the long pilgrimage among the alps that had ended so unexpectedly at vevey in the retrospect the years seemed punctuated with phases when we must talk dominated their intercourse and each time the impulse of that recognized need passed away by insensible degrees againwith nothing said   § 6  marjorie cherished an obstinate hope that trafford would take up political questions and go into parliament it seemed to her that there was something about him altogether graver and wider than most of the active politicians she knew she liked to think of those gravities assuming a practical form of trafford very rapidly and easily coming forward into a position of cardinal significance it gave her general expenditure a quality of concentration without involving any uncongenial limitation to suppose it aimed at the preparation of a statesmans circle whenever trafford chose to adopt that assumption little men in great positions came to her house and talked with opaque selfconfidence at her table she measured them against her husband while she played the admiring female disciple to their halfconfidential talk she felt that he could take up these questions and measures that they reduced to trite twaddle open the wide relevancies behind them and make them magically significant sweep away the encrusting pettiness the personalities and arbitrary prejudices but why didnt he begin to do it she threw out hints he seemed blind towards she exercised miracles of patience while he ignored her baits she came near intrigue in her endeavor to entangle him in political affairs for a time it seemed to her that she was succeedingi have already told of his phase of inquiry and interest in sociopolitical workand then he relapsed into a scornful restlessness and her hopes weakened again  but he could not concentrate his mind he could not think where to begin day followed day each with its attacks upon his intention its petty just claims its attractive novelties of aspect the telephone bell rang the letters flopped into the hall malcom the butler seemed always at hand with some distracting oblong on his salver dowd was developing ideas for a reconstructed organization of the factory solomonson growing enthusiastic about rubberglass his house seemed full of women marjorie had an engagement for him to keep or the children were coming in to say goodnight to his irritated brain the whole scheme of his life presented itself at last as a tissue of interruptions which prevented his looking clearly at reality more and more definitely he realized he wanted to get away and think his former life of research became invested with an effect of immense dignity and of a steadfast singleness of purpose  but trafford was following his own lights upon his own lines he was returning to that faith in the supreme importance of thought and knowledge upon which he had turned his back when he left pure research behind him to that familiar end he came by an unfamiliar route after his long unsatisfying examination of social reform movements and social and political theories immaturity haste and presumption vitiated all that region and it seemed to him less and less disputable that the only escape for mankind from a continuing extravagant futility lay through the attainment of a quite unprecedented starkness and thoroughness of thinking about all these questions this conception of a needed renascence obsessed him more and more and the persuasion deeply felt if indistinctly apprehended that somewhere in such an effort there was a part for him to play  life is too great for us or too petty it gives us no tolerable middle way between baseness and greatness we must die daily on the levels of ignoble compromise or perish tragically among the precipices on the one hand is a lifeunsatisfying and secure a plane of dulled gratifications mean advantages petty triumphs adaptations acquiescences and submissions and on the other a steep and terrible climb set with sharp stones and bramble thickets and the possibilities of grotesque dislocations and the snares of such temptation as comes only to those whose minds have been quickened by high desire and the challenge of insoluble problems and the intimations of issues so complex and great demanding such a nobility of purpose such a steadfastness alertness and openness of mind that they fill the heart of man with despair  there were moods when trafford would as people say pull himself together and struggle with his gnawing discontent he would compare his lot with that of other men reproach himself for a monstrous greed and ingratitude he remonstrated with himself as one might remonstrate with a pampered child refusing to be entertained by a whole handsome nursery full of toys other men did their work in the world methodically and decently did their duty by their friends and belongings were manifestly patient through dullness steadfastly cheerful ready to meet vexations with a humorous smile and grateful for orderly pleasures was he abnormal or was he in some unsuspected way unhealthy trafford neglected no possible explanations did he want this great renascence of the human mind because he was suffering from some subtle form of indigestion he invoked independently of each other the aid of two distinguished specialists they both told him in exactly the same voice and with exactly the same air of guineas well earned what you want mr trafford is a change  trafford brought his mind to bear upon the instances of contentment about him he developed an opinion that all men and many women were potentially at least as restless as himself a huge proportion of the usage and education in modern life struck upon him now as being a training in contentment or rather in keeping quiet and not upsetting things the serious and responsible life of an ordinary prosperous man fulfilling the requirements of our social organization fatigues and neither completely satisfies nor completely occupies still less does the responsible part of the life of a woman of the prosperous classes engage all her energies or hold her imagination and there has grown up a great informal organization of employments games ceremonies social routines travel to consume these surplus powers and excessive cravings which might otherwise change or shatter the whole order of human living he began to understand the forced preoccupation with cricket and golf the shooting visiting and so forth to which the young people of the economically free classes in the community are trained he discovered a theory for hobbies and specialized interests he began to see why people go to scotland to get away from london and come to london to get away from scotland why they crowd to and fro along the riviera swarm over switzerland shoot yacht hunt and maintain an immense apparatus of racing and motoring because so they are able to remain reasonably contented with the world as it is he perceived too that a man who has missed or broken through the training to this kind of life does not again very readily subdue himself to the security of these systematized distractions his own upbringing had been antipathetic to any such adaptations his years of research had given him the habit of naked intimacy with truth filled him with a craving for reality and the destructive acids of a relentless critical method  he began to understand something of the psychology of vice to comprehend how small a part mere sensuality how large a part the spirit of adventure and the craving for illegality may play in the career of those who are called evil livers mere animal impulses and curiosities it had always seemed possible to him to control but now he was beginning to apprehend the power of that passion for escape at any cost in any way from the petty weakly stimulating competitive motives of lowgrade and lawabiding prosperity  for a time trafford made an earnest effort to adjust himself to the position in which he found himself and make a working compromise with his disturbing forces he tried to pick up the scientific preoccupation of his earlier years he made extensive schemes to solomonsons great concern whereby he might to a large extent disentangle himself from business he began to hunt out forgotten notebooks and yellowing sheets of memoranda he found the resumption of research much more difficult than he had ever supposed possible he went so far as to plan a laboratory and to make some inquiries as to site and the cost of building to the great satisfaction not only of marjorie but of his mother old mrs trafford had never expressed her concern at his abandonment of molecular physics for moneymaking but now in her appreciation of his return to pure investigation she betrayed her sense of his departure  but in his heart he felt that this methodical establishment of virtue by limitation would not suffice for him he said no word of this scepticism as it grew in his mind marjorie was still under the impression that he was returning to research and that she was free to contrive the steady preparation for that happier day when he should assume his political inheritance and then presently a queer little dispute sprang up between them suddenly for the first time since he took to business trafford found himself limiting her again she was disposed partly through the natural growth of her circle and her setting and partly through a movement on the part of mrs halford wallace to move from sussex square into a larger more picturesquely built house in a more central position she particularly desired a good staircase he met her intimations of this development with a curious and unusual irritation the idea of moving bothered him he felt that exaggerated annoyance which is so often a concomitant of overwrought nerves they had a dispute that was almost a quarrel and though marjorie dropped the matter for a time he could feel she was still at work upon it     chapter the second  trafford decides to go   § 1  a haunting desire to go away into solitude grew upon trafford very steadily he wanted intensely to think and london and marjorie would not let him think he wanted therefore to go away out of london and marjories world he wanted he felt to go away alone and face god and clear things up in his mind by imperceptible degrees this desire anticipated its realization his activities were affected more and more by intimations of a determined crisis one eventful day it seemed to him that his mind passed quite suddenly from desire to resolve he found himself with a project already broadly definite hitherto he hadnt been at all clear where he could go from the first almost he had felt that this change he needed the change by which he was to get out of the thickets of work and perplexity and distraction that held him captive must be a physical as well as a mental removal he must go somewhere still and isolated where sustained detached thinking was possible his preference if he had one inclined him to some solitude among the himalaya mountains that came perhaps from kim and the precedent of the hindoos religious retreat from the world but this retreat he contemplated was a retreat that aimed at a return a clarified and strengthened resumption of the world and then suddenly as if he had always intended it labrador flashed through his thoughts like a familiar name that had been for a time quite unaccountably forgotten  the word labrador drifted to him one day from an adjacent table as he sat alone at lunch in the liberal union club some bore was reciting the substance of a lecture to a fellowmember seems to be a remarkable country said the speaker mineral wealth hardly glanced at you know furs and a few score indians and at our doors practicallyat our doors  trafford ceased to listen his mind was taking up this idea of labrador he wondered why he had not thought of labrador before  he had two or three streams of thought flowing in his mind as a man who muses alone is apt to do marjories desire to move had reappeared a particular group of houses between berkeley square and park lane had taken hold of her fancy she had urged the acquisition of one upon him that morning and this kept coming up into consciousness like a wrong thread in a tapestry moreover he was watching his fellowmembers with a critical rather than a friendly eye a halfspeculative halfhostile contemplation of his habitual associates was one of the queer aspects of this period of unsettlement they exasperated him by their massive contentment with the surface of things they came in one after another patting their ties or pulling at the lapels of their coats and looked about them for vacant places with a conscious ease of manner that irritated his nerves no doubt they were all more or less successful and distinguished men matter for conversation and food for anecdotes but why did they trouble to give themselves the air of it they halted or sat down by friends enunciated vapid remarks in sonorous voices and opened conversations in trite phrases about london architecture about the political situation or the mornings newspaper conversations that ought he felt to have been thrown away unopened so stale and needless they seemed to him they were judges lawyers of all sorts bankers company promoters railway managers stockbrokers pressmen politicians men of leisure he wondered if indeed they were as opaque as they seemed wondered with the helpless wonder of a man of exceptional mental gifts whether any of them at any stage had had such thoughts as his had wanted as acutely as he did now to get right out of the world did old booch over there for example guzzling oysters cry at times upon the unknown god in the vast silences of the night but booch of course was a member or something of the house of laymen and very sound on the thirtynine articlesa man who ate oysters like that could swallow anythingand in the vast silences of the night he was probably heavily and noisily asleep  blenkins the gentlemanly colleague of denton in the control of the old country gazette appeared on his way to the paydesk gesticulating amiably enroute to any possible friend trafford returned his salutation and pulled himself together immediately after in fear that he had scowled for he hated to be churlish to any human being blenkins too it might be had sorrow and remorse and periods of passionate selfdistrust and selfexamination maybe blenkins could weep salt tears as blenkins no doubt under suitable swordplay would reveal heart and viscera as quivering and oozy as any mans  but to traffords jaundiced eyes just then it seemed that if you slashed blenkins across he would probably cut like a cheese  now in labrador  so soon as blenkins had cleared trafford followed him to the paydesk and went on upstairs to the smokingroom thinking of labrador long ago he had read the story of wallace and hubbard in that wilderness  there was much to be said for a winter in labrador it was cold it was clear infinitely lonely with a keen edge of danger and hardship and never a letter or a paper  one could provision a hut and sit wrapped in fur watching the northern lights  im off to labrador said trafford and entered the smokingroom  it was after all perfectly easy to go to labrador one had just to go  as he pinched the end of his cigar he became aware of blenkins with a gleam of golden glasses and a flapping white cuff beckoning across the room to him with that probable scowl on his conscience trafford was moved to respond with an unreal warmth and strolled across to blenkins and a group of three or four other people including that vigorous young politician weston massinghay and hart kc about the further fireplace we were talking of you said blenkins come and sit down with us why dont you come into parliament  ive just arranged to go for some months to labrador  industrial development asked blenkins all alive  no holiday  no blenkins believes that sort of thing but of course if trafford chose to keep his own counsel  well come into parliament as soon as you get back  trafford had had that old conversation before he pretended insensibility when blenkins gestured to a vacant chair no he said still standing we settled all that and now im up to my neck indetail about labrador i shall be startingbefore the month is out  blenkins and hart simulated interest its immoral said blenkins for a man of your standing to keep out of politics  its more than immoral said hart its american  solomonson comes in to represent the firm smiled trafford signalled the waiter for coffee and presently disentangled himself from their company  for blenkins trafford concealed an exquisite dislike and contempt and blenkins had a considerable admiration for trafford based on extensive misunderstandings blenkins admired trafford because he was goodlooking and welldressed with a beautiful and successful wife because he had become reasonably rich very quickly and easily was young and a fellow of the royal society with a reputation that echoed in berlin and very perceptibly did not return blenkins admiration all these things filled blenkins with a desire for traffords intimacy and to become the associate of the very promising political career that it seemed to him in spite of traffords repudiations was the natural next step in a deliberately and honourably planned life he mistook traffords silences and detachment for the marks of a strong silent man who was scheming the immense vulgar distinguishedlooking achievements that appeal to the blenkins mind blenkins was a sentimentally loyal party liberal and as he said at times to hart and weston massinghay if those other fellows get hold of him  blenkins was the fine flower of oxford liberalism and the tennysonian days he wanted to be like king arthur and sir galahad with the merest touch of launcelot and to be perfectly upright and splendid and very very successful he was a fair tenoring sort of person with an arthurian moustache and a disposition to long frock coats it had been said of him that he didnt dress like a gentleman but that he dressed more like a gentleman than a gentleman ought to dress it might have been added that he didnt behave like a gentleman but that he behaved more like a gentleman than a gentleman ought to behave he didnt think but he talked and he wrote more thoughtfully in his leaders and in the little dialogues he wrote in imitation of sir arthur helps than any other person who didnt think could possibly do he was an orthodox churchman but very very broad he held all the doctrines a distinguished sort of thing to do in an age of doubt but there was a quality about them as he held themas though they had been run over by something rather heavy it was a flattened and slightly obliterated breadthnothing was assertive but nothing under examination proved to be altogether gone his profuse thoughtfulness was not confined to his journalistic and literary work it overflowed into talks he was a man for great talks interminable rambling floods of boyish observation emotional appreciation and silly sapient comment he loved to discuss who are the best talkers now alive he had written an essay talk in the past he boasted of weekends when the talk had gone on from the moment of meeting in the train to the moment of parting at euston or paddington or waterloo and one or two hostesses with embittered memories could verify his boasting he did his best to make the club a talking club and loved to summon men to a growing circle of chairs  trafford had been involved in talks on one or two occasions and now as he sat alone in the corridor and smoked and drank his coffee he could imagine the talk he had escaped the talk that was going on in the smoking roomthe platitudes the sagacities the digressions the sudden revelation of deep irrational convictions he reflected upon the various talks at which he had assisted his chief impression of them all was of an intolerable fluidity never once had he known a talk thicken to adequate discussion never had a new idea or a new view come to him in a talk he wondered why blenkins and his like talked at all essentially they lived for pose not for expression they did not greatly desire to discover make or be they wanted to seem and succeed talking perhaps was part of their pose of great intellectual activity and blenkins was fortunate to have an easy unforced running of mind  over his cigar trafford became profoundly philosophical about talk and after the manner of those who become profoundly philosophical he spread out the word beyond its original and proper intentions to all sorts of kindred and parallel things blenkins and his miscellany of friends in their circle of chairs were after all only a crude rendering of very much of intellectual activity of mankind men talked so often as dogs bark those talkers never came to grips fell away from topic to topic pretended depth and evaded the devastating horrors of sincerity listening was a politeness amongst them that was presently rewarded with utterance tremendously like dogs they were in a dogfancying neighborhood on a summer weekday afternoon fluidity excessive abundance inconsecutiveness these were the things that made talk hateful to trafford  wasnt most literature in the same class wasnt nearly all present philosophical and sociological discussion in the world merely a blenkins circle on a colossal scale with every one looming forward to get in a deeply thoughtful word edgeways at the first opportunity imagine any one in distress about his soul or about mankind going to a professor of economics or sociology or philosophy he thought of the endless big expensive fruitless books the windy expansions of industrious pedantry that mocked the spirit of inquiry the fields of physical and biological science alone had been partially rescued from the floods of human inconsecutiveness there at least a man must on the whole join on to the work of other men stand a searching criticism justify himself philosophically this was an age of relaxed schoolmen he thought of doctor codger at cambridge bubbling away with his iridescent hegelianism like a salted snail of doctor quiller at oxford ignoring bergson and fulminating a preposterous insular pragmatism each contradicted the other fundamentally upon matters of universal concern neither ever joined issue with the other why in the name of humanity didnt some one take hold of those two excellent gentlemen and bang their busy heads together hard and frequently until they either compromised or cracked   § 2  he forgot these rambling speculations as he came out into the spring sunshine of pall mall and halting for a moment on the topmost step regarded the tidy pavements the rare dignified shops the waiting taxicabs the pleasant prosperous passersby his mind lapsed back to the thought that he meant to leave all this and go to labrador his mind went a step further and reflected that he would not only go to labrador butit was highly probablecome back again  and then  why after all should he go to labrador at all why shouldnt he make a supreme effort here  something entirely irrational within him told him with conclusive emphasis that he had to go to labrador  he remembered there was this confounded business of the proposed house in mayfair to consider   § 3  it occurred to him that he would go a little out of his way and look at the new great laboratories at the romeike college of which his old bottlewasher durgan was he knew extravagantly proud romeikes widow was dead now and her will executed and her substance half turned already to bricks and stone and glazed tiles and all those excesses of space and appliance which the rich and authoritative imagine must needs give us science however illselected and underpaid and slighted the users of those opportunities may be the architects had had great fun with the bequest a quarter of the site was devoted to a huge square surrounded by dignified if functionless colonnades and adorned with those stone seats of honour which are always so chill and unsatisfactory as resting places in our island climate the laboratories except that they were a little shaded by the colonnades were everything a laboratory should be the benches were miracles of convenience there wasnt anything the industrious investigator might want steam high pressures electric power that he couldnt get by pressing a button or turning a switch unless perhaps it was inspiring ideas and the new library at the end with its greys and greens its logarithmic computators at every table was a miracle of mental convenience  durgan showed his old professor the marvels  if he chooses to do something here said durgan not too hopefully a man can  whats become of the little old room where we two used to work asked trafford  theyll turn em all out presently said durgan when this part is ready but just at present its very much as you left it theres been precious little research done there since you went awaynot what i call research females chieflyand boys playing at it making themselves into dscs by a baby research instead of a mans examination its like broaching a thirtytwo gallon cask full of pap to think of it lord sir the swill research counting and weighing things professor lakes all right i suppose but his work was mostly mathematical he didnt do much of it here no the old days ended sir when you  he arrested himself and obviously changed his words got busy with other things  trafford surveyed the place it seemed to him to have shrunken a little in the course of the three years that had intervened since he resigned his position on the wall at the back there still hung flyblown and a little crumpled an old table of constants he had made for his elasticity researches lake had kept it there for lake was a man of generous appreciations and rather proud to follow in the footsteps of an investigator of traffords subtlety and vigor the old sink in the corner where trafford had once swilled his watch glasses and filled his beakers had been replaced by one of a more modern construction and the combustion cupboard was unfamiliar until durgan pointed out that it had been enlarged the groundglass window at the east end showed still the marks of an explosion that had banished a clumsy student from this sanctuary at the very beginning of traffords career  by jove he said after a silence but i did some good work here  you did sir said durgan  i wonderi may take it up again presently  i doubt it sir said durgan  oh but suppose i come back  i dont think you would find yourself coming back sir said durgan after judicious consideration  he adduced no shadow of a reason for his doubt but some mysterious quality in his words carried conviction to traffords mind he knew that he would never do anything worth doing in molecular physics again he knew it now conclusively for the first time   § 4  he found himself presently in bond street the bright may day had brought out great quantities of people so that he had to come down from altitudes of abstraction to pick his way among them  he was struck by the prevailing interest and contentment in the faces he passed there was no sense of insecurity betrayed no sense of the deeps and mysteries upon which our being floats like a film they looked solid they looked satisfied surely never before in the history of the world has there been so great a multitude of securefeeling satisfiedlooking uninquiring people as there is today all the tragic great things of life seem stupendously remote from them pain is rare death is out of sight religion has shrunken to an inconsiderable comfortable reassuring appendage of the daily life and with the bright small things of immediacy they are so active and alert never before has the world seen such multitudes and a day must come when it will cease to see them for evermore  as he shouldered his way through the throng before the oxford street shop windows he appreciated a queer effect almost as it were of insanity about all this rich and abundant and ultimately aimless life this tremendous spawning and proliferation of uneventful humanity these individual lives signified no doubt enormously to the individuals but did all the shining reflecting changing existence that went by like bubbles in a stream signify collectively anything more than the leaping glittering confusion of shoaling mackerel on a sunlit afternoon the pretty girl looking into the window schemed picturesque achievements with lace and ribbon the beggar at the curb was alert for any sympathetic eye the chauffeur on the waiting taxicab watched the twopences ticking on with a quiet satisfaction each followed a keenly sought immediate end but altogether where were they going altogether until he knew that where was the sanity of statecraft the excuse of any impersonal effort the significance of anything beyond a life of appetites and selfseeking instincts  he found that perplexing suspicion of priggishness affecting him again why couldnt he take the gift of life as it seemed these people took it why was he continually lapsing into these sombre dimly religious questionings and doubts why after all should he concern himself with these riddles of some collective and ultimate meaning in things was he for all his ability and security so afraid of the accidents of life that on that account he clung to this conception of a larger impersonal issue which the world in general seemed to have abandoned so cheerfully at any rate he did cling to itand his sense of it made the abounding active life of this stirring bristling thoroughfare an almost unendurable perplexity  by the marble arch a little crowd had gathered at the pavement edge he remarked other little knots towards paddington and then still others and inquiring found the king was presently to pass they promised themselves the gratification of seeing the king go by they would see a carriage they would see horses and coachmen perhaps even they might catch sight of a raised hat and a bowing figure and this would be a gratification to them it would irradiate the day with a sense of experiences exceptional and precious for that some of them had already been standing about for two or three hours  he thought of these waiting people for a time and then he fell into a speculation about the king he wondered if the king ever lay awake at three oclock in the morning and faced the riddle of the eternities or whether he did really take himself seriously and contentedly as being in himself the vital function of the state performed his ceremonies went hither and thither through a wilderness of gaping watchers slept well on it was the man satisfied was he satisfied with his empire as it was and himself as he was or did some vision some high ironical intimation of the latent and lost possibilities of his empire and of the world of things conceivable that lies beyond the poor tawdry splendours of our present loyalties ever dawn upon him  traffords imagination conjured up a sleepless king emperor agonizing for humanity  he turned to his right out of lancaster gate into sussex square and came to a stop at the pavement edge  from across the road he surveyed the wide white front and portals of the house that wasnt big enough for marjorie   § 5  he let himself in with his latchkey  malcolm his man hovered at the foot of the staircase and came forward for his hat and gloves and stick  mrs trafford in asked trafford  she said she would be in by four sir  trafford glanced at his watch and went slowly upstairs  on the landing there had been a rearrangement of the furniture and he paused to survey it the alterations had been made to accommodate a big cloisonné jar that now glowed a wonder of white and tinted whites and luminous blues upon a dark deepshining stand he noted now the curtain of the window had been changed from somethingsurely it had been a reddish curtainto a sharp clear blue with a black border that reflected upon and sustained and encouraged the jar tremendously and the wall behind yes its deep brown was darkened to an absolute black behind the jar and shaded up between the lacquer cabinets on either hand by insensible degrees to the general hue it was wonderful perfectly harmonious and so subtly planned that it seemed it all might have grown as flowers grow  he entered the drawingroom and surveyed its long and handsome spaces postimpressionism was over and gone three long pictures by young rogerson and one of redwoods gallant bronzes faced the tall windows between the white marble fireplaces at either end there were two lean jars from india a young boys head from florence and in a great bowl in the remotest corner a radiant mass of azaleas  his mood of wondering at familiar things was still upon him it came to him as a thing absurd and incongruous that this should be his home it was all wonderfully arranged into one dignified harmony but he felt now that at a touch of social earthquake with a mere momentary lapse towards disorder it would degenerate altogether into litter lie heaped together confessed the loot it was he came to a stop opposite one of the rogersons a stiffly selfconscious shop girl in her sunday clothes a not unsuccessful emulation of nicholsons wonderful mrs stafford of paradise row regarded as so much brown and grey and ambergold it was coherent in marjories design but regarded as a work of art as a piece of expression how madly irrelevant was its humour and implications to that room and the purposes of that room rogerson wasnt perhaps trying to say much but at any rate he was trying to say something and redwood too was asserting freedom and adventure and the thought of that florentine of the bust and the patient careful indian potter and every maker of all the little casual articles about him produced an effect of muffled stifled assertions against this subdued and disciplined background of muted inarticulate criescries for beauty for delight for freedom marjorie and her world moved and rustled and chattered and competedwearing the skins of beasts the loveplumage of birds the woven cocoon cases of little silkworms  preposterous he whispered  he went to the window and stared out turned about and regarded the gracious variety of that long welllit room again then strolled thoughtfully upstairs he reached the door of his study and a sound of voices from the schoolroomit had recently been promoted from the rank of day nursery to this levelcaught his mood he changed his mind crossed the landing and was welcomed with shouts  the rogues had been dressing up margharita that child of the dreadful dawn was now a sturdy and domineering girl of eight and she was attired in a gilt paper mitre and her governesss white muslin blouse so tied at the wrists as to suggest long sleeves a broad crimson band doing

wellknown fashion of the middle ages after the children had welcomed their father and explained the bloody work in hand they returned to it with solemn earnestness while trafford surveyed the tragedy godwin slew with admirable gusto and i doubt if the actual thomas of canterbury showed half the stately dignity of margharita  the scene finished they went on to the penance of henry the second and there was a tremendous readjustment of costumes with much consultation and secrecy traffords eyes went from his offspring to the long whitepainted room with its gay frieze of ships and gulls and its rugvariegated cork carpet of plain brick red everywhere it showed his wifes quick cleverness the clean serviceable decorativeness of it all the pretty patterned window curtains the writing desks the little library of books the flowers and bulbs in glasses the counting blocks and bricks and jolly toys the blackboard on which the children learnt to draw in bold wide strokes the big wellchosen german colour prints upon the walls and the children did credit to their casket they were not only full of vitality but full of ideas even edward was already a person of conversation they were good stuff anyhow  it was fine in a sense trafford thought to have given up his own motives and curiosities to afford this airy pleasantness of upbringing for them and then came a qualifying thought would they in their turn for the sake of another generation have to give up fine occupations for mean occupations deep thoughts for shallow would the world get them in turn would the girls be hustled and flattered into advantageous marriages that dinners and drawingrooms might still prevail would the boys after this gracious beginning presently have to swim submerged in another generation of blenkinses and their talk toil in arduous selfseeking observe respect and manipulate shams succeed or fail and succeeding beget amidst hope and beautiful emotions yet another generation doomed to insincerities and accommodations and so die at lastas he must die  he heard his wifes clear voice in the hall below and went down to meet her she had gone into the drawingroom and he followed her in and through the folding doors to the hinder part of the room where she stood ready to open a small bureau she turned at his approach and smiled a pleasant habitual smile  she was no longer the slim quickmoving girl who had come out of the world to him when he crawled from beneath the wreckage of solomonsons plane no longer the halfbarbaric young beauty who had been revealed to him on the staircase of the vevey villa she was now a dignified selfpossessed woman controlling her house and her life with a skilful subtle appreciation of her every point and possibility she was wearing now a simple walking dress of brownish fawn colour and her hat was touched with a steely blue that made her blue eyes seem handsome and hard and toned her hair to a merely warm brown she had as it were subdued her fine colours into a sheath in order that she might presently draw them again with more effect  hullo old man she said you home  he nodded the club bored meand i couldnt work  her voice had something of a challenge and defiance in it ive been looking at a house she said alice carmel told me of it it isnt in berkeley square but its near it its rather good  he met her eye thatspremature he said  we cant go on living in this one  i wont go to another  but why  i just wont  it isnt the money  no said trafford with sudden fierce resentment ive overtaken you and beaten you there marjorie  she stared at the harsh bitterness of his voice she was about to speak when the door opened and malcom ushered in aunt plessington and uncle hubert husband and wife hung for a moment and then realized their talk was at an end  marjorie went forward to greet her aunt careless now of all that once stupendous influence might think of her she had long ceased to feel even the triumph of victory in her big house her costly dignified clothes her assured and growing social importance for five years aunt plessington had not even ventured to advise had once or twice admired all that business of magnet waseven elaboratelyforgotten  seven years of feverish selfassertion had left their mark upon both the plessingtons she was leaner more gauntly untidy more aggressively illdressed she no longer dressed carelessly she defied the world with her clothes waved her tattered and dingy banners in its face uncle hubert was no fatter but in some queer way he had ceased to be thin like so many people whose peripheries defy the manifest quaint purpose of providence he was in a state of thwarted adiposity and with all the disconnectedness and weak irritability characteristic of his condition he had developed a number of nervous movements chinstrokings cheekscratchings and incredulous pawings at his more salient features  isnt it a lark began aunt plessington with something like a note of apprehension in her highpitched voice and speaking almost from the doorway were making a call together i and hubert its an attack in force  uncle hubert goggled in the rear and stroked his chin and tried to get together a sort of facial expression  the traffords made welcoming noises and marjorie advanced to meet her aunt  we want you to do something for us said aunt plessington taking two hands with two hands  in the intervening years the movement had had ups and downs it had had a boom which had ended abruptly in a complete loss of voice for aunt plessingtonshe had tried to run it on a patent nonstimulating food and then it had entangled itself with a new cult of philanthropic theosophy from which it had been extracted with difficulty and in a damaged condition it had never completely recovered from that unhappy association latterly aunt plessington had lost her nerve and she had taken to making calls upon people with considerable and sometimes embarrassing demand for support urging them to join committees take chairs stake reputations speak and act as foils for her if they refused she lost her temper very openly and frankly and became industriously vindictive she circulated scandals or created them her old assurance had deserted her the strangulated contralto was losing its magic power she felt in this degenerating england it had ruled so long in the last year or so she had become extremely snappy with uncle hubert she ascribed much of the movements futility to the decline of his administrative powers and the increasing awkwardness of his gestures and she did her utmost to keep him up to the mark her only method of keeping him up to the mark was to jerk the bit she had now come to compel marjorie to address a meeting that was to inaugurate a new phase in the movements history and she wanted marjorie because she particularly wanted a daring liberal and spiritually amorous bishop who had once told her with a note of profound conviction that marjorie was a very beautiful woman she was so intent upon her purpose that she scarcely noticed trafford he slipped from the room unobserved under cover of her playful preliminaries and went to the untidy little apartment overhead which served in that house as his study he sat down at the big desk pushed his methodically arranged papers back and drummed on the edge with his fingers  im damned if we have that bigger house said trafford   § 6  he felt he wanted to confirm and establish this new resolution to go right away to labrador for a year he wanted to tell someone the thing definitely he would have gone downstairs again to marjorie but she was submerged and swimming desperately against the voluble rapids of aunt plessingtons purpose it might be an hour before that attack withdrew presently there would be other callers he decided to have tea with his mother and talk to her about this new break in the course of his life  except that her hair was now grey and her brown eyes by so much contrast brighter mrs traffords appearance had altered very little in the ten years of her only sons marriage whatever fresh realizations of the inevitably widening separation between parent and child these years had brought her she had kept to herself she had watched her daughterinlaw sometimes with sympathy sometimes with perplexity always with a jealous resolve to let no shadow of jealousy fall between them marjorie had been sweet and friendly to her but after the first outburst of enthusiastic affection she had neither offered nor invited confidences old mrs trafford had talked of marjorie to her son guardedly and had marked and respected a growing indisposition on his part to discuss his wife for a year or so after his marriage she had ached at times with a sense of nearly intolerable loneliness and then the new interests she had found for herself had won their way against this depression the new insurrectionary movement of women that had distinguished those years had attacked her by its emotion and repelled her by its crudity and she had resolved quite in the spirit of the man who had shaped her life to make a systematic study of all the contributory strands that met in this difficult tangle she tried to write but she found that the poetic gift the gift of the creative and illuminating phrase which alone justifies writing was denied to her and so she sought to make herself wise to read and hear and discuss and think over these things and perhaps at last inspire and encourage writing in others  her circle of intimates grew and she presently remarked with a curious interest that while she had lost the confidences of her own son and his wife she was becoming the confidant of an increasing number of other people they came to her she perceived because she was receptive and sympathetic and without a claim upon them or any interest to complicate the freedoms of their speech with her they came to her because she did not belong to them nor they to her it is indeed the defect of all formal and established relationship that it embarrasses speech and taints each phase in intercourse with the flavour of diplomacy one can be far more easily outspoken to a casual stranger one may never see again than to that inseparable other who may misinterpret who may disapprove or misunderstand and who will certainly in the measure of that discord remember  it became at last a matter of rejoicing to mrs trafford that the ties of the old instinctive tenderness between herself and her son the memories of pain and tears and the passionate conflict of childhood were growing so thin and lax and inconsiderable that she could even hope some day to talk to him againalmost as she talked to the young men and young women who drifted out of the unknown to her and sat in her little room and sought to express their perplexities and listened to her advice  it seemed to her that afternoon the wishedfor day had come  trafford found her just returned from a walk in kensington gardens and writing a note at her desk under the narrow sunlit window that looked upon the high street finish your letter little mother he said and took possession of the hearthrug  when she had sealed and addressed her letter she turned her head and found him looking at his fathers portrait  done he asked becoming aware of her eyes  she took her letter into the hall and returned to him closing the door behind her  im going away little mother he said with an unconvincing offhandedness im going to take a holiday  alone  yes i want a change im going off somewhereuntrodden ground as near as one can get it nowadayslabrador  their eyes met for a moment  is it for long  the best part of a year  i thought you were going on with your research work again  no he paused im going to labrador  why she asked  im going to think  she found nothing to say for a moment its good she remarked to think then lest she herself should seem to be thinking too enormously she rang the bell to order the tea that was already on its way  it surprises a mother she said when the maid had come and gone when her son surprises her  you see he repeated as though it explained everything i want to think  then after a pause she asked some questions about labrador wasnt it very cold very desert very dangerous and bitter and he answered informingly how was he going to stay there he would go up the country with an expedition build a hut and remain behind alone yesthinking her eyes rested on his face for a time it will belonely she said after a pause  she saw him as a little still speck against immense backgrounds of snowy wilderness  the teathings came before mother and son were back at essentials again then she asked abruptly why are you going away like this  im tired of all this business and finance he said after a pause  i thought you would be she answered as deliberately  yes ive had enough of things i want to get clear and begin again somehow  she felt they both hung away from the essential aspect either he or she must approach it she decided that she would that it was a less difficult thing for her than for him  and marjorie she asked  he looked into his mothers eyes very quietly you see he went on deliberately disregarding her question im beached im aground im spoilt now for the old researchesspoilt altogether and i dont like this life im leading i detest it while i was struggling it had a kind of interest there was an excitement in piling up the first twenty thousand but now its empty its aimless its incessant  he paused she turned to the teathings and lit the spirit lamp under the kettle it seemed a little difficult to do and her hand trembled when she turned on him again it was with an effort  does marjorie like the life you are leading she asked and pressed her lips together tightly  he spoke with a bitterness in his voice that astonished her oh she likes it  are you sure  he nodded  she wont like it without you  oh thats too much its her world its what shes donewhat shes made she can have it she can keep it ive played my part and got it for her but nownow im free to go i will go shes got everything else ive done my half of the bargain but my souls my own if i want to go away and think i will not even marjorie shall stand in the way of that  she made no answer to this outburst for a couple of seconds then she threw out why shouldnt marjorie think too  he considered that for some moments she doesnt he said as though the words came from the roots of his being  but you two  we dont talk its astonishinghow we dont we dont we cant we try to and we cant and she goes her way and nowi will go mine  and leave her  he nodded  in london  with all the things she cares for  except yourself  im only a means  she turned her quiet face to him you know she said that isnt true  no she repeated to his silent contradiction  ive watched her she went on youre not a means id have spoken long ago if i had thought that havent i watched havent i lain awake through long nights thinking about her and you thinking over every casual mood every little signlonging to helphelpless  she struggled with herself for she was weeping it has come to this she said in a whisper and choked back a flood of tears  trafford stood motionless watching her she became active she moved round the table she looked at the kettle moved the cups needlessly made tea and stood waiting for a moment before she poured it out its so hard to talk to you she said and about all this i care so much for her and for you words dont come dear one says stupid things  she poured out the tea and left the cups steaming and came and stood before him  you see she said youre ill you arent just youve come to an end you dont know where you are and what you want to do neither does she my dear shes as aimless as youand less able to help it ever so much less able  but she doesnt show it she goes on she wants things and wants things  and you want to go away its the same thing its exactly the same thing its dissatisfaction life leaves you empty and cravingleaves you with nothing to do but little immediate things that turn to dust as you do them its her trouble just as its your trouble  but she doesnt show it  women dont not so much perhaps even she doesnt know it half the women in our world dont knowand for a woman its so much easier to go onso many little things  trafford tried to grasp the intention of this mother he said i mean to go away  but think of her  ive thought now ive got to think of myself  you cantwithout her  i will its what im resolved to do  go right away  right away  and think  he nodded  find outwhat it all means my boy  yes so far as im concerned  and then  come back i suppose i havent thought  to her  he didnt answer she went and stood beside him leaning upon the mantel godwin she said shed only be further behind youve got to take her with you  he stood still and silent  youve got to think things out with her if you dont  i cant  then you ought to go away with her she stopped  for good he asked  yes  they were both silent for a space then mrs trafford gave her mind to the tea that was cooling in the cups and added milk and sugar she spoke again with the table between them  ive thought so much of these things she said with the milkjug in her hand its not only you two but others and all the movement about us marriage isnt what it was its become a different thing because women have become human beings onlyyou know godwin all these things are so difficult to express womans come out of being a slave and yet she isnt an equal weve had a sort of sham emancipation and we havent yet come to the real one  she put down the milkjug on the tray with an air of grave deliberation if you go away from her and make the most wonderful discoveries about life and yourself its no goodunless she makes them too its no good at all you cant live without her in the end any more than she can live without you you may think you can but ive watched you you dont want to go away from her you want to go away from the world thats got hold of her from the dresses and parties and the competition and all this complicated flatness we have to live in it wouldnt worry you a bit if it hadnt got hold of her you dont want to get out of it for your own sake you are out of it you are as much out of it as any one can be only she holds you in it because she isnt out of it your going away will do nothing shell still be in itand still have her hold on you youve got to take her away or elseif you go awayin the end it will be just like a ship godwin coming back to its moorings  she watched his thoughtful face for some moments then arrested herself just in time in the act of putting a second portion of sugar into each of the cups she handed her son his tea and he took it mechanically youre a wise little mother he said i didnt see things in that light i wonder if youre right  i know i am she said  ive thought more and moreit was marjorie  its the world  women made the world all the dress and display and competition  mrs trafford thought sex made the world neither men nor women but the world has got hold of the women tighter than it has the men theyre deeper in she looked up into his face take her with you she said simply  she wont come said trafford after considering it  mrs trafford reflected shell comeif you make her she said  shell want to bring two housemaids  i dont think you know marjorie as well as i do  but she cant  she can its youyoull want to take two housemaids for her even you men are not fair to women  trafford put his untasted tea upon the mantelshelf and confronted his mother with a question point blank does marjorie care for me he asked  youre the sun of her world  but she goes her way  shes clever shes full of life full of activities eager to make and arrange and order but theres nothing she is nothing she makes that doesnt centre on you  but if she cared shed understand  my dear do you understand  he stood musing i had everything clear he said i saw my way to labrador  her little clock pinged the hour good god he said im to be at dinner somewhere at seven were going to a first night with the bernards i think then i suppose well have a supper always life is being slashed to tatters by these things always one thinks in snatches of fifty minutes its dementia   § 7  they dined at the loretto restaurant with the bernards and richard hampden and mrs godwin capes the darkeyed quietmannered wife of the dramatist a woman of impulsive speech and long silences who had subsided from an early romance capes had been divorced for her while she was still a mere girl into a markedly correct and exclusive mother of daughters through the dinner marjorie was watching trafford and noting the deep preoccupation of his manner he talked a little to mrs bernard until it was time for hampden to entertain her then finding mrs capes was interested in bernard he lapsed into thought presently marjorie discovered his eyes scrutinizing herself  she hoped the play would catch his mind but the play seemed devised to intensify his sense of the tawdry unreality of contemporary life bernard filled the intervals with a conventional enthusiasm capes didnt appear  he doesnt seem to care to see his things his wife explained  its so brilliant said bernard  he has to do it said mrs capes slowly her sombre eyes estimating the crowded stalls below it isnt what he cares to do  the play was in fact an admirable piece of english stagecraft and it dealt exclusively with that unreal other world of beings the english theatre has for its own purposes developed just as greece through the ages evolved and polished and perfected the idealized life of its homeric poems so the british mind has evolved their stage land to embody its more honourable dreams full of heroic virtues incredible honour genial worldliness childish villainies profound but amiable waiters and domestics pathetic shepherds and preposterous crimes capes needing an income had mastered the habits and customs of this imagined world as one learns a language success endorsed his mastery he knew exactly how deeply to underline an irony and just when it is fit and proper for a good man to call upon god or cry out damn in this play he had invented a situation in which a charming and sympathetic lady had killed a gross and drunken husband in selfdefence almost but not quite accidentally and had then appealed to the prodigious hero for assistance in the resulting complications at a great cost of mental suffering to himself he had told his first and only lie to shield her then years after he had returned to englandthe first act happened of course in indiato find her on the eve of marrying without any of the preliminary confidences common among human beings an old school friend of his in plays all gentlemen have been at school together and one has been the others fag the audience had to be interested in the problem of what the prodigious hero was to do in this prodigious situation should he maintain a colossal silence continue his shielding and let his friend marry the murderess saved by his perjury or the dreadful quandary indeed the absoluteinconvenience  marjorie watched trafford in the corner of the box as he listened rather contemptuously to the statement of the evenings problem and then lapsed again into a brooding quiet she wished she understood his moods better she felt there was more in this than a mere resentment at her persistence about the new house  why didnt he go on with things  this darkling mood of his had only become manifest to her during the last three or four years of their life previously of course he had been irritable at times  were they less happy now than they had been in the little house in chelsea it had really been a horrible little house and yet there had been a brightness thena nearness  she found her mind wandering away upon a sort of stocktaking expedition how much of real happiness had she and trafford had together they ought by every standard to be so happy  she declined the bernards invitation to a chafingdish supper and began to talk so soon as she and trafford had settled into the car  rag she said somethings the matter  wellyes  the house  yesthe house  marjorie considered through a little interval  old man why are you so prejudiced against a bigger house  oh because the one we have bores me and the next one will bore me more  but try it  i dont want to  well she said and lapsed into silence  and then he asked what are we going to do  going to dowhen  after the new house  im going to open out she said  he made no answer  i want to open out i want you to take your place in the world the place you deserve  a fourfootman place  oh the house is only a means  he thought upon that a means he asked to what look here marjorie what do you think you are up to with me and yourself what do you see me doingin the years ahead  she gave him a silent and thoughtful profile for a second or so  at first i suppose you are going on with your researches  well  theni must tell you what i think of you rag politics  good lord  youve a sort of power you could make things noble  and then office  why not look at the little men they are  and then perhaps a still bigger house  youre not fair to me  he pulled up the bearskin over his knees  marjorie he said you seewe arent going to do any of those things at all no  i cant go on with my researches he explained thats what you dont understand im not able to get back to work i shall never do any good research again thats the real trouble marjorie and it makes all the difference as for politicsi cant touch politics i despise politics i think this empire and the monarchy and lords and commons and patriotism and social reform and all the rest of it silly silly beyond words temporary accidental foolish a mere stopgaplike a gipseys roundabout in a place where one will presently build a house you dont help make the house by riding on the roundabout theres no clear knowledgeno clear purpose only research mattersand expression perhapsi suppose expression is a sort of researchuntil we get thatthat sufficient knowledge and you see i cant take up my work again ive lost something  she waited  ive got into this stupid struggle for winning money he went on and i feel like a woman must feel whos made a success of prostitution ive been prostituted i feel like some one fallen and diseased business and prostitution theyre the same thing all business is a sort of prostitution all prostitution is a sort of business why should one sell ones brains any more than one sells ones body its so easy to succeed if one has good brains and cares to do it and doesnt let ones attention or imagination wanderand its so degrading hopelessly degrading im sick of this life marjorie i dont want to buy things im sick of buying im at an end im clean at an end its exactly as though suddenly in walking through a great house one came on a passage that ended abruptly in a door which openedon nothing nothing  this is a mood she whispered to his pause  it isnt a mood its a fact ive got nothing ahead and i dont know how to get back my lifes no good to me any more ive spent myself  she looked at him with dismayed eyes but she said this is a mood  no he said no mood but conviction i know  he started the car had stopped at their house and malcolm was opening the door of the car they descended silently and went upstairs in silence  he came into her room presently and sat down by her fireside she had gone to her dressingtable and unfastened a necklace now with this winking and glittering in her hand she came and stood beside him  rag she said i dont know what to say this isnt so much of a surprise i felt that somehow life was disappointing you that i was disappointing you ive felt it endless times but more so lately i havent perhaps dared to let myself know just how much but isnt it what life is doesnt every wife disappoint her husband were none of us inexhaustible after all weve had a good time isnt it a little ungrateful to forget  look here rag she said i dont know what to do if i did know i would do it what are we to do  think he suggested  weve got to live as well as think  its the immense troublesome futility ofeverything he said  welllet us cease to be futile let us do you say there is no grip for you in research that you despise politics theres no end of trouble and suffering cannot we do social work social reform change the lives of others less fortunate than ourselves  who are we that we should tamper with the lives of others  but one must do something  he thought that over  no he said thats the universal blunder nowadays one must do the right thing and we dont know the right thing marjorie thats the very heart of the trouble does this life satisfy you if it did would you always be so restless  but she said think of the good things in life  its just the good the exquisite things in life that make me rebel against this life we are leading its because ive seen the streaks of gold that i know the rest for dirt when i go cheating and scheming to my office and come back to find you squandering yourself upon a horde of chattering overdressed women when i think that that is our substance and everyday and what we are then it is i remember most the deep and beautiful things it is impossible dear it is intolerable that life was made beautiful for usjust for these vulgarities  isnt there she hesitated lovestill  buthas it been love love is a thing that grows but we took itas people take flowers out of a garden cut them off put them in water how much of our daily life has been love how much of it mere consequences of the love weve left behind us weve just cohabited and made loveyou and iand thought of a thousand other things  he looked up at her oh i love a thousand things about you he said but do i love you marjorie have i got you havent i lost youhavent we both lost something the very heart of it all do you think that we were just cheated by instinct that there wasnt something in it we felt and thought was there and where is it now where is that brightness and wonder marjorie and the pride and the immense unlimited hope  she was still for a moment then knelt very swiftly before him and held out her arms  oh rag she said with a face of tender beauty he took her finger tips in his dropped them and stood up above her  my dear he cried my dear why do you always want to turn love intotouches stand up again stand up there my dear dont think ive ceased to love you but stand up there and let me talk to you as one man to another if we let this occasion slide to embraces  he stopped short  she crouched before the fire at his feet go on she said go on  i feel now that all our lives now marjoriewe have come to a crisis i feel that nownow is the time either we shall save ourselves now or we shall never save ourselves it is as if something had gathered and accumulated and could wait no longer if we do not seize this opportunitythen our lives will go on as they have gone on will become more and more a matter of small excitements and elaborate comforts and distraction  he stopped this halting speech and then broke out again  oh why should the life of every day conquer us why should generation after generation of men have these fine beginnings these splendid dreams of youth attempt so much achieve so much and then then becomethis look at this room this litter of little satisfactions look at your pretty books there a hundred minds you have pecked at bright things of the spirit that attracted you as jewels attract a jackdaw look at the glass and silver and that silk from china and we are in the full tide of our years marjorie now is the very crown and best of our lives and this is what we do we sample we accumulate for this we loved for this we hoped do you remember when we were youngthat life seemed so splendidit was intolerable we should ever die the splendid dream the intimations of greatness the miserable failure  he raised clenched fists i wont stand it marjorie i wont endure it somehow in some way i will get out of this lifeand you with me i have been brooding upon this and brooding but now i know  but how asked marjorie with her bare arms about her knees staring into the fire how  we must get out of its constant interruptions its incessant vivid petty appeals  we might go awayto switzerland  we went to switzerland didnt we agreeit was our second honeymoon it isnt a honeymoon we need no well have to go further than that  a sudden light broke upon marjories mind she realized he had a plan she lifted a firelit face to him and looked at him with steady eyes and asked  where  ever so much further  where  i dont know  you do youve planned something  i dont know marjorie at leasti havent made up my mind where it is very lonely cold and remote away from all this his mind stopped short and he ended with a cry oh god how i want to get out of all this  he sat down in her armchair and bowed his face on his hands  then abruptly he stood up and went out of the room   § 8  when in five minutes time he came back into her room she was still upon her hearthrug before the fire with her necklace in her hand the red reflections of the flames glowing and winking in her jewels and in her eyes he came and sat again in her chair  i have been ranting he said i feel ive beeneloquent you make me feel like an actormanager in a play by capes you are the most difficult person for me to talk to in all the worldbecause you mean so much to me  she moved impulsively and checked herself and crouched away from him i mustnt touch your hand she whispered  i want to explain  youve got to explain  ive got quite a definite plan but a sort of terror seized me it was likeshyness  i know i knew you had a plan  you see i mean to go to labrador  he leant forward with his elbows on his knees and his hands extended explanatory he wanted intensely that she should understand and agree and his desire made him clumsy now slow and awkward now glibly and unsatisfyingly eloquent but she comprehended his quality better than he knew they were to go away to labrador this snowy desert of which she had scarcely heard to camp in the very heart of the wilderness two hundred miles or more from any human habitation  but how long she asked abruptly  the better part of a year  and we are to talk  yes he said talk and think ourselves togetherohthe old phrases carry it allfind god  it is what i dreamt of rag years ago  will you come he cried out of all this  she leant across the hearthrug and seized and kissed his hand  then with one of those swift changes of hers she was in revolt but rag she exclaimed this is dreaming we are not free there are the children rag we cannot leave the children  we can he said we must  but my dearour duty  is it a mothers duty always to keep with her children they will be looked after their lives are organized there is my mother close at hand what is the good of having children at allunless their world is to be better than our world what are we doing to save them from the same bathos as thisto which we have come we give them food and health and pictures and lessons thats all very well while they are just little children but weve got no religion to give them no aim no sense of a general purpose what is the good of bread and healthand no worship what can we say to them when they ask us why we brought them into the worldwe happenedyou happened what are we to tell them when they demand the purpose of all this training all these lessons when they ask what we are preparing them for just that you too may have children is that any answer marjorie its commonsense to try this overto make this last supreme effortjust as it will be commonsense to separate if we cant get the puzzle solved together  separate  separate why not we can afford it of course we shall separate  but ragseparate  he faced her protest squarely life is not worth living he said unless it has more to hold it together than ours has now if we cannot escape together theni will go alone   § 9  they parted that night resolved to go to labrador together with the broad outline of their subsequent journey already drawn each lay awake far into the small hours thinking of this purpose and of one another with a strange sense of renewed association each woke to a morning of sunshine heavyeyed each found that overnight decision remote and incredible it was like something in a book or a play that had moved them very deeply they came down to breakfast and helped themselves after the wonted fashion of several years marjorie with a skilful eye to the large order of her household the times had one or two characteristic letters which interested them both there was the usual picturesque irruption of the children and a distribution of early strawberries among them trafford had two notes in his correspondence which threw a new light upon the reconstruction of the nortonbatsford company in which he was interested he formed a definite conclusion upon the situation and went quite normally to his study and the telephone to act upon that  it was only as the morning wore on that it became real to him that he and marjorie had decided to leave the world then with the nortonbatsford business settled he sat at his desk and mused his apathy passed his imagination began to present first one picture and then another of his retreat he walked along oxford street to his club thinkingsoon we shall be out of all this by the time he was at lunch in his club labrador had become again the magic refuge it had seemed the day before after lunch he went to work in the library finding out books about labrador and looking up the details of the journey  but his sense of futility and hopeless oppression had vanished he walked along the corridor and down the great staircase and without a trace of the despairful hostility of the previous day passed blenkins talking grey bosh with infinite thoughtfulness he nodded easily to blenkins he was going out of it all as a man might do who discovers after years of weary incarceration that the walls of his cell are made of thin paper the time when blenkins seemed part of a prisonhouse of routine and invincible stupidity seemed ten ages ago  in pall mall trafford remarked lady grampians and the countess of claridge two women of great influence in a big green car on the way no doubt to create or sustain or destroy and it seemed to him that it was limitless ages since these poor old dears with their ridiculous hats and their ridiculous airs their luncheons and dinners and dirty aggressive old minds had sent tidal waves of competitive anxiety into his home  he found himself jostling through the shopping crowd on the sunny side of regent street he felt now that he looked over the swarming preoccupied heads at distant things he and marjorie were going out of it all going clean out of it all they were going to escape from society and shopping and petty engagements and incessant trivialityas a bird flies up out of weeds   § 10  but marjorie fluctuated more than he did  there were times when the expedition for which he was now preparing rapidly and methodically seemed to her the most adventurouslybeautiful thing that had ever come to her and times when it seemed the maddest and most hopeless of eccentricities there were times when she had devastating premonitions of filth hunger strain and fatigue damp and cold when her whole being recoiled from the project when she could even think of staying secure in london and letting him go alone she developed complicated anxieties for the children she found reasons for further inquiries for delay why not she suggested wait a year  no he said i wont i mean we are to do this and do it now and nothing but sheer physical inability to do it will prevent my carrying it out and you of course you are to come i cant drag you shrieking all the way to labrador short of that im going to make you come with me  she sat and looked up at him with dark lights in her upturned eyes and a little added warmth in her cheek youve never forced my will like this before she said in a low voice never  he was too intent upon his own resolve to heed her tones  it hasnt seemed necessary somehow he said considering her statement now it does  this is something final she said  it is final  she found an old familiar phrasing running through her head as she sat crouched together looking up at his rather gaunt very intent face the speech of another woman echoing to her across a vast space of years whither thou goest i will go  in labrador he began     chapter the third  the pilgrimage to lonely hut   § 1  marjorie was surprised to find how easy it was at last to part from her children and go with trafford  i am not sorry she said not a bit sorrybut i am fearfully afraid i shall dream they are ill apart from that its strange how you grip me and they dont  in the train to liverpool she watched trafford with the queer feeling which comes to all husbands and wives at times that that other partner is indeed an undiscovered stranger just beginning to show perplexing traitsfull of inconceivable possibilities  for some reason his tearing her up by the roots in this fashion had fascinated her imagination she felt a strange new wonder at him that had in it just a pleasant faint flavour of fear always before she had felt a curious aversion and contempt for those servile women who are said to seek a master to want to be mastered to be eager even for the physical subjugations of brute force now she could at least understand sympathize even with them not only trafford surprised her but herself she found she was in an unwonted perplexing series of moods all her feelings struck her now as being incorrect as well as unexpected not only had life become suddenly full of novelty but she was making novel responses she felt that she ought to be resentful and tragically sorry for her home and children she felt this departure ought to have the quality of an immense sacrifice a desperate and heroic undertaking for traffords sake instead she could detect little beyond an adventurous exhilaration when presently she walked the deck of the steamer that was to take her to st johns she had visited her cabin seen her luggage stowed away and now she surveyed the mersey and its shipping with a renewed freshness of mind she was reminded of the day now nearly nine years ago when she had crossed the sea for the first timeto italy then too trafford had seemed a being of infinitely wonderful possibilities what were the children doingthat ought to have been her preoccupation she didnt know she didnt care trafford came and stood beside her pointed out this and that upon the landing stage no longer heavily sullen but alert interested almost gay  neither of them could find any way to the great discussion they had set out upon in this voyage to st johns but there was plenty of time before them plenty of time they were both the prey of that uneasy distraction which seems the inevitable quality of a passenger steamship they surveyed and criticized their fellow travellers and prowled up and down through the long swaying days and the cold dark nights they slept uneasily amidst foghorn hootings and the startling sounds of waves swirling against the ports marjorie had never had a long sea voyage before for the first time in her life she saw all the world through a succession of days as a circle of endless blue waters with the stars and planets and sun and moon rising sharply from its rim until one has had a voyage no one really understands that old earth is a watery globe they ran into thirty hours of storm which subsided and then came a slow time among icebergs and a hooting dreary passage through fog the first three icebergs were marvels the rest bores a passing collier out of her course and pitching heavily a lonely black and dirty ship with a manner almost derelict filled their thoughts for half a day their minds were in a state of tedious inactivity eager for such small interests and only capable of such small interests there was no hurry to talk they agreed no hurry at all until they were settled away ahead there among the snows there we shall have plenty of time for everything  came the landfall and then st johns and they found themselves side by side watching the town draw near the thought of landing and transference to another ship refreshed them both  they were going trafford said in search of god but it was far more like two children starting out upon a holiday   § 2  there was trouble and procrastination about the halfbreed guides that trafford had arranged should meet them at st johns and it was three weeks from their reaching newfoundland before they got themselves and their guides and equipment and general stores aboard the boat for port dupré thence he had planned they should go in the gibson schooner to manivikovik the marconi station at the mouth of the green river and thence past the new pulpmills up river to the wilderness there were delays and a few trivial troublesome complications in carrying out this scheme but at last a day came when trafford could wave goodbye to the seven people and eleven dogs which constituted the population of peter hammonds that last rude outpost of civilization twenty miles above the pulpmill and turn his face in good earnest towards the wilderness  neither he nor marjorie looked back at the headland for a last glimpse of the little settlement they were leaving each stared ahead over the broad smooth sweep of water broken by one transverse bar of foaming shallows and scanned the low treeclad hills beyond that drew together at last in the distant gorge out of which the river came the morning was warm and full of the promise of a hot noon so that the veils they wore against the assaults of sandflies and mosquitoes were already a little inconvenient it seemed incredible in this morning glow that the wooded slopes along the shore of the lake were the border of a land in which nearly half the inhabitants die of starvation the deepladen canoes swept almost noiselessly through the water with a rhythmic alternation of rush and pause as the dripping paddles drove and returned altogether there were four long canoes and five indian breeds in their party and when they came to pass through shallows both marjorie and trafford took a paddle  they came to the throat of the gorge towards noon and found strong flowing deep water between its high purple cliffs all hands had to paddle again and it was only when they came to rest in a pool to eat a midday meal and afterwards to land upon a mossy corner for a stretch and a smoke that marjorie discovered the peculiar beauty of the rock about them on the dull purplishgrey surfaces played the most extraordinary mist of luminous iridescence it fascinated her here was a land whose common substance had this gemlike opalescence but her attention was very soon withdrawn from these glancing splendours  she had had to put aside her veil to eat and presently she felt the vividly painful stabs of the blackfly and discovered blood upon her face a bigger fly the size and something of the appearance of a small wasp with an evil buzz also assailed her and trafford it was a bad corner for flies the breeds even were slapping their wrists and swearing under the torment and every one was glad to embark and push on up the winding gorge it opened out for a time and then the wooded shores crept in again and in another halfhour they saw ahead of them a long rush of foaming waters among tumbled rocks that poured down from a brimming splashing line of light against the sky they crossed the river ran the canoes into an eddy under the shelter of a big stone and began to unload they had reached their first portage  the rest of the first day was spent in packing and lugging first the cargoes and then the canoes up through thickets and over boulders and across stretches of reindeer moss for the better part of two miles to a camping ground about halfway up the rapids marjorie and trafford tried to help with the carrying but this evidently shocked and distressed the men too much so they desisted and set to work cutting wood and gathering moss for the fires and bedding for the camp when the iron stove was brought up the man who had carried it showed them how to put it up on stakes and start a fire in it and then trafford went to the river to get water and marjorie made a kind of flour cake in the fryingpan in the manner an american woman from the wilderness had once shown her and boiled water for tea the twilight had deepened to night while the men were still stumbling up the trail with the last two canoes  it gave marjorie a curiously homeless feeling to stand there in the open with the sunset dying away below the black scrubby outlines of the treetops uphill to the northwest and to realize the nearest roof was already a days toilsome journey away the cool night breeze blew upon her bare face and armsfor now the insects had ceased from troubling and she had cast aside gloves and veil and turned up her sleeves to cookand the air was full of the tumult of the rapids tearing seaward over the rocks below struggling through the bushes towards her was an immense headless quadruped with unsteady legs and hesitating paces two of the men carrying the last canoe two others were now assisting trafford to put up the little tent that was to shelter her and the fifth was kneeling beside her very solemnly and respectfully cutting slices of bacon for her to fry the air was very sweet and she wished she could sleep not in the tent but under the open sky  it was queer she thought how much of the wrappings of civilization had slipped from them already every day of the journey from london had released them or deprived themshe hardly knew whichof a multitude of petty comforts and easy accessibilities the afternoon toil uphill intensified the effect of having clambered up out of thingsto this loneliness this twilight openness this simplicity  the men ate apart at a fire they made for themselves and after trafford and marjorie had supped on damper bacon and tea he smoked they were both too healthily tired to talk very much there was no moon but a frosty brilliance of stars the air which had been hot and sultry at midday grew keen and penetrating and after she had made him tell her the names of constellations she had forgotten she suddenly perceived the wisdom of the tent went into itit was sweet and wonderful with sprigs of the labrador teashrubundressed and had hardly rolled herself up into a cocoon of blankets before she was fast asleep  she was awakened by a blaze of sunshine pouring into the tent a smell of fried bacon and traffords voice telling her to get up theyve gone on with the first loads he said get up wrap yourself in a blanket and come and bathe in the river its as cold as ice  she blinked at him arent you stiff she asked  i was stiffer before i bathed he said  she took the tin he offered her they werent to see china cups again for a year its womans work getting tea she said as she drank  you cant be a squaw all at once said trafford   § 3  after marjorie had taken her dip dried roughly behind a bush twisted her hair into a pigtail and coiled it under her hat she amused herself and trafford as they clambered up through rocks and willows to the tent again by cataloguing her apparatus of bath and toilette at sussex square and tracing just when and how she had parted from each item on the way to this place  but i say she cried with a sudden sharp note of dismay we havent soap this is our last cake almost i never thought of soap  nor i said trafford  he spoke again presently we dont turn back for soap he said  we dont turn back for anything said marjorie stilli didnt count on a soapless winter  ill manage something said trafford a little doubtfully trust a chemist  that day they finished the portage and came out upon a wide lake with sloping shores and a distant view of snowtopped mountains a lake so shallow that at times their loaded canoes scraped on the glaciated rock below and they had to alter their course they camped in a lurid sunset the night was warm and mosquitoes were troublesome and towards morning came a thunderstorm and wind and rain  the dawn broke upon a tearing race of waves and a wild drift of slanting rain sweeping across the lake before a gale marjorie peered out at this as one peers out under the edge of an umbrella it was manifestly impossible to go on and they did nothing that day but run up a canvas shelter for the men and shift the tent behind a thicket of trees out of the full force of the wind the men squatted stoically and smoked and yarned everything got coldly wet and for the most part the traffords sat under the tent and stared blankly at this summer day in labrador  now said trafford we ought to begin talking  theres nothing much to do else said marjorie  only one cant begin said trafford  he was silent for a time were getting out of things he said  the next day began with a fine drizzle through which the sun broke suddenly about ten oclock they made a start at once and got a good dozen miles up the lake before it was necessary to camp again both marjorie and trafford felt stiff and weary and uncomfortable all day and secretly a little doubtful now of their own endurance they camped on an island on turf amidst slippery rocks and the next day were in a foaming difficult river again with glittering shallows that obliged every one to get out at times to wade and push all through the afternoon they were greatly beset by flies and so they worked their way on through a third days journey towards the silent inland of labrador  day followed day of toilsome and often tedious travel they fought rapids they waited while the men stumbled up long portages under vast loads going and returning they camped and discussed difficulties and alternatives the flies sustained an unrelenting persecution until faces were scarred in spite of veils and smoke fires until wrists and necks were swollen and the blood in a fever as they got higher and higher towards the central plateau the midday heat increased and the nights grew colder until they would find themselves toiling wet with perspiration over rocks that sheltered a fringe of ice beneath their shadows the first fatigues and lassitudes the shrinking from cold water the ache of muscular effort gave place to a tougher and tougher endurance skin seemed to have lost half its capacity for pain without losing a tithe of its discrimination muscles attained a steely resilience they were getting seasoned i dont feel philosophical said trafford but i feel well  were getting out of things  suppose we are getting out of our problems  one day as they paddled across a milelong pool they saw three bears prowling in single file high up on the hillside look said the man and pointed with his paddle at the big soft furry black shapes magnified and startling in the clear air all the canoes rippled to a stop the men at first still whispered softly one passed a gun to trafford who hesitated and looked at marjorie  the air of tranquil assurance about these three huge loafing monsters had a queer effect on marjories mind they made her feel that they were at home and that she was an intruder she had never in her life seen any big wild animals except in a menagerie she had developed a sort of unconscious belief that all big wild animals were in menageries nowadays and this spectacle of beasts entirely at large startled her there was never a bar between these creatures she felt and her sleeping self they might she thought do any desperate thing to feeble men and women who came their way  shall i take a shot asked trafford  no said marjorie pervaded by the desire for mutual toleration let them be  the big brutes disappeared in a gully reappeared came out against the skyline one by one and vanished  too long a shot said trafford handing back the gun  their journey lasted altogether a month never once did they come upon any human being save themselves though in one place they passed the polesfor the most part overthrownof an old indian encampment but this desolation was by no means lifeless they saw great quantities of waterbirds geese divers arctic partridge and the like they became familiar with the banshee cry of the loon they lived very largely on geese and partridge then for a time about a string of lakes the country was alive with migrating deer going south and the men found traces of a wolf they killed six caribou and stayed to skin and cut them up and dry the meat to replace the bacon they had consumed caught fried and ate great quantities of trout and became accustomed to the mysterious dance of the northern lights as the sunset afterglow faded  everywhere except in the river gorges the country displayed the low hummocky lines and tarnlike pools of intensely glaciated land everywhere it was carpeted with reindeer moss growing upon peat and variegated by bushes of flowering sweetsmelling labrador tea in places this was starred with little harebells and diversified by tussocks of heather and rough grass and over the rocks trailed delicate dwarf shrubs and a very pretty and fragrant pinkflowered plant of which neither she nor trafford knew the name there was an astonishing amount of wild fruit raspberries cranberries and a white kind of strawberry that was very delightful the weather after its first outbreak remained brightly serene  and at last it seemed fit to trafford to halt and choose his winter quarters he chose a place on the side of a low razorhacked rocky mountain ridge about fifty feet above the riverwhich had now dwindled to a thirtyfoot stream his site was near a tributary rivulet that gave convenient water in a kind of lap that sheltered between two rocky knees each bearing thickets of willow and balsam not a dozen miles away from them now they reckoned was the height of land the low watershed between the waters that go to the atlantic and those that go to hudsons bay close beside the site he had chosen a shelf of rock ran out and gave a glimpse up the narrow rocky valley of the green rivers upper waters and a broad prospect of hill and tarn towards the southeast north and northeast of them the country rose to a line of low crests with here and there a yellowing patch of last years snow and across the valley were slopes covered in places by woods of stunted pine it had an empty spaciousness of effect the one continually living thing seemed to be the green river hurrying headlong noisily perpetually in an eternal flight from this high desolation birds were rare here and the insects that buzzed and shrilled and tormented among the rocks and willows in the gorge came but sparingly up the slopes to them  here presently said trafford we shall be in peace  it is very lonely said marjorie  the nearer to god  think not one of these hills has ever had a name  well  it might be in some other planet  ohwell christen them that shall be marjorie ridge and that rag valley this space shall beoh bayswater before weve done with it this place and every feature of it will be as familiar as sussex square more sofor half the houses there would be stranger to us if we could see inside them than anything in this wilderness as familiar sayas your drawingroom thats better  marjorie made no answer but her eyes went from the reindeer moss and scrub and thickets of the foreground to the low rocky ridges that bounded the view north and east of them the scattered boulders the tangles of wood the barren upper slopes the dustsoiled survivals of the winters snowfall all contributed to an effect at once carelessly desert and hopelessly untidy she looked westward and her memory was full of interminable streaming rapids wastes of icestriated rocks tiresome struggles through woods and wild wide stretches of tundra and tarn trackless and treeless infinitely desolate it seemed to her that the sea coast was but a step from london and ten thousand miles away from her   § 4  the men had engaged to build the framework of hut and store shed before returning and to this under traffords direction they now set themselves they were all halfbreeds mingling with indian with scottish or french blood sober and experienced men three were named mackenzie two brothers and a cousin and another raymond noyes was a relation and acquaintance of that george elson who was with wallace and leonidas hubbard and afterwards guided mrs hubbard in her crossing of labrador the fifth was a boy of eighteen named lean they were all familiar with the idea of summer travel in this country quite a number a score or so that is to say of adventurous people including three or four women had ventured far in the wake of the hubbards into these great wildernesses during the decade that followed that first tragic experiment in which hubbard died but that any one not of indian or esquimaux blood should propose to face out the labrador winter was a new thing to them they were really very sceptical at the outset whether these two highly civilizedlooking people would ever get up to the height of land at all and it was still with manifest incredulity that they set about the building of the hut and the construction of the sleeping bunks for which they had brought up planking a stream of speculative talk had flowed along beside marjorie and trafford ever since they had entered the green river and it didnt so much come to an end as get cut off at last by the necessity of their departure  noyes would stand holding a hammer and staring at the narrow little berth he was fixing together  youll not sleep in this he said  i will replied marjorie  youll come back with us  not me  therell be wolves come and howl  let em  theyll come right up to the door here winter makes em hidjus bold  marjorie shrugged her shoulders  its that cold ive known a man have his nose froze while he lay in bed said noyes  up here  down the coast but they say its most as cold up here manys the man its starved and froze  he and his companions told storiesvery circumstantial and pitiful stories of indian disasters they were all tales of weariness and starvation of the cessation of food because the fishing gave out because the caribou did not migrate by the customary route because the man of a family group broke his wrist and then of the start of all or some of the party to the coast to get help and provisions of the straining starving fugitives caught by blizzards losing the track devouring small vermin raw gnawing their own skin garments until they toiled halfnaked in the snowbecoming cannibals becoming delirious lying down to die once there was an epidemic of influenza and three families of seven and twenty people just gave up and starved and died in their lodges and were found still partly frozen a patient pitiful company by trappers in the spring  such they said were the common things that happened in a labrador winter did the traffords wish to run such risks  a sort of propagandist enthusiasm grew up in the men they felt it incumbent upon them to persuade the traffords to return they reasoned with them rather as one does with wilful children they tried to remind them of the delights and securities of the world they were deserting noyes drew fancy pictures of the pleasures of london by way of contrast to the bitter days before them youve got everything there everything suppose you feel a bit ill you go out and every block theres a drug store got everythingall the new remdiespraps twenty thirty sorts of remdy lit up nice and chaps in collarslike gentlemen or you feel a bit dully and you go into the streets and theres people why when i was in new york i used to spend hours looking at the people hours and everything lit up too sky signs readin everywhere you can spend hours and hours in new york  london said marjorie  well londonjust going about and reading the things they stick up every blamed sort of thing or you say lets go somewhere lets go out and be a bit lively see up you get on a car and there you are great big restaurants blazing with lights and you cant think of a thing to eat they havent got waiters all round you dressed tremendous fair asking you to have more or you say lets go to a theatre very likely said noyes letting his imagination soar you order up one of these automobillies  by telephone helped trafford  by telephone confirmed noyes when i was in new york there was a telephone in each room in the hotel each room i didnt use it ever except once when they didnt answerbut there it was i know about telephones all right  why had they come here none of the men were clear about that marjorie and trafford would overhear them discussing this question at their fire night after night they seemed to talk of nothing else they indulged in the boldest hypotheses even in the theory that trafford knew of deposits of diamonds and gold and would trust no one but his wife with the secret they seemed also attracted by the idea that our two young people had done something lean with memories of some tattered sixpenny novel that had drifted into his hands from england had even some notion of an elopement of a pursuing husband or a vindictive wife he was young and romantic but it seemed incredible he should suggest that marjorie was a royal princess yet there were moments when his manner betrayed a more than personal respect  one night after a hard days portage mackenzie was inspired by a brilliant idea they got no children he said in a hoarse exceptionally audible whisper it worries them them as is catholics goes pilgrimages but these aint catholics see  i cant stand that said marjorie it touches my pride ive stood a good deal mr mackenzie mr mackenzie  the voice at the mens fire stopped and a black head turned around what is it mrs trafford asked mackenzie  she held up four fingers four she said  eh  three sons and a daughter said marjorie  mackenzie did not take it in until his younger brother had repeated her words  and youve come from them to this sir what have you come for  we want to be here shouted trafford to their listening pause their silence was incredulous  we wanted to be alone together there was too muchover theretoo much everything  mackenzie in silhouette against the fire shook his head entirely dissatisfied he could not understand how there could be too much of anything it was beyond a trappers philosophy  come back with us sir said noyes youll weary of it  noyes clung to the idea of dissuasion to the end i dont care to leave ye he said and made a sort of byword of it that served when there was nothing else to say  he made it almost his last words he turned back for another handclasp as the others under their light returning packs were filing down the hill  i dont care to leave ye he said  good luck said trafford  youll need it said noyes and looked at marjorie very gravely and intently before he turned about and marched off after his fellows  both marjorie and trafford felt a queer emotion a sense of loss and desertion a swelling in the throat as that file of men receded over the rocky slopes went down into a dip reappeared presently small and remote cresting another spur going on towards the little wood that hid the head of the rapids they halted for a moment on the edge of the wood and looked back then turned again one by one and melted stride by stride into the trees noyes was the last to go he stood in an attitude that spoke as plainly as words i dont care to leave ye something white waved and flickered he had whipped out the letters they had given him for england and he was waving them then as if by an effort he set himself to follow the others and the two still watchers on the height above saw him no more     chapter the fourth  lonely hut   § 1  marjorie and trafford walked slowly back to the hut there is much to do before the weather breaks he said ending a thoughtful silence then we can sit inside there and talk about the things we need to talk about  he added awkwardly since we started there has been so much to hold the attention i remember a moodan immense despair i feel its still somewhere at the back of things waiting to be dealt with its our essential fact but meanwhile weve been busy looking at fresh things  he paused now it will be different perhaps  for nearly four weeks indeed they were occupied very closely and crept into their bunks at night as tired as wholesome animals who drop to sleep at any time the weather might break already there had been two overcast days and a frowning conference of clouds in the north when at last storms began they knew there would be nothing for it but to keep in the hut until the world froze up  there was much to do to the hut the absence of anything but stunted and impoverished timber and the limitation of time had forbidden a log hut and their home was really only a double framework rammed tight between inner and outer frame with a mixture of earth and boughs and twigs of willow pine and balsam the floor was hammered earth carpeted with balsam twigs and a caribou skin outside and within wall and roof were faced with coarse canvasthat was traffords ideaand their bunks occupied two sides of the hut heating was done by the sheetiron stove they had brought with them and the smoke was carried out to the roof by a thin sheetiron pipe which had come up outside a roll of canvas they had made the roof with about the pitch of a swiss châlet and it was covered with nailed waterproof canvas held down by a large number of big lumps of stone much of the canvassing still remained to do when the men went down and then the traffords used every scrap of packingpaper and newspaper that had come up with them and was not needed for lining the bunks in covering any crack or join in the canvas wall  two decadent luxuries a rubber bath and two rubber hotwater bottles hung behind the door they were almost the only luxuries kettles and pans and some provisions stood on a shelf over the stove there was also a sort of recess cupboard in the opposite corner reserve clothes were in canvas trunks under the bunks they kept their immediate supply of wood under the eaves just outside the door and there was a big can of water between stove and door when the winter came they would have to bring in ice from the stream  this was their home the tent that had sheltered marjorie on the way up was erected close to this hut to serve as a rude scullery and outhouse and they also made a long roughly thatched roof with a canvas cover supported on stakes to shelter the rest of the stores the stuff in tins and cases and jars they left on the ground under this the restthe flour candles bacon dried caribou beef and so forth they hung as they hoped out of the reach of any prowling beast and finally and most important was the wood pile this they accumulated to the north and east of the hut and all day long with a sort of antlike perseverance trafford added to it from the thickets below once or twice however tempted by the appearance of birds he went shooting and one day he got five geese that they spent a day upon plucking cleaning boiling and putting up in all their store of empty cans letting the fat float and solidify on the top to preserve this addition to their provision until the advent of the frost rendered all other preservatives unnecessary they also tried to catch trout down in the river below but though they saw many fish the catch was less than a dozen  it was a discovery to both of them to find how companionable these occupations were how much more side by side they could be amateurishly cleaning out a goose and disputing about its cooking than they had ever contrived to be in sussex square  these things are so infernally interesting said trafford surveying the row of miscellaneous cans upon the stove he had packed with disarticulated goose but we didnt come here to picnic all this is eating us up i have a memory of some immense tragic purpose  that tins boiling screamed marjorie sharply  he resumed his thread after an active interlude  well keep the wolf from the door he said  dont talk of wolves said marjorie  it is only when men have driven away the wolf from the dooroh altogether away that they find despair in the sky i wonder  what asked marjorie in his pause  i wonder if there is nothing really in life but this the food hunt and the love hunt is life just all hunger and need and are we left with nothingnothing at allwhen these things are done were infernally uncomfortable here  oh nonsense cried marjorie  think of your carpets at home think of the great warm beautiful house that wasnt big enoughand yet here were happy  we are happy said marjorie struck by the thought only  yes  im afraid and i long for the children and the wind nips  it may be those are good things for us no this is just a lark as yet marjorie its still fresh and full of distractions the discomforts are amusing presently well get used to it then well talk outwhat we have to talk out i say wouldnt it keep and improve this goose of ours if we put in a little brandy   § 2  the weather broke at last one might say it smashed itself over their heads there came an afternoon darkness swift and sudden a wild gale and an icy sleet that gave place in the night to snow so that trafford looked out next morning to see a maddening chaos of small white flakes incredibly swift against something that was neither darkness nor light even with the door but partly ajar a cruelty of cold put its claw within set everything that was moveable swaying and clattering and made marjorie hasten shuddering to heap fresh logs upon the fire once or twice trafford went out to inspect tent and roof and storeshed several times wrapped to the nose he battled his way for fresh wood and for the rest of the blizzard they kept to the hut it was slumberously stuffy but comfortingly full of flavours of tobacco and food there were two days of intermission and a day of gusts and icy sleet again turning with one extraordinary clap of thunder to a wild downpour of dancing lumps of ice and then a night when it seemed all labrador earth and sky together was in hysterical protest against inconceivable wrongs  and then the break was over the annual freezingup was accomplished winter had established itself the snowfall moderated and ceased and an icebound world shone white and sunlit under a cloudless sky   § 3  through all that time they got no further with the great discussion for which they had faced that solitude they attempted beginnings  where had we got to when we left england cried marjorie you couldnt work you couldnt restyou hated our life  yes i know i had a violent hatred of the lives we were leading i thoughtwe had to get away to think but things dont leave us alone here  he covered his face with his hands  why did we come here he asked  you wantedto get out of things  yes but with you have we after all got out of things at all i said coming up perhaps we were leaving our own problem behind in exchange for other problemsold problems men have had before weve got nearer necessity thats all things press on us just as much theres nothing more fundamental in wild nature nothing profounderonly something earlier one doesnt get out of life by going here or there but i wanted to get you awayfrom all things that had such a hold on you  when one lies awake at nights then one seems to get down into things  he went to the door opened it and stood looking out against a wan daylight the snow was falling noiselessly and steadily  everything goes on he said relentlessly   § 4  that was as far as they had got when the storms ceased and they came out again into an air inexpressibly fresh and sharp and sweet and into a world blindingly clean and golden white under the rays of the morning sun  we will build a fire out here said marjorie make a great pile there is no reason at all why we shouldnt live outside all through the day in such weather as this   § 5  one morning trafford found the footmarks of some catlike creature in the snow near the bushes where he was accustomed to get firewood they led away very plainly up the hill and after breakfast he took his knife and rifle and snowshoes and went after the lynxfor that he decided the animal must be there was no urgent reason why he should want to kill a lynx unless perhaps that killing it made the store shed a trifle safer but it was the first trail of any living thing for many days it promised excitement some primordial instinct perhaps urged him  the morning was a little overcast and very cold between the gleams of wintry sunshine goodbye dear wife he said and then as she remembered afterwards came back a dozen yards to kiss her ill not be long he said the beasts prowling and if it doesnt get wind of me i ought to find it in an hour he hesitated for a moment ill not be long he repeated and she had an instants wonder whether he hid from her the same dread of loneliness that she concealed or perhaps he only knew her secret up among the tumbled rocks he turned and she was still watching him goodbye he cried and waved and the willow thickets closed about him  she forced herself to the petty duties of the day made up the fire from the pile he had left for her set water to boil put the hut in order brought out sheets and blankets to air and set herself to wash up she wished she had been able to go with him the sky cleared presently and the low december sun lit all the world about her but it left her spirit desolate  she did not expect him to return until midday and she sat herself down on a log before the fire to darn a pair of socks as well as she could for a time this unusual occupation held her attention and then her hands became slow and at last inactive and she fell into reverie she thought at first of her children and what they might be doing in england across there to the east it would be about five hours later four oclock in the afternoon and the children would be coming home through the warm muggy london sunshine with fraulein otto to tea she wondered if they had the proper clothes if they were well were they perhaps quarrelling or being naughty or skylarking gaily across the park of course fraulein otto was all right quite to be trusted absolutely trustworthy and their grandmother would watch for a flushed face or an irrational petulance or any of the little signs that herald trouble with more than a mothers instinctive alertness no need to worry about the children no need whatever the world of london opened out behind these thoughts it was so queer to think that she was in almost the same latitude as the busy bright traffic of the autumn season in kensington gore that away there in ten thousand cleverly furnished drawingrooms the ringing tea things were being set out for the rustling advent of smart callers and the quick leaping gossip and there would be all sorts of cakes and little things for a while her mind ran on cakes and little things and she thought in particular whether it wasnt time to begin cooking not yet what was it she had been thinking about ah the solomonsons and the capeses and the bernards and the carmels and the lees would they talk of her and trafford it would be strange to go back to it all would they go back to it all she found herself thinking intently of trafford  what a fine human being he was and how touchingly human the thoughts of his moments of irritation his baffled silences filled her with a wild passion of tenderness she had disappointed him all that life failed to satisfy him dear master of her life what was it he needed she too wasnt satisfied with life but while she had been able to assuage herself with a perpetual series of petty excitements theatres new books and new people meetings movements dinners shows he had grown to an immense discontent he had most of the things men sought wealth respect love children so many men might have blunted their heartache withadventures there were pretty women clever women unoccupied women she felt she wouldnt have mindedmuchif it made him happy it was so wonderful he loved her still it wasnt that he lacked occupation on the whole he overworked his business interests were big and wide ought he to go into politics why was it that the researches that had held him once could hold him now no more that was the real pity of it was she to blame for that she couldnt state a case against herself and yet she felt she was to blame she had taken him away from those things forced him to make money  she sat chin on hand staring into the fire the sock forgotten on her knee  she could not weigh justice between herself and him if he was unhappy it was her fault she knew if he was unhappy it was no excuse that she had not known had been misled had a right to her own instincts and purposes she had got to make him happy but what was she to do what was there for her to do  only he could work out his own salvation and until he had light all she could do was to stand by him help him cease to irritate him watch wait anyhow she could at least mend his socks as well as possible so that the threads would not chafe him  she flashed to her feet what was that  it seemed to her she had heard the sound of a shot and a quick brief wake of echoes she looked across the icy waste of the river and then up the tangled slopes of the mountain her heart was beating very fast it must have been up there and no doubt he had killed his beast some shadow of doubt she would not admit crossed that obvious suggestion  this wilderness was making her as nervously responsive as a creature of the wild  came a second shot this time there was no doubt of it then the desolate silence closed about her again  she stood for a long time staring at the shrubby slopes that rose to the barren rock wilderness of the purple mountain crest she sighed deeply at last and set herself to make up the fire and prepare for the midday meal once far away across the river she heard the howl of a wolf  time seemed to pass very slowly that day she found herself going repeatedly to the space between the day tent and the sleeping hut from which she could see the stunted wood that had swallowed him up and after what seemed a long hour her watch told her it was still only halfpast twelve and the fourth or fifth time that she went to look out she was set atremble again by the sound of a third shot and then at regular intervals out of that distant brown purple jumble of thickets against the snow came two more shots something has happened she said something has happened and stood rigid then she became active seized the rifle that was always at hand when she was alone fired into the sky and stood listening  prompt come an answering shot  he wants me said marjorie somethingperhaps he has killed something too big to bring  she was for starting at once and then remembered this was not the way of the wilderness  she thought and moved very rapidly her mind catalogued possible requirements rifle hunting knife the oilskin bag with matches and some chunks of dry paper the rucksackand he would be hungry she took a saucepan and a huge chunk of cheese and biscuit then a brandy flask is sometimes handyone never knows though nothing was wrong of course needles and stout thread and some cord snowshoes a waterproof cloak could be easily carried her light hatchet for wood she cast about to see if there was anything else she had almost forgotten cartridgesand a revolver nothing more she kicked a stray brand or so into the fire put on some more wood damped the fire with an armful of snow to make it last longer and set out towards the willows into which he had vanished  there was a rustling and snapping of branches as she pushed her way through the bushes a little stir that died insensibly into quiet again and then the camping place became very still  scarcely a sound occurred except for the little shuddering and stirring of the fire and the reluctant infrequent drip from the icicles along the sunny edge of the log hut roof about one oclock the amber sunshine faded out altogether a veil of clouds thickened and became greyly ominous and a little after two the first flakes of a snowstorm fell hissing into the fire a wind rose and drove the multiplying snowflakes in whirls and eddies before it the icicles ceased to drip but one or two broke and fell with a weak tinkling a deep soughing a shuddering groaning of trees and shrubs came ever and again out of the ravine and the powdery snow blew like puffs of smoke from the branches  by four the fire was out and the snow was piling high in the darkling twilight against tent and hut   § 6  traffords trail led marjorie through the thicket of dwarf willows and down to the gully of the rivulet which they had called marjorie trickle it had long since become a trough of snowcovered rotten ice the trail crossed this and turning sharply uphill went on until it was clear of shrubs and trees and in the windy open of the upper slopes it crossed a ridge and came over the lip of a large desolate valley with slopes of ice and icy snow here she spent some time in following his loops back on the homeward trail before she saw what was manifestly the final trail running far away out across the snow with the spoor of the lynx a lightlydotted line to the right of it she followed this suggestion of the trail put on her snowshoes and shuffled her way across this valley which opened as she proceeded she hoped that over the ridge she would find trafford and scanned the sky for the faintest discolouration of a fire but there was none that seemed odd to her but the wind was in her face and perhaps it beat the smoke down then as her eyes scanned the hummocky ridge ahead she saw something something very intent and still that brought her heart into her mouth it was a big grey wolf standing with back haunched and head down watching and winding something beyond there out of sight  marjorie had an instinctive fear of wild animals and it still seemed dreadful to her that they should go at large uncaged she suddenly wanted trafford violently wanted him by her side also she thought of leaving the trail going back to the bushes she had to take herself in hand in the wastes one did not fear wild beasts one had no fear of them but why not fire a shot to let him know she was near  the beast flashed round with an animals instantaneous change of pose and looked at her for a couple of seconds perhaps woman and brute regarded one another across a quarter of a mile of snowy desolation  suppose it came towards her  she would fireand she would fire at it she made a guess at the range and aimed very carefully she saw the snow fly two yards ahead of the grisly shape and then in an instant it had vanished over the crest  she reloaded and stood for a moment waiting for traffords answer no answer came queer she whispered queerand suddenly such a horror of anticipation assailed her that she started running and floundering through the snow to escape it twice she called his name and once she just stopped herself from firing a shot  over the ridge she would find him surely she would find him over the ridge  she found herself among rocks and there was a beaten and trampled place where trafford must have waited and crouched then on and down a slope of tumbled boulders there came a patch where he had either thrown himself down or fallen  it seemed to her he must have been running  suddenly a hundred feet or so away she saw a patch of violently disturbed snowsnow stained a dreadful colour a snow of scarlet crystals three strides and trafford was in sight  she had a swift conviction he was dead he was lying in a crumpled attitude on a patch of snow between convergent rocks and the lynx a mass of blood smeared silvery fur was in some way mixed up with him she saw as she came nearer that the snow was disturbed round about them and discoloured copiously yellow widely and in places bright red with congealed and frozen blood she felt no fear now and no emotion all her mind was engaged with the clear bleak perception of the fact before her she did not care to call to him again his head was hidden by the lynxs body it was as if he was burrowing underneath the creature his legs were twisted about each other in a queer unnatural attitude  then as she dropped off a boulder and came nearer trafford moved a hand came out and gripped the rifle beside him he suddenly lifted a dreadful face horribly scarred and torn and crimson with frozen blood he pushed the grey beast aside rose on an elbow wiped his sleeve across his eyes stared at her grunted and flopped forward he had fainted  she was now as clearminded and as selfpossessed as a woman in a shop in another moment she was kneeling by his side she saw by the position of his knife and the huge rip in the beasts body that he had stabbed the lynx to death as it clawed his head he must have shot and wounded it and then fallen upon it his knitted cap was torn to ribbons and hung upon his neck also his leg was manifestly injured how she could not tell it was chiefly evident he must freeze if he lay here it seemed to her that perhaps he had pulled the dead brute over him to protect his torn skin from the extremity of cold the lynx was already rigid its clumsy paws asprawlthe torn skin and clot upon traffords face was stiff as she put her hands about his head to raise him she turned him over on his backhow heavy he seemedand forced brandy between his teeth then after a moments hesitation she poured a little brandy on his wounds  she glanced at his leg which was surely broken and back at his face then she gave him more brandy and his eyelids flickered he moved his hand weakly the blood he said kept getting in my eyes  she gave him brandy once again wiped his face and glanced at his leg something ought to be done to that she thought but things must be done in order  she stared up at the darkling sky with its grey promise of snow and down the slopes of the mountain clearly they must stay the night here they were too high for wood among these rocks but three or four hundred yards below there were a number of dwarfed fir trees she had brought an axe so that a fire was possible should she go back to camp and get the tent  trafford was trying to speak again i got he said  yes  got my leg in that crack damndamned nuisance  was he able to advise her she looked at him and then perceived she must bind up his head and face she knelt behind him and raised his head on her knee she had a thick silk neck muffler and this she supplemented by a band she cut and tore from her inner vest she bound this still warm from her body about him wrapped her cloak round him the next thing was a fire five yards away perhaps a great mass of purple gabbro hung over a patch of nearly snowless moss a hummock to the westward offered shelter from the weakly bitter wind the icy draught that was soughing down the valley always in labrador if you can you camp against a rock surface it shelters you from the wind reflects your fire guards your back  rag she said  rotten hole said trafford  what she cried sharply  got you in a rotten hole he said eh  listen she said and shook his shoulder look i want to get you up against that rock  wont make much difference said trafford and opened his eyes where he asked  there  he remained quite quiet for a second perhaps listen to me he said go back to camp  yes she said  go back to camp make a pack of all the strongest foodstrenthinstrengthrin foodyou know he seemed troubled to express himself  yes she said  down the river downdown till you meet help  leave you  he nodded his head and winced  youre always plucky he said look facts in the face kiddies thought it over while you were coming a tear oozed from his eye not be a fool madge kiss me goodbye not be a fool im done kids  she stared at him and her spirit was a luminous mist of tears you old coward she said in his ear and kissed the little patch of rough and bloody cheek beneath his eye then she knelt up beside him im boss now old man she said i want to get you to that place there under the rock if i drag can you help  he answered obstinately youd better go  ill make you comfortable first she answered anyhow  he made an enormous effort and then with her quick help and with his back to her knee had raised himself on his elbows  and afterwards he asked  build a fire  wood  down there  two bits of wood tied on my legsplints then i can drag myself see like a blessed old walrus  he smiled and she kissed his bandaged face again  else it hurts he apologized more than i can stand  she stood up again thought put his rifle and knife to his hand for fear of that lurking wolf abandoning her own rifle with an effort and went striding and leaping from rock to rock towards the trees below she made the chips fly and was presently towing three venerable pine dwarfs bumping over rock and crevice back to trafford she flung them down stood for a moment bright and breathless then set herself to hack off the splints he needed from the biggest stem now she said coming to him  a fool he remarked would have made the splints down there youregood marjorie  she lugged his leg out straight put it into the natural and least painful pose padded it with moss and her torn handkerchief and bound it up as she did so a handful of snowflakes came whirling about them she was now braced up to every possibility it never rains she said grimly but it pours and went on with her bonesetting he was badly weakened by pain and shock and once he swore at her sharply sorry he said  she rolled him over on his chest and left him to struggle to the shelter of the rock while she went for more wood  the sky alarmed her the mountains up the valley were already hidden by driven rags of slaty snowstorms this time she found a longer but easier path for dragging her boughs and trees she determined she would not start the fire until nightfall nor waste any time in preparing food until then there were dead boughs for kindlingmore than enough it was snowing quite fast by the time she got up to him with her second load and a premature twilight already obscured and exaggerated the rocks and mounds about her she gave some of her cheese to trafford and gnawed some herself on her way down to the wood again she regretted that she had brought neither candles nor lantern because then she might have kept on until the cold of night stopped her and she reproached herself bitterly because she had brought no tea she could forgive herself the lantern she had never expected to be out after dark but the tea was inexcusable she muttered selfreproaches while she worked like two men among the trees panting puffs of mist that froze upon her lips and iced the knitted wool that covered her chin why dont they teach a girl to handle an axe  when at last the wolfish cold of the labrador night had come it found trafford and marjorie seated almost warmly on a bed of pine boughs between the sheltering dark rock behind and a big but well husbanded fire in front drinking a queertasting but not unsavory soup of lynxflesh that she had fortified with the remainder of the brandy then they tried roast lynx and ate a little and finished with some scraps of cheese and deep draughts of hot water thenoh tyburnia and chelsea and all that is becomingthey smoked traffords pipe for alternate minutes and marjorie found great comfort in it  the snowstorm poured incessantly out of the darkness to become flakes of burning fire in the light of the flames flakes that vanished magically but it only reached them and wetted them in occasional gusts what did it matter for the moment if the dim snowheaps rose and rose about them a glorious fatigue an immense selfsatisfaction possessed marjorie she felt that they had both done well  i am not afraid of tomorrow now she said at lasta thought matured no  trafford had the pipe and did not speak for a moment nor i he said at last very likely well get through with it he added after a pause i thought i was done for a manloses heart after a loss of blood  the legs better  hot as fire his humour hadnt left him its a treat he said the hottest thing in labrador  ive been a good squaw this time old man she asked suddenly  he seemed not to hear her then his lips twitched and he made a feeble movement for her hand i cursed you he said  she slept but on a spring as it were lest the fire should fall she replenished it with boughs tucked in the halfburnt logs and went to sleep again then it seemed to her that some invisible hand was pouring a thin spirit on the flames that made them leap and crackle and spread north and south until they filled the heavens her eyes were open and the snowstorm overpast leaving the sky clear and all the westward heaven alight with the trailing crackling leaping curtains of the aurora brighter than she had ever seen them before quite clearly visible beyond the smoulder of the fire a wintry waste of rock and snow boulder beyond boulder passed into a dun obscurity the mountain to the right of them lay long and white and stiff a shrouded death all earth was dead and waste and nothing and the sky alive and coldly marvellous signalling and astir she watched the changing shifting colours and they made her think of the gathering banners of inhuman hosts the stir and marshalling of icy giants for ends stupendous and indifferent to all the trivial impertinence of mans existence  that night the whole world of man seemed small and shallow and insecure to her beyond comparison one came she thought but just a little way out of its warm and sociable cities hither and found this homeless wilderness one pricked the thin appearances of life with microscope or telescope and came to an equal strangeness all the pride and hope of human life goes to and fro in a little shell of air between this ancient globe of rusty nickelsteel and the void of space faint specks we are within a film we quiver between the atom and the infinite being hardly more substantial than the glow within an oily skin that drifts upon the water the wonder and the riddle of it here she and trafford were phantasmal shapes of unsubstantial fluid thinly skinned against evaporation and wrapped about with woven wool and the skins of beasts that yet reflected and perceived suffered and sought to understand that held a million memories framed thoughts that plumbed the deeps of space and timeand another day of snow or icy wind might leave them just scattered bones and torn rags gnawed by a famishing wolf  she felt a passionate desire to pray  she glanced at trafford beside her and found him awake and staring his face was very pale and strange in that livid flickering light she would have spoken and then she saw his lips were moving and something something she did not understand held her back from doing so   § 7  the bleak slow dawn found marjorie intently busy she had made up the fire boiled water and washed and dressed traffords wounds and made another soup of lynx but trafford had weakened in the night the stuff nauseated him he refused it and tried to smoke and was sick and then sat back rather despairfully after a second attempt to persuade her to leave him there to die this failure of his spirit distressed her and a little astonished her but it only made her more resolute to go through with her work she had awakened cold stiff and weary but her fatigue vanished with movement she toiled for an hour replenishing her pile of fuel made up the fire put his gun ready to his hand kissed him abused him lovingly for the trouble he gave her until his poor torn face lit in response and then parting on a note of cheerful confidence set out to return to the hut she found the way not altogether easy to make out wind and snow had left scarcely a trace of their tracks and her mind was full of the stores she must bring and the possibility of moving him nearer to the hut she was startled to see by the fresh deep spoor along the ridge how near the wolf had dared approach them in the darkness  ever and again marjorie had to halt and look back to get her direction right as it was she came through the willow scrub nearly half a mile above the hut and had to follow the steep bank of the frozen river down at one place she nearly slipped upon an icy slope of rock  one possibility she did not dare to think of during that time a blizzard now would cut her off absolutely from any return to trafford short of that she believed she could get through  her quick mind was full of all she had to do at first she had thought chiefly of his immediate necessities of food and some sort of shelter she had got a list of things in her headmeat extract bandages corrosive sublimate by way of antiseptic brandy a tin of beef some bread and so forth she went over that several times to be sure of it and then for a time she puzzled about a tent she thought she could manage a bale of blankets on her back and that she could rig a sleeping tent for herself and trafford with one and some bent sticks the big tent would be too much to strike and shift and then her mind went on to a bolder enterprise which was to get him home the nearer she could bring him to the log hut the nearer they would be to supplies she cast about for some sort of sledge the snow was too soft and broken for runners especially among the trees but if she could get a flat of smooth wood she thought she might be able to drag him she decided to try the side of her bunk she could easily get that off she would have of course to run it edgewise through the thickets and across the ravine but after that she would have almost clear going until she reached the steep place of broken rocks within two hundred yards of him the idea of a sledge grew upon her and she planned to nail a rope along the edge and make a kind of harness for herself  she found the campingplace piled high with drifted snow which had invaded tent and hut and that some beast a wolverine she guessed had been into the hut devoured every candleend and the uppers of traffords wellgreased second boots and had then gone to the corner of the store shed and clambered up to the stores she made no account of its depredations there but set herself to make a sledge and get her supplies together there was a gleam of sunshine but she did not like the look of the sky and she was horribly afraid of what might be happening to trafford she carried her stuff through the wood and across the ravine and returned for her improvised sledge she was still struggling with that among the trees when it began to snow again  it was hard then not to be frantic in her efforts as it was she packed her stuff so loosely on the planking that she had to repack it and she started without putting on her snowshoes and floundered fifty yards before she discovered that omission the snow was now falling fast darkling the sky and hiding everything but objects close at hand and she had to use all her wits to determine her direction she knew she must go down a long slope and then up to the ridge and it came to her as a happy inspiration that if she bore to the left she might strike some recognizable vestige of her mornings trail she had read of people walking in circles when they have no light or guidance and that troubled her until she bethought herself of the little compass on her watch chain by that she kept her direction she wished very much she had timed herself across the waste so that she could tell when she approached the ridge  soon her back and shoulders were aching violently and the rope across her chest was tugging like some eviltempered thing but she did not dare to rest the snow was now falling thick and fast the flakes traced white spirals and made her head spin so that she was constantly falling away to the southwestward and then correcting herself by the compass she tried to think how this zigzagging might affect her course but the snow whirls confused her mind and a growing anxiety would not let her pause to think she felt blinded it seemed to be snowing inside her eyes so that she wanted to rub them soon the ground must rise to the ridge she told herself it must surely rise then the sledge came bumping at her heels and she perceived she was going down hill she consulted the compass and she found she was facing south she turned sharply to the right again the snowfall became a noiseless pitiless torture to sight and mind  the sledge behind her struggled to hold her back and the snow balled under her snowshoes she wanted to stop and rest take thought sit for a moment she struggled with herself and kept on she tried walking with shut eyes and tripped and came near sprawling oh god she cried oh god too stupefied for more articulate prayers  would the rise of the ground to the ribs of rock never come  a figure black and erect stood in front of her suddenly and beyond appeared a group of black straight antagonists she staggered on towards them gripping her rifle with some muddled idea of defence and in another moment she was brushing against the branches of a stunted fir which shed thick lumps of snow upon her feet what trees were these had she ever passed any trees no there were no trees on her way to trafford  she began whimpering like a tormented child but even as she wept she turned her sledge about to follow the edge of the wood she was too much downhill she thought and she must bear up again  she left the trees behind made an angle uphill to the right and was presently among trees again again she left them and again came back to them she screamed with anger at them and twitched her sledge away she wiped at the snowstorm with her arm as though she would wipe it away she wanted to stamp on the universe  and she ached she ached  something caught her eye ahead something that gleamed it was exactly like a long bare rather pinkish bone standing erect on the ground just because it was strange and queer she ran forward to it then as she came nearer she perceived it was a streak of barked trunk a branch had been torn off a pine tree and the bark stripped down to the root and then her foot hit against a freshly hewn stump and then came another poking its pinkish wounds above the snow and there were chips this filled her with wonder some one had been cutting wood there must be indians or trappers near she thought and then realized the woodcutter could be none other than herself  she turned to the right and saw the rocks rising steeply close at hand oh rag she cried and fired her rifle in the air  ten seconds twenty seconds and then so loud and near it amazed her came his answering shot it sounded like the hillside bursting  in another moment she had discovered the trail she had made overnight and that morning by dragging firewood it was now a shallow soft white trench instantly her despair and fatigue had gone from her should she take a load of wood with her she asked herself in addition to the weight behind her and had a better idea she would unload and pile her stuff here and bring him down on the sledge closer to the wood she looked about and saw two rocks that diverged with a space between she flashed schemes she would trample the snow hard and flat put her sledge on it pile boughs and make a canopy of blanket overhead and behind then a fire in front  she saw her camp admirable she tossed her provisions down and ran up the broad windings of her pinetree trail to trafford with the unloaded sledge bumping behind her she ran as lightly as though she had done nothing that day  she found him markedly recovered weak and quiet with snow drifting over his feet his rifle across his knees and his pipe alight back already he said but  he hesitated no grub  she knelt over him gave his rough unshaven cheek a swift kiss and very rapidly explained her plan   § 8  in three days time they were back at the hut and the last two days they wore blue spectacles because of the midday glare of the sunlit snow  it amazed marjorie to discover as she lay awake in the camp on the edge of the ravine close to the hut to which she had lugged trafford during the second day that she was deeply happy it was preposterous that she should be so but those days of almost despairful stress were irradiated now by a new courage she was doing this thing against all labrador and the snowdriving wind that blew from the polar wilderness she was winning it was a great discovery to her that hardship and effort almost to the breakingpoint could ensue in so deep a satisfaction she lay and thought how deep and rich life had become for her as though in all this effort and struggle some unsuspected veil had been torn away she perceived again but now with no sense of desolation that same infinite fragility of life which she had first perceived when she had watched the aurora borealis flickering up the sky beneath that realization and carrying it as a river flood may carry scum was a sense of herself as something deeper greater more enduring than mountain or wilderness or sky or any of those monstrous forms of nature that had dwarfed her physical self to nothingness  she had a persuasion of self detachment and illumination and withal of selfdiscovery she saw her life of time and space for what it was away in london the children with the coldest of noses and the gayest of spirits would be scampering about their bedrooms in the mild morning sunlight of a london winter elsie the parlourmaid would be whisking dexterous about the diningroom the bacon would be cooking and the coffeemill at work the letters of the morning delivery perhaps just pattering into the letterbox and all the bright little household she had made with all the furniture she had arranged all the characteristic decoration she had given it all the clever convenient arrangements would be getting itself into action for another dayand it wasnt herself it was the extremest of her superficiality  she had come out of all that and even so it seemed she had come out of herself this weary woman lying awake on the balsam boughs with a brain cleared by underfeeding and this continuous arduous bath of toil in snowwashed frost cleansed starry air this too was no more than a momentarily clarified window for her unknown and indefinable reality what was that reality what was she herself she became interested in framing an answer to that and slipped down from the peace of soul she had attained her serenity gave way to a reiteration of this question reiterations increasing and at last oppressing like the snowflakes of a storm perpetual whirling repetitions that at last confused her and hid the sky  she fell asleep   § 9  with their return to the hut marjorie had found herself encountering a new set of urgencies in their absence that wretched little wolverine had found great plenty and happiness in the tent and storeshed its traces were manifest nearly everywhere and it had particularly assailed the candles after a destructive time among the frozen caribou beef it had clambered up on the packages of sardines and jumped thence on to a sloping pole that it could claw along into the frame of the roof she rearranged the packages but that was no good she could not leave trafford in order to track the brute down and for a night or so she could not think of any way of checking its depredations it came each night trafford kept her close at home she had expected that when he was back in his bunk secure and warm he would heal rapidly but instead he suddenly developed all the symptoms of a severe feverish cold and his scars which had seemed healing became flushed and uglylooking moreover there was something wrong with his leg an ominous ache that troubled her mind every woman she decided ought to know how to set a bone he was unable to sleep by reason of these miseries though very desirous of doing so he became distressingly weak and inert he ceased to care for food and presently he began ta talk to himself with a complete disregard of her presence hourly she regretted her ignorance of medicine that left her with no conceivable remedy for all the aching and gnawing that worried and weakened him except bathing with antiseptics and a liberal use of quinine  and his face became strange to her for over his flushed and sunken cheeks under the raw spaces of the scar a blond beard bristled and grew presently trafford was a bearded man  incidentally however she killed the wolverine by means of a trap of her own contrivance a loaded rifle with a bait of what was nearly her last candles rigged to the trigger  but this loss of the candles brought home to them the steady lengthening of the nights scarcely seven hours of day remained now in the black cold grip of the darkness and through those seventeen hours of chill aggression they had no light but the red glow of the stove she had to close the door of the hut and bar every chink and cranny against the icy air that became at last a murderous freezing wind not only did she line the hut with every scrap of skin and paper she could obtain but she went out with the spade toiling for three laborious afternoons in piling and beating snow against the outer frame and now it was that trafford talked at last talked with something of the persistence of delirium and she sat and listened hour by hour silently for he gave no heed to her or to anything she might say he talked it seemed to god   § 10  darkness about a sullen glow of red and a voice speaking  the voice of a man fevered and in pain wounded and amidst hardship and danger struggling with the unrelenting riddle of his being ever and again when a flame leapt she would see his face haggard bearded changed and yet infinitely familiar  his voice varied now high and clear now mumbling now vexed and expostulating now rich with deep feeling now fagged and slow his matter varied too now he talked like one who is inspired and now like one lost and confused stupidly repeating phrases going back upon a misleading argument painfully laboriously beginning over and over again marjorie sat before the stove watching it burn and sink replenishing it preparing food and outside the bitter wind moaned and blew the powdery snow before it and the shortening interludes of pallid diffused daylight which pass for days in such weather came and went intense cold had come now with leaden snowy days and starless nights  sometimes his speech filled her mind seemed to fill all her world sometimes she ceased to listen following thoughts of her own sometimes she dozed sometimes she awakened from sleep to find him talking but slowly she realized a thread in his discourse a progress and development  sometimes he talked of his early researches and then he would trace computations with his hands as if he were using a blackboard and became distressed to remember what he had written sometimes he would be under the claws of the lynx again and fighting for his eyes ugh he said keep those hind legs still keep your hind legs still knife knife ah got it guuu you beast  but the gist of his speech was determined by the purpose of his journey to labrador at last he was reviewing his life and hers and all that their life might signify even as he determined to do she began to perceive that whatever else drifted into his mind and talk this recurred and grew that he returned to the conclusion he had reached and not to the beginning of the matter and went on from that  you see he said our lives are nothingnothing in themselves i know that ive never had any doubts of that we individuals just pick up a mixed lot of things out of the powers that begat us and lay them down again presently a little altered thats allheredities traditions the finger nails of my grandfather a greataunts lips the faith of a sect the ideas of ones time we live and then we die and the threads run dispersing this way and that to make other people again whatevers immortal isnt that our looks or our habits our thoughts or our memoriesjust the shapes these are of one immortal stuff one immortal stuff  the voice died away as if he was baffled then it resumed  but we ought to partake of immortality thats my point we ought to partake of immortality  i mean were like the little elements in a magnet ought not to lie higgledypiggledy ought to point the same way bepolarizedsomething microcosmic you know ought to be found in a man  analogies run away with one suppose the bar isnt magnetized yet suppose purpose has to come suppose the immortal stuff isnt yet isnt being but struggling to be struggling to be gods that morning when the child was born and afterwards she was therewith a smile on her lips and a little flushed and proudas if nothing had happened so very much out of the way nothing so wonderful and we had another life besides our own  afterwards he came back to that that was a good image he said something trying to exist which isnt substance doesnt belong to space or time something stifled and enclosed struggling to get through just confused birth cries eyes that hardly see deaf ears poor little thrusting hands a thing altogether blind at first a twitching and thrusting of protoplasm under the waters and then the plants creeping up the beaches the insects and reptiles on the margins of the rivers beasts with a flicker of light in their eyes answering the sun and at last out of the long interplay of desire and fear an ape an ape that stared and wondered and scratched queer pictures on a bone  he lapsed into silent thought for a time and marjorie glanced at his dim face in the shadows  i say nothing of ultimates he said at last  he repeated that twice before his thoughts would flow again  this is as much as i see in time as i know it and space as i know itsomething struggling to exist its true to the end of my limits what can i say beyond that it struggles to exist becomes conscious becomes now conscious of itself that is where i come in as a part of it above the beast in me is thatthe desire to know better to knowbeautifully and to transmit my knowledge thats all there is in life for me beyond food and shelter and tidying up this beingopening its eyes listening trying to comprehend every good thing in man is thatlooking and making pictures listening and making songs making philosophies and sciences trying new powers bridge and engine spark and gun at the bottom of my soul that we began with bonescratching were stillnear it i am just a part of this beginningmixed with other things every book every art every religion is that the attempt to understand and expressmixed with other things nothing else matters nothing whatever i tell younothing whatever  ive always believed that all my life ive believed that  only ive forgotten  every man with any brains believes that at the bottom of his heart only he gets busy and forgets he goes shooting lynxes and breaks his leg odd instinctive brutal thing to doto go tracking down a lynx to kill it i grant you that marjorie i grant you that  grant me what she cried startled beyond measure to hear herself addressed  grant you that it is rather absurd to go hunting a lynx and what big paws it hasdisproportionately big i wonder if thats an adaptation to snow tremendous paws they are but the real thing i was saying the real thing is to get knowledge and express it all things lead up to that civilization social order just for that except for that all the life of man all his affairs his laws and police his morals and mannersnonsense nonsense nonsense lynx hunts just ways of getting themselves mauled and clawed perhapsinto a state of understanding who knows  his voice became low and clear  understanding spreading like a dawn  logic and language clumsy implements but rising to our needs rising to our needs thought clarified enriched reaching out to every man alivesome daypresentlytouching every man alive harmonizing acts and plans drawing men into gigantic cooperations tremendous cooperations  until man shall stand upon this earth as upon a footstool and reach out his hand among the stars  and then i went into the rubber market and spent seven years of my life driving shares up and down and into a net queer game indeed stupid ass behrens wasat bottom  theres a flaw in it somewhere  he came back to that several times before he seemed able to go on from it  there is a collective mind he said a growing general consciousnessgrowing clearer something put me away from that but i know it my work my thinking was a part of it thats why i was so mad about behrens  behrens  of course hed got a twist a wrong twist it makes me angry now it will take years it will eat up some brilliant man to clean up after behrens  yes but the point ishis voice became acutewhy did i go making money and let behrens in why generally and in all sorts of things does behrens come in  he was silent for a long time and then he began to answer himself of course he said i said itor somebody said itabout this collective mind being mixed with other things its something arising out of lifenot the common stuff of life an exhalation its like the little tongues of fire that came at pentecost queer how one comes drifting back to these images perhaps i shall die a christian yet the other christians wont like me if i do what was i saying its what i reach up to what i desire shall pervade me not what i am just as far as i give myself purely to knowledge to making feeling and thought clear in my mind and words to the understanding and expression of the realities and relations of life just so far do i achieve salvation salvation  i wonder is salvation the same for every one perhaps for one man salvation is research and thought and for another expression in art and for another nursing lepers provided he does it in the spirit he has to do it in the spirit  there came a silence as though some difficulty baffled him and he was feeling back to get his argument again  this flame that arises out of life that redeems life from purposeless triviality isnt life let me get hold of that thats a point thats a very important point  something had come to him  ive never talked of this to marjorie ive lived with her nine years and more and never talked of religion not once thats so queer of us any other couple in any other time would have talked religion no end people ought to  then he stuck out an argumentative hand you see marjorie is life he said  she took me  he spoke slowly as though he traced things carefully before i met her i suppose i wasnt half alive no yet i dont remember i felt particularly incomplete women were interesting of course they excited me at times that girl at yonkershm i stuck to my work it was fine work i forget half of it now the halfconcealed intimations i meanqueer how one forgetsbut i know i felt my way to wide deep things it was like exploring cavesmonstrous limitless caves such caves very stillunderground wonderful and beautiful theyre lying there now for other men to seek other men will find them then she came as though she was taking possession the beauty of her oh the life and bright eagerness and the incompatibility thats the riddle ive loved her always when she came to my arms it seemed to me the crown of life caves indeed old caves nothing else seemed to matter but something did all sorts of things did i found that out soon enough and when that first child was born that for a time was supreme yesshes the quintessence of life the dear greed of her the appetite the clever appetite for things she grabs shes so damned clever the light in her eyes her quick sure hands only my work was crowded out of my life and ended and she didnt seem to feel it she didnt seem to mind it there was a sort of disregard disregard as though all that didnt really matter  my dear whispered marjorie unheeded she wanted to tell him it mattered now mattered supremely but she knew he had no ears for her  his voice flattened its perplexing he said the two different things  then suddenly he cried out harshly i ought never to have married hernever never i had my task i gave myself to her oh the high immensities the great and terrible things open to the mind of man and we breed children and live in littered houses and play with our food and chatter chatter chatter oh the chatter of my life the folly the women with their clothes i can hear them rustle now whiff the scent of it the scandalsas though the things they did with themselves and each other mattered a rap the little sham impromptu clever things the trying to keep youngand underneath it all that continual cheating cheating cheating damning struggle for money  marjorie marjorie marjorie why is she so good and no better why wasnt she worth it altogether  no i dont want to go on with it any moreever i want to go back  i want my life over again and to go back  i want research and the spirit of research that has died in me and that still silent room of mine again that room as quiet as a cell and the toil that led to light oh the coming of that light the uprush of discovery the solemn joy as the generalization rises like a sun upon the factsfloods them with a common meaning that is what i want that is what i have always wanted  give me my time oh god again i am sick of this life i have chosen i am sick of it thisbusy death give me my time again why did you make me and then waste me like this why are we made for folly upon folly folly and brains made to scale high heaven smeared into the dust into the dust into the dust dust  he passed into weak wandering repetitions of disconnected sentences that died into whispers and silence and marjorie watched him and listened to him and waited with a noiseless dexterity upon his every need   § 11  one day she did not know what day for she had lost count of the days marjorie set the kettle to boil and opened the door of the hut to look out and the snow was ablaze with diamonds and the air was sweet and still it occurred to her that it would be well to take trafford out into that brief brightness she looked at him and found his eyes upon the sunlight quiet and rather wondering eyes  would you like to get out into that she asked abruptly  yes he said and seemed disposed to get up  youve got a broken leg she cried to arrest his movement and he looked at her and answered of coursei forgot  she was all atremble that he should recognize her and speak to her she pulled her rude old sledge alongside his bunk and kissed him and showed him how to shift and drop himself upon the plank she took him in her arms and lowered him he helped weakly but understandingly and she wrapped him up warmly on the planks and lugged him out and built up a big fire at his feet wondering but as yet too fearful to rejoice at the change that had come to him  he said no more but his eyes watched her move about with a kind of tired curiosity he smiled for a time at the sun and shut his eyes and still faintly smiling lay still she had a curious fear that if she tried to talk to him this new lucidity would vanish again she went about the business of the morning glancing at him ever and again until suddenly the calm of his upturned face smote her and she ran to him and crouched down to him between hope and a terrible fear and found that he was sleeping and breathing very lightly sleeping with the deep unconsciousness of a child  when he awakened the sun was red in the west his eyes met hers and he seemed a little puzzled  ive been sleeping madge he said  she nodded  and dreaming ive a vague sort of memory of preaching and preaching in a kind of black empty place where there wasnt anything a fury of exposition  a kind of argument i sayis there such a thing in the world as a newlaid eggand some breadandbutter  he seemed to reflect of course he said i broke my leg gollys i thought that beast was going to claw my eyes out lucky madge it didnt get my eyes it was just a chance it didnt  he stared at her  i say he said youve had a pretty rough time how long has this been going on  he amazed her by rising himself on his elbow and sitting up  your leg she cried  he put his hand down and felt it pretty stiff he said you get me some foodthere were some eggs madge frozen newlaid anyhowand then well take these splints off and feel about a bit eh why not how did you get me out of that scrape madge i thought id got to be froze as safe as eggs those eggs ought to be all right you know if you put them on in a saucepan and wait until they boil ive a sort of muddled impression by jove madge youve had a time i say you have had a time  his eyes full of a warmth of kindliness she had not seen for long weeks scrutinized her face i say he repeated very softly  all her strength went from her at his tenderness oh my dear she wailed kneeling at his side my dear dear and still regardful of his leg she yet contrived to get herself weeping into his coveted arms  he regarded her he held her he patted her back the infinite luxury to her hed come back hed come back to her  how long has it been he asked poor dear poor dear how long can it have been   § 12  from that hour trafford mended he remained clearminded helpful sustaining his face healed daily marjorie had had to cut away great fragments of gangrenous frozen flesh and he was clearly destined to have a huge scar over forehead and cheek but in that pure clear air once the healing had begun it progressed swiftly his leg had set a little shorter than its fellow and with a lump in the middle of the shin but it promised to be a good serviceable leg none the less they examined it by the light of the stove with their heads together and discussed when it would be wise to try it how do doctors tell when a man may stand on his broken leg she had a vague impression you must wait six weeks but she could not remember why she fixed upon that time  it seems a decent interval said trafford well try it  she had contrived a crutch for him against that momentous experiment and he sat up in his bunk pillowed up by a sack and her rugs and whittled it smooth and padded the fork with the skin of that slaughtered wolverine poor victim of hungerwhile she knelt by the stove feeding it with logs and gave him an account of their position  were somewhere in the middle of december she said somewhere between the twelfth and the fourteenthyes im as out as thatand ive handled the stores pretty freely so did that little beast until i got him she nodded at the skin in his hand i dont see myself shooting much now and so far ive not been able to break the ice to fish its too much for me even if it isnt too late to fish this book weve got describes barks and mosses and that will help but if we stick here until the birds and things come were going to be precious short we may have to last right into july ive plansbut it may come to that we ought to ration all the regular stuff and trust to luck for a feast the rationsi dont know what theyll come to  right o said trafford admiring her capable gravity lets ration  marjorie he asked abruptly are you sorry we came  her answer came unhesitatingly no  nor i  he paused ive found you out he said dear dirty living thing you are dirty you know  ive found myself she answered thinking i feel as if ive never loved you until this hut i suppose i have in my way  lugano he suggested dont lets forget good things marjorie oh and endless times  oh of course as for that but nownow youre in my bones we were just two shallow pretty young thingsloving it was sweet dearsweet as youthbut not this unkempt and wearythen one understands love i suppose i am dirty think of it ive lugged you through the snow till my shoulders chafed and bled i cried with pain and kept on luggingoh my dear my dear he kissed her hair ive held you in my arms to keep you from freezing id have frozen myself first weve got to starve together perhaps before the end dear if i could make you you should eat me imim beginning to understand ive had a light ive begun to understand ive begun to see what life has been for you and how ive wastedwasted  weve wasted  no she said it was i  she sat back on the floor and regarded him you dont remember things you saidwhen you were delirious  no he answered what did i say  nothing  nothing clearly what did i say  it doesnt matter no indeed only you made me understand youd never have told me youve always been a little weak with me there but its plain to me why we didnt keep our happiness why we were estranged if we go back alive we go backall that settled for good and all  what  that discord my dear ive been a fool selfish illtrained and greedy weve both been floundering about but ive been the mischief of it yes ive been the trouble oh its had to be so what are we womenhalf savages half pets unemployed things of greed and desireand suddenly we want all the rights and respect of souls ive had your life in my hands from the moment we met together if i had known it isnt that we can make you or guide youim not pretending to be an inspirationbutbut we can release you we neednt press upon you we can save you from the instincts and passions that try to waste you altogether on us yes im beginning to understand oh my child my husband my man you talked of your wasted life ive been thinkingsince first we left the mersey ive begun to see what it is to be a woman for the first time in my life were the responsible sex and weve forgotten it we think weve done a wonder if weve borne men into the world and smiled a little but indeed weve got to bear them all our lives a woman has to be steadier than a man and more selfsacrificing than a man because when she plunges she does more harm than a man and what does she achieve if she does plunge nothingnothing worth counting dresses and carpets and hangings and pretty arrangements excitements and satisfactions and competition and more excitements we cant do things we dont bring things off and you you monster you dream you want to stick your hand out of all that is and make something that isnt begin to be thats the man  dear old madge he said theres all sorts of women and all sorts of men  well our sort of women then and our sort of men  i doubt even that  i dont ive found my place ive been making my master my servant we womenweve been looting all the good things in the world and helping nothing youve carried me on your back until you are loathing life ive been making you fetch and carry for me love me dress me keep me and my children minister to my vanities and greeds no let me go on im so penitent my dear so penitent i want to kneel down here and marry you all over again heal up your broken life and begin again  she paused  one doesnt begin again she said but i want to take a new turn dear youre still only a young man weve thirty or forty years before usforty years perhaps or more what shall we do with our years weve loved weve got children what remains here we can plan it out work it out day after day what shall we do with our lives and life tell me make me your partner its you who know what are we doing with life   § 13  what are we doing with life  that question overtakes a reluctant and fugitive humanity the traffords were but two of a great scattered host of people who obeying all the urgencies of need and desire struggling loving begetting enjoying do nevertheless find themselves at last unsatisfied they have lived the round of experience achieved all that living creatures have sought since the beginning of the worldsecurity and gratification and offspringand they find themselves still strong unsatiated with power in their hands and years before them empty of purpose what are they to do  the world presents such a spectacle of evasion as it has never seen before never was there such a boiling over and waste of vital energy the sphinx of our opportunity calls for the uttermost powers of heart and brain to read its riddlethe new astonishing riddle of excessive power a few give themselves to those honourable adventures that extend the range of man they explore untravelled countries climb remote mountains conduct researches risk life and limb in the fantastic experiments of flight and a monstrous outpouring of labour and material goes on in the strenuous preparation for needless and improbable wars the rest divert themselves with the dwarfish satisfactions of recognized vice the meagre routine of pleasure or still more timidly with sport and gamesthose new unscheduled perversions of the soul  we are afraid of our new selves the dawn of human opportunity appals us few of us dare look upon this strange light of freedom and limitless resources that breaks upon our world  think said trafford while we sit here in this dark hutthink of the surplus life that wastes itself in the world for sheer lack of direction away there in englandi suppose that is westwardhe pointedthere are thousands of men going out today to shoot think of the beautifully made guns the perfected ammunition the excellent clothes the army of beaters the carefully preserved woodland the admirable science of itall for that idiot massacre of halftame birds just because man once had need to be a hunter think of the others againgolfing think of the big elaborate houses from which they come the furnishings the service and the womendressing perpetually dressing you marjorieyouve done nothing but dress since we married no let me abuse you dear its insane you know you dress your minds a little to talk amusingly you spread your minds out to backgrounds to households picturesque and delightful gardens nurseries those nurseries think of our tremendously cherished and educated children and when they grow up what have we got for them a feast of futility   § 14  on the evening of the day when trafford first tried to stand upon his leg they talked far into the night it had been a great and eventful day for them full of laughter and exultation he had been at first ridiculously afraid he had clung to her almost childishly and she had held him about the body with his weight on her strong right arm and his right arm in her left hand concealing her own dread of a collapse under a mask of taunting courage the crutch had proved admirable its my silly knees trafford kept on saying the legs all right but i get put out by my silly knees  they made the day a feast a dinner of two whole days rations and a special soup instead of supper the birds will come they explained to each other ducks and geese long before may may you know is the latest  marjorie confessed the habit of sharing his pipe was growing on her what shall we do in tyburnia she said and left it to the imagination  if ever we get back there he said  i dont much fancy kicking a skirt before my shins againand ill be a black coarse woman down to my neck at dinner for years to come  then as he lay back in his bunk and she crammed the stove with fresh boughs and twigs of balsam that filled the little space about them with warmth and with a faint sweet smell of burning and with flitting red reflections he took up a talk about religion they had begun some days before  you see he said ive always believed in salvation i suppose a mans shy of saying soeven to his wife but ive always believed more or less distinctly that there was something up to which a life workedalways its been rather vague ill admit i dont think ive ever believed in individual salvation you see i feel these are deep things and the deeper one gets the less individual one becomes thats why one thinks of those things in darkness and lonelinessand finds them hard to tell one has an individual voice or an individual birthmark or an individualized old hat but the soulthe souls different it isnt me talking to you when it comes to that this question of what we are doing with life isnt a question to begin with for you and me as ourselves but for you and me as mankind am i spinning it too fine madge  no she said intent go on  you see when we talk rations here marjorie its ourselves but when we talk religionits mankind youve either got to be everyman in religion or leave it alone thats my idea its no more presumptuous to think for the race than it is for a beggar to praythough that means going right up to god and talking to him salvations a collective thing and a mystical thingor there isnt any fancy the almighty and me sitting up and keeping eternity together god and r a g trafford frsthats silly fancy a man in number seven boots and a tailormade suit in the nineteenfourteen fashion sitting before god thats caricature but god and man thats sense marjorie  he stopped and stared at her  marjorie sat redlit regarding him queer things you say she said so much of this ive never thought out i wonder why ive never done so too busy with many things i suppose but go on and tell me more of these secrets youve kept from me  well weve got to talk of these things as mankindor just leave them alone and shoot pheasants  if i could shoot a pheasant now whispered marjorie involuntarily  and where do we stand what do we needi mean the whole race of uskings and beggars together you know marjorie its thisits understanding thats what mankind has got to the realization that it doesnt understand that it cant express that its purblind we havent got eyes for those greater things but weve got the promisethe intimation of eyes weve come out of an unsuspecting darkness brute animal darkness not into sight thats been the mistake but into a feeling of illumination into a feeling of light shining through our opacity  i feel that man has now before all things to know thats his supreme duty to feel realize see understand express himself to the utmost limits of his power  he sat up speaking very earnestly to her and in that flickering light she realized for the first time how thin he had become how bright and hollow his eyes his hair was long over his eyes and a rough beard flowed down to his chest all the religions he said all the philosophies have pretended to achieve too much weve no language yet for religious truth or metaphysical truth weve no basis yet broad enough and strong enough on which to build religion and philosophy have been impudent and quackishquackish theyve been like the doctors who have always pretended they could cure since the beginning of things cure everything and to this day even they havent got more than the beginnings of knowledge on which to base a cure theyve lacked humility theyve lacked the honour to say they didnt know the priests took things of wood and stone the philosophers took little odd arrangements of poor battered words metaphors analogies abstractions and said thats it think of their silly old absoluteabsolutus an untied parcel i heard haldane at the aristotelian once go on for an hourno it was longer than an houras glib and slick as a welloiled sausagemachine about the different sorts of absolute and not a soul of us laughed out at him the vanity of such profundities theyve no faith faith in patience faith to wait for the coming of god and since we dont know god since we dont know his will with us isnt it plain that all our lives should be a search for him and it can anything else matterafter we are free from necessity that is the work now that is before all mankind to attempt understandingby the perpetual finding of thought and the means of expression by perpetual extension and refinement of science by the research that every artist makes for beauty and significance in his art by the perpetual testing and destruction and rebirth under criticism of all these things and by a perpetual extension of this intensifying wisdom to more minds and more minds and more till all men share in it and share in the making of it there you have my creed marjorie there you have the very marrow of me  he became silent  will you go back to your work she said abruptly go back to your laboratory  he stared at her for a moment without speaking never he said at last  but she said and the word dropped from her like a stone that falls down a well  my dear he said at last ive thought of that but since i left that dear dusty little laboratory and all those exquisite subtle thingsive lived ive left that man seven long years behind me some other man must go oni think some younger manwith the riddles i found to work on then ive growninto something different it isnt how atoms swing with one another or why they build themselves up so and not so that matters any more to me ive got you and all the world in which we live and a new set of riddles filling my mind how thought swings about thought how one man attracts his fellows how the waves of motive and conviction sweep through a crowd and all the little drifting crystallizations of spirit with spirit and all the repulsions and eddies and difficulties that one can catch in that turbulent confusion i want to do a new sort of work now altogether life has swamped me once but i dont think it will get me under againi want to study men  he paused and she waited with a face aglow  i want to go back to watch and thinkand i suppose write i believe i shall write criticism but everything that matters is criticism i want to get into contact with the men who are thinking i dont mean to meet them necessarily but to get into the souls of their books every writer who has anything to say every artist who matters is the stronger for every man or woman who responds to him thats the great workthe reality i want to become a part of this stuttering attempt to express i want at least to resonate even if i do not help and you with me marjorieyou with me everything i write i want you to see and think about i want you to read as i read now after so long now that now that weve begun to talk you know talk again  something stopped his voice something choked them both into silence he held out a lean hand and she shuffled on her knees to take it  dont please make me she stumbled through her thoughts one of those little parasitic parroting wivesdont pretend too much about mebecause you want me with you dont forget a woman isnt a man  old madge he said you and i have got to march together didnt i love you from the first from that time when i was a boy examiner and you were a candidate girlbecause your mind was clear  and we will go back she whispered with a work  with a purpose he said  she disengaged herself from his arm and sat close to him upon the floor i think i can see what you will do she said she mused for the first time i begin to see things as they may be for us i begin to see a life ahead for the very first time  queer ideas came drifting into her head suddenly she cried out sharply in that high note he loved good heavens she said the absurdity the infinite absurdity  but what  i might have married will magnet thats all  she sprang to her feet there came a sound of wind outside a shifting of snow on the roof and the door creaked halfpast eleven she exclaimed looking at the watch that hung in the light of the stove door i dont want to sleep yet do you im going to brew some teamake a convivial drink and then we will go on talking its so good talking to you so good ive an idea dont you think on this special day it might run to a biscuit her face was keenly anxious he nodded one biscuit each she said trying to rob her voice of any note of criminality just one you know wont matter  she hovered for some moments close to the stove before she went into the arctic corner that contained the tin of tea if we can really live like that she said when we are home again  why not he answered  she made no answer but went across for the tea  he turned his head at the sound of the biscuit tin and watched her put out the precious discs  i shall have another pipe he proclaimed with an agreeable note of excess thank heaven for unstinted tobacco  and now marjories mind was teaming with thoughts of this new conception of a life lived for understanding as she went about the preparation of the tea her vividly concrete imagination was active with the realization of the life they would lead on their return she could not see it otherwise than framed in a tall fine room a study a study in sombre tones with high narrow tall dignified bookshelves and rich deep green curtains veiling its windows there should be a fireplace of white marble very plain and well proportioned with furnishings of old brass and a big desk towards the window beautifully lit by electric light with abundant space for papers to lie and she wanted some touch of the wilderness about it a skin perhaps  the tea was still infusing when she had determined upon an enormous paperweight of that iridescent labradorite that had been so astonishing a feature of the green river valley she would have it polished on one side onlythe other should be rough to show the felspar in its natural state  it wasnt that she didnt feel and understand quite fully the intention and significance of all he had said but that in these symbols of texture and equipment her mind quite naturally clothed itself and while this room was coming into anticipatory being in her mind she was making the tea very deftly and listening to traffords every word   § 15  that talk marked an epoch to marjorie from that day forth her imagination began to shape a new ordered and purposeful life for trafford and herself in london a life not altogether divorced from their former life but with a faith sustaining it and aims controlling it she had always known of the breadth and power of his mind but now as he talked of what he might do what interests might converge and give results through him it seemed she really knew him for the first time in his former researches so technical and withdrawn she had seen little of his mind in action now he was dealing in his own fashion with things she could clearly understand there were times when his talk affected her like that joy of light one has in emerging into sunshine from a long and tedious cave he swept things together flashed unsuspected correlations upon her intelligence smashed and scattered absurd yet venerated conventions of thought made undreamtof courses of action visible in a flare of luminous necessity and she could follow him and help him just as she had hampered him and crippled him so now she could release himshe fondled that word she found a preposterous image in her mind that she hid like a disgraceful secret that she tried to forget and yet its stupendous its dreamlike absurdity had something in it that shaped her delight as nothing else could do she was she told herselfhawking with an archangel  these were her moods of exaltation and she was sure she had never loved her man before that this was indeed her beginning it was as if she had just found him  perhaps she thought true lovers keep on finding each other all through their lives  and he too had discovered her all the host of marjories he had known the shining delightful seductive wilful perplexing aspects that had so filled her life gave place altogether for a time to this steadyeyed woman lean and warmwrapped with the valiant heart and the frostroughened skin what a fine strong ruddy thing she was how glad he was for this wild adventure in the wilderness if only because it had made him lie among the rocks and think of her and wait for her and despair of her life and god and at last see her coming back to him flushed with effort and calling his name to him out of that whirlwind of snow and there was at least one old memory mixed up with all these new and overmastering impressions the memory of her clear unhesitating voice as it had stabbed into his life again long years ago minute and bright in the telephone its me you know its marjorie  perhaps after all she had not wasted a moment of his life perhaps every issue between them had been necessary and it was good altogether to be turned from the study of crystals to the study of men and women  and now both their minds were londonward where all the tides and driftage and currents of human thought still meet and swirl together they were full of what they would do when they got back marjorie sketched that study to himin general terms and without the paperweightand began to shape the world she would have about it she meant to be his squaw and bodyservant first of all and thena mother children she said are none the worse for being kept a little out of focus and he was rapidly planning out his approach to the new questions to which he was now to devote his life one wants something to hold the work together he said and projected a book one cannot struggle at large for plain statement and copious and free and courageous statement one needs a positive attack  he designed a book which he might write if only for the definition it would give him and with no ultimate publication which was to be called the limits of language as a means of expression  it was to be a pragmatist essay a sustained attempt to undermine the confidence of all that scholasticism and logic chopping which still lingers like the sequelæ of a disease in our university philosophy those duffers sit in their studies and make a sort of tea of dry old wordsand think theyre distilling the spirit of wisdom he said  he proliferated titles for a time and settled at last on from realism to reality he wanted to get at that at once it fretted him to have to hang in the air day by day for want of books to quote and opponents to lance and confute and he wanted to see pictures too and plays read novels he had heard of and never read in order to verify or correct the ideas that were seething in his mind about the qualities of artistic expression his thought had come out to a conviction that the line to wider human understandings lies through a huge criticism and cleaning up of the existing methods of formulation as a preliminary to the wider and freer discussion of those religious and social issues our generation still shrinks from its grotesque he said and utterly true that the sanity and happiness of all the world lies in its habits of generalization there was not even paper for him to make notes or provisional drafts of the new work he hobbled about the camp fretting at these deprivations  marjorie he said weve done our job why should we wait here on this frosty shelf outside the world my legs getting sounderif it wasnt for that feeling of ice in it why shouldnt we make another sledge from the other bunk and start down  to hammond  why not  but the way  the valley would guide us we could do four hours a day before we had to camp im not sure we couldnt try the river we could drag and carry all our food  she looked down the wide stretches of the valley there was the hill they had christened marjorie ridge at least it was familiar every night before nightfall if they started there would be a fresh camping place to seek among the snowdrifts a great heap of wood to cut to last the night suppose his leg gave outwhen they were already some days away so that he could no longer go on or she drag him back to the stores plainly there would be nothing for it then but to lie down and die together  and a sort of weariness had come to her as a consequence of two months of halfstarved days not perhaps a failure so much as a reluctance of spirit  of course she said with a new aspect drifting before her mind thenwe could eat we could feed up before we started we could feast almost   § 16  while you were asleep the other night trafford began one day as they sat spinning out their midday meal i was thinking how badly i had expressed myself when i talked to you the other day and what a queer thin affair i made of the plans i wanted to carry out as a matter of fact theyre neither queer nor thin but they are unreal in comparison with the common things of everyday life hunger anger all the immediate desires they must be they only begin when those others are at peace its hard to set out these things theyre complicated and subtle and one cannot simplify without falsehood i dont want to simplify the world has gone out of its way time after time through simplifications and short cuts save us from epigrams and when one thinks over what one has said at a little distanceone wants to go back to it and say it all again i seem to be not so much thinking things out as reviving and developing things ive had growing in my mind ever since we met its as though an immense reservoir of thought had filled up in my mind at last and was beginning to trickle over and break down the embankment between us this conflict that has been going on between our life together and mymy intellectual life its only just growing clear in my own mind yet its just as if one turned up a light on something that had always been there  its a most extraordinary thing to think out marjorie that antagonism our love has kept us so close together and always our purposes have beenlike that he spread divergent hands ive speculated again and again whether there isnt something incurably antagonistic between women thats you generalized marjorie and men thats me directly we pass beyond the conditions of the individualistic struggle i believe every couple of lovers whove ever married have felt that strain yet its not a difference in kind between us but degree the big conflict between us has a parallel in a little internal conflict that goes on theres something of man in every woman and a touch of the feminine in every man but youre nearer as woman to the immediate personal life of sense and reality than i am as man its been so ever since the men went hunting and fighting and the women kept hut tended the children and gathered roots in the little cultivation close at hand its been so perhaps since the female carried and suckled her child and distinguished one male from another it may be it will always be so men were released from that close continuous touch with physical necessities long before women were its only now that women begin to be released for ages now men have been wandering from field and home and city over the hills and far away in search of adventures and fresh ideas and the wells of mystery beyond the edge of the world but its only now that the woman comes with them too our difference isnt a difference in kind old marjorie its the difference between the old adventurer and the new feet upon the trail  weve got to come said marjorie  oh youve got to come no good to be pioneers if the race does not follow the women are the backbone of the race the men are just the individuals into this labrador and into all the wild and desolate places of thought and desire if men come you women have to come tooand bring the race with you some day  a long day mate of my heart  who knows how long or how far arent you at any rate here dear woman of mine surely you are here  he went off at a tangent theres all those words that seem to mean something and then dont seem to mean anything that keep shifting to and fro from the deepest significance to the shallowest of claptrap socialism christianity you knowthey arent anything really as yet they are something trying to be havent i said that before marjorie  she looked round at him you said something like that when you were delirious she answered after a little pause its one of the ideas that youre struggling with you go on old man and talk weve monthsfor repetitions  well i mean that all these things are seeking after a sort of cooperation thats greater than our power even of imaginative realization thats what i mean the kingdom of heaven the communion of saints the fellowship of men these are things like high peaks far out of the common life of every day shining things that madden certain sorts of men to climb certain sorts of us im a religious man im a socialistic man these calls are more to me than my daily bread ive got something in me more generalizing than most men im more so than many other men and most other women im more socialistic than you  you know marjorie ive always felt youre a finer individual than me ive never had a doubt of it youre more beautiful by far than i woman for my man youve a keener appetite for things a firmer grip on the substance of life i love to see you do things love to see you move love to watch your hands youve cleverer hands than mine by far and yetim a deeper and bigger thing than you i reach up to something you dont reach up to youre in lifeand im a little out of it im like one of those fish that began to be amphibian i go out into something where you dont followwhere you hardly begin to follow  thats the real perplexity between thousands of men and women  it seems to me that the primitive socialism of christianity and all the stuff of modern socialism that matters is really aimingalmost unconsciously i admit at timesat one simple end at the release of the human spirit from the individualistic struggle  you used release the other day marjorie of course i remember its queer how i go on talking after you have understood  it was just a flash said marjorie we have intimations neither of us really understands were like people climbing a mountain in a mist that thins out for a moment and shows valleys and cities and then closes in again before we can recognize them or make out where we are  trafford thought when i talk to you ive always felt i mustnt be too vague and the very essence of all this is a vague thing something we shall never come nearer to it in all our lives than to see it as a shadow and a glittering that escapes again into a mist and yet its everything that matters everything the only thing that matters truly and for ever through the whole range of life and we have to serve it with the keenest thought the utmost patience inordinate veracity  the practical trouble between your sort and my sort marjorie is the trouble between faith and realization you demand the outcome oh and i hate to turn aside and realize ive had to do it for seven years damnable years men of my sort want to understand we want to understand and you ask us to make we want to understand atoms ions molecules refractions you ask us to make rubber and diamonds i suppose its right that incidentally we should make rubber and diamonds finally i warn you we will make rubber unnecessary and diamonds valueless and again we want to understand how people react upon one another to produce social consequences and you ask us to put it at once into a draft bill for the reform of something or other i suppose life lies between us somewhere were the two poles of truth seeking and truth getting with me alone it would be nothing but a luminous dream with you nothing but a scramble in which sooner or later all the lamps would be upset but its ever too much of a scramble yet and ever too little of a dream all our world over there is full of the confusion and wreckage of premature realizations theres no real faith in thought and knowledge yet old necessity has driven men so hard that they still rush with a wild urgencythough she goads no more greed and haste and if indeed we seem to have a moments breathing space then the gawdsaker tramples us under  my dear cried marjorie with a sharp note of amusement what is a gawdsaker  oh said trafford havent you heard that before hes the person who gets excited by any deliberate discussion and gets up wringing his hands and screaming for gawds sake lets do something now i think they used it first for pethick lawrence that man who did so much to run the old militant suffragettes and burke the proper discussion of womans future you know you used to have em in chelseawith their hats oh gawdsaking is the curse of all progress the hectic consumption that kills a thousand good beginnings you see it in small things and in great you see it in my life gawdsaking turned my lifework to cash and promotions gawdsakinglook at the way the aviators took to flying for prizes and gatemoney the way pure research is swamped by endowments for technical applications then that poor ghostgiant of an idea the socialists haveits been treated like one of those unborn lambs they kill for the fine skin of it made into results before ever it was alive was there anything more pitiful the first great dream and then the last phase when your aunt plessington and the district visitors took and used it as a synonym for payment in kind its natural i suppose for people to be eager for results personal and immediate resultsthe last lesson of life is patience naturally they want reality naturally they want the individual life something to handle and feel and use and live by something of their very own before they die and they want it now but the thing that matters for the race marjorie is a very different thing it is to get the emerging thought process clear and to keep it clearand to let those other hungers go weve got to go back to england on the side of that delay that arrest of interruption that detached observant synthesizing process of the mind that solvent of difficulties and obsolescent institutions which is the reality of collective human life weve got to go back on the side of pure scienceliterature untrammeled by the preconceptions of the social schemersart free from the urgency of immediate utilityand a new a regal a godlike sincerity in philosophy and above all weve got to stop this jackdaw buying of yours my dear which is the essence of all that is wrong with the world this snatching at everything which loses everything worth having in life this greedy confused realization of our accumulated resources youre going to be a nonshopping woman now youre to come out of bond street you and your kind like israel leaving the egyptian fleshpots youre going to be my wife and my mate less of this service of things investments in comfort in security in experience yes but not just spending any more  he broke off abruptly with i want to go back and begin  yes said marjorie we will go back and saw minutely and distantly and yet as clearly and brightly as if she looked into a concave mirror that tall and dignified study a very high room indeed with a man writing before a fine longcurtained window and a great lump of richglowing labradorite upon his desk before him holding together an accumulation of written sheets  she knew exactly the shop in oxford street where the stuff for the curtains might be best obtained   § 17  one night marjorie had been sitting musing before the stove for a long time and suddenly she said i wonder if we shall fail i wonder if we shall get into a mess again when we are back in london as big a mess and as utter a discontent as sent us here  trafford was scraping out his pipe and did not answer for some moments then he remarked what nonsense  but we shall she said everybody fails to some extent we are bound to fail because indeed nothing is clear nothing is a clear issue you knowim just the old marjorie really in spite of all these resolutionsthe spendthrift the restless the eager im a born snatcher and shopper were just the same people really  no he said after thought youre all labrador older  i always have failed she considered when it came to any special temptations rag i cant stand not having a thing  he made no answer  and youre still the same old rag you know she went on who weakens into kindness if i cry who likes me welldressed who couldnt endure to see me poor  not a bit of it no im a very different rag with a very different marjorie yes indeed thingsare graver whyim lame for lifeand ive a scar the very look of things is changed he stared at her face and said youve hidden the lookingglass and you think i havent noted it  it keeps on healing she interrupted and if it comes to thatwheres my complexion she laughed these are just the superficial aspects of the case  nothing ever heals completely he said answering her first sentence and nothing ever goes back to the exact place it held before we are different you sunbitten frostbitten wife of mine  character is character said marjorie coming back to her point dont exaggerate conversion dear its not a bit of good pretending we shant fall away both of us each in our own manner we shall we shall old man london is still a tempting and confusing place and you cant alter people fundamentally not even by halffreezing and halfstarving them you only alter people fundamentally by killing them and replacing them i shall be extravagant again and forget again try as i may and you will work again and fall away again and forgive me again you knowits just as though we were each of us not one person but a lot of persons who sometimes meet and shout all together and then disperse and forget and plot against each other  oh things will happen again said trafford in her pause but they will happen again with a differenceafter this with a difference thats the good of it all weve found something herethat makes everything different weve found each other too dear wife  she thought intently  i am afraid she whispered  but what is there to be afraid of  myself  she spoke after a little pause that seemed to hesitate at times i wishoh passionatelythat i could pray  why dont you  i dont believe enoughin that i wish i did  trafford thought people are always so exacting about prayer he said  exacting  you want to prayand you cant make terms for a thing you want i used to think i could i wanted god to come and demonstrate a bit its no good madge if god chooses to be silentyou must pray to the silence if he chooses to live in darkness you must pray to the night  yes said marjorie i suppose one must  she thought i suppose in the end one does she said   § 18  mixed up with this entirely characteristic theology of theirs and their elaborate planningout of a new life in london were other strands of thought queer memories of london and old times together would flash with a peculiar brightness across their contemplation of the infinities and the needs of mankind out of nowhere quite disconnectedly would come the human finite do you remember  two things particularly pressed into their minds one was the thought of their children and i do not care to tell how often in the day now they calculated the time in england and tried to guess to a half mile or so where those young people might be and what they might be doing the shops are bright for christmas now said marjorie this year dick was to have had his first fireworks i wonder if he did i wonder if he burnt his dear little funny stumps of fingers i hope not  oh just a little said trafford i remember how a squib made my glove smoulder and singed me and how my mother kissed me for taking it like a man it was the best part of the adventure  dick shall burn his fingers when his mothers home to kiss him but spare his fingers now dadda  the other topic was food  it was only after they had been doing it for a week or so that they remarked how steadily they gravitated to reminiscences suggestions descriptions and long discussions of eatablessound solid eatables they told over the particulars of dinners they had imagined altogether forgotten neither hosts nor conversations seemed to matter now in the slightest degree but every item in the menu had its place they nearly quarrelled one day about horsdoeuvre trafford wanted to dwell on them when marjorie was eager for the soup  its niggling with food said marjorie  oh but theres no reason said trafford why you shouldnt take a lot of horsdoeuvre three or four sardines and potato salad and a big piece of smoked salmon and some of that norwegian herring and so on and keep the olives by you to pick at its a beginning  itsits immoral said marjorie thats what i feel if one needs a whet to eat one shouldnt eat the proper beginning of a dinner is soupgood hot rich soup thick soupwith things in it vegetables and meat and things bits of oxtail  not peas  no not peas peasoup is tiresome i never knew anything one tired of so soon i wish we hadnt relied on it so much  thick soups all very well said trafford but how about that clear stuff they give you in the little pavement restaurants in paris you knowcroûteaupot with lovely great crusts and big leeks and lettuce leaves and so on tremendous aroma of onions and beautiful little beads of fat and being a clear soup you see what there is thatsinteresting twentyfive centimes marjorie lord id give a guinea a plate for it id give five pounds for one of those jolly whitemetal tureens fullyou know full with little drops all over the outside of it and the ladle sticking out under the lid  have you ever tasted turtle soup  rather they give it you in the city the fatsripping but theyre rather precious with it you know for my own part i dont think soup should be doled out i always liked the soup we used to get at the harts but then they never give you enough you knownot nearly enough  about a tablespoonful said marjorie its mocking an appetite  still theres things to follow said trafford  they discussed the proper order of a dinner very carefully they decided that sorbets and ices were not only unwholesome but nasty in london said trafford ones taste getsvitiated  they weighed the merits of french cookery modern international cookery and produced alternatives trafford became very eloquent about old english food dinners said trafford should be feasting not the mere satisfaction of a necessity there should beamplitude i remember a recipe for a pie i think it was in one of those books that man lucas used to compile if i remember rightly it began with take a swine and hew it into gobbets gobbets thats something like a beginning it was a big pie with tiers and tiers of things and it kept it up all the way in that key and then what could be better than prime britishfed roast beef reddish just a shade on the side of underdone and not too finely cut mutton cant touch it  beef is the best she said  then our english cold meat again what can equal it such stuff as they give in a good country inn a huge joint of beefyou cut from it yourself you know as much as you likewith mustard pickles celery a tankard of stout let us say pressed beef such as theyll give you at the reform too thats good eating for a man with chutney and then old cheese to follow and boiled beef with little carrots and turnips and a dumpling or so eh  of course said marjorie one must do justice to a wellchosen turkey a fat turkey  or a good goose for the matter of thatwith honest wellthoughtout stuffing i like the little sausages round the dish of a turkey too like cherubs they are round the feet of a madonna theres much to be said for sausage marjorie it concentrates  sausage led to germany im not one of those patriots he was saying presently who run down other countries by way of glorifying their own while i was in germany i tasted many good things theres their leberwurst its never bad and at its best its splendid its only a fool would reproach germany with sausage devonshire blackpudding of course is the master of any blutwurst but theres all those others on the german side frankfurter big reddish sausage stuff again with great crystalline lumps of white fat and how well they cook their rich hashes and the thick gravies they make curious how much better the cooking of teutonic peoples is than the cooking of the south europeans its as if one needed a colder climate to brace a cook to his business the frenchman and the italian trifle and stimulate its as if theyd never met a hungry man no german would have thought of soufflé ugh its vicious eating theres much thats fine though in austria and hungary i wish i had travelled in hungary do you remember how once or twice weve lunched at that viennese place in regent street and how theyve given us stuffed paprika eh  that was a good place i remember there was stewed beef once with a lot of barleysuch good barley  every country has its glories one talks of the cookery of northern countries and then suddenly one thinks of curry with lots of rice  and lots of chicken  and lots of hot curry powder very hot and look at america heres a people who havent any of them been out of europe for centuries and yet they have as different a table as you could well imagine theres a kind of fish planked shad that they cook on resinous woodroast it i suppose its substantial like nothing else in the world and how good too with turkey are sweet potatoes then they have such a multitude of cereal things stuff like their buckwheat cakes all swimming in golden syrup and indian corn again  of course corn is being anglicized ive often given you cornlatterly before we came away  that sort of separated grainout of tins like chickens food its not the real thing you should eat corn on the cobamerican fashion its fine i had it when i was in the states you know you take it up in your hands by both endsyouve seen the cobsand gnaw  the craving air of labrador at a temperature of 20° fahrenheit and methodically stinted rations make great changes in the outward qualities of the mind id like to do that said marjorie  her face flushed a little at a guilty thought her eyes sparkled she leant forward and spoke in a confidential undertone  idid like to eat a mutton chop like that said marjorie   § 20  one morning marjorie broached something she had had on her mind for several days  old man she said i cant stand it any longer im going to thaw my scissors and cut your hair and then youll have to trim that beard of yours  youll have to dig out that lookingglass  i know said marjorie she looked at him youll never be a pretty man again she said but theres a sort of wild splendour and i love every inch and scrap of you  their eyes met were a thousand deeps now below the look of things said trafford wed love each other minced  she broke into that smiling laugh of hers oh it wont come to that she said trust my housekeeping     chapter the fifth  the trail to the sea   § 1  one astonishing afternoon in january a man came out of the wilderness to lonely hut he was a frenchindian halfbreed a trapper up and down the green river and across the height of land to sea lake he arrived in a sort of shy silence and squatted amiably on a log to thaw much snow he said and little fur  after he had sat at their fire for an hour and eaten and drunk his purpose in coming thawed out he explained he had just come on to them to see how they were he was he said a planter furring he had a line of traps about a hundred and twenty miles in length the nearest trap in his path before he turned northward over the divide was a good forty miles down the river he had come on from there just to have a look his name he said was louis napoleon partington he had carried a big pack a rifle and a dead martenthey lay beside himand out of his shapeless mass of caribou skins and woolen clothing and wrappings peeped a genial oily brown face very dirty with a strand of blueblack hair across one eye irregular teeth in its friendly smile and little squeezedup eyes  conversation developed there had been doubts of his linguistic range at first but he had an understanding expression and his english seemed guttural rather than really bad  he was told the tremendous story of traffords leg was shown it and felt it he interpolated thick and whistling noises to show how completely he followed their explanations and then suddenly he began a speech that made all his earlier taciturnity seem but the dam of a great reservoir of mixed and partly incomprehensible english he complimented marjorie so effusively and relentlessly and shamelessly as to produce a pause when he had done yes he said and nodded to button up the whole he sucked his pipe well satisfied with his eloquence trafford spoke in his silence we are coming down he said  i thought perhaps whispered louis napoleon  yes said trafford we are coming down with you why not we can get a sledge over the snow now its hard i mean a flat sledgelike this see like this he got up and dragged marjories old arrangement into view we shall bring all the stuff we can down with us grub blanketsnot the tent its too bulky well leave a lot of the heavy gear  youd have to leave the tent said louis napoleon  i said leave the tent  and youd have to leave  some of those tins  nearly all of them  and the ammunition thereexcept just a little  just enough for the journey down  perhaps a gun  no not a gun though after allwell wed return one of the guns give it you to bring back here  bring back here  if you liked  for some moments louis napoleon was intently silent when he spoke his voice was guttural with emotion after he said thoughtfully and paused and then resolved to have it over forthwith all you leave will be mine eh  trafford said that was the idea  louis napoleons eye brightened but his face preserved its indian calm  i will take you right to hammonds he said where they have dogs and then i can come back here   § 2  they had talked out nearly every particular of their return before they slept that night they yarned away three hours over the first generous meal that any one of them had eaten for many weeks louis napoleon stayed in the hut as a matter of course and reposed with snores and choking upon marjories sledge and within a yard of her it struck her as she lay awake and listened that the housemaids in sussex square would have thought things a little congested for a ladys bedroom and then she reflected that after all it wasnt much worse than a crowded carriage in an allnight train from switzerland she tried to count how many people there had been in that compartment and failed how stuffy that had beenthe smell of cheese and all and with that after a dream that she was whaling and had harpooned a particularly shortwinded whale she fell very peacefully into oblivion  next day was spent in the careful preparation of the two sledges they intended to take a full provision for six weeks although they reckoned that with good weather they ought to be down at hammonds in four  the day after was sunday and louis napoleon would not look at the sledges or packing instead he held a kind of religious service which consisted partly in making trafford read aloud out of a very oily old new testament he produced a selected passage from the book of corinthians and partly in moaning rather than singing several hymns he was rather disappointed that they did not join in with him in the afternoon he heated some water went into the tent with it and it would appear partially washed his face in the evening after they had supped he discussed religion being curious by this time about their beliefs and procedure  he spread his mental and spiritual equipment before them very artlessly their isolation and their immense concentration on each other had made them sensitive to personal quality and they listened to the broken english and the queer tangential starts into new topics of this dirty mongrel creature with the keenest appreciation of its quality it was inconsistent miscellaneous simple honest and human it was as touching as the medley in the pocket of a dead schoolboy he was superstitious and sceptical and sensual and spiritual and very very earnest the things he believed even if they were just beliefs about the weather or drying venison or filling pipes he believed with emotion he flushed as he told them for all his intellectual muddle they felt he knew how to live honestly and die if need be very finely  he was more than a little distressed at their apparent ignorance of the truths of revealed religion as it is taught in the moravian schools upon the coast and indeed it was manifest that he had had far more careful and infinitely more sincere religious teaching than either trafford or marjorie for a time the missionary spirit inspired him and then he quite forgot his solicitude for their conversion in a number of increasingly tall anecdotes about hunters and fishermen illustrating at first the extreme dangers of any departure from a rigid sabbatarianism but presently becoming just stories illustrating the uncertainty of life thence he branched off to the general topic of life upon the coast and the relative advantages of planter and fisherman  and then with a kindling eye he spoke of women and how that some day he would marry his voice softened and he addressed himself more particularly to marjorie he didnt so much introduce the topic of the lady as allow the destined young woman suddenly to pervade his discourse she was it seemed a servant an esquimaux girl at the moravian mission station at manivikovik he had been plighted to her for nine years he described a gramophone he had purchased down at port dupré and brought back to her three hundred miles up the coastit seemed to marjorie an odd gift for an esquimaux maidenand he gave his views upon its mechanism he said god was with the man who invented the gramophone truly they would have found one a very great relief to the tediums of their sojourn at lonely hut the gramophone he had given his betrothed possessed records of the rev capel gumms preaching and of madame melbas singing a revival hymn called sowing the seed and a comic songthey could not make out his pronunciation of the titlethat made you die with laughter it goes gobble gobble gobble he said with a solemn appreciative reflection of those distant joys  its good to be jolly at times he said with his bright eyes scanning marjories face a little doubtfully as if such ideas were better left for weekday expression   § 3  their return was a very different journey from the toilsome ascent of the summer an immense abundance of snow masked the world snow that made them regret acutely they had not equipped themselves with ski with ski and a good circulation a man may go about labrador in winter six times more easily than by the canoes and slow trudging of summer travel as it was they were glad of their canadian snow shoes one needs only shelters after the alpine club hut fashion and all that vast solitary country would be open in the wintertime its shortest day is no shorter than the shortest day in cumberland or dublin  this is no place to tell of the beauty and wonder of snow and ice the soft contours of gentle slopes the rippling of fine snow under a steady wind the long shadow ridges of shining powder on the lee of trees and stones and rocks the delicate wind streaks over broad surfaces like the marks of a chisel in marble the crests and cornices the vivid brightness of edges in the sun the glowing yellowish light on sunlit surfaces the long blue shadows the flush of sunset and sunrise and the pallid unearthly desolation of snow beneath the moon nor need the broken snow in woods and amidst tumbled stony slopes be described nor the vast soft overhanging crests on every outstanding rock beside the icebound river nor the huge stalactites and stalagmites of greenblue ice below the cliffs nor trees burdened and broken by frost and snow nor snow upon ice nor the blue pools at midday upon the surface of the icestream across the smooth windswept ice of the open tarns they would find a growth of ice flowers sixrayed and complicated more abundant and more beautiful than the alpine summer flowers  but the wind was very bitter and the sun had scarcely passed its zenith before the thought of fuel and shelter came back into their minds  as they approached partingtons tilt at the point where his trapping ground turned out of the green river gorge he became greatly obsessed by the thought of his traps he began to talk of all that he might find in them all he hoped to find and the dallars that might ensue they slept the third night marjorie within and the two men under the lee of the little cabin and partington was up and away before dawn to a trap towards the ridge he had infected marjorie and trafford with a sympathetic keenness but when they saw his killing of a marten that was still alive in its trap they suddenly conceived a distaste for trapping  they insisted they must witness no more they would wait while he went to a trap  think what hes doing said trafford as they sat together under the lee of a rock waiting for him we imagined this was a free simplesouled man leading an unsophisticated life on the very edge of humanity and really he is as much a dependant of your womans world marjorie as any sweated seamstress in a marylebone slum lord how far those pretty wasteful hands of women reach all these poor broken and starving beasts he finds and slaughters are from the point of view of our world just furs furs poor little snarling unfortunates their pelts will be dressed and prepared because women who have never dreamt of this bleak wilderness desire them they will get at last into regent street shops and bond street shops and shops in fifth avenue and in paris and berlin they will make delightful deep muffs with scent and little bags and powder puffs and all sorts of things tucked away inside and long wraps for tall women and jolly little frames of soft fur for pretty faces and dainty coats and rugs for expensive little babies in kensington gardens  i wonder reflected marjorie if i could buy one perhaps as a memento  he looked at her with eyes of quiet amusement  oh she cried i didnt mean to the old eve  the old adam is with her said trafford hes wanting to give it her we dont cease to be human madge you know because weve got an idea now of just where we are i wonder which would you like i dare say we could arrange it  no said marjorie and thought it would be jolly she said all the same you knowand just to show youim not going to let you buy me that fur  id like to said trafford  no said marjorie with a decision that was almost fierce i mean it ive got more to do than you in the way of reforming its just because always ive let my life be made up of such little things that i mustnt indeed i mustnt dont make things hard for me  he looked at her for a moment very well he said but id have liked to  youre right he added five seconds later  oh im right   § 4  one day louis napoleon sent them on along the trail while he went up the mountain to a trap among the trees he rejoined themnot as his custom was shouting inaudible conversation for the last hundred yards or so but in silence they wondered at that and at the one clumsy gesture that flourished something darkly grey at them what had happened to the man whatever he had caught he was hugging it as one hugs a cat and stroking it ugh he said deeply drawing near oh a solemn joy irradiated his face and almost religious ecstasy found expression  he had got a silver fox a beautifully marked silver fox the best luck of labrador one goes for years without one in hope and when it comes it pays the trappers debts it clears his lifefor years  they tried poor inadequate congratulation  as they sat about the fire that night a silence came upon louis napoleon it was manifest that his mind was preoccupied he got up walked about inspected the miracle of fur that had happened to him returned regarded them mm he said and stroked his chin with his forefinger a certain diffidence and yet a certain dignity of assurance mingled in his manner it wasnt so much a doubt of his own correctness as of some possible ignorance of the finer shades on their part that might embarrass him he coughed a curt preface and intimated he had a request to make behind the indian calm of his face glowed tremendous feeling like the light of a foundry furnace shining through chinks in the door he spoke in a small flat voice exercising great selfcontrol his wish he said in view of all that had happened was a little thing this was nearly a perfect day for him and one thing only remained well he said and hung well said trafford he plunged just simply this would they give him the brandy bottle and let him get drunk mr grenfell was a good man a very good man but he had made brandy deardear beyond the reach of common men altogetheralong the coast  he explained dear bundle of clothes and dirt that he was always perfectly respectable when he was drunk   § 5  it seemed strange to trafford that now that marjorie was going home a wild impatience to see her children should possess her so long as it had been probable that they would stay out their year in labrador that separation had seemed mainly a sentimental trouble now at times it was like an animal craving she would talk of them for hours at a stretch and when she was not talking he could see her eyes fixed ahead and knew that she was anticipating a meeting and for the first time it seemed the idea of possible misadventure troubled her  they reached hammonds in one and twenty days from lonely hut three days they had been forced to camp because of a blizzard and three because louis napoleon was rigidly sabbatarian they parted from him reluctantly and the next day hammonds produced its dogs twelve stout but extremely hungry dogs and sent the traffords on to the green river pulpmills where there were good beds and a copious supply of hot water thence they went to manivikovik and thence the new marconi station sent their inquiries home inquiries that were answered next day with matteroffact brevity everyone well love from all  when the operator hurried with that to marjorie she received it offhandedly glanced at it carelessly asked him to smoke remarked that wireless telegraphy was a wonderful thing and then in the midst of some unfinished commonplace about the temperature broke down and wept wildly and uncontrollably   § 6  then came the long wonderful ride southward day after day along the coast to port dupré a ride from headland to headland across the frozen bays behind long teams of straining furry dogs that leapt and yelped as they ran sometimes over the land the brutes shirked and loitered and called for the whip they were a quarrelsome crew to keep waiting but across the seaice they went like the wind and downhill the komatic chased their waving tails the sledges swayed and leapt depressions and shot athwart icy stretches the traffords spectacled and wrapped to their noses had all the sensations then of hunting an unknown quarry behind a pack of wolves the snow blazed under the sun out to sea beyond the ice the water glittered and it wasnt so much air they breathed as a sort of joyous hunger  one day their teams insisted upon racing  marjories team was the heavier her driver more skillful and her sledge the lighter and she led in that wild chase from start to finish but ever and again trafford made wild spurts that brought him almost level once as he came alongside she heard him laughing joyously  marjorie he shouted dyou remember old donkey cart  her team yawed away and as he swept near again behind his pack of whimpering straining furious dogs she heard him shouting you know that old cart under the overhanging trees so thick and green they met overhead you know when you and i had our first talk together in the lane it wasnt so fast as this eh   § 7  at port dupré they stayed ten daysdays that marjorie could only make tolerable by knitting absurd garments for the children her knitting was atrocious and then one afternoon they heard the gun of the grenfell the new winter steamer from st johns signalling as it came in through the fog very slowly from that great wasteful world of men and women beyond the seaward grey   the end
