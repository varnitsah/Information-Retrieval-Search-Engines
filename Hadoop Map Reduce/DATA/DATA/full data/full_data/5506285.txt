5506285	tomorrow   by joseph conrad   what was known of captain hagberd in the little seaport of colebrook was not exactly in his favour he did not belong to the place he had come to settle there under circumstances not at all mysterioushe used to be very communicative about them at the timebut extremely morbid and unreasonable he was possessed of some little money evidently because he bought a plot of ground and had a pair of ugly yellow brick cottages run up very cheaply he occupied one of them himself and let the other to josiah carvilblind carvil the retired boatbuildera man of evil repute as a domestic tyrant  these cottages had one wall in common shared in a line of iron railing dividing their front gardens a wooden fence separated their back gardens miss bessie carvil was allowed as it were of right to throw over it the teacloths blue rags or an apron that wanted drying  it rots the wood bessie my girl the captain would remark mildly from his side of the fence each time he saw her exercising that privilege  she was a tall girl the fence was low and she could spread her elbows on the top her hands would be red with the bit of washing she had done but her forearms were white and shapely and she would look at her fathers landlord in silencein an informed silence which had an air of knowledge expectation and desire  it rots the wood repeated captain hagberd it is the only unthrifty careless habit i know in you why dont you have a clothes line out in your back yard  miss carvil would say nothing to thisshe only shook her head negatively the tiny back yard on her side had a few stonebordered little beds of black earth in which the simple flowers she found time to cultivate appeared somehow extravagantly overgrown as if belonging to an exotic clime and captain hagberds upright hale person clad in no 1 sailcloth from head to foot would be emerging kneedeep out of rank grass and the tall weeks on his side of the fence he appeared with the colour and uncouth stiffness of the extraordinary material in which he chose to clothe himselffor the time being would be his mumbled remark to any observation on the subjectlike a man roughened out of granite standing in a wilderness not big enough for a decent billiardroom a heavy figure of a man of stone with a red handsome face a blue wandering eye and a great white beard flowing to his waist and never trimmed as far as colebrook knew  seven years before he had seriously answered next month i think to the chaffing attempt to secure his custom made by that distinguished local wit the colebrook barber who happened to be sitting insolently in the taproom of the new inn near the harbour where the captain had entered to buy an ounce of tobacco after paying for his purchase with three halfpence extracted from the corner of a handkerchief which he carried in the cuff of his sleeve captain hagberd went out as soon as the door was shut the barber laughed the old one and the young one will be strolling arm in arm to get shaved in my place presently the tailor shall be set to work and the barber and the candlestick maker high old times are coming for colebrook they are coming to be sure it used to be next week now it has come to next month and so onsoon it will be next spring for all i know  noticing a stranger listening to him with a vacant grin he explained stretching out his legs cynically that this queer old hagberd a retired coastingskipper was waiting for the return of a son of his the boy had been driven away from home he shouldnt wonder had run away to sea and had never been heard of since put to rest in davy joness locker this many a day as likely as not that old man came flying to colebrook three years ago all in black broadcloth had lost his wife lately then getting out of a thirdclass smoker as if the devil had been at his heels and the only thing that brought him down was a lettera hoax probably some joker had written to him about a seafaring man with some such name who was supposed to be hanging about some girl or other either in colebrook or in the neighbourhood funny aint it the old chap had been advertising in the london papers for harry hagberd and offering rewards for any sort of likely information and the barber would go on to describe with sardonic gusto how that stranger in mourning had been seen exploring the country in carts on foot taking everybody into his confidence visiting all the inns and alehouses for miles around stopping people on the road with his questions looking into the very ditches almost first in the greatest excitement then with a plodding sort of perseverance growing slower and slower and he could not even tell you plainly how his son looked the sailor was supposed to be one of two that had left a timber ship and to have been seen dangling after some girl but the old man described a boy of fourteen or soa cleverlooking highspirited boy and when people only smiled at this he would rub his forehead in a confused sort of way before he slunk off looking offended he found nobody of course not a trace of anybodynever heard of anything worth belief at any rate but he had not been able somehow to tear himself away from colebrook  it was the shock of this disappointment perhaps coming soon after the loss of his wife that had driven him crazy on that point the barber suggested with an air of great psychological insight after a time the old man abandoned the active search his son had evidently gone away but he settled himself to wait his son had been once at least in colebrook in preference to his native place there must have been some reason for it he seemed to think some very powerful inducement that would bring him back to colebrook again  ha ha ha why of course colebrook where else thats the only place in the united kingdom for your longlost sons so he sold up his old home in colchester and down he comes here well its a craze like any other wouldnt catch me going crazy over any of my youngsters clearing out ive got eight of them at home the barber was showing off his strength of mind in the midst of a laughter that shook the taproom  strange though that sort of thing he would confess with the frankness of a superior intelligence seemed to be catching his establishment for instance was near the harbour and whenever a sailorman came in for a haircut or a shaveif it was a strange face he couldnt help thinking directly suppose hes the son of old hagberd he laughed at himself for it it was a strong craze he could remember the time when the whole town was full of it but he had his hopes of the old chap yet he would cure him by a course of judicious chaffing he was watching the progress of the treatment next weeknext monthnext year when the old skipper had put off the date of that return till next year he would be well on his way to not saying any more about it in other matters he was quite rational so this too was bound to come such was the barbers firm opinion  nobody had ever contradicted him his own hair had gone grey since that time and captain hagberds beard had turned quite white and had acquired a majestic flow over the no 1 canvas suit which he had made for himself secretly with tarred twine and had assumed suddenly coming out in it one fine morning whereas the evening before he had been seen going home in his mourning of broadcloth it caused a sensation in the high streetshopkeepers coming to their doors people in the houses snatching up their hats to run outa stir at which he seemed strangely surprised at first and then scared but his only answer to the wondering questions was that startled and evasive for the present  that sensation had been forgotten long ago and captain hagberd himself if not forgotten had come to be disregardedthe penalty of dailinessas the sun itself is disregarded unless it makes its power felt heavily captain hagberds movements showed no infirmity he walked stiffly in his suit of canvas a quaint and remarkable figure only his eyes wandered more furtively perhaps than of yore his manner abroad had lost its excitable watchfulness it had become puzzled and diffident as though he had suspected that there was somewhere about him something slightly compromising some embarrassing oddity and yet had remained unable to discover what on earth this something wrong could be  he was unwilling now to talk with the townsfolk he had earned for himself the reputation of an awful skinflint of a miser in the matter of living he mumbled regretfully in the shops bought inferior scraps of meat after long hesitations and discouraged all allusions to his costume it was as the barber had foretold for all one could tell he had recovered already from the disease of hope and only miss bessie carvil knew that he said nothing about his sons return because with him it was no longer next week next month or even next year it was tomorrow  in their intimacy of back yard and front garden he talked with her paternally reasonably and dogmatically with a touch of arbitrariness they met on the ground of unreserved confidence which was authenticated by an affectionate wink now and then miss carvil had come to look forward rather to these winks at first they had discomposed her the poor fellow was mad afterwards she had learned to laugh at them there was no harm in him now she was aware of an unacknowledged pleasurable incredulous emotion expressed by a faint blush he winked not in the least vulgarly his thin red face with a wellmodelled curved nose had a sort of distinctionthe more so that when he talked to her he looked with a steadier and more intelligent glance a handsome hale upright capable man with a white beard you did not think of his age his son he affirmed had resembled him amazingly from his earliest babyhood  harry would be oneandthirty next july he declared proper age to get married with a nice sensible girl that could appreciate a good home he was a very highspirited boy highspirited husbands were the easiest to manage these mean soft chaps that you would think butter wouldnt melt in their mouths were the ones to make a woman thoroughly miserable and there was nothing like a homea firesidea good roof no turning out of your warm bed in all sorts of weather eh my dear  captain hagberd had been one of those sailors that pursue their calling within sight of land one of the many children of a bankrupt farmer he had been apprenticed hurriedly to a coasting skipper and had remained on the coast all his sea life it must have been a hard one at first he had never taken to it his affection turned to the land with its innumerable houses with its quiet lives gathered round its firesides many sailors feel and profess a rational dislike for the sea but his was a profound and emotional animosityas if the love of the stabler element had been bred into him through many generations  people did not know what they let their boys in for when they let them go to sea he expounded to bessie as soon make convicts of them at once he did not believe you ever got used to it the weariness of such a life got worse as you got older what sort of trade was it in which more than half your time you did not put your foot inside your house directly you got out to sea you had no means of knowing what went on at home one might have thought him weary of distant voyages and the longest he had ever made had lasted a fortnight of which the most part had been spent at anchor sheltering from the weather as soon as his wife had inherited a house and enough to live on from a bachelor uncle who had made some money in the coal business he threw up his command of an eastcoast collier with a feeling as though he had escaped from the galleys after all these years he might have counted on the fingers of his two hands all the days he had been out of sight of england he had never known what it was to be out of soundings i have never been further than eighty fathoms from the land was one of his boasts  bessie carvil heard all these things in front of their cottage grew an undersized ash and on summer afternoons she would bring out a chair on the grassplot and sit down with her sewing captain hagberd in his canvas suit leaned on a spade he dug every day in his front plot he turned it over and over several times every year but was not going to plant anything just at present  to bessie carvil he would state more explicitly not till our harry comes home tomorrow and she had heard this formula of hope so often that it only awakened the vaguest pity in her heart for that hopeful old man  everything was put off in that way and everything was being prepared likewise for tomorrow there was a boxful of packets of various flowerseeds to choose from for the front garden he will doubtless let you have your say about that my dear captain hagberd intimated to her across the railing  miss bessies head remained bowed over her work she had heard all this so many times but now and then she would rise lay down her sewing and come slowly to the fence there was a charm in these gentle ravings he was determined that his son should not go away again for the want of a home all ready for him he had been filling the other cottage with all sorts of furniture she imagined it all new fresh with varnish piled up as in a warehouse there would be tables wrapped up in sacking rolls of carpets thick and vertical like fragments of columns the gleam of white marble tops in the dimness of the drawn blinds captain hagberd always described his purchases to her carefully as to a person having a legitimate interest in them the overgrown yard of his cottage could be laid over with concrete after tomorrow  we may just as well do away with the fence you could have your dryingline out quite clear of your flowers he winked and she would blush faintly  this madness that had entered her life through the kind impulses of her heart had reasonable details what if some day his son returned but she could not even be quite sure that he ever had a son and if he existed anywhere he had been too long away when captain hagberd got excited in his talk she would steady him by a pretence of belief laughing a little to salve her conscience  only once she had tried pityingly to throw some doubt on that hope doomed to disappointment but the effect of her attempt had scared her very much all at once over that mans face there came an expression of horror and incredulity as though he had seen a crack open out in the firmament  youyouyou dont think hes drowned  for a moment he seemed to her ready to go out of his mind for in his ordinary state she thought him more sane than people gave him credit for on that occasion the violence of the emotion was followed by a most paternal and complacent recovery  dont alarm yourself my dear he said a little cunningly the sea cant keep him he does not belong to it none of us hagberds ever did belong to it look at me i didnt get drowned moreover he isnt a sailor at all and if he is not a sailor hes bound to come back theres nothing to prevent him coming back  his eyes began to wander  tomorrow  she never tried again for fear the man should go out of his mind on the spot he depended on her she seemed the only sensible person in the town and he would congratulate himself frankly before her face on having secured such a levelheaded wife for his son the rest of the town he confided to her once in a fit of temper was certainly queer the way they looked at youthe way they talked to you he had never got on with any one in the place didnt like the people he would not have left his own country if it had not been clear that his son had taken a fancy to colebrook  she humoured him in silence listening patiently by the fence crocheting with downcast eyes blushes came with difficulty on her deadwhite complexion under the negligently twisted opulence of mahoganycoloured hair her father was frankly carroty  she had a full figure a tired unrefreshed face when captain hagberd vaunted the necessity and propriety of a home and the delights of ones own fireside she smiled a little with her lips only her home delights had been confined to the nursing of her father during the ten best years of her life  a bestial roaring coming out of an upstairs window would interrupt their talk she would begin at once to roll up her crochetwork or fold her sewing without the slightest sign of haste meanwhile the howls and roars of her name would go on making the fishermen strolling upon the seawall on the other side of the road turn their heads towards the cottages she would go in slowly at the front door and a moment afterwards there would fall a profound silence presently she would reappear leading by the hand a man gross and unwieldy like a hippopotamus with a badtempered surly face  he was a widowed boatbuilder whom blindness had overtaken years before in the full flush of business he behaved to his daughter as if she had been responsible for its incurable character he had been heard to bellow at the top of his voice as if to defy heaven that he did not care he had made enough money to have ham and eggs for his breakfast every morning he thanked god for it in a fiendish tone as though he were cursing  captain hagberd had been so unfavourably impressed by his tenant that once he told miss bessie he is a very extravagant fellow my dear  she was knitting that day finishing a pair of socks for her father who expected her to keep up the supply dutifully she hated knitting and as she was just at the heel part she had to keep her eyes on her needles  of course it isnt as if he had a son to provide for captain hagberd went on a little vacantly girls of course dont require so muchhmhm they dont run away from home my dear  no said miss bessie quietly  captain hagberd amongst the mounds of turnedup earth chuckled with his maritime rig his weatherbeaten face his beard of father neptune he resembled a deposed seagod who had exchanged the trident for the spade  and he must look upon you as already provided for in a manner thats the best of it with the girls the husbands he winked miss bessie absorbed in her knitting coloured faintly  bessie my hat old carvil bellowed out suddenly he had been sitting under the tree mute and motionless like an idol of some remarkably monstrous superstition he never opened his mouth but to howl for her at her sometimes about her and then he did not moderate the terms of his abuse her system was never to answer him at all and he kept up his shouting till he got attended totill she shook him by the arm or thrust the mouthpiece of his pipe between his teeth he was one of the few blind people who smoke when he felt the hat being put on his head he stopped his noise at once then he rose and they passed together through the gate  he weighed heavily on her arm during their slow toilful walks she appeared to be dragging with her for a penance the burden of that infirm bulk usually they crossed the road at once the cottages stood in the fields near the harbour two hundred yards away from the end of the street and for a long long time they would remain in view ascending imperceptibly the flight of wooden steps that led to the top of the seawall it ran on from east to west shutting out the channel like a neglected railway embankment on which no train had ever rolled within memory of man groups of sturdy fishermen would emerge upon the sky walk along for a bit and sink without haste their brown nets like the cobwebs of gigantic spiders lay on the shabby grass of the slope and looking up from the end of the street the people of the town would recognise the two carvils by the creeping slowness of their gait captain hagberd pottering aimlessly about his cottages would raise his head to see how they got on in their promenade  he advertised still in the sunday papers for harry hagberd these sheets were read in foreign parts to the end of the world he informed bessie at the same time he seemed to think that his son was in englandso near to colebrook that he would of course turn up tomorrow bessie without committing herself to that opinion in so many words argued that in that case the expense of advertising was unnecessary captain hagberd had better spend that weekly halfcrown on himself she declared she did not know what he lived on her argumentation would puzzle him and cast him down for a time they all do it he pointed out there was a whole column devoted to appeals after missing relatives he would bring the newspaper to show her he and his wife had advertised for years only she was an impatient woman the news from colebrook had arrived the very day after her funeral if she had not been so impatient she might have been here now with no more than one day more to wait you are not an impatient woman my dear  ive no patience with you sometimes she would say  if he still advertised for his son he did not offer rewards for information any more for with the muddled lucidity of a mental derangement he had reasoned himself into a conviction as clear as daylight that he had already attained all that could be expected in that way what more could he want colebrook was the place and there was no need to ask for more miss carvil praised him for his good sense and he was soothed by the part she took in his hope which had become his delusion in that idea which blinded his mind to truth and probability just as the other old man in the other cottage had been made blind by another disease to the light and beauty of the world  but anything he could interpret as a doubtany coldness of assent or even a simple inattention to the development of his projects of a home with his returned son and his sons wifewould irritate him into flings and jerks and wicked side glances he would dash his spade into the ground and walk to and fro before it miss bessie called it his tantrums she shook her finger at him then when she came out again after he had parted with her in anger he would watch out of the corner of his eyes for the least sign of encouragement to approach the iron railings and resume his fatherly and patronising relations  for all their intimacy which had lasted some years now they had never talked without a fence or a railing between them he described to her all the splendours accumulated for the settingup of their housekeeping but had never invited her to an inspection no human eye was to behold them till harry had his first look in fact nobody had ever been inside his cottage he did his own housework and he guarded his sons privilege so jealously that the small objects of domestic use he bought sometimes in the town were smuggled rapidly across the front garden under his canvas coat then coming out he would remark apologetically it was only a small kettle my dear  and if not too tired with her drudgery or worried beyond endurance by her father she would laugh at him with a blush and say thats all right captain hagberd i am not impatient  well my dear you havent long to wait now he would answer with a sudden bashfulness and looking uneasily as though he had suspected that there was something wrong somewhere  every monday she paid him his rent over the railings he clutched the shillings greedily he grudged every penny he had to spend on his maintenance and when he left her to make his purchases his bearing changed as soon as he got into the street away from the sanction of her pity he felt himself exposed without defence he brushed the walls with his shoulder he mistrusted the queerness of the people yet by then even the town children had left off calling after him and the tradesmen served him without a word the slightest allusion to his clothing had the power to puzzle and frighten especially as if it were something utterly unwarranted and incomprehensible  in the autumn the driving rain drummed on his sailcloth suit saturated almost to the stiffness of sheetiron with its surface flowing with water when the weather was too bad he retreated under the tiny porch and standing close against the door looked at his spade left planted in the middle of the yard the ground was so much dug up all over that as the season advanced it turned to a quagmire when it froze hard he was disconsolate what would harry say and as he could not have so much of bessies company at that time of the year the roars of old carvil that came muffled through the closed windows calling her indoors exasperated him greatly  why dont that extravagant fellow get you a servant he asked impatiently one mild afternoon she had thrown something over her head to run out for a while  i dont know said the pale bessie wearily staring away with her heavylidded grey and unexpectant glance there were always smudgy shadows under her eyes and she did not seem able to see any change or any end to her life  you wait till you get married my dear said her only friend drawing closer to the fence harry will get you one  his hopeful craze seemed to mock her own want of hope with so bitter an aptness that in her nervous irritation she could have screamed at him outright but she only said in selfmockery and speaking to him as though he had been sane why captain hagberd your son may not even want to look at me  he flung his head back and laughed his throaty affected cackle of anger  what that boy not want to look at the only sensible girl for miles around what do you think i am here for my dearmy dearmy dear what you wait you just wait youll see tomorrow ill soon  bessie bessie bessie howled old carvil inside bessiemy pipe that fat blind man had given himself up to a very lust of laziness he would not lift his hand to reach for the things she took care to leave at his very elbow he would not move a limb he would not rise from his chair he would not put one foot before another in that parlour where he knew his way as well as if he had his sight without calling her to his side and hanging all his atrocious weight on her shoulder he would not eat one single mouthful of food without her close attendance he had made himself helpless beyond his affliction to enslave her better she stood still for a moment setting her teeth in the dusk then turned and walked slowly indoors  captain hagberd went back to his spade the shouting in carvils cottage stopped and after a while the window of the parlour downstairs was lit up a man coming from the end of the street with a firm leisurely step passed on but seemed to have caught sight of captain hagberd because he turned back a pace or two a cold white light lingered in the western sky the man leaned over the gate in an interested manner  you must be captain hagberd he said with easy assurance  the old man spun round pulling out his spade startled by the strange voice  yes i am he answered nervously  the other smiling straight at him uttered very slowly youve been advertising for your son i believe  my son harry mumbled captain hagberd off his guard for once hes coming home tomorrow  the devil he is the stranger marvelled greatly and then went on with only a slight change of tone youve grown a beard like father christmas himself  captain hagberd drew a little nearer and leaned forward over his spade go your way he said resentfully and timidly at the same time because he was always afraid of being laughed at every mental state even madness has its equilibrium based upon selfesteem its disturbance causes unhappiness and captain hagberd lived amongst a scheme of settled notions which it pained him to feel disturbed by peoples grins yes peoples grins were awful they hinted at something wrong but what he could not tell and that stranger was obviously grinninghad come on purpose to grin it was bad enough on the streets but he had never before been outraged like this  the stranger unaware how near he was of having his head laid open with a spade said seriously i am not trespassing where i stand am i i fancy theres something wrong about your news suppose you let me come in  you come in murmured old hagberd with inexpressible horror  i could give you some real information about your sonthe very latest tip if you care to hear  no shouted hagberd he began to pace wildly to and fro he shouldered his spade he gesticulated with his other arm heres a fellowa grinning fellow who says theres something wrong ive got more information than youre aware of ive all the information i want ive had it for yearsfor yearsfor yearsenough to last me till tomorrow let you come in indeed what would harry say  bessie carvils figure appeared in black silhouette on the parlour window then with the sound of an opening door flitted out before the other cottage all black but with something white over her head these two voices beginning to talk suddenly outside she had heard them indoors had given her such an emotion that she could not utter a sound  captain hagberd seemed to be trying to find his way out of a cage his feet squelched in the puddles left by his industry he stumbled in the holes of the ruined grassplot he ran blindly against the fence  here steady a bit said the man at the gate gravely stretching his arm over and catching him by the sleeve somebodys been trying to get at you hallo whats this rig youve got on storm canvas by george he had a big laugh well you are a character  captain hagberd jerked himself free and began to back away shrinkingly for the present he muttered in a crestfallen tone  whats the matter with him the stranger addressed bessie with the utmost familiarity in a deliberate explanatory tone i didnt want to startle the old man he lowered his voice as though he had known her for years i dropped into a barbers on my way to get a twopenny shave and they told me there he was something of a character the old man has been a character all his life  captain hagberd daunted by the allusion to his clothing had retreated inside taking his spade with him and the two at the gate startled by the unexpected slamming of the door heard the bolts being shot the snapping of the lock and the echo of an affected gurgling laugh within  i didnt want to upset him the man said after a short silence whats the meaning of all this he isnt quite crazy  he has been worrying a long time about his lost son said bessie in a low apologetic tone  well i am his son  harry she criedand was profoundly silent  know my name friends with the old man eh  hes our landlord bessie faltered out catching hold of the iron railing  owns both them rabbithutches does he commented young hagberd scornfully just the thing he would be proud of can you tell me whos that chap coming tomorrow you must know something of it i tell you its a swindle on the old mannothing else  she did not answer helpless before an insurmountable difficulty appalled before the necessity the impossibility and the dread of an explanation in which she and madness seemed involved together  ohi am so sorry she murmured  whats the matter he said with serenity you neednt be afraid of upsetting me its the other fellow thatll be upset when he least expects it i dont care a hang but there will be some fun when he shows his mug tomorrow i dont care that for the old mans pieces but right is right you shall see me put a head on that coonwhoever he is  he had come nearer and towered above her on the other side of the railings he glanced at her hands he fancied she was trembling and it occurred to him that she had her part perhaps in that little game that was to be sprung on his old man tomorrow he had come just in time to spoil their sport he was entertained by the ideascornful of the baffled plot but all his life he had been full of indulgence for all sorts of womens tricks she really was trembling very much her wrap had slipped off her head poor devil he thought never mind about that chap i daresay hell change his mind before tomorrow but what about me i cant loaf about the gate til the morning  she burst out it is youyou yourself that hes waiting for it is you who come tomorrow  he murmured oh its me blankly and they seemed to become breathless together apparently he was pondering over what he had heard then without irritation but evidently perplexed he said i dont understand i hadnt written or anything its my chum who saw the paper and told methis very morning eh what  he bent his ear she whispered rapidly and he listened for a while muttering the words yes and i see at times then but why wont today do he queried at last  you didnt understand me she exclaimed impatiently the clear streak of light under the clouds died out in the west again he stooped slightly to hear better and the deep night buried everything of the whispering woman and the attentive man except the familiar contiguity of their faces with its air of secrecy and caress  he squared his shoulders the broadbrimmed shadow of a hat sat cavalierly on his head awkward this eh he appealed to her tomorrow well well never heard tell of anything like this its all tomorrow then without any sort of today as far as i can see  she remained still and mute  and you have been encouraging this funny notion he said  i never contradicted him  why didnt you  what for should i she defended herself it would only have made him miserable he would have gone out of his mind  his mind he muttered and heard a short nervous laugh from her  where was the harm was i to quarrel with the poor old man it was easier to half believe it myself  aye aye he meditated intelligently i suppose the old chap got around you somehow with his soft talk you are goodhearted  her hands moved up in the dark nervously and it might have been true it was true it has come here it is this is the tomorrow we have been waiting for  she drew a breath and he said goodhumouredly aye with the door shut i wouldnt care if and you think he could be brought round to recognise me eh what you could do it in a week you say hm i daresay you couldbut do you think i could hold out a week in this deadalive place not me i want either hard work or an allfired racket or more space than there is in the whole of england i have been in this place though once before and for more than a week the old man was advertising for me then and a chum i had with me had a notion of getting a couple quid out of him by writing a lot of silly nonsense in a letter that lark did not come off though we had to clear outand none too soon but this time ive a chum waiting for me in london and besides  bessie carvil was breathing quickly  what if i tried a knock at the door he suggested  try she said  captain hagberds gate squeaked and the shadow of the son moved on then stopped with another deep laugh in the throat like the fathers only soft and gentle thrilling to the womans heart awakening to her ears  he isnt friskyis he i would be afraid to lay hold of him the chaps are always telling me i dont know my own strength  hes the most harmless creature that ever lived she interrupted  you wouldnt say so if you had seen him chasing me upstairs with a hard leather strap he said i havent forgotten it in sixteen years  she got warm from head to foot under another soft subdued laugh at the rattattat of the knocker her heart flew into her mouth  hey dad let me in i am harry i am straight come back home a day too soon  one of the windows upstairs ran up  a grinning information fellow said the voice of old hagberd up in the darkness dont you have anything to do with him it will spoil everything  she heard harry hagberd say hallo dad then a clanging clatter the window rumbled down and he stood before her again  its just like old times nearly walloped the life out of me to stop me going away and now i come back he throws a confounded shovel at my head to keep me out it grazed my shoulder  she shuddered  i wouldnt care he began only i spent my last shillings on the railway fare and my last twopence on a shaveout of respect for the old man  are you really harry hagberd she asked can you prove it  can i prove it can any one else prove it he said jovially prove with what what do i want to prove there isnt a single corner in the world barring england perhaps where you could not find some man or more likely woman that would remember me for harry hagberd i am more like harry hagberd than any man alive and i can prove it to you in a minute if you will let me step inside your gate  come in she said  he entered then the front garden of the carvils his tall shadow strode with a swagger she turned her back on the window and waited watching the shape of which the footfalls seemed the most material part the light fell on a tilted hat a powerful shoulder that seemed to cleave the darkness on a leg stepping out he swung about and stood still facing the illuminated parlour window at her back turning his head from side to side laughing softly to himself  just fancy for a minute the old mans beard stuck on to my chin hey now say i was the very spit of him from a boy  its true she murmured to herself  and thats about as far as it goes he was always one of your domestic characters why i remember how he used to go about looking very sick for three days before he had to leave home on one of his trips to south shields for coal he had a standing charter from the gasworks you would think he was off on a whaling cruisethree years and a tail ha ha not a bit of it ten days on the outside the skimmer of the seas was a smart craft fine name wasnt it mothers uncle owned her  he interrupted himself and in a lowered voice did he ever tell you what mother died of he asked  yes said miss bessie bitterly from impatience  he made no sound for a while then brusquely they were so afraid i would turn out badly that they fairly drove me away mother nagged at me for being idle and the old man said he would cut my soul out of my body rather than let me go to sea well it looked as if he would do it tooso i went it looks to me sometimes as if i had been born to them by a mistakein that other hutch of a house  where ought you to have been born by rights bessie carvil interrupted him defiantly  in the open upon a beach on a windy night he said quick as lightning then he mused slowly they were characters both of them by george and the old man keeps it up welldont he a damned shovel on thehark whos that making that row bessie bessie its in your house  its for me she said with indifference  he stepped aside out of the streak of light your husband he inquired with the tone of a man accustomed to unlawful trysts fine voice for a ships deck in a thundering squall  no my father i am not married  you seem a fine girl miss bessie dear he said at once  she turned her face away  oh i saywhats up whos murdering him  he wants his tea she faced him still and tall with averted head with her hands hanging clasped before her  hadnt you better go in he suggested after watching for a while the nape of her neck a patch of dazzling white skin and soft shadow above the sombre line of her shoulders her wrap had slipped down to her elbows youll have all the town coming out presently ill wait here a bit  her wrap fell to the ground and he stooped to pick it up she had vanished he threw it over his arm and approaching the window squarely he saw a monstrous form of a fat man in an armchair an unshaded lamp the yawning of an enormous mouth in a big flat face encircled by a ragged halo of hairmiss bessies head and bust the shouting stopped the blind ran down he lost himself in thinking how awkward it was father mad no getting into the house no money to get back a hungry chum in london who would begin to think he had been given the goby damn he muttered he could break the door in certainly but they would perhaps bundle him into chokey for that without asking questionsno great matter only he was confoundedly afraid of being locked up even in mistake he turned cold at the thought he stamped his feet on the sodden grass  what are youa sailor said an agitated voice  she had flitted out a shadow herself attracted by the reckless shadow waiting under the wall of her home  anything enough of a sailor to be worth my salt before the mast came home that way this time  where do you come from she asked  right away from a jolly good spree he said by the london trainsee ough i hate being shut up in a train i dont mind a house so much  ah she said thats lucky  because in a house you can at any time open the blamed door and walk away straight before you  and never come back  not for sixteen years at least he laughed to a rabbit hutch and get a confounded old shovel  a ship is not so very big she taunted  no but the sea is great  she dropped her head and as if her ears had been opened to the voices of the world she heard beyond the rampart of seawall the swell of yesterdays gale breaking on the beach with monotonous and solemn vibrations as if all the earth had been a tolling bell  and then why a ships a ship you love her and leave her and a voyage isnt a marriage he quoted the sailors saying lightly  it is not a marriage she whispered  i never took a false name and ive never yet told a lie to a woman what lie why the lie take me or leave me i say and if you take me then it is he hummed a snatch very low leaning against the wall      oh ho ho rio      and fare thee well      my bonnie young girl      were bound to rio grande  capstan song he explained her teeth chattered  you are cold he said heres that affair of yours i picked up she felt his hands about her wrapping her closely hold the ends together in front he commanded  what did you come here for she asked repressing a shudder  five quid he answered promptly we let our spree go on a little too long and got hard up  youve been drinking she said  blind three days on purpose i am not given that waydont you think theres nothing and nobody that can get over me unless i like i can be as steady as a rock my chum sees the paper this morning and says he to me go on harry loving parent thats five quid sure so we scraped all our pockets for the fare devil of a lark  you have a hard heart i am afraid she sighed  what for for running away why he wanted to make a lawyers clerk of mejust to please himself master in his own house and my poor mother egged him onfor my good i suppose well thenso long and i went no i tell you the day i cleared out i was all black and blue from his great fondness for me ah he was always a bit of a character look at that shovel now off his chump not much thats just exactly like my dad he wants me here just to have somebody to order about however we two were hard up and whats five quid to himonce in sixteen hard years  oh but i am sorry for you did you never want to come back home  be a lawyers clerk and rot herein some such place as this he cried in contempt what if the old man set me up in a home today i would kick it down about my earsor else die there before the third day was out  and where else is it that you hope to die  in the bush somewhere in the sea on a blamed mountaintop for choice at home yes the worlds my home but i expect ill die in a hospital some day what of that any place is good enough as long as ive lived and ive been everything you can think of almost but a tailor or a soldier ive been a boundary rider ive sheared sheep and humped my swag and harpooned a whale ive rigged ships and prospected for gold and skinned dead bullocksand turned my back on more money than the old man would have scraped in his whole life ha ha  he overwhelmed her she pulled herself together and managed to utter time to rest now  he straightened himself up away from the wall and in a severe voice said time to go  but he did not move he leaned back again and hummed thoughtfully a bar or two of an outlandish tune  she felt as if she were about to cry thats another of your cruel songs she said  learned it in mexicoin sonora he talked easily it is the song of the gambucinos you dont know the song of restless men nothing could hold them in one placenot even a woman you used to meet one of them now and again in the old days on the edge of the gold country away north there beyond the rio gila ive seen it a prospecting engineer in mazatlan took me along with him to help look after the waggons a sailors a handy chap to have about you anyhow its all a desert cracks in the earth that you cant see the bottom of and mountainssheer rocks standing up high like walls and church spires only a hundred times bigger the valleys are full of boulders and black stones theres not a blade of grass to see and the sun sets more red over that country than i have seen it anywherebloodred and angry it is fine  you do not want to go back there again she stammered out  he laughed a little no thats the blamed gold country it gave me the shivers sometimes to look at itand we were a big lot of men together mind but these gambucinos wandered alone they knew that country before anybody had ever heard of it they had a sort of gift for prospecting and the fever of it was on them too and they did not seem to want the gold very much they would find some rich spot and then turn their backs on it pick up perhaps a littleenough for a spreeand then be off again looking for more they never stopped long where there were houses they had no wife no chick no home never a chum you couldnt be friends with a gambucino they were too restlesshere today and gone god knows where tomorrow they told no one of their finds and there has never been a gambucino well off it was not for the gold they cared it was the wandering about looking for it in the stony country that got into them and wouldnt let them rest so that no woman yet born could hold a gambucino for more than a week thats what the song says its all about a pretty girl that tried hard to keep hold of a gambucino lover so that he should bring her lots of gold no fear off he went and she never saw him again  what became of her she breathed out  the song dont tell cried a bit i daresay they were the fellows kiss and go but its the looking for a thinga something sometimes i think i am a sort of gambucino myself  no woman can hold you then she began in a brazen voice which quavered suddenly before the end  no longer than a week he joked playing upon her very heartstrings with the gay tender note of his laugh and yet i am fond of them all anything for a woman of the right sort the scrapes they got me into and the scrapes they got me out of i love them at first sight ive fallen in love with you already missbessies your nameeh  she backed away a little and with a trembling laugh  you havent seen my face yet  he bent forward gallantly a little pale it suits some but you are a fine figure of a girl miss bessie  she was all in a flutter nobody had ever said so much to her before  his tone changed i am getting middling hungry though had no breakfast today couldnt you scare up some bread from that tea for me or  she was gone already he had been on the point of asking her to let him come inside no matter anywhere would do devil of a fix what would his chum think  i didnt ask you as a beggar he said jestingly taking a piece of breadandbutter from the plate she held before him i asked as a friend my dad is rich you know  he starves himself for your sake  and i have starved for his whim he said taking up another piece  all he has in the world is for you she pleaded  yes if i come here to sit on it like a dam toad in a hole thank you and what about the shovel eh he always had a queer way of showing his love  i could bring him round in a week she suggested timidly  he was too hungry to answer her and holding the plate submissively to his hand she began to whisper up to him in a quick panting voice he listened amazed eating slower and slower till at last his jaws stopped altogether thats his game is it he said in a rising tone of scathing contempt an ungovernable movement of his arm sent the plate flying out of her fingers he shot out a violent curse  she shrank from him putting her hand against the wall  no he raged he expects expects mefor his rotten money who wants his home madnot he dont you think he wants his own way he wanted to turn me into a miserable lawyers clerk and now he wants to make of me a blamed tame rabbit in a cage of me of me his subdued angry laugh frightened her now  the whole world aint a bit too big for me to spread my elbows in i can tell youwhats your namebessielet alone a dam parlour in a hutch marry he wants me to marry and settle and as likely as not he has looked out the girl toodash my soul and do you know the judy may i ask  she shook all over with noiseless dry sobs but he was fuming and fretting too much to notice her distress he bit his thumb with rage at the mere idea a window rattled up  a grinning information fellow pronounced old hagberd dogmatically in measured tones and the sound of his voice seemed to bessie to make the night itself madto pour insanity and disaster on the earth now i know whats wrong with the people here my dear why of course with this mad chap going about dont you have anything to do with him bessie bessie i say  they stood as if dumb the old man fidgeted and mumbled to himself at the window suddenly he cried piercingly bessiei see you ill tell harry  she made a movement as if to run away but stopped and raised her hands to her temples young hagberd shadowy and big stirred no more than a man of bronze over their heads the crazy night whimpered and scolded in an old mans voice  send him away my dear hes only a vagabond what you want is a good home of your own that chap has no homehes not like harry he cant be harry harry is coming tomorrow do you hear one day more he babbled more excitedly never you fearharry shall marry you  his voice rose very shrill and mad against the regular deep soughing of the swell coiling heavily about the outer face of the seawall  he will have to i shall make him or if nothe swore a great oathill cut him off with a shilling tomorrow and leave everything to you i shall to you let him starve  the window rattled down  harry drew a deep breath and took one step toward bessie so its youthe girl he said in a lowered voice she had not moved and she remained half turned away from him pressing her head in the palms of her hands my word he continued with an invisible halfsmile on his lips i have a great mind to stop  her elbows were trembling violently  for a week he finished without a pause  she clapped her hands to her face  he came up quite close and took hold of her wrists gently she felt his breath on her ear  its a scrape i am inthis and it is you that must see me through he was trying to uncover her face she resisted he let her go then and stepping back a little have you got any money he asked i must be off now  she nodded quickly her shamefaced head and he waited looking away from her while trembling all over and bowing her neck she tried to find the pocket of her dress  here it is she whispered oh go away go away for gods sake if i had moremorei would give it all to forgetto make you forget  he extended his hand no fear i havent forgotten a single one of you in the world some gave me more than moneybut i am a beggar nowand you women always had to get me out of my scrapes  he swaggered up to the parlour window and in the dim light filtering through the blind looked at the coin lying in his palm it was a halfsovereign he slipped it into his pocket she stood a little on one side with her head drooping as if wounded with her arms hanging passive by her side as if dead  you cant buy me in he said and you cant buy yourself out  he set his hat firmly with a little tap and next moment she felt herself lifted up in the powerful embrace of his arms her feet lost the ground her head hung back he showered kisses on her face with a silent and overmastering ardour as if in haste to get at her very soul he kissed her pale cheeks her hard forehead her heavy eyelids her faded lips and the measured blows and sighs of the rising tide accompanied the enfolding power of his arms the overwhelming might of his caresses it was as if the sea breaking down the wall protecting all the homes of the town had sent a wave over her head it passed on she staggered backwards with her shoulders against the wall exhausted as if she had been stranded there after a storm and a shipwreck  she opened her eyes after awhile and listening to the firm leisurely footsteps going away with their conquest began to gather her skirts staring all the time before her suddenly she darted through the open gate into the dark and deserted street  stop she shouted dont go  and listening with an attentive poise of the head she could not tell whether it was the beat of the swell or his fateful tread that seemed to fall cruelly upon her heart presently every sound grew fainter as though she were slowly turning into stone a fear of this awful silence came to herworse than the fear of death she called upon her ebbing strength for the final appeal  harry  not even the dying echo of a footstep nothing the thundering of the surf the voice of the restless sea itself seemed stopped there was not a soundno whisper of life as though she were alone and lost in that stony country of which she had heard where madmen go looking for gold and spurn the find  captain hagberd inside his dark house had kept on the alert a window ran up and in the silence of the stony country a voice spoke above her head high up in the black airthe voice of madness lies and despairthe voice of inextinguishable hope is he gone yetthat information fellow do you hear him about my dear  she burst into tears no no no i dont hear him any more she sobbed  he began to chuckle up there triumphantly you frightened him away good girl now we shall be all right dont you be impatient my dear one day more  in the other house old carvil wallowing regally in his armchair with a globe lamp burning by his side on the table yelled for her in a fiendish voice bessie bessie you bessie  she heard him at last and as if overcome by fate began to totter silently back toward her stuffy little inferno of a cottage it had no lofty portal no terrific inscription of forfeited hopesshe did not understand wherein she had sinned  captain hagberd had gradually worked himself into a state of noisy happiness up there  go in keep quiet she turned upon him tearfully from the doorstep below  he rebelled against her authority in his great joy at having got rid at last of that something wrong it was as if all the hopeful madness of the world had broken out to bring terror upon her heart with the voice of that old man shouting of his trust in an everlasting tomorrow
