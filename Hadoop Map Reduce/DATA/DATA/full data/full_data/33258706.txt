33258706	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    the tollhouse   its all nonsense said jack barnes  of course people have died in the house people die in every house  as for the noiseswind in the chimney and rats in the wainscot are very convincing to a nervous man  give me another cup of tea meagle  lester and white are first said meagle who was presiding at the teatable of the three feathers inn  youve had two  lester and white finished their cups with irritating slowness pausing between sips to sniff the aroma and to discover the sex and dates of arrival of the strangers which floated in some numbers in the beverage mr meagle served them to the brim and then turning to the grimly expectant mr barnes blandly requested him to ring for hot water  well try and keep your nerves in their present healthy condition he remarked  for my part i have a sort of halfandhalf belief in the supernatural  all sensible people have said lester  an aunt of mine saw a ghost once  white nodded  i had an uncle that saw one he said  it always is somebody else that sees them said barnes  well there is a house said meagle a large house at an absurdly low rent and nobody will take it  it has taken toll of at least one life of every family that has lived therehowever short the timeand since it has stood empty caretaker after caretaker has died there  the last caretaker died fifteen years ago  exactly said barnes  long enough ago for legends to accumulate  ill bet you a sovereign you wont spend the night there alone for all your talk said white suddenly  and i said lester  no said barnes slowly  i dont believe in ghosts nor in any supernatural things whatever all the same i admit that i should not care to pass a night there alone  but why not  inquired white  wind in the chimney said meagle with a grin  rats in the wainscot chimed in lester  as you like said barnes coloring  suppose we all go said meagle  start after supper and get there about eleven  we have been walking for ten days now without an adventureexcept barness discovery that ditchwater smells longest  it will be a novelty at any rate and if we break the spell by all surviving the grateful owner ought to come down handsome  lets see what the landlord has to say about it first said lester there is no fun in passing a night in an ordinary empty house  let us make sure that it is haunted  he rang the bell and sending for the landlord appealed to him in the name of our common humanity not to let them waste a night watching in a house in which spectres and hobgoblins had no part  the reply was more than reassuring and the landlord after describing with considerable art the exact appearance of a head which had been seen hanging out of a window in the moonlight wound up with a polite but urgent request that they would settle his bill before they went  its all very well for you young gentlemen to have your fun he said indulgently but supposing as how you are all found dead in the morning what about me  it aint called the tollhouse for nothing you know  who died there last  inquired barnes with an air of polite derision  a tramp was the reply  he went there for the sake of half a crown and they found him next morning hanging from the balusters dead  suicide said barnes  unsound mind  the landlord nodded  thats what the jury brought it in he said slowly but his mind was sound enough when he went in there  id known him off and on for years  im a poor man but i wouldnt spend the night in that house for a hundred pounds  illustration im a poor man but i wouldnt spend the night in that house for a hundred pounds  he repeated this remark as they started on their expedition a few hours later  they left as the inn was closing for the night bolts shot noisily behind them and as the regular customers trudged slowly homewards they set off at a brisk pace in the direction of the house most of the cottages were already in darkness and lights in others went out as they passed  it seems rather hard that we have got to lose a nights rest in order to convince barnes of the existence of ghosts said white  its in a good cause said meagle  a most worthy object and something seems to tell me that we shall succeed  you didnt forget the candles lester  i have brought two was the reply all the old man could spare  there was but little moon and the night was cloudy  the road between high hedges was dark and in one place where it ran through a wood so black that they twice stumbled in the uneven ground at the side of it  fancy leaving our comfortable beds for this  said white again  let me see this desirable residential sepulchre lies to the right doesnt it  farther on said meagle  they walked on for some time in silence broken only by whites tribute to the softness the cleanliness and the comfort of the bed which was receding farther and farther into the distance  under meagles guidance they turned oft at last to the right and after a walk of a quarter of a mile saw the gates of the house before them  illustration they saw the gates of the house before them  the lodge was almost hidden by overgrown shrubs and the drive was choked with rank growths  meagle leading they pushed through it until the dark pile of the house loomed above them  there is a window at the back where we can get in so the landlord says said lester as they stood before the hall door  window said meagle  nonsense  lets do the thing properly  wheres the knocker  he felt for it in the darkness and gave a thundering rattattat at the door  dont play the fool said barnes crossly  ghostly servants are all asleep said meagle gravely but ill wake them up before ive done with them  its scandalous keeping us out here in the dark  he plied the knocker again and the noise volleyed in the emptiness beyond  then with a sudden exclamation he put out his hands and stumbled forward  why it was open all the time he said with an odd catch in his voice come on  i dont believe it was open said lester hanging back  somebody is playing us a trick  nonsense said meagle sharply  give me a candle  thanks  whos got a match  barnes produced a box and struck one and meagle shielding the candle with his hand led the way forward to the foot of the stairs  shut the door somebody he said theres too much draught  it is shut said white glancing behind him  meagle fingered his chin  who shut it  he inquired looking from one to the other  who came in last  i did said lester but i dont remember shutting itperhaps i did though  meagle about to speak thought better of it and still carefully guarding the flame began to explore the house with the others close behind  shadows danced on the walls and lurked in the corners as they proceeded  at the end of the passage they found a second staircase and ascending it slowly gained the first floor  careful said meagle as they gained the landing  he held the candle forward and showed where the balusters had broken away  then he peered curiously into the void beneath  this is where the tramp hanged himself i suppose he said thoughtfully  youve got an unwholesome mind said white as they walked on  this place is qutie creepy enough without your remembering that  now lets find a comfortable room and have a little nip of whiskey apiece and a pipe  how will this do  he opened a door at the end of the passage and revealed a small square room  meagle led the way with the candle and first melting a drop or two of tallow stuck it on the mantelpiece  the others seated themselves on the floor and watched pleasantly as white drew from his pocket a small bottle of whiskey and a tin cup  hm  ive forgotten the water he exclaimed  ill soon get some said meagle  he tugged violently at the bellhandle and the rusty jangling of a bell sounded from a distant kitchen  he rang again  dont play the fool said barnes roughly  meagle laughed  i only wanted to convince you he said kindly  there ought to be at any rate one ghost in the servants hall  barnes held up his hand for silence  yes said meagle with a grin at the other two  is anybody coming  suppose we drop this game and go back said barnes suddenly  i dont believe in spirits but nerves are outside anybodys command  you may laugh as you like but it really seemed to me that i heard a door open below and steps on the stairs  his voice was drowned in a roar of laughter  he is coming round said meagle with a smirk  by the time i have done with him he will be a confirmed believer  well who will go and get some water  will you barnes  no was the reply  if there is any it might not be safe to drink after all these years said lester  we must do without it  meagle nodded and taking a seat on the floor held out his hand for the cup  pipes were lit and the clean wholesome smell of tobacco filled the room  white produced a pack of cards talk and laughter rang through the room and died away reluctantly in distant corridors  empty rooms always delude me into the belief that i possess a deep voice said meagle  tomorrow  he started up with a smothered exclamation as the light went out suddenly and something struck him on the head  the others sprang to their feet then meagle laughed  its the candle he exclaimed  i didnt stick it enough  barnes struck a match and relighting the candle stuck it on the mantelpiece and sitting down took up his cards again  what was i going to say  said meagle  oh i know tomorrow i  listen said white laying his hand on the others sleeve  upon my word i really thought i heard a laugh  look here said barnes  what do you say to going back  ive had enough of this  i keep fancying that i hear things too sounds of something moving about in the passage outside  i know its only fancy but its uncomfortable  you go if you want to said meagle and we will play dummy  or you might ask the tramp to take your hand for you as you go downstairs  barnes shivered and exclaimed angrily  he got up and walking to the halfclosed door listened  go outside said meagle winking at the other two  ill dare you to go down to the hall door and back by yourself  barnes came back and bending forward lit his pipe at the candle  i am nervous but rational he said blowing out a thin cloud of smoke my nerves tell me that there is something prowling up and down the long passage outside my reason tells me that it is all nonsense  where are my cards  he sat down again and taking up his hand looked through it carefully and led  your play white he said after a pause  white made no sign  why he is asleep said meagle  wake up old man  wake up and play  lester who was sitting next to him took the sleeping man by the arm and shook him gently at first and then with some roughness but white with his back against the wall and his head bowed made no sign  meagle bawled in his ear and then turned a puzzled face to the others  he sleeps like the dead he said grimacing  well there are still three of us to keep each other company  yes said lester nodding  unlessgood lord suppose  he broke off and eyed them trembling  suppose what inquired meagle  nothing stammered lester  lets wake him  try him again white white  its no good said meagle seriously theres something wrong about that sleep  thats what i meant said lester and if he goes to sleep like that why shouldnt  meagle sprang to his feet  nonsense he said roughly  hes tired out thats all  still lets take him up and clear out  you take his legs and barnes will lead the way with the candle  yes  whos that  he looked up quickly towards the door  thought i heard somebody tap he said with a shamefaced laugh  now lester up with him  one two lester  lester  he sprang forward too late lester with his face buried in his arms had rolled over on the floor fast asleep and his utmost efforts failed to awaken him  heisasleep he stammered  asleep  barnes who had taken the candle from the mantelpiece stood peering at the sleepers in silence and dropping tallow over the floor  illustration barnes stood peering at the sleepers in silence and dropping tallow over the floor  we must get out of this said meagle  quick  barnes hesitated  we cant leave them here he began  we must said meagle in strident tones  if you go to sleep i shall goquick  come  he seized the other by the arm and strove to drag him to the door barnes shook him off and putting the candle back on the mantelpiece tried again to arouse the sleepers  its no good he said at last and turning from them watched meagle dont you go to sleep he said anxiously  meagle shook his head and they stood for some time in uneasy silence may as well shut the door said barnes at last  he crossed over and closed it gently  then at a scuffling noise behind him he turned and saw meagle in a heap on the hearthstone  with a sharp catch in his breath he stood motionless  inside the room the candle fluttering in the draught showed dimly the grotesque attitudes of the sleepers  beyond the door there seemed to his over wrought imagination a strange and stealthy unrest  he tried to whistle but his lips were parched and in a mechanical fashion he stooped and began to pick up the cards which littered the floor  he stopped once or twice and stood with bent head listening  the unrest outside seemed to increase a loud creaking sounded from the stairs  who is there he cried loudly  the creaking ceased  he crossed to the door and flinging it open strode out into the corridor  as he walked his fears left him suddenly  come on he cried with a low laugh  all of you  all of you  show your facesyour infernal ugly faces  dont skulk  he laughed again and walked on and the heap in the fireplace put out his head tortoise fashion and listened in horror to the retreating footsteps not until they had become inaudible in the distance did the listeners features relax  good lord lester weve driven him mad he said in a frightened whisper  we must go after him  there was no reply  meagle sprung to his feet  do you hear  he cried  stop your fooling now this is serious  white  lester  do you hear  he bent and surveyed them in angry bewilderment  all right he said in a trembling voice  you wont frighten me you know  he turned away and walked with exaggerated carelessness in the direction of the door  he even went outside and peeped through the crack but the sleepers did not stir  he glanced into the blackness behind and then came hastily into the room again  he stood for a few seconds regarding them  the stillness in the house was horrible he could not even hear them breathe  with a sudden resolution he snatched the candle from the mantelpiece and held the flame to whites finger  then as he reeled back stupefied the footsteps again became audible  he stood with the candle in his shaking hand listening  he heard them ascending the farther staircase but they stopped suddenly as he went to the door  he walked a little way along the passage and they went scurrying down the stairs and then at a jogtrot along the corridor below  he went back to the main staircase and they ceased again  for a time he hung over the balusters listening and trying to pierce the blackness below then slowly step by step he made his way downstairs and holding the candle above his head peered about him  barnes  he called  where are you  shaking with fright he made his way along the passage and summoning up all his courage pushed open doors and gazed fearfully into empty rooms  then quite suddenly he heard the footsteps in front of him  he followed slowly for fear of extinguishing the candle until they led him at last into a vast bare kitchen with damp walls and a broken floor in front of him a door leading into an inside room had just closed  he ran towards it and flung it open and a cold air blew out the candle  he stood aghast  illustration into a vast bare kitchen with damp walls and a broken floor  barnes he cried again  dont be afraid  it is imeagle  there was no answer  he stood gazing into the darkness and all the time the idea of something close at hand watching was upon him  then suddenly the steps broke out overhead again  he drew back hastily and passing through the kitchen groped his way along the narrow passages  he could now see better in the darkness and finding himself at last at the foot of the staircase began to ascend it noiselessly  he reached the landing just in time to see a figure disappear round the angle of a wall  still careful to make no noise he followed the sound of the steps until they led him to the top floor and he cornered the chase at the end of a short passage  barnes  he whispered  barnes  something stirred in the darkness  a small circular window at the end of the passage just softened the blackness and revealed the dim outlines of a motionless figure  meagle in place of advancing stood almost as still as a sudden horrible doubt took possession of him  with his eyes fixed on the shape in front he fell back slowly and as it advanced upon him burst into a terrible cry  barnes  for gods sake  is it you  the echoes of his voice left the air quivering but the figure before him paid no heed  for a moment he tried to brace his courage up to endure its approach then with a smothered cry he turned and fled  the passages wound like a maze and he threaded them blindly in a vain search for the stairs  if he could get down and open the hall door  he caught his breath in a sob the steps had begun again  at a lumbering trot they clattered up and down the bare passages in and out up and down as though in search of him  he stood appalled and then as they drew near entered a small room and stood behind the door as they rushed by  he came out and ran swiftly and noiselessly in the other direction and in a moment the steps were after him  he found the long corridor and raced along it at top speed  the stairs he knew were at the end and with the steps close behind he descended them in blind haste  the steps gained on him and he shrank to the side to let them pass still continuing his headlong flight  then suddenly he seemed to slip off the earth into space   lester awoke in the morning to find the sunshine streaming into the room and white sitting up and regarding with some perplexity a badly blistered finger  where are the others  inquired lester  gone i suppose said white we must have been asleep  lester arose and stretching his stiffened limbs dusted his clothes with his hands and went out into the corridor  white followed  at the noise of their approach a figure which had been lying asleep at the other end sat up and revealed the face of barnes  why ive been asleep he said in surprise  i dont remember coming here  how did i get here  nice place to come for a nap said lester severely as he pointed to the gap in the balusters  look there  another yard and where would you have been  he walked carelessly to the edge and looked over  in response to his startled cry the others drew near and all three stood gazing at the dead man below  illustration all three stood gazing at the dead man below
