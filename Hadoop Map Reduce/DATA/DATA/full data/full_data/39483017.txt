of the struggle     preface   my dear lads  you have probably been accustomed to regard the war between england and her colonies in america as one in which we were not only beaten but to some extent humiliated owing to the war having been an unsuccessful one for our arms british writers have avoided the subject and it has been left for american historians to describe these writing for their own countrymen and drawing for their facts upon gazettes letters and other documents emanating from one side only have naturally and no doubt insensibly given a very strong color to their own views of the events and english writers have been too much inclined to accept their account implicitly there is however another and very different side to the story and this i have endeavored to show you the whole of the facts and details connected with the war can be relied upon as accurate they are drawn from the valuable account of the struggle written by major steadman who served under howe clinton and cornwallis and from other authentic contemporary sources you will see that although unsuccessfuland success was under the circumstances a sheer impossibilitythe british troops fought with a bravery which was never exceeded and that their victories in actual conflict vastly outnumbered their defeats indeed it may be doubted whether in any war in which this country has been engaged have our soldiers exhibited the qualities of endurance and courage to a higher degree  yours very sincerely  g a henty       true to the old flag     chapter i   a frontier farm   concord march 1 1774  my dear cousin i am leaving next week with my husband for england where we intend to pass some time visiting his friends john and i have determined to accept the invitation you gave us last summer for harold to come and spend a few months with you his father thinks that a great future will ere many years open in the west and that it is therefore well the boy should learn something of frontier life for myself i would rather that he stayed quietly at home for he is at present overfond of adventure but as my husband is meditating selling his estate here and moving west it is perhaps better for him  massachusetts is in a ferment as indeed are all the eastern states and the people talk openly of armed resistance against the government my husband being of english birth and having served in the kings army cannot brook what he calls the rebellious talk which is common among his neighbors and is already on bad terms with many around us i myself am as it were a neutral as an american woman it seems to me that the colonists have been dealt with somewhat hardly by the english parliament and that the measures of the latter have been highhanded and arbitrary upon the other hand i naturally incline toward my husbands views he maintains that as the kings army has driven out the french and gives protection to the colony it is only fair that the colonists should contribute to its expenses the english ask for no contributions toward the expense of their own country but demand that at least the expenses of the protection of the colony shall not be charged upon the heavily taxed people at home as to the law that the colony shall trade only with the mother country my husband says that this is the rule in the colonies of spain france portugal and the netherlands and that the people here who can obtain what land they choose and till it without rent should not grumble at paying this small tax to the mother country however it be i fear that troubles will come and this place being the head and focus of the party hostile to england my husband feeling himself out of accord with all his neighbors saying a few loyal gentlemen like himself is thinking much and seriously of selling our estate here and of moving away into the new countries of the west where he will be free from all the disputation and contentious talk which occupies mens time here  indeed cousin times have sadly changed since you were staying here with us five years ago then our life was a peaceful and quiet one now there is nothing but wrangling and strife the dissenting clergy are as my husband says was the case in england before the great civil war the fomenters of this discontent there are many busybodies who pass their time in stirring up the people by violent harangues and seditious writings therefore everyone takes one side or the other and there is neither peace nor comfort in life  accustomed as i have always been to living in ease and affluence i dread somewhat the thought of a life on the indian frontier one has heard so many dreadful stories of indian fights and massacres that i tremble a little at the prospect but i do not mention this to john for as other women are like yourself brave enough to support these dangers i would not appear a coward in his eyes you will see cousin that as this prospect is before us it is well that harold should learn the ways of a frontier life moreover john does not like the thought of leaving him here while we are in england for as he says the boy might learn to become a rebel in his absence therefore my dear cousin we have resolved to send him to you an opportunity offers in the fact that a gentleman of our acquaintance is with his family going this week west with the intention of settling there and he will he tells us go first to detroit whence he will be able to send harold forward to your farm the boy himself is delighted at the thought and promises to return an accomplished backwoodsman john joins me in kind love to yourself and your husband and believe me to remain  your affectionate cousin  mary wilson   four months after the date of the above letter a lad some fifteen years old was walking with a man of middle age on the shores of lake huron behind them was a large clearing of about a hundred acres in extent a comfortable house with buildings for cattle stood at a distance of some three hundred yards from the lake broad fields of yellow corn waved brightly in the sun and from the edge of the clearing came the sound of a woodsmans ax showing that the proprietor was still enlarging the limits of his farm surrounding the house at a distance of twenty yards was a strong stockade some seven feet in height formed of young trees pointed at the upper end squared and fixed firmly in the ground the house itself although far more spacious and comfortable than the majority of backwood farmhouses was built in the usual fashion of solid logs and was evidently designed to resist attack  william welch had settled ten years before on this spot which was then far removed from the nearest habitation it would have been a very imprudent act under ordinary circumstances to have established himself in so lonely a position so far removed from the possibility of assistance in case of attack he settled there however just after pontiac who was at the head of an alliance of all the indian tribes of those parts had after the long and desperate siege of fort pitt made peace with us upon finding that his friends the french had given up all thought of further resistance to the english and had entirely abandoned the country mr welch thought therefore that a permanent peace was likely to reign on the frontier and that he might safely establish himself in the charming location he had pitched upon far removed from the confines of civilization  the spot was a natural clearing of some forty acres in extent sloping down to the waters edge and a more charming site could hardly have been chosen mr welch had brought with him three farm laborers from the east and as time went on he extended the clearing by cutting down the forest giants which bordered it  but in spite of the beauty of the position the fertility of the soil the abundance of his crops and the advantages afforded by the lake both from its plentiful supply of fish and as a highway by which he could convey his produce to market he had more than once regretted his choice of location it was true that there had been no indian wars on a large scale but the indians had several times broken out in sudden incursions three times he had been attacked but fortunately only by small parties which he had been enabled to beat off once when a more serious danger threatened him he had been obliged to embark with his wife and child and his more valuable chattels in the great scow in which he carried his produce to market and had to take refuge in the settlements to find on his return his buildings destroyed and his farm wasted at that time he had serious thoughts of abandoning his location altogether but the settlements were extending rapidly toward him and with the prospect of having neighbors before long and the natural reluctance to give up a place upon which he had expended so much toil he decided to hold on hoping that more quiet times would prevail until other settlers would take up land around him  the house had been rebuilt more strongly than before he now employed four men and had been unmolested since his return to his farm three years before the date of this story already two or three locations had been taken up on the shores of the lake beyond him a village had grown up thirtyfive miles away and several settlers had established themselves between that place and his home  so you are going out fishing this morning harold mr welch said i hope you will bring back a good supply for the larder is low i was looking at you yesterday and i see that you are becoming a firstrate hand at the management of a canoe  so i ought to be the boy said considering that for nearly three months i have done nothing but shoot and fish  you have a sharp eye harold and will make a good backwoodsman one of these days you can shoot nearly as well as i can now it is lucky that i had a good stock of powder and lead on hand firing away by the hour together as you do consumes a large amount of ammunition see there is a canoe on the lake it is coming this way too there is but one man in it he is a white by his clothes  for a minute or two they stood watching the boat and then seeing that its course was directed toward the shore they walked down to the edge of the lake to meet it  ah pearson is that you mr welch asked i thought i knew your long sweeping stroke at a distance you have been hunting i see that is a fine stag you have got there what is the news  about as bad as can be master welch the hunter said the iroquois have dug up the tomahawk again and are out on the warpath they have massacred john brent and his family i heard a talk of it among some hunters i met ten days since in the woods they said that the iroquois were restless and that their chief war eagle one of the most troublesome varmints on the whole frontier had been stirring em up to war he told em i heard that the palefaces were pushing further and further into the injun woods and that unless they drove em back the redskin hunting grounds would be gone i hoped that nothing would come of it but i might have known better when the redskins begin to stir theres sure to be mischief before theyre quiet again  the color had somewhat left mr welchs cheeks as the hunter spoke  this is bad news indeed pearson he said gravely are you sure about the attack on the brents  sartin sure the hunter said i met their herder he had been down to johnsons to fetch a barrel of pork just when he got back he heard the injun yells and saw smoke rising in the clearing so he dropped the barrel and made tracks i met him at johnsons where he had just arrived johnson was packing up with all haste and was going to leave and so i said i would take my canoe and come down the lake giving you all warning on the way i stopped at burns and hoopers burns said he should clear out at once but hooper talked about seeing it through hes got no wife to be skeary about and reckoned that with his two hands he could defend his log hut i told him i reckoned he would get his har raised if the injuns came that way but in course thats his business  what do you advise pearson i do not like abandoning this farm to the mercy of the redskins  it would be a pity master welch thats as true as gospel its the likeliest clearing within fifty miles round and youve fixed the place up as snug and comfortable as if it were a farm in the old provinces in course the question is what this war eagle intends to do his section of the tribe is pretty considerable strong and although at present i aint heard that any others have joined these injuns are like barrels of gunpowder when the spark is once struck theres no saying how far the explosion may spread when one band of em sees as how another is taking scalps and getting plunder and honor they all want to be at the same work i reckon war eagle has got some two hundred braves who will follow him but when the news spreads that he has begun his work all the iroquois to say nothing of the shawnees delawares and other varmint may dig up the hatchet the question is what war eagles intentions are he may make a clean sweep down attacking all the outlying farms and waiting till he is joined by a lot more of the red reptiles before attacking the settlements then on the other hand he may think himself strong enough to strike a blow at gloucester and some other border villages at once in that case he might leave the outlying farms alone as the news of the burning of these would reach the settlements and put em on their guard and he knows in course that if he succeeds there he can eat you all up at his leisure  the attack upon brents place looks as if he meant to make a clean sweep down mr welch said  well the hunter continued thoughtfully i dont know as i sees it in that light brents place was a long way from any other he might have wished to give his band a taste of blood and so raise their spirits and he might reasonably conclude that naught would be known about it for days perhaps weeks to come then again the attack might have been made by some straggling party without orders its a dubious question youve got four hands here i think and yourself i have seen your wife shoot pretty straight with a rifle so she can count as one and as this young un here has a good idea too with his shootingiron that makes six guns your place is a strong one and you could beat off any straggling party my idea is that war eagle who knows pretty well that the place would make a stout fight wont waste his time by making a regular attack upon it you might hold out for twentyfour hours the clearing is open and there aint no shelter to be had he would be safe to lose a sight of men and this would be a bad beginning and would discourage his warriors greatly no i reckon war eagle will leave you alone for the present maybe he will send a scout to see whether you are prepared its as likely as not that one is spying at us somewhere among the trees now i should lose no time in driving in the animals and getting well in shelter when they see you are prepared they will leave you alone at least for the present afterward theres no sayingthat will depend on how they get on at the settlements if they succeed there and get lots of booty and plenty of scalps they may march back without touching you they will be in a hurry to get to their villages and have their feasts and dancing if they are beaten off at the settlements i reckon they will pay you a visit for sure they wont go back without scalps they will be savage like and wont mind losing some men for the sake of having something to brag about when they get back and now master welch i must be going on for i want to take the news down to the settlements before war eagle gets there and he may be ahead of me now for aught i know i dont give you no advice as to what you had best do you can judge the circumstances as well as i can when i have been to the settlements and put them on their guard maybe i shall be coming back again and in that case you know jack pearsons rifle is at your disposal you may as well tote this stag up to the house you wont be doing much hunting just for the present and the meat may come in handy  the stag was landed and a minute later the canoe shot away from shore under the steady stroke of the hunters powerful arms mr welch at once threw the stag over his shoulders and accompanied by harold strode away toward the house on reaching it he threw down the stag at the door seized a rope which hung against the wall and the sounds of a large bell rung in quick sharp strokes summoned the hands from the fields the sound of the woodmans ax ceased at once and the shouts of the men as they drove the cattle toward the house rose on the still air  what is the matter william mrs welch asked as she ran from the house  i have bad news my dear the indians are out again and i fear we may have trouble before us we must hope that they will not come in this direction but must be prepared for the worst wait till i see all the hands and beasts in the stockade and then we can talk the matter over quietly  in a few minutes the hands arrived driving before them the horses and cattle  what is it boss they asked was that the alarm bell sure enough  the indians are out again mr welch said and in force they have massacred the brents and are making toward the settlements they may come this way or they may not at any rate we must be prepared for them get the beasts into the sheds and then do you all take scythes and set to work to cut down that patch of corn which is high enough to give them shelter theres nothing else which will cover them within a hundred yards of the house of course you will take your rifles with you and keep a sharp lookout but they will have heard the bell if they are in the neighborhood and will guess that we are on the alert so they are not likely to attempt a surprise shut one of the gates and leave the other ajar with the bar handy to put up in case you have to make a run for it harold will go up to the lookout while you are at work  having seen that all was attended to mr welch went into the house where his wife was going about her work as usual pale but quiet and resolute  now jane he said sit down and i will tell you exactly how matters stand as far as pearson who brought the news has told me then you shall decide as to the course we had better take  after he had told her all that pearson had said and the reasons for and against expecting an early attack he went on  now it remains for you my dear to decide whether we shall stay and defend the place till the last against any attack that may be made or whether we shall at once embark in the scow and make our way down to the settlements  what do you think william his wife asked  i scarcely know myself he answered but if i had quite my own way i should send you and nelly down to the settlements in the scow and fight it out here with the hands  you certainly will not have your own way in that his wife said if you go of course i go if you stay i stay i would a thousand times rather go through a siege here and risk the worst than go down to gloucester and have the frightful anxiety of not knowing what was happening here besides it is very possible as you say that the indians may attack the settlement itself many of the people there have had no experience in indian war and the redskins are likely to be far more successful in their surprise there than they would be here if we go we should have to leave our house our barns our stacks and our animals to the mercy of the savages your capital is pretty nearly all embarked here now and the loss of all this would be ruin to us at any rate william i am ready to stay here and to risk what may come if you are a life on the frontier is necessarily a life of danger and if we are to abandon everything and to have to commence life afresh every time the indians go on the warpath we had better give it up at once and return to massachusetts  very well my dear her husband said gravely you are a true frontiersmans wife you have chosen as i should have done it is a choice of evils but god has blessed and protected us since we came out into the wildernesswe will trust and confide in him now at any rate he went on more cheerfully there is no fear of the enemy starving us out we got in our store of provisions only a fortnight since and have enough of everything for a threemonths siege there is no fear of our well failing us and as for ammunition we have abundance seeing how harold was using powder and ball i had an extra supply when the stores came in the other day there is plenty of corn in the barn for the animals for months and i will have the corn which the men are cutting brought in as a supply of food for the cows it will be useful for another purpose too we will keep a heap of it soaked with water and will cover the shingles with it in case of attack it will effectually quench their fire arrows  the day passed off without the slightest alarm and by nightfall the patch of corn was cleared away and an uninterrupted view of the ground for the distance of a hundred yards from the house was afforded when night fell two out of the four dogs belonging to the farm were fastened out in the open at a distance of from seventy to eighty yards of the house the others being retained within the stockade the garrison was divided into three watches two men being on the alert at a time relieving each other every three hours mr welch took harold as his companion on the watch the boy was greatly excited at the prospect of a struggle he had often read of the desperate fights between the frontier settlers and the indians and had longed to take a share in the adventurous work he could scarcely believe that the time had come and that he was really a sharer in what might be a desperate struggle  the first watch was set at nine and at twelve mr welch and harold came on duty the men they relieved reported that all was silent in the woods and that they had heard no suspicious cries of any kind when the men had returned to their room mr welch told harold that he should take a turn round the stockade and visit the dogs harold was to keep watch at the gate to close it after he went out to put up the bar and to stand beside it ready to open it instantly if called upon  then the farmer stepped out into the darkness and treading noiselessly at once disappeared from harolds sight the latter closed the gate replaced the heavy bar and stood with one hand on this and the other holding his rifle listening intently once he thought he heard a low growling from one of the dogs but this presently ceased and all was quiet again the gate was a solid one formed of strong timbers placed at a few inches apart and bolted to horizontal bars  presently he felt the gate upon which his hand rested quiver as if pressure was applied from without his first impulse was to say is that you but mr welch had told him that he would give a low whistle as he approached the gate he therefore stood quiet with his whole attention absorbed in listening without making the least stir he peered through the bars and made out two dark figures behind them after once or twice shaking the gate one took his place against it and the other sprang upon his shoulders  harold looked up and saw a mans head appear against the sky dim as was the light he could see that it was no european headgear a long feather or two projecting from it in an instant he leveled his rifle and fired there was a heavy fall and then all was silent harold again peered through the bars the second figure had disappeared and a black mass lay at the foot of the gate  in an instant the men came running from the house rifles in hand  what is it they exclaimed where is mr welch  he went out to scout round the house leaving me at the gate harold said two men i think indians came up one was getting over the gate when i shot him i think he is lying outsidethe other has disappeared  we must get the master in one of the men said he is probably keeping away not knowing what has happened mr welch he shouted it is all safe here so far as we know we are all on the lookout to cover you as you come up  immediately a whistle was heard close to the gate this was cautiously opened a few inches and was closed and barred directly mr welch entered  harold told him what had happened  i thought it was something of the sort i heard wolf growl and felt sure that it was not at me i threw myself down and crept up to him and found him shot through the heart with an indian arrow i was crawling back to the house when i heard harolds shot then i waited to see if it was followed by the warwhoop which the redskins would have raised at once on finding that they were discovered had they been about to attack in force seeing that all was quiet i conjectured that it was probably an attempt on the part of a spy to discover if we were upon the alert then i heard your call and at once came on i do not expect any attack tonight now as these fellows must have been alone but we will all keep watch till the morning you have done very well harold and have shown yourself a keen watchman it is fortunate that you had the presence of mind neither to stir nor to call out when you first heard them for had you done so you would probably have got an arrow between your ribs as poor wolf has done  when it was daylight and the gate was opened the body of an indian was seen lying without a small mark on his forehead showed where harolds bullet had entered death being instantaneous his warpaint and the embroidery of his leggings showed him at once to be an iroquois beside him lay his bow with an arrow which had evidently been fitted to the string for instant work harold shuddered when he saw it and congratulated himself on having stood perfectly quiet a grave was dug a short distance away the indian was buried and the household proceeded about their work  the day as was usual in households in america was begun with prayer and the supplications of mr welch for the protection of god over the household were warm and earnest the men proceeded to feed the animals these were then turned out of the inclosure one of the party being always on watch in the little tower which they had erected for that purpose some ten or twelve feet above the roof of the house from this spot a view was obtainable right over the clearing to the forest which surrounded it on three sides the other hands proceeded to cut down more of the corn so as to extend the level space around the house     chapter ii   an indian raid  that day and the next passed quietly the first night the man who was on watch up to midnight remarked to mr welch when he relieved him that it seemed to him that there were noises in the air  what sort of noises jacksoncalls of nightbirds or animals if so the indians are probably around us  no the man said all is still round here but i seem to feel the noise rather than hear it i should say that it was firing very many miles off  the night is perfectly still and the sound of a gun would be heard a long way  i cannot say that i have heard a gun it is rather a tremble in the air than a sound  when the man they had relieved had gone down and all was still again mr welch and harold stood listening intently  jackson was right the farmer said there is something in the air i can feel it rather than hear it it is a sort of murmur no louder than a whisper do you hear it harold  i seem to hear something harold said it might be the sound of the sea a very long way off just as one can hear it many miles from the coast on a still night at home what do you think it is  if it is not fancy mr welch replied and i do not think that we should all be deceived it is an attack upon gloucester  but gloucester is thirtyfive miles away harold answered  it is mr welch replied but on so still a night as this sounds can be heard from an immense distance if it is not this i cannot say what it is  upon the following night just as mr welchs watch was at an end a low whistle was heard near the gate  who is there mr welch at once challenged  jack pearson and the sooner you open the gate the better theres no saying where these red devils may be lying round  harold and the farmer instantly ran down and opened the gate  i should advise you to stop down here the hunter said as they replaced the bars if you did not hear me you certainly would not hear the redskins and theyd all be over the palisade before you had time to fire a shot im glad to see you safe for i was badly skeared lest i should find nothing but a heap of ashes here  the next two men now turned out and mr welch led his visitor into the house and struck a light  halloo pearson you must have been in a skirmish he said seeing that the hunters head was bound up with a bloodstained bandage  it was all that pearson said and wuss i went down to gloucester and told em what i had heard but the darned fools tuk it as quiet as if all king georges troops with fixed bayonets had been camped round em the council got together and palavered for an hour and concluded that there was no chance whatever of the iroquois venturing to attack such a powerful place as gloucester i told em that the redskins would go over their stockade at a squirrels jump and that as war eagle alone had at least 150 braves while there warnt more than 50 ablebodied men in gloucester and all the farms around it things would go bad with em if they didnt mind but bless yer they knew more than i did about it most of em had moved from the east and had never seen an injun in his warpaint gloucester had never been attacked since it was founded nigh ten years ago and they didnt see no reason why it should be attacked now there was a few old frontiersmen like myself among em who did their best to stir em up but it was no manner of good when the council was over we put our heads together and just went through the township atalking to the women and we hadnt much difficulty in getting up such a skear among em that before nightfall every one of em in the farms around made their husbands move into the stockade of the village  when the night passed off quietly most of the men were just as savage with us as if it had been a false alarm altogether i pinted out that it was not because war eagle had left em alone that night that he was bound to do so the next night or any night after but in spite of the women they would have started out to their farms the fust thing in the morning if a man hadnt come in with the news that carters farm had been burned and the whole of the people killed and scalped as carters farm lay only about fifteen miles off this gave em a skear and they were as ready now to believe in the injuns as i had tried to make em the night before then they asked us old hands to take the lead and promised to do what we told em but when it came to it their promises were not worth the breath they had spent upon em there were eight or ten houses outside the stockade and in course we wanted these pulled down but they wouldnt hear of it howsomever we got em to work to strengthen the stockades to make loopholes in the houses near em to put up barricades from house to house and to prepare generally for a fight we divided into three watches  well just as i expected about eleven oclock at night the injuns attacked our watch might just as well have been asleep for any good they did for it was not till the redskins had crept up to the stockade all round and opened fire between the timbers on em that they knew that they were near ill do em justice to say that they fought stiff enough then and for four hours they held the line of houses every redskin who climbed the stockade fell dead inside it four fires had been lighted directly they attacked to enable us to keep em from scaling the stockade but they showed us to the enemy of course   the redskins took possession of the houses which we had wanted to pull down and precious hot they made it for us then they shot such showers of burning arrows into the village that half of the houses were soon alight we tried to get our men to sally out and to hold the line of stockade when we might have beaten em off if all the village had been burned down but it were no manner of good each man wanted to stick to his wife and family till the last as the flames went up every man who showed himself was shot down and when at last more than half our number had gone under the redskins brought up fagots piled em against the stockade outside and then the hull tribe came bounding over our rifles were emptied for we couldnt get the men to hold their fire but some of us chaps as knew what was coming gave the redskins a volley as they poured in  i dont know much as happened after that jack robins and bill shuter who were old pals of mine and me made up our minds what to do and we made a rush for a small gate that there was in the stockade just opposite where the injuns came in we got through safe enough but they had left men all round jack robins he was shot dead bill and i kept straight on we had a grapple with some of the redskins two or three on em went down and bill and i got through and had a race for it till we got fairly into the forest bill had a ball in the shoulder and i had a clip across the head with a tomahawk we had a council and bill went off to warn some of the other settlements and i concluded to take to the water and paddle back to you not knowing whether i should find that the redskins had been before me i thought anyway that i might stop your going down to gloucester and that if there was a fight you would be none the worse for an extra rifle  mr welch told the hunter of the visit of the two indian spies two nights before  waal the hunter said i reckon for the present you are not likely to be disturbed the injuns have taken a pile of booty and something like two hundred scalps counting the women and children and they moved off at daybreak this morning in the direction of tottenham which i reckon theyll attack tonight howsomever bill has gone on there to warn em and after the sack of gloucester the people of tottenham wont be caught napping and there are two or three old frontiersmen who have settled down there and war eagle will get a hot reception if he tries it as far as his band is concerned youre safe for some days the only fear is that some others of the tribe hurrying up at hearing of his success may take this place as they go past and now i guess ill take a few hours sleep i havent closed an eye for the last two nights  a week passed quietly pearson after remaining two days again went down the lake to gather news and returned a day later with the intelligence that almost all the settlements had been deserted by their inhabitants the indians were out in great strength and had attacked the settlers at many points along the frontier committing frightful devastations  still another week passed and mr welch began to hope that his little clearing had been overlooked and forgotten by the indians the hands now went about their work as usual but always carried arms with them while one was constantly stationed on the watchtower harold resumed his fishing never however going out of sight of the house sometimes he took with him little nelly welch it being considered that she was as safe in the canoe as she was in the house especially as the boat was always in sight and the way up from the landing to the house was under cover of the rifles of the defenders so that even in case of an attack they would probably be able to make their way back  one afternoon they had been out together for two or three hours everything looked as quiet and peaceable as usual the hands were in the fields near the house a few of the cows grazing close to the gate harold had been successful in his fishing and had obtained as many fish as he could carry he stepped out from the canoe helped nelly to land slung his rifle across his back and picked up the fish which were strung on a withe passed through their gills  he had made but a few steps when a yell arose so loud and terrible that for a moment his heart seemed to stop beating then from the cornfields leaped up a hundred dark figures then came the sharp crack of rifles and two of the hands dashed down at full speed toward the house one had fallen the fourth man was in the watchtower the surprise had been complete the indians had made their way like snakes through the long corn whose waving had been unperceived by the sentinel who was dozing at his post halfasleep in the heat of the sun harold saw in a moment that it was too late for him to regain the house the redskins were already nearer to it than he was  now nelly into the boat againquick he said we must keep out of the way till its all over  nelly was about twelve years old and her life in the woods had given her a courage and quickness beyond her years without wasting a moment on cries or lamentations she sprang back into the canoe harold took his place beside her and the light craft darted rapidly out into the lake not until he was some three or four hundred yards from the shore did harold pause to look round then when he felt he was out of gunshot distance he ceased paddling the fight was raging now around the house from loopholes and turret the white puffs of smoke darted angrily out the fire had not been ineffectual for several dark forms could be seen lying round the stockade and the bulk of the indians foiled in their attempt to carry the place at a rush had taken shelter in the corn and kept up a scattering fire round the house broken only on the side facing the lake where there was no growing crop to afford them shelter  they are all right now harold said cheerfully  do not be anxious nelly they will beat them off pearson is a host in himself i expect he must have been lying down when the attack was made i know he was scouting round the house all night if he had been on the watch those fellows would never have succeeded in creeping up so close unobserved  i wish we were inside nelly said speaking for the first time if i were only with them i should not mind  i am sure i wish we were harold agreed it is too hard being useless out here when such a splendid fight is going on ah they have their eyes on us he exclaimed as a puff of smoke burst out from some bushes near the shore and a ball came skipping along on the surface of the water sinking however before it reached it  those indian muskets are no good harold said contemptuously and the trade powder the indians get is very poor stuff but i think that they are well within range of my rifle  the weapon which harold carried was an english rifle of very perfect make and finish which his father had given him on parting  now he said do you paddle the canoe a few strokes nearer the shore nelly we shall still be beyond the range of that fellow he will fire again and i shall see exactly where he is lying  nelly who was efficient in the management of a canoe took the paddle and dipping it in the water the boat moved slowly toward the shore harold sat with his rifle across his knees looking intently over the bows of the boat toward the bush from which the shot had come  thats near enough nelly he said  the girl stopped paddling and the hidden foe seeing that they did not mean to come nearer the shore again fired harolds rifle was in an instant against his shoulder he sat immovable for a moment and then fired  instantly a dark figure sprang from the bush staggered a few steps up the slope and then fell headlong  that was a pretty good shot harold said your father told me when i saw a stags horns above a bush to fire about two feet behind them and eighteen inches lower i fired a foot below the flash and i expect i hit him through the body i had the sight at three hundred yards and fired a little above it now nelly paddle out again see he said there is a shawl waving from the top of the tower put your hat on the paddle and wave it  what are you thinking of doing harold the girl asked presently   that is just what i have been asking myself for the last ten minutes harold replied it is quite clear that as long as the siege is kept up we cannot get back again and there is no saying how long it may last the first thing is what chance is there of their pursuing us are there any other canoes on the lake within a short distance  they have one at braithwaites the girl said four miles off but look there is pearsons canoe lying by the shore  so there is harold exclaimed i never thought of that i expect the indians have not noticed it the bank is rather high where it is lying they are sure to find it sooner or later i think nelly the best plan would be to paddle back again so as to be within the range of my rifle while still beyond the reach of theirs i think i can keep them from using the boat until it is dark  but after it is dark harold  well then we must paddle out into the lake so as to be well out of sight when it gets quite dark we can paddle in again and sleep safely anywhere a mile or two from the house  an hour passed without change then nelly said there is a movement in the bushes near the canoe presently an arm was extended and proceeded to haul the canoe toward the shore by its headrope as it touched the bank an indian rose from the bushes and was about to step in while a number of puffs of smoke burst out along the shore and the bullets skipped over the water toward the canoe one of them striking it with sufficient force to penetrate the thin bark a few inches above the waters edge harold had not moved but as the savage stepped into the canoe he fired and the indian fell heavily into the water upsetting the canoe as he did so  a yell of rage broke from his comrades  i dont think they will try that game again as long as it is daylight harold said paddle a little further out again nelly if that bullet had hit you it would have given you a nasty blow though i dont think it would have penetrated still we may as well avoid accidents  after another hour passed the fire round the house ceased  do you think the indians have gone away nelly asked  i am afraid there is no chance of that harold said i expect they are going to wait till night and then try again they are not fond of losing men and pearson and your father are not likely to miss anything that comes within their range as long as daylight lasts  but after dark harold  oh they will try all sorts of tricks but pearson is up to them all dont you worry about them dear  the hours passed slowly away until at last the sun sank and the darkness came on rapidly so long as he could see the canoe which just floated above the waters edge harold maintained his position then taking one paddle while nelly handled the other he sent the boat flying away from the shore out into the lake for a quarter of an hour they paddled straight out by this time the outline of the shore could be but dimly perceived harold doubted whether it would be possible to see the boat from shore but in order to throw the indians off the scent should this be the case he turned the boats head to the south and paddled swiftly until it was perfectly dark  i expect they saw us turn south he said to nelly the redskins have wonderful eyes so if they pursue at all they will do it in that direction no human being unless he borrowed the eyes of an owl could see us now so we will turn and paddle the other way  for two hours they rowed in this direction  we can go in to shore now harold said at last we must be seven or eight miles beyond the house  the distance to the shore was longer than they expected for they had only the light of the stars to guide them and neither had any experience in night traveling they had made much further out into the lake than they had intended at length the dark line of trees rose in front of them and in a few minutes the canoe lay alongside the bank and its late occupants were stretched on a soft layer of moss and fallen leaves  what are we going to do tomorrow about eating nelly asked  there are four or five goodsized fish in the bottom of the canoe harold replied fortunately we caught more than i could carry and i intended to make a second trip from the house for these i am afraid we shall not be able to cook them for the indians can see smoke any distance if the worst comes to the worst we must eat them raw but we are sure to find some berries in the wood tomorrow now dear you had better go to sleep as fast as you can but first let us kneel down and pray god to protect us and your father and mother   the boy and girl knelt in the darkness and said their simple prayers then they lay down and harold was pleased to hear in a few minutes the steady breathing which told him that his cousin was asleep it was a long time before he followed her example during the day he had kept up a brave front and had endeavored to make the best of their position but now that he was alone he felt the full weight of the responsibility of guiding his companion through the extreme danger which threatened them both he felt sure that the indians would prolong the siege for some time as they would be sure that no reenforcements could possibly arrive in aid of the garrison moreover he by no means felt so sure as he had pretended to his companion of the power of the defenders of the house to maintain a successful resistance to so large a number of their savage foes in the daylight he felt certain they could beat them off but darkness neutralizes the effect both of superior arms and better marksmanship it was nearly midnight before he lay down with the determination to sleep but scarcely had he done so when he was aroused by an outburst of distant firing although six or seven miles from the scene of the encounter the sound of each discharge came distinct to the ear along the smooth surface of the lake and he could even hear mingled with the musketry fire the faint yells of the indians for hours as it seemed to him he sat listening to the distant contest and then he unconsciously to himself dozed off to sleep and awoke with a start to find nelly sitting up beside him and the sun streaming down through the boughs he started to his feet  bless me he exclaimed i did not know that i had been asleep it seems but an instant ago that i was listeningand here he checked himselfthat is that i was wide awake and here we are in broad daylight  harolds first care was to examine the position of the canoe and he found that fortunately it had touched the shore at a spot where the boughs of the trees overhead drooped into the water beyond it so that it could not be seen by anyone passing along the lake this was the more fortunate as he saw some three miles away a canoe with three figures on board for a long distance on either side the boughs of the trees drooped into the water with only an opening here and there such as that through which the boat had passed the night before  we must be moving nelly here are the marks where we scrambled up the bank last night if the indians take it into their heads to search the shore both ways as likely enough they may do they will be sure to see them in the first place let us gather a stock of berries and then we will get into the boat again and paddle along under this arcade of boughs till we get to some place where we can land without leaving marks of our feet if the indians find the place where we landed here they will suppose that we went off again before daylight  for some time they rambled in the woods and succeeded in gathering a store of berries and wild fruit upon these nelly made her breakfast but harolds appetite was sufficiently ravenous to enable him to fall to upon the fish which he declared were not so bad after all then they took their places in the canoe again and paddled on for nearly a mile   see harold nelly exclaimed as she got a glimpse through the boughs into the lake there is another canoe they must have got the braithwaite boat we passed their place coming here you know i wonder what has happened there  what do you think is best to do nelly harold asked your opinion is just as good as mine about it shall we leave our canoe behind land and take to the woods or shall we stop quietly in the canoe in shelter here or shall we take to the lake and trust to our speed to get away in which case you know if they should come up i could pick them off with my gun before they got within reach  i dont think that would do the girl said shaking her head you shoot very well but it is not an easy thing to hit a moving object if you are not accustomed to it and they paddle so fast that if you miss them once they would be close alongsideat any rate we should be within reach of their gunsbefore you could load again they would be sure to catch us for although we might paddle nearly as fast for a time they would certainly tire us out then as to waiting here in the canoe if they came along on foot looking for us we should be in their power it is dreadful to think of taking to the woods with indians all about but i really think that would be our safest plan  i think so too nelly if we can manage to do it without leaving a track we must not go much further for the trees are getting thinner ahead and we should be seen by the canoes  fifty yards further harold stopped paddling  here is just the place nelly  at this point a little stream of three or four feet wide emerged into the lake harold directed the boats head toward it the water in the stream was but a few inches deep  now nelly he said we must step out into the water and walk up it as far as we can goit will puzzle even the sharpest redskin to find our track then  they stepped into the water harold taking the headrope of the canoe and towing the light boatwhich when empty did not draw more than two inches of waterbehind him he directed nelly to be most careful as she walked not to touch any of the bushes which at times nearly met across the stream  a broken twig or withered leaf would be quite enough to tell the indians that we came along this way he said where the bushes are thick you must manage to crawl under them never mind about getting wetyou will soon dry again  slowly and cautiously they made their way up the stream for nearly a mile it had for some distance been narrowing rapidly being only fed by little rills from the surrounding swamp land harold had so far looked in vain for some spot where they could land without leaving marks of their feet presently they came to a place where a great tree had fallen across the stream  this will do nelly harold said now above all things you must be careful not to break off any of the moss or bark you had better take your shoes off then i will lift you on to the trunk and you can walk along it without leaving a mark  it was hard work for nelly to take off her drenched boots but she managed at last harold lifted her on to the trunk and said  walk along as far as you can and get down as lightly as possible on to a firm piece of ground it rises rapidly here and is i expect a dry soil where the upper end of the tree lies  how are you going to get out harold  i can swing myself up by that projecting root  before proceeding to do so harold raised one end of the canoe and placed it on the trunk of the tree then having previously taken off his shoes he swung himself on to the trunk hauling up the light bark canoe and taking especial pains that it did not grate upon the trunk he placed it on his head and followed nelly along the tree he found as he had expected that the ground upon which the upper end lay was firm and dry he stepped down with great care and was pleased to see as he walked forward that no trace of a footmark was left  be careful nelly he exclaimed when he joined her not to tread on a stick or disturb a fallen leaf with your feet and above all to avoid breaking the smallest twig as you pass choose the most open ground as that is the hardest  in about a hundred yards they came upon a large clump of bushes  now nelly raise those lower boughs as gently and as carefully as you can i will push the canoe under i dont think the sharpest indian will be able to take up our track now  very carefully the canoe was stowed away and when the boughs were allowed to fall in their natural position it was completely hidden from sight to every passerby harold took up the fish nelly had filled her apron with the berries and carrying their shoesfor they agreed that it would be safer not to put them onthey started on their journey through the deep forest     chapter iii   the redskin attack  mr welch was with the men two or three hundred yards away from the house when the indians suddenly sprang out and opened fire one of the men fell beside him the farmer stooped to lift him but saw that he was shot through the head then he ran with full speed toward the house shouting to the hands to make straight for the gate disregarding the cattle several of these however alarmed at the sudden outburst of fire and the yells of the indians made of their own accord for the stables as their master rushed up at full speed the indians were but fifty or sixty yards behind when mr welch reached his gate they had all emptied their pieces and after the first volley no shots had been fired save one by the watchman on the lookout then came the crack of pearsons rifle just as mr welch shut the gate and laid the bar in its place several spare guns had been placed in the upper chambers and three reports rang out together for mrs welch had run upstairs at the first alarm to take her part in the defense  in another minute the whole party now six in all were gathered in the upper room  where are nelly and harold mr welch exclaimed i saw the canoe close to the shore just before the indians opened fire the watchman answered  you must have been asleep pearson said savagely where were your eyes to let them redskins crawl up through the corn without seeing em with such a crowd of em the corn must have been awaving as if it was blowing a gale you ought to have a bullet in yer ugly carkidge instead of its being in yer mates out there  while this conversation was going on no one had been idle each took up his station at a loophole and several shots were fired whenever the movement of a blade of corn showed the lurking place of an indian  the instant the gate had been closed war eagle had called his men back to shelter for he saw that all chance of a surprise was now over and it was contrary to all redskin strategy to remain for one moment unnecessarily exposed to the rifles of the whites the farmer and his wife had rushed at once up into the lookout as the indians drew off and to their joy saw the canoe darting away from shore  they are safe for the present thank god mr welch said it is providential indeed that they had not come a little further from the shore when the redskins broke out nothing could have saved them had they fairly started for the house  what will they do william asked his wife anxiously  i cannot tell you my dear i do not know what i should do myself under the circumstances however the boy has got a cool head on his shoulders and you need not be anxious for the present now let us join the others our first duty is to take our share in the defense of the house the young ones are in the hands of god we can do nothing for them well pearson asked looking round from his loophole as the farmer and his wife descended into the room which was a low garret extending over the whole of the house do you see the canoe  yes it has got safely away william welch said but what the lad will do now is more than i can say  pearson placed his rifle against the wall now keep your eyes skinned he said to the three farm hands  one of yers done mischief enough this morning already and youll get your har raised as sure as youre born unless you look out sharp now he went on turning to the welches let us go down and talk this matter over the injuns may keep on firing but i dont think theyll show in the open again as long as its light enough for us to draw bead on em yes he went on as he looked through a loophole in the lower story over the lake there they are just out of range  what do you think they will do mrs welch asked  the hunter was silent for a minute  it aint a easy thing to say what they ought to do much less what they will do it aint a good outlook anyway and i dont know what i should do myself the whole of the woods on this side of the lake are full of the darned red critters theres a hundred eyes on that canoe now and go where they will theyll be watched  but why should they not cross the lake and land on the other side mr welch said  if you and i were in that canoe the hunter answered thats about what we should do but not to say that its a long row for em they two young uns would never get across the injuns would have em before they had been gone an hour theres my canoe lying under the bushes shed carry four and would go three feet to their two  i had forgotten about that william welch said and then added after a pause the indians may not find it  you neednt hope that the hunter answered they have found it long before this i dont want to put you out of heart but i tell ye yell see them on the water before many minutes have passed  then they are lost mrs welch said sinking down in her chair and bursting into tears  they air in gods hands maam the hunter said and its no use trying to deceive you  would it be of any use william welch asked after a pause for me to offer the redskins that my wife and i will go out and put ourselves in their hands if they will let the canoe go off without pursuit  not it the hunter replied decidedly you would be throwing away your own lives without saving theirs not to mention although that doesnt matter a straw the lives of the rest of us here it will be as much as we can do when they attack us in earnest to hold this place with six guns and with only four the chance would be worth nothing but thats neither here nor there you wouldnt save the young ones if you gave yourselves up you cant trust the word of an injun on the warpath and if they went so far as not to kill em they would carry em off and after all i aint sure as death aint better for em than to be brought up as injuns there he said stopping suddenly as a report of a musket sounded at some little distance off the injuns are trying their range against em lets go up to the lookout  the little tower had a thick parapet of logs some three feet high and crouching behind this they watched the canoe hes coming nearer in shore and the girl has got the paddle pearson muttered whats he doing now a puff of smoke was seen to rise near the border of the lake then came the sharp crack of harolds rifle they saw an indian spring from the bushes and fall dead  well done young un pearson exclaimed i told yer hed got his head screwed on the right way hes keeping just out of range of their guns and that piece of his can carry twice as far as theirs i reckon hes thought of the canoe and means to keep em from using it i begins to think mr welch that theres a chance for em yet now lets talk a little to these red devils in the corn  for some little time pearson and william welch turned their attention to the indians while the mother sat with her eyes fixed upon the canoe  he is coming closer again she exclaimed presently  hes watching the canoe sure enough pearson said then came the volley along the bushes on the shore and they saw an indian rise to his feet  thats just where she lies pearson exclaimed hes getting into it there well done young un  the sudden disappearance of the indian and the vengeful yell of the hidden foe told of the failure of the attempt  i think theyre safe now till nightfall the injuns wont care about putting themselves within range of that ere rifle again  gradually the fire of the indians ceased and the defenders were able to leave the loopholes two of the men went down and fastened up the cattle which were still standing loose in the yard inside the stockade the other set to to prepare a meal for mrs welch could not take her eyes off the canoe  the afternoon seemed of interminable length not a shot was fired the men after taking their dinner were occupied in bringing some great tubs on to the upper story and filling them to the brim with water from the well this story projected two feet beyond the one below it having been so built in order that in case of attack the defenders might be able to fire down upon any foe who might cross the stockade and attack the house itself the floor boards over the projecting portion were all removable the men also brought a quantity of the newly cut corn to the top of the house first drenching it with water  the sun sank and as dusk was coming on the anxious watchers saw the canoe paddle out far into the lake  an old frontiersman couldnt do better pearson exclaimed hes kept them out of the canoe as long as daylight lasted now he has determined to paddle away and is making down the lake he went on presently its a pity he turned so soon as they can see the course hes taking  they watched until it was completely dark but before the light quite faded they saw another canoe put out from shore and start in the direction taken by the fugitives  will they catch them do you think mrs welch asked  no maam pearson said confidently the boys got sense enough to have changed his course after it gets dark though whether hell make for shore or go out toward the other side is more than i can say you see theyll know that the injuns are all along this side of the lake but then on the other hand theyll be anxious about us and ll want to keep close at hand besides the lad knows nothing of the other side there may be injuns there for aught he knows and its a skeary thing for a young un to take to the forest especially with a gal in his charge there aint no saying what hell do and now weve got to look after ourselves dont let us think about em at present the best thing as we can do for them as well as for ourselves is to hold this here place if they live theyll come back to it sooner or later and it ll be better for em to find it standing and you here to welcome em than to get back to a heap of ruins and some dead bodies  when will the redskins attack do you think the farmer asked  we may expect em any time now the hunter answered the injuns time of attack is generally just before dawn but they know well enough they aint likely to ketch us asleep any time and as they know exactly what they have got to do theyll gain nothing by waiting i wish we had a moon if we had we might keep em out of the stockade but thereits just as well its dark after all for if the moon was up the young ones would have no chance of getting away  the garrison now all took their places at the loopholes having first carried the wet fodder to the roof and spread it over the shingles there was nothing to do now but to wait the night was so dark that they could not see the outline of the stockade presently a little spark shot through the air followed by a score of others mr welch had taken his post on the tower and he saw the arrows whizzing through the air many of them falling on the roof the dry grass dipped in resin which was tied round the arrowheads was instantly extinguished as the arrows fell upon the wet corn and a yell arose from the indians  the farmer descended and told the others of the failure of the indians first attempt  that ere dodge is a firstrate un pearson said were safe from fire and thats the only thing weve got to be afeared on youll see em up here in a few minutes  everything was perfectly quiet once or twice the watchers thought that they could hear faint sounds but could not distinguish their direction after half an hours anxious waiting a terrible yell was heard from below and at the doors and windows of the lower rooms came the crashing blows of tomahawks  the boards had already been removed from the flooring above and the defenders opened a steady fire into the dark mass that they could faintly make out clustered round the windows and doors at pearsons suggestion the bullets had been removed from the guns and heavy charges of buckshot had been substituted for them and yells of pain and surprise rose as they fired a few shots were fired up from below but a second discharge from the spare guns completed the effect from the first volley the dark mass broke up and in a few seconds all was as quiet as before  two hours passed and then slight sounds were heard theyve got the gate opened i expect pearson said fire occasionally at that if we dont hit em the flashes may show us what theyre doing  it was as he had expected the first discharge was followed by a cry and by the momentary light they saw a number of dark figures pouring in through the gate seeing that concealment was no longer possible the indians opened a heavy fire round the house then came a crashing sound near the door  just as i thought pearson said theyre going to try to burn us out  for some time the noise continued as bundle after bundle of dried wood was thrown down by the door the garrison were silent for as pearson said they could see nothing and a stray bullet might enter at the loopholes if they placed themselves there and the flashes of the guns would serve as marks for the indians  presently two or three faint lights were seen approaching  now pearson said pick em off as they come up you and ill take the first man welch you fire just to the right of the light i will fire to the left he may be carrying the brand in either hand  they fired together and the brand was seen to drop to the ground the same thing happened as the other two sparks of light approached then it was again quiet now a score of little lights flashed through the air  theyre going to light the pile with their flaming arrows pearson said war eagle is a good leader  three or four of the arrows fell on the pile of dry wood a moment later the flames crept up and the smoke of burning wood rolled up into the room above a yell of triumph burst from the indians but this changed into one of wrath as those above emptied the contents of one of the great tubs of water on to the pile of wood below them the flames were instantly extinguished  what will they do next mrs welch asked  its like enough pearson replied that theyll give the job up altogether theyve got plenty of plunder and scalps at the settlements and their attacking us here in such force looks as if the hull of em were on their way back to their villages if they could have tuk our scalps easy they would have done it but war eagle aint likely to risk losing a lot of men when he aint sartin of winning after all he has done good work as it is and has quite enough to boast about when he gets back if he were to lose a heap of his braves here it would spoil the success of his expedition no i think as he will give it up now  he will be all the more anxious to catch the children mrs welch said despondently  it cant be denied maam as he will do his best that way pearson answered it all depends though on the boy i wish i was with him in that canoe howsomever i cant help thinking as he will sarcumvent em somehow  the night passed without any further attack by turns half the garrison watched while the other lay down but there was little sleep taken by any with the first gleam of daylight mrs welch and her husband were on the lookout  theres two canoes out on the lake pearson said theyre paddling quietly which is which i cant say  as the light became brighter pearson pronounced positively that there were three men in one canoe and four in the other  i think theyre all injuns he said they must have got another canoe somewhere along the lake waal theyve not caught the young uns yet  the boats are closing up to each other mrs welch said theyre going to have a talk i reckon yes one of ems turning and going down the lake while the others going up id give a heap to know where the young uns have got to  the day passed quietly an occasional shot toward the house showed that the indians remained in the vicinity and indeed dark forms could be seen moving about in the distant parts of the clearing  will it be possible the farmer asked pearson when night again fell to go out and see if we can discover any traces of them  worse than no use pearson said positively we should just lose our har without doing no good whatever if the injuns in these woodsand i reckon altogether theres a good many hundred of emcant find em ye may swear that we cant thats just what theyre hoping that well be fools enough to put ourselves outside the stockade theyll lie close round all night and a weasel wouldnt creep through em ef i thought there was jest a shadow of chance of finding them young uns id risk it but theres no chancenot a bit of it  a vigilant watch was again kept up all night but all was still and quiet the next morning the indians were still round them  dont ye fret maam pearson said as he saw how pale and wan mrs welch looked in the morning light you may bet your last shilling that theyre not caught em  why are you so sure mrs welch asked they may be dead by this time  not they maam im as sartin as theyre living and free as i am that im standing here i know these injuns ways ef they had caught em theyd jest have brought em here and would have fixed up two posts jest out of rifle range and would have tied them there and offered you the choice of giving up this place and your scalps or of seeing them tortured and burned under your eyes thats their way no they aint caught em alive nor they aint caught em dead neither for ef they had theyd have brought their scalps to have shown yer no theyve got away though it beats me to say how ive only got one fear and that is that they might come back before the injuns have gone now i tell ye what we had better dowe better keep up a dropping fire all night and all day tomorrow and so on until the redskins have gone ef the young uns come back across the lake at night and all is quiet theyll think the injuns have taken themselves off but if they hear firing still going on theyll know well enough that theyre still around the house  william welch at once agreed to this plan and every quarter of an hour or so all through the night a few shots were fired the next morning no indians could be seen and there was a cessation of the dropping shots which had before been kept up at the house  they may be in hiding pearson said in the afternoon trying to tempt us out but im more inclined to think as how theyve gone i dont see a blade of that corn move ive had my eyes fixed on it for the last two hours it are possible of course that theyre there but i reckon not i expect theyve been waiting ever since they gave up the attack in hopes that the young uns would come back but now as they see that were keeping up a fire to tell them as how theyre still round us theyve given it up and gone when it gets dark tonight ill go out and scout round  at ten oclock at night pearson dropped lightly from the stockade on the side opposite to the gate as he knew that if the indians were there this would be the point that they would be watching then crawling upon his stomach he made his way slowly down to the lake entering the water and stooping low he waded along the edge of the bushes for a distance of a mile then he left the water and struck into the forest every few minutes he could hear the discharge of the rifles at the house but as before no answering shots were heard treading very cautiously he made a wide détour and then came down again on the clearing at the end furthest from the lake where the indians had been last seen moving about all was still keeping among the trees and moving with great caution he made his way for a considerable distance along the edge of the clearing then he dropped on his hands and knees and entered the cornfield and for two hours he crawled about quartering the ground like a dog in search of game everywhere he found lines where the indians had crawled along to the edge nearest to the house but nowhere did he discover a sign of life then still taking great care he moved down toward the house and made a circuit of it a short distance outside the stockade then he rose to his feet  yer may stop shooting he shouted the pesky rascals are gone then he walked openly up to the gate it was opened at once by william welch  are you sure they have gone he asked  sure as gospel he answered and theyve been gone twentyfour hours at least  how do you know that  easy enough i found several of their cooking places in the woods the brands were out and even under the ashes the ground was cold so they must have been out for a long time i could have walked straight on to the house then but i thought it safer to make quite sure by searching everywhere for they might have moved deeper into the forest and left a few men on guard here in case the young uns should come back but it aint so theyve gone and there aint a living soul anywhere nigh the clearing the young uns can come back now if they will safely enough  before doing anything else the farmer assembled the party together in the living room and there solemnly offered up thanks to god for their deliverance from danger and implored his protection for the absent ones when this was over he said to his wife  now jane you had better lie down and get a few hours sleep it is already two oclock and there is no chance whatever of their returning tonight but i shall go down to the lake and wait till morning place candles in two of the upper windows should they be out on the lake they will see them and know that the indians have not taken the house  morning came without any signs of the absent ones at daybreak pearson went out to scout in the woods and returned late in the afternoon with the news that the indians had all departed and that for a distance of ten miles at least the woods were entirely free  when it became dark the farmer again went down to the lake and watched until two when pearson took his place mr welch was turning to go back to the house when pearson placed his hand on his shoulder  listen he said and for a minute the men stood immovable  what was it the farmer asked  i thought i heard the stroke of a paddle pearson said it might have been the jump of a fish there there it is again he lay down and put his ear close to the water theres a canoe in the lake to the northard i can hear the strokes of the paddle plainly  mr welch could hear nothing some minutes passed then pearson exclaimed  there i saw a break in the water over there there it is he said straining his eyes in the darkness thats a canoe sure enough although they have ceased paddling its not a mile away  then he rose to his feet and shouted halloo at the top of his voice an answering shout faintly came back across the water he again hailed loudly and this time the answer came in a female voice  its them sure enough i can swear to nellys voice  william welch uncovered his head and putting his hand before his face returned fervent thanks to god for the recovery of his child then he dashed off at full speed toward the house before he reached it however he met his wife running down to meet him the shouts having informed her that something was seen hand in hand they ran down to the waters edge the canoe was now swiftly approaching the mother screamed  nelly is that you  mamma mamma came back in the girls clear tones  with a low cry of gladness mrs welch fell senseless to the ground the strain which she had for four days endured had been terrible and even the assurances of pearson had failed to awaken any strong feeling of hope in her heart she had kept up bravely and had gone about her work in the house with a pale set face but the unexpected relief was too much for her two minutes later the bow of the canoe grated on the shore and nelly leaped into her fathers arms  where is mamma she exclaimed she is here my dear but she has fainted the joy of your return has been too much for her  nelly knelt beside her mother and raised her head and the farmer grasped harolds hand  my brave boy he said i have to thank you for saving my childs life god bless you  he dipped his hat in the lake and sprinkled water in his wifes face she soon recovered and a few minutes afterward the happy party walked up to the house mrs welch being assisted by her husband and pearson the two young ones were soon seated at a table ravenously devouring food and when their hunger was satisfied they related the story of their adventures the whole of the garrison being gathered round to listen after relating what had taken place up to the time of their hiding the canoe harold went on  we walked about a quarter of a mile until we came to a large clump of underwood we crept in there taking great pains not to break a twig or disturb a leaf the ground was fortunately very dry and i could see that our footprints had not left the smallest marks there we have lain hid ever since we had the fish and the berries and fortunately the fruit was ripe and juicy and quenched our thirst well enough and we could sometimes hear the firing by day and always at night on the day we took refuge we heard the voices of the indians down toward the lake quite plainly but we have heard nothing of them since last night we heard the firing up to the middle of the night and then it suddenly stopped today i crept out and went down to the lake to listen but it seemed that everything was still nelly was in a terrible way and was afraid that the house had been taken by the indians but i told her that could not be for that there would certainly have been a tremendous lot of firing at last whereas it stopped after a few shots just as it had been going on so long our provisions were all gone and nelly was getting very bad for want of water i of course got a drink at the lake this morning so we agreed that if everything was still again tonight we would go back to the place where we had hidden the canoe launch it and paddle here everything was quiet so we came along as we had arranged when i saw the lights in the windows i made sure all was right still it was a great relief when i heard the shout from the shore i knew of course that it wasnt a redskins shout besides indians would have kept quiet till we came alongside  very hearty were the commendations bestowed on the boy for his courage and thoughtfulness  you behaved like an old frontiersman pearson said i couldnt have done better myself you only made one blunder from the time you set out from shore  what was that harold asked  you were wrong to pick the berries the redskins of course would find where you had landed theyd see the marks where you lay down and would know that you had paddled away again had it not been for their seeing the tracks you made in picking the berries they might have supposed you had started before daybreak and had gone out of sight across the lake but them marks would have shown em that you did not take to your canoe until long after the sun was up and therefore that you couldnt have made across the lake without their seeing you but must either have landed or be in your canoe under shelter of the trees somewhere along the shore its a marvel to me that they didnt find your traces however careful you were to conceal em but thats the only error you made and i tell you young un you have a right to be proud of having outwitted a hull tribe of redskins     chapter iv   the fight at lexington  harold remained for four months longer with his cousin the indians had made several attacks upon settlements at other points of the frontier but they had not repeated their incursion in the neighborhood of the lake the farming operations had gone on regularly but the men always worked with their rifles ready to their hand pearson had predicted that the indians were not likely to return to that neighborhood mr welchs farm was the only one along the lake that had escaped and the loss the indians had sustained in attacking it had been so heavy that they were not likely to make an expedition in that quarter where the chances of booty were so small and the certainty of a desperate resistance so great  other matters occurred which rendered the renewal of the attack improbable the news was brought by a wandering hunter that a quarrel had arisen between the shawnees and the iroquois and that the latter had recalled their braves from the frontier to defend their own villages in case of hostilities breaking out between them and the rival tribe  there was no occasion for harold to wait for news from home for his father had before starting definitely fixed the day for his return and when that time approached harold started on his eastward journey in order to be at home about the date of their arrival pearson took him in his canoe to the end of the lake and accompanied him to the settlement whence he was able to obtain a conveyance to detroit here he took a passage in a trading boat and made his way by water to montreal thence down through lake champlain and the hudson river to new york and thence to boston  the journey had occupied him longer than he expected and mr and mrs wilson were already in their home at concord when he arrived the meeting was a joyful one his parents had upon their return home found letters from mr welch and his wife describing the events which had happened at the farm speaking in the highest terms of the courage and coolness in danger which harold had displayed and giving him full credit for the saving of their daughters life  upon the day after harolds return two gentlemen called upon captain wilson and asked him to sign the agreement which a number of colonists had entered into to resist the mother country to the last this captain wilson positively refused to do  i am an englishman he said and my sympathies are wholly with my country i do not say that the whole of the demands of england are justifiable i think that parliament has been deceived as to the spirit existing here but i consider that it has done nothing whatever to justify the attitude of the colonists the soldiers of england have fought for you against french and indians and are still stationed here to protect you the colonists pay nothing for their land they pay nothing toward the expenses of the government of the mother country and it appears to me to be perfectly just that people here free as they are from all the burdens that bear so heavily on those at home should at least bear the expense of the army stationed here i grant that it would have been far better had the colonists taxed themselves to pay the extra amount instead of the mother country taxing them but this they would not do some of the colonists paid their quota others refused to do so and this being the case it appears to me that england is perfectly justified in laying on a tax nothing could have been fairer than the tax that she proposed the stamptax would in no way have affected the poorer classes in the colonies it would have been borne only by the rich and by those engaged in such business transactions as required stamped documents i regard the present rebellion as the work of a clique of ambitious men who have stirred up the people by incendiary addresses and writings there are of course among them a large number of menamong them gentlemen i place youwho conscientiously believe that they are justified in doing nothing whatever for the land which gave them or their ancestors birth who would enjoy all the great natural wealth of this vast country without contributing toward the expense of the troops to whom it is due that they enjoy peace and tranquility such gentlemen are not my sentiments you consider it a gross hardship that the colonists are compelled to trade only with the mother country i grant that it would be more profitable and better for us had we an open trade with the whole world but in this england only acts as do all other countries toward their colonies france spain portugal and the netherlands all monopolize the trade of their colonies all far more than does england regard their colonies as sources of revenue i repeat i do not think that the course that england has pursued toward us has been always wise but i am sure that nothing that she has done justifies the spirit of disaffection and rebellion which is ripe throughout these colonies  the time will come sir one of the gentlemen said when you will have reason to regret the line which you have now taken  no sir captain wilson said haughtily the time may come when the line that i have taken may cost me my fortune and even my life but it will never cause me one moments regret that i have chosen the part of a loyal english gentleman  when the deputation had departed harold who had been a wondering listener to the conversation asked his father to explain to him the exact position in which matters stood  it was indeed a serious one the success of england in her struggle with france for the supremacy of north america had cost her a great deal of money at home the burdens of the people were extremely heavy the expense of the army and navy was great and the ministry in striving to lighten the burdens of the people turned their eyes to the colonies they saw in america a population of over two million people subjects of the king like themselves living free from rent and taxes on their own land and paying nothing whatever to the expenses of the country they were it is true forced to trade with england but this obligation was set wholly at naught a gigantic system of smuggling was carried on the customhouse officials had no force at their disposal which would have enabled them to check these operations and the law enforcing a trade with england was virtually a dead letter  their first step was to strengthen the naval force on the american coast and by additional vigilance to put some sort of check on the wholesale smuggling which prevailed this step caused extreme discontent among the trading classes of america and these set to work vigorously to stir up a strong feeling of disaffection against england the revenue officers were prevented sometimes by force from carrying out their duties  after great consideration the english government came to the conclusion that a revenue sufficient to pay a considerable proportion of the cost of the army in america might be raised by means of a stamptax imposed upon all legal documents receipts agreements and licensesa tax in fact resembling that on stamps now in use in england the colonists were furious at the imposition of this tax a congress composed of deputies from each state met and it was unanimously resolved that the stamptax should not be paid meetings were everywhere held at which the strongest and most treasonable language was uttered and such violent threats were used against the persons employed as stampcollectors that these in fear of their lives resigned their posts  the stamptax remained uncollected and was treated by the colonists as if it were not in existence  the whole of the states now began to prepare for war the congress was made permanent the militia drilled and prepared for fighting and everywhere the position grew more and more strained massachusetts was the headquarters of disaffection and here a total break with the mother country was openly spoken of at times the more moderate spirits attempted to bring about a reconciliation between the two parties petitions were sent to the houses of parliament and even at this time had any spirit of wisdom prevailed in england the final consequences might have been prevented unfortunately the majority in parliament were unable to recognize that the colonists had any rights upon their side taxation was so heavy at home that men felt indignant that they should be called upon to pay for the keeping up of the army in america to which the untaxed colonists with their free farms and houses would contribute nothing the plea of the colonists that they were taxed by a chamber in which they were unrepresented was answered by the statement that such was also the case with manchester leeds and many other large towns which were unrepresented in parliament  in england neither the spirit nor the strength of the colonists was understood men could not bring themselves to believe that these would fight rather than submit still less that if they did fight it would be successfully they ignored the fact that the population of the states was onefourth as large as that of england that by far the greater proportion of that population were men trained either in border warfare or in the chase to the use of the rifle that the enormous extent of country offered almost insuperable obstacles to the most able army composed of regular troops and that the vast forests and thinly populated country were all in favor of a population fighting as guerrillas against trained troops had they perceived these things the english people would have hesitated before embarking upon such a struggle even if convinced as assuredly the great majority were convinced of the fairness of their demands it is true that even had england at this point abandoned altogether her determination to raise taxes in america the result would probably have been the same the spirit of disaffection in the colony had gone so far that a retreat would have been considered as a confession of weakness and separation of the colonists from the mother country would have happened ere many years had elapsed as it was parliament agreed to let the stamptax drop and in its place established some import duties on goods entering the american ports  the colonists however were determined that they would submit to no taxation whatever the english government in its desire for peace abandoned all the duties with the exception of that on tea but even this concession was not sufficient to satisfy the colonists these entered into a bond to use no english goods a riot took place at boston and the revenue officers were forced to withdraw from their posts troops were dispatched from england and the house of commons declared massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion  it must not be supposed that the colonists were by any means unanimous in their resistance to england there were throughout the country a large number of gentlemen like captain wilson wholly opposed to the general feeling new york refused to send members to the congress and in many other provinces the adhesion given to the disaffected movement was but lukewarm it was in the new england provinces that the spirit of rebellion was hottest these states had been peopled for the most part by puritansmen who had left england voluntarily exiling themselves rather than submit to the laws and religion of the country and among them as among a portion of the irish population of america at the present time the feeling of hatred against the government of england was in a way hereditary  so far but few acts of violence had taken place nothing could be more virulent than the language of the newspapers of both parties against their opponents but beyond a few isolated tumults the peace had not been broken it was the lull before the storm the great majority of the new england colonists were bent upon obtaining nothing short of absolute independence the loyalists and the english were as determined to put down any revolt by force  the congress drilled armed and organized the english brought over fresh troops and prepared for the struggle it was december when harold returned home to his parents and for the next three months the lull before the storm continued  the disaffected of massachusetts had collected a large quantity of military stores at concord these general gage who commanded the troops at boston determined to seize and destroy seeing that they could be collected only for use against the government and on the night of april 19 the grenadier and light infantry companies of the various regiments 800 strong under command of lieutenant colonel smith of the tenth regiment and major pitcairne of the marines embarked in boats and were conveyed up charles river as far as a place called phipps farm there they landed at midnight having a days provisions in their haversacks and started on their march to concord twenty miles distant from boston  the design had been discovered by some of the revolutionary party in the town and two of their number were dispatched on horseback to rouse the whole country on the way to concord where the news arrived at two oclock in the morning  captain wilson and his household were startled from sleep by the sudden ringing of the alarmbells and a negro servant pompey who had been for many years in their service was sent down into the town which lay a quarter of a mile from the house to find out what was the news he returned in half an hour  me tink all de people gone mad massa dey swarming out of deir houses and filling de streets all wid guns on deir shoulders all de while shouting and halloing down wid de english down wid de redcoats dey shant have our guns dey shant take de cannon and de powder dere were ole massa bill emerson the preacher wid his gun in his hands shouting to de people to stand firm and to fight till de last dey all shout we will dey bery desperate me fear great fight come on  what are you going to do father harold asked  nothing my boy if as it is only too likely this is the beginning of a civil war i have determined to offer my services to the government great numbers of loyalists have sent in their names offering to serve if necessary and from my knowledge of drill i shall of course be useful today i can take no active part in the fight but i shall take my horse and ride forward to meet the troops and warn the commanding officer that resistance will be attempted here  may i go with you father  yes if you like my boy pompey saddle two horses at once you are not afraid of being left alone mary he said turning to his wife there is no chance of any disturbance here our house lies beyond the town and whatever takes place will be in concord when the troops have captured the guns and stores they will return  mrs wilson said she was not frightened and had no fear whatever of being left alone the horses were soon brought round and captain wilson and his son mounted and rode off at full speed they made a détour to avoid the town and then gaining the highroad went forward at full speed the alarm had evidently been given all along the line at every village the bells were ringing the people were assembling in the streets all carrying arms while numbers were flocking in from the farmhouses around once or twice captain wilson was stopped and asked where he was going  i am going to tell the commander of the british force now marching hither that if he advances there will be bloodshedthat it will be the beginning of civil war if he has orders to come at all hazards my words will not stop him if it is left to his discretion possibly he may pause before he brings on so dire a calamity  it was just dawn when captain wilson and harold rode into lexington where the militia 130 strong had assembled their guns were loaded and they were ready to defend the place which numbered about 700 inhabitants  just as captain wilson rode in a messenger ran up with the news that the head of the british column was close at hand some of the militia had dispersed to lie down until the english arrived john parker who commanded them ordered the drums to beat and the alarmguns to be fired and his men drew up in two ranks across the road  it is too late now harold captain wilson said let us get out of the line of fire  the british hearing the drums and the alarmguns loaded and the advance company came on at the double major pitcairne was at their head and shouted to the militia to lay down their arms  it is a matter of dispute and will always remain one as to who fired the first shot the americans assert that it was the english the english say that as they advanced several shots were fired at them from behind a stone wall and from some of the adjoining houses which wounded one man and hit major pitcairnes horse in two places  the militia disregarded major pitcairnes orders to lay down their arms the english fired several of the militia were killed nine wounded and the rest dispersed there was no further fighting and the english marched on unopposed to concord  as they approached the town the militia retreated from it the english took possession of a bridge behind the place and held this while the troops were engaged in destroying the ammunition and guncarriages most of the guns had been removed and only two twentyfour pounders were taken in destroying the stores by fire the courthouse took flames at the sight of this fire the militia and armed countrymen advanced down the hill toward the bridge the english tried to pull up the planks but the americans ran forward rapidly the english guard fired the colonists returned the fire some of the english were killed and wounded and the party fell back into the town half an hour later colonel smith having performed the duty that he was sent to do resumed the homeward march with the whole of his troops  then the militiamen of concord with those from many villages around and every man in the district capable of bearing arms fell upon the retiring english  the road led through several defiles and every tree every rock every depression of ground was taken advantage of by the americans scarcely a man was to be seen but their deadly fire rained thick upon the tired troops this they vainly attempted to return but they could do nothing against an invisible foe every man of whom possessed a skill with his rifle far beyond that of the british soldier very many fell and the retreat was fast becoming a rout when near lexington the column met a strong reenforcement which had been sent out from boston this was commanded by lord percy who formed his detachment into square in which colonel smiths party now so utterly exhausted that they were obliged to lie down for some time took refuge when they were rested the whole force moved forward again toward boston harassed the whole way by the americans who from behind stone walls and other places of shelter kept up an incessant fire upon both flanks as well as in the front and rear against which the troops could do nothing at last the retreating column safely arrived at boston spent and worn out with fatigue their loss was 65 men killed 136 wounded 49 missing  such was the beginning of the war of independence many american writers have declared that previous to that battle there was no desire for independence on the part of the colonists but this is emphatically contradicted by the language used at the meetings and in the newspapers which have come down to us the leaders may not have wished to go so farmay not have intended to gain more than an entire immunity from taxation and an absolute power for the colonists to manage their own affairs but experience has shown that when the spark of revolution is once lighted when resistance to the law has once commenced things are carried to a point far beyond that dreamed of by the first leaders  those who commenced the french revolution were moderate men who desired only that some slight check should be placed on the arbitrary power of the kingthat the people should be relieved in some slight degree from the horrible tyranny of the nobles from the misery and wretchedness in which they lived these just demands increased step by step until they culminated in the reign of terror and the most horrible scenes of bloodshed and massacre of modern times  men like washington and franklin and adams may have desired only that the colonists should be free from imperial taxation but the popular voice went far beyond this three years earlier wise counsels in the british parliament might have averted a catastrophe and delayed for many years the separation of the colonies from their mother country at the time the march began from boston to concord the american colonists stood virtually in armed rebellion the militia throughout new england were ready to fight arms ammunition and military stores were collected in rhode island and new hampshire the cannon and military stores belonging to the crown had been carried off by the people forty cannon being seized in rhode island alone such being the case it is nonsense to speak of the fray at lexington as the cause of the revolutionary war it was but the spark in the powder the magazine was ready and primed the explosion was inevitable and the fight at lexington was the accidental incident which set fire to it  the efforts of american writers to conceal the real facts of the case to minimize the rebellious language the violent acts of the colonists and to make england responsible for the war because a body of troops were sent to seize cannon and military stores intended to be used against them are so absurd as well as so untrue that it is astonishing how wide a credence such statements have received  from an eminence at some distance from the line of retreat captain wilson and his son watched sorrowfully the attack upon the british troops when at last the combatants disappeared from sight through one of the defiles captain wilson turned his horses head homeward  the die is cast he said to his wife as she met him at the door the war has begun and i fear it can have but one termination the colonists can place forces in the field twenty times as numerous as any army that england can spare they are inferior in drill and in discipline but these things which are of such vast consequence in a european battlefield matter but little in such a country as this skill with the rifle and knowledge of forest warfare are far more important in these points the colonists are as superior to the english soldiers as they are in point of numbers nevertheless my dear my duty is plain i am an englishman and have borne his majestys commission and i must fight for the king harold has spoken to me as we rode home together and he wishes to fight by my side i have pointed out to him that as he was born here he can without dishonor remain neutral in the struggle he however insists that as a royal subject of the king he is entitled to fight for him he saw today many lads not older than himself in the rebel ranks and he has pleaded strongly for permission to go with me to this i have agreed which would you prefer maryto stay quietly here where i imagine you would not be molested on account of the part i take or will you move into boston and stop with your relations there until the struggle has ended one way or the other  as mrs wilson had frequently talked over with her husband the course that he would take in the event of civil war actually breaking out the news that he would at once offer his services to the british authorities did not come as a shock upon her even the question of harold accompanying his father had been talked over and although her heart bled at the thought of husband and son being both engaged in such a struggle she agreed to acquiesce in any decision that harold might arrive at he was now nearly sixteen and in the colonies a lad of this age is in point of independence and selfreliance older than an english boy harold too had already shown that he possessed discretion and coolness as well as courage and although now that the moment had come mrs wilson wept passionately at the thought of their leaving her she abstained from saying any word to dissuade them from the course they had determined upon when she recovered from her fit of crying she said that she would accompany them at once to boston as in the first place their duties might for some time lie in that city and that in any case she would obtain far more speedy news there of what was going on throughout the country than she would at concord she would too be living among her friends and would meet with many of the same convictions and opinions as her husbands whereas in concord the whole population would be hostile  captain wilson said that there was no time to be lost as the whole town was in a tumult he therefore advised her to pack up such necessary articles as could be carried in the valises on the horses backs  pompey and the other servants were to pack up the most valuable effects and to forward them to a relation of mrs wilsons who lived about three miles from boston there they would be in safety and could be brought into the town if necessary pompey and two other old servants were to remain in charge of the house and its contents jake an active young negro some twentythree or twentyfour years old who was much attached to harold whose personal attendant and companion he had always been was to accompany them on horseback as was judy mrs wilsons negro maid  as evening fell the five horses were brought round and the party started by a long and circuitous route by which after riding for nearly forty miles they reached boston at two oclock next morning     chapter v   bunkers hill  the excitement caused by the news of the fight at concord was intense and as it spread through the colonies the men everywhere rushed to arms the fray at lexington was represented as a wanton outrage and the fact wholly ignored that the colonists concerned in it were drawn up in arms to oppose the passage of the kings troops who were marching on their legitimate duty of seizing arms and ammunition collected for the purpose of warring against the king the colonial orators and newspaper writers affirmed then as they have affirmed since that up to the day of lexington no one had a thought of firing a shot against the government a more barefaced misstatement was never made men do not carry off cannon by scores and accumulate everywhere great stores of warlike ammunition without a thought of fighting the colonists commenced the war by assembling in arms to oppose the progress of british troops obeying the orders of the government it matters not a whit on which side the first shot was fired american troops have many times since that event fired upon rioters in the streets under circumstances no stronger than those which brought on the fight at lexington  from all parts of new england the militia and volunteers poured in and in three days after the fight twenty thousand armed men were encamped between the rivers mystic and roxburgh thus besieging boston they at once set to work throwing up formidable earthworks the english troops remaining within their intrenchments across the neck of land joining boston with the mainland  the streets of boston were crowded with an excited populace when captain wilson and his party rode into it at two in the morning no one thought of going to bed and all were excited to the last degree at the news of the battle all sorts of reports prevailed on the colonial side it was affirmed that the british in their retreat had shot down women and children while the soldiers affirmed that the colonists had scalped many of their number who fell in the fight the latter statement was officially made by lord percy in his report of the engagement  captain wilson rode direct to the house of his wifes friends they were still up and were delighted to see mary wilson for such exaggerated reports had been received of the fight that they were alarmed for her safety they belonged to the moderate party who saw that there were faults on both sides and regretted bitterly both the obstinacy of the english parliament in attempting to coerce the colonists and the determination of the latter to oppose by force of arms the legitimate rights of the mother country  until the morning the events of the preceding day were talked over a few hours repose was then taken after which captain wilson went to the headquarters of general gage and offered his services although boston was the headquarters of the disaffected party no less than two hundred men came forward as volunteers in the kings service and captain wilson was at once appointed to the command of a company of fifty men before leaving the army he had taken part in several expeditions against the indians and his knowledge of forest warfare rendered him a valuable acquisition boston was but poorly provisioned and as upon the day when the news of lexington reached new york two vessels laden with flour for the use of the troops at boston were seized by the colonists and many other supplies cut off the danger of the place being starved out was considerable general gage therefore offered no opposition to the exit from the city of those who wished to avoid the horror of a siege and a considerable portion of the population made their way through to the rebel lines every day brought news of fresh risings throughout the country the governors of the various provinces were powerless small garrisons of english troops were disarmed and made prisoners and the fortress of ticonderoga held only by fifty men was captured by the americans without resistance in one month after the first shot was fired the whole of the american colonies were in rebellion  the news was received in england with astonishment and sorrow great concessions had been made by parliament but the news had reached america too late to avoid hostilities public opinion was divided many were in favor of granting at once all that the colonists demanded and many officers of rank and position resigned their commissions rather than fight against the americans the division indeed was almost as general and complete as it had been in the time of our own civil war in london the feeling in favor of the colonists was strong but in the country generally the determination to repress the rising was in the ascendant the colonists had with great shrewdness dispatched a fastsailing ship to europe upon the day following the battle of lexington giving their account of the affair and representing it as a massacre of defenseless colonists by british troops and the story thus told excited a sympathy which would not perhaps have been extended to them had the real facts of the case been known representatives from all the colonies met at philadelphia to organize the national resistance but as yet although many of the bolder spirits spoke of altogether throwing off allegiance to england no resolution was proposed to that effect  for the first six weeks after his arrival at boston captain wilson was engaged in drilling his company harold was of course attached to it and entered with ardor upon his duties captain wilson did not attempt to form his men into a band of regular soldiers accuracy of movement and regularity of drill would be of little avail in the warfare in which they were likely to be engaged accuracy in shooting quickness in taking cover and steadiness in carrying out any general orders were the principal objects to be attained most of the men had already taken part in frontier warfare the majority of them were gentlemenenglishmen who like their captain had come out from home and purchased small estates in the country the discipline therefore was not strict and off duty all were on terms of equality  toward the end of may and beginning of june considerable reenforcements arrived from england and as a step preparatory to offensive measures general gage on june 12 issued a proclamation offering in his majestys name a free pardon to all who should forthwith lay down their arms john hancock and general adams only excepted and threatening with punishment all who should delay to avail themselves of the offer this proclamation had no effect whatever  near the peninsula of boston on the north and separated from it by the charles river which is navigable and about the breadth of the thames at london bridge is another neck of land called the peninsula of charlestown on the north bank opposite boston lies the town of charlestown behind which in the center of the peninsula rises an eminence called bunkers hill bunkers hill is sufficiently high to overlook any part of boston and near enough to be within cannonshot this hill was unoccupied by either party and about this time the americans hearing that general gage had come to a determination to fortify it resolved to defeat his resolution by being the first to occupy it  about nine in the evening of june 16 a detachment from the colonial army one thousand strong under the command of colonel prescott moved along the charlestown road and took up a position on a shoulder of bunkers hill which was known as breeds hill just above the town of charlestown they reached this position at midnight each man carried a pick and shovel and all night they worked vigorously in intrenching the position not a word was spoken and the watch on board the menofwar in the harbor were ignorant of what was going on so near at hand at daybreak the alarm was given and the lively opened a cannonade upon the redoubt a battery of guns was placed on copps hill behind boston distant twelve hundred yards from the works and this also opened fire the americans continued their work throwing up fresh intrenchments and singularly only one man was killed by the fire from the ships and redoubt a breastwork was carried down the hill to the flat ground which intersected by fences stretched away to the mystic by nine oclock they had completed their intrenchments  prescott sent off for reenforcements but there was little harmony among the colonial troops disputes between the contingents of the various provinces were common there was no head of sufficient authority to enforce his orders upon the whole and a long delay took place before the reenforcements were sent forward  in the meantime the english had been preparing to attack the position the fifth thirtyeighth fortythird and fiftysecond regiments with ten companies of the grenadiers and ten of the light infantry with a proportion of field artillery embarked in boats and crossing the harbor landed on the outward side of the peninsula near the mystic with a view of outflanking the american position and surrounding them the force was under the command of major general howe under whom was brigadier general piggott  upon seeing the strength of the american position general howe halted and sent back for further reenforcements the americans improved the time thus given them by forming a breastwork in front of an old ditch here there was a postandrail fence they ran up another by the side of this and filled the space between the two with the newmown hay which cut only the day before lay thickly over the meadows  illustration plan of the action at bunkers hill on the 17th of june 1775  two battalions were sent across to reenforce howe while large reenforcements with six guns arrived to the assistance of prescott the english had now a force consisting according to different authorities of between 2000 and 2500 men the colonial force is also variously estimated and had the advantage both in position and in the protection of their intrenchments while the british had to march across open ground as individual shots the colonists were immensely superior but the british had the advantages given by drill and discipline  the english lines advanced in good order steadily and slowly the artillery covering them by their fire presently the troops opened fire but the distance was too great and they did but little execution encumbered with their knapsacks they ascended the steep hill toward the redoubt with difficulty covered as it was by grass reaching to the knees the colonists did not fire a shot until the english line had reached a point about one hundred and fifty yards from the intrenchments then prescott gave the order and from the redoubt and the long line of intrenchments flanking it flashed a line of fire each man had taken a steady aim with his rifle resting on the earthwork before him and so deadly was the fire that nearly the whole front line of the british fell for ten minutes the rest stood with dogged courage firing at the hidden foe but these sheltered while they loaded and only exposing themselves momentarily while they raised their heads above the parapets to fire did such deadly execution that the remnant of the british fell back to the foot of the hill  while this force which was under the command of general pigott had been engaged another division under howe himself moved against the rail fence the combat was a repetition of that which had taken place on the hill here the americans reserved their fire until the enemy were close then with their muskets resting on the rails they poured in a deadly fire and after in vain trying to stand their ground the troops fell back to the shore  captain wilson was standing with harold on copps hill watching the engagement  what beautiful order they go in harold said looking admiringly at the long lines of redcoated soldiers  it is very pretty captain wilson said sadly and may do in regular warfare but i tell you harold that sort of thing wont do here there is scarce a man carrying a gun behind those intrenchments who cannot with certainty hit a bullseye at one hundred and fifty yards it is simply murder taking the men up in regular order against such a foe sheltered by earthworks  at this moment the long line of fire darted out from the american intrenchments  look there captain wilson cried in a pained voice the front line is nearly swept away do you see them lying almost in an unbroken line on the hillside i tell you harold it is hopeless to look for success if we fight in this way the bravest men in the world could not stand such a fire as that  what will be done now harold asked as the men stood huddled upon the shore  they will try again captain wilson said look at the officers running about among them and getting them into order  in a quarter of an hour the british again advanced both toward the redoubt and the grass fence as before the americans withheld their fire and this time until the troops were far closer than before and the result was even more disastrous some of the grenadier and light infantry companies who led lost threefourths others ninetenths of their men again the british troops recoiled from that terrible fire general howe and his officers exerted themselves to the utmost to restore order when the troops again reached the shore and the men gallantly replied to their exhortations almost impossible as the task appeared they prepared to undertake it for the third time this time a small force only was directed to move against the grass fence while the main body under howe were to attack the redoubt on the hill  knapsacks were taken off and thrown down and each man nerved himself to conquer or die the ships in the harbor prepared the way by opening a heavy cannonade general clinton who was watching the battle from copps hill ran down to the shore rowed across the harbor and put himself at the head of two battalions then with loud cheers the troops again sprang up the ascent the american ammunition was running short many of the men not having more than three or four rounds left and this time they held their fire until the british troops were within twenty yards these had not fired a shot the order being that there was to be no pause but that the redoubt was to be carried with the bayonet for a moment they wavered when the deadly volley was poured in upon them then with a cheer they rushed at the intrenchments all those who first mounted were shot down by the defenders but the troops would not be denied and pouring over the earthworks leaped down upon the enemy  for a few minutes there was a handtohand fight the americans using the buttends of their muskets the english their bayonets the soldiers were exhausted with the climb up the hill and their exertions under a blazing sun and the great majority of the defenders of the redoubt were therefore enabled to retreat unharmed as fresh and active they were able to outrun their tired opponents and as the balls served out to the english fieldpieces were too large the artillery were unable to come into action  the colonists at the rail fence maintained their position against the small force sent against them till the main body at the redoubt had made their escape the british were unable to continue the pursuit beyond the isthmus  in the whole history of the british army there is no record of a more gallant feat than the capture of bunkers hill and few troops in the world would after two bloody repulses have moved up the third time to assail such a position defended by men so trained to the use of the rifle ten hundred and fiftyfour men or nearly half their number were killed and wounded among whom were 83 officers in few battles ever fought was the proportion of casualties to the number engaged so great the americans fought bravely but the extraordinary praise bestowed upon them for their valor appears misplaced their position was one of great strength and the absence of drill was of no consequence whatever in such an engagement they were perfectly sheltered from the enemys fire while engaged in calmly shooting him down and their loss up to the moment when the british rushed among them was altogether insignificant their casualties took place after the position was stormed and on their retreat along the peninsula and amounted in all to 145 killed and captured and 304 wounded it may be said that both sides fought well but from the circumstances under which they fought the highest credit is due to the victors  the battle however though won by the english was a moral triumph for the americans and the british parliament should at once have given up the contest it was from the first absolutely certain that the americans with their immense superiority in numbers could if they were only willing to fight hold their vast country against the british troops fighting with a base thousands of miles away the battle of bunkers hill showed that they were so willingthat they could fight sternly and bravely and this point once established it was little short of madness for the english government to continue the contest they had not even the excuse of desiring to wipe out the dishonor of a defeat their soldiers had won a brilliant victory and had fought with a determination and valor never exceeded and england could have afforded to say we will fight no more if you the inhabitants of a vast continent are determined to go alone are ready to give your lives rather than remain in connection with us go and prosper we acknowledge we cannot subdue a nation in arms  from the height of copps hill it could be seen that the british had suffered terribly captain wilson was full of enthusiasm when he saw the success of the last gallant charge of the english soldiers but he said to harold  it is a disastrous victory a few such battles as these and the english army in america would cease to exist  but although they were aware that the losses were heavy they were not prepared for the truth the long grass had hidden from view many of those who fell and when it was known that nearly half of those engaged were killed or wounded the feeling among the english was akin to consternation  the generalship of the british was wholly unworthy of the valor of the troops there would have been no difficulty in placing some of the vessels of light draught so far up the mystic as to outflank the intrenchments held by the colonists indeed the british troops might have been landed further up the mystic in which case the americans must have retreated instantly to avoid capture lastly the troops although fighting within a mile of their quarters were encumbered with three days provisions and their knapsacks constituting with their muskets and ammunition a load of 125 pounds this was indeed heavily handicapping men who had under a blazing sun to climb a steep hill with grass reaching to their knees and intersected by walls and fences  american writers describe the defenders of the position as inferior in numbers to the assailants but it is due to the english to say that their estimate of the number of the defenders of the intrenchments differs very widely from this general gage estimated them as being fully three times as numerous as the british troops it is probable that the truth lies between the two accounts  captain wilson returned with harold greatly dispirited to his house  the lookout is dreadfully bad he said to his wife after describing the events of the day so far as i can see there are but two alternativeseither peace or a long and destructive war with failure at its end it is even more hopeless trying to conquer a vast country like this defended by irregulars than if we had a trained and disciplined army to deal with in that case two or three signal victories might bring the war to a conclusion but fighting with irregulars a victory means nothing beyond so many of the enemy killed there are scarcely any cannon to take no stores or magazines to capture when the enemy is beaten he disperses moves off and in a couple of days gathers again in a fresh position the work has no end there are no fortresses to take no strategical positions to occupy no great roads to cut the enemy can march anywhere attack and disperse as he chooses scatter and reform when you have passed by it is like fighting the wind  well john since it seems so hopeless cannot you give it up is it too late  altogether too late mary and if i were free tomorrow i would volunteer my services again next day it is not any the less my duty to fight in my countrys cause because i believe the cause to be a losing one you must see that yourself dear if england had been sure to win without my aid i might have stood aloof it is because everyones help is needed that such services as i can render are due to her a country would be in a bad way whose sons were only ready to fight when their success was a certainty  the congress determined now to detach canada from the english side and prepared a force for the invasion of that colony where the british had but few regular troops  captain wilson was one morning summoned to headquarters on his return he called together four or five of the men best acquainted with the country these had been in their early days hunters or border scouts and knew every foot of the forest and lakes  i have just seen the general captain wilson said a royalist brought in news last night that the rebels are raising a force intended to act against montreal they reckon upon being joined by a considerable portion of the canadians among whom there is unfortunately a good deal of discontent we have but two regiments in the whole colony one of these is at quebec the rebels therefore will get the advantage of surprise and may raise the colony before we are in a condition to resist general howe asked me to take my company through the woods straight to montreal we should be landed a few miles up the coast at night i suppose some of you know the country well enough to be able to guide us  several of the men expressed their ability to act as guides  ive fought the injuns through them woods over and over again said one of them a sinewy weatherbeaten man of some sixty years old who was known as peter lambton he had for many years been a scout attached to the army and was one of the most experienced hunters on the frontier he was a tall angular man except that he stooped slightly the result of a habit of walking with the head bent forward in the attitude of listening the years which had passed over him had had no effect upon his figure he walked with a long noiseless tread like that of an indian and was one of the men attached to his company in whom wisely captain wilson had made no attempt to instill the very rudiments of drill it was the captain thought well that the younger men should have such a knowledge of drill as would enable them to perform simple maneuvers but the old hunters would fight in their own waya way infinitely better adapted for forest warfare than any that he could teach them peter and some of his companions were in receipt of small pensions which had been bestowed upon them for their services with the troops men of this kind were not likely to take any lively interest in the squabbles as to questions of taxation but when they found that it was coming to fighting they again offered their services to the government as a matter of course some were attached to the regular troops as scouts while others were divided among the newly raised companies of loyalists  peter lambton had for the last four years been settled at concord during the war with the french he had served as a scout with the regiment to which captain wilson belonged and had saved that officers life when with a portion of his company he was surrounded and cut off by hostile indians a strong feeling of friendship had sprung up between them and when four years before there had been a lull in the english fighting on the frontier peter had retired on his pension and the savings which he had made during his many years work as a hunter and had located himself in a cottage on captain wilsons estate it was the many tales told him by the hunter of his experiences in indian warfare that had fired harold with a desire for the life of a frontier hunter and had given him such a knowledge of forest life as had enabled him to throw off the indians from his trail on harolds return the old hunter had listened with extreme interest to the story of his adventures and had taken great pride in the manner in which he had utilized his teachings peter made his appearance in the city three days after the arrival of captain wilson there  i look upon this here affair as a favorable occurrence for harold he said to captain wilson the boy has lots of spirits but if it had not been for this he might have grown up a regular town greenhorn fit for nothing but to walk about in a long coat and to talk pleasant to women but this ll jest be the making of him with your permission cap ill take him under my charge and teach him to use his eyes and his ears and i reckon hell turn out as good an injun fighter as youll see on the frontier  but it is not indians that we are going to fight peter captain wilson said i heartily wish it was  it ll be the same thing peter said not here in course there ll be battles between the regulars and the colonists regular battles like that at quebec where both parties was fools enough to march about in the open and get shot down by hundreds i dont call that fighting thats jest killing and there aint no more sense in it than in two herd of buffalo charging each other on the prairie but there ll be plenty of real fightingexpeditions in the woods and injun skirmishes for youll be sure that the injunsll join in some on one side and some on the other it aint in their nature to sit still in their villages while powders being burned a few months of this work will make a man of him and he might have a worse teacher than peter lambton you jest hand him over to my care cap and ill teach him all i know of the ways of the woods and i tell yer there aint no better kind of edication for a young fellow he larns to use the senses god has given him to keep his head when another man would lose his presence of mind to have the eye of a hawk and the ear of a hound to get so that he scarcely knows what it is to be tired or hungry to be able to live while other men would starve to read the signs of the woods like a printed book and to be in every way a man and not a tailors figure  there is a great deal in what you say old friend captain wilson answered and such a training cannot but do a man good i wish with all my heart that it had been entirely with red foes that the fighting was to be done however that cannot be helped and as he is to fight he could not be in better hands than yours so long as we remain here i shall teach him what drill i can with the rest of the company but when we leave this town and the work really begins i shall put him in your charge to learn the duties of a scout  the young negro jake had also enlisted for throughout the war the negroes fought on both sides according to the politics of their masters there were only two other negroes in the company and captain wilson had some hesitation in enlisting them but they made good soldiers in the case of jake captain wilson knew that he was influenced in his wish to join solely by his affection for harold and the lads father felt that in the moment of danger the negro would be ready to lay down his life for him  there was great satisfaction in the band when they received news that they were at last about to take the field the long inaction had been most wearisome to them and they knew that any fighting that would take place round boston would be done by the regular troops food too was very scarce in town and they were heartily weary of the regular drill and discipline they were then in high spirits as they embarked on board the thetis sloopofwar and sailed from boston harbor  it was a pitiful parting between mrs wilson and her husband and son it had been arranged that she should sail for england in a ship that was leaving in the following week and should there stay with her husbands family from whom she had a warm invitation to make their home her own until the war was over  the thetis ran out to sea as soon as night fell her bow was turned to land again and about midnight the anchor was let fall near the shore some twenty miles north of boston the landing was quickly effected and with three days provisions in their knapsacks the little party started on their march  one of the scouts who had come from that neighborhood led them by paths which avoided all villages and farms at daybreak they bivouacked in a wood and at nightfall resumed the march by the next morning they had left the settlements behind and entered a belt of swamp and forest extending west to the st lawrence     chapter vi   scouting  a party of six men were seated around a fire in the forest which covered the slopes of the northern shore of lake champlain the spot had been chosen because a great tree had fallen bringing down several others in its course and opening a vista through which a view could be obtained of the surface of the lake the party consisted of peter lambton harold jake ephraim potter another old frontiersman and two indians  the company under captain wilson had made its way safely to the st lawrence after undergoing considerable hardships in the forest they had been obliged to depend entirely on what game they could shoot and such fish as they could catch in the rivers whose course they followed they had however reached montreal without loss and there they found that general carleton had in all about 500 regulars and about 200 volunteers who had recently been engaged  it was clear that if the people of canada were as hostile to the connection with england as were those of the other colonies the little force at the disposal of the english general could do nothing to defend the colony against the strong force which the americans were collecting for its invasion fortunately this was not the case although the canadians were of french descent and the province had been wrested by arms from france they for the most part preferred being under english rule to joining the insurgent colonies they had been in no way oppressed by england their property had been respected and above all things no attempt had ever been made to interfere with their religion in the new england provinces the hard puritan spirit of the early fathers had never ceased to prevail those who had fled from england to obtain freedom of worship had been intolerant persecutors of all religion different from their own the consequence was that the priests of canada were wholly opposed to any idea of union with the insurgent colonists their influence over the people was great and although these still objected to the english rule and would have readily taken up arms against it under other circumstances they had too little sympathy with the new englanders to join in their movement which if successful would have placed canada under the rule of the united states instead of that of england  the upper classes of canadians were almost to a man loyal to the english connection they had been well treated and enjoyed a greater state of independence than had been the case under french rule moreover they were for the most part descended from old french families and their sympathies were entirely opposed to popular insurrection thus when captain wilson and his party reached montreal they found that in spite of the paucity of english troops under the command of general carleton the position was not so bad as had been feared by general gage it was possible and indeed probable that upper canada might fall into the hands of the americans and that even quebec itself might be captured but unless the people joined the americans the success of the latter would be but temporary with the spring the navigation of the river would be open and reenforcements would arrive from england the invaders would then be at a disadvantage separated from home by a wide tract of forestcovered country they would have the greatest difficulty in transporting artillery ammunition and stores and fighting as an army in invasion they would be placed in a very different position to that occupied by the colonists fighting on their own ground it was probable that for a time the tide of invasion would succeed  the indians of the five nations as those dwelling near the british frontier at this point were called had volunteered their services to the general to cross the frontier to recapture ticonderoga and crown point which had been seized by the americans and to carry the war into the colonies but general carleton an exceedingly humane and kindhearted man shrank from the horrors that such a warfare would entail upon the colonists he accepted the services of the indians as far as the absolute defense of canada from invasion but refused to allow them to cross the frontier  on the arrival of captain wilson with his little force he was ordered to march at once to the fort of st johns which was held by a party of regular troops  on arriving at that place the two scouts had been sent down toward lake champlain to watch the proceedings of the enemy harold had obtained leave from his father to accompany the scouts and jake had been permitted to form one of the party peter lambton had grumbled a little at this last addition to the number he knew jakes affection for his young master and the great strength of the negro would have rendered him useful in a handtohand fight but he was altogether unaccustomed to forest work and his habit of bursting into fits of laughter on the smallest provocation as is the manner of his race enraged the scout to the last degree indeed he had not left the fort above an hour when he turned savagely on the negro  lookee here he said if thats the way yere agoing on the sooner ye turns yer face and tramps back to the fort the better when you were at concord it done no harm to make as much noise as a jackass braying whenever you opened that mouth of yours but it wont do in the forests it would cost us our har and your wool ef yer were to make that noise with the enemy anywhere within fifteen miles of yer i aint agoing if i knows it to risk my sculp on such a venture as this still less i aint agoing to see this young chaps life thrown away his father hez put him in my charge and i aint agoing to see him sacrificed in no such way so yeve got to make up yer mind yer have got to keep that mouth of yours shut tight or yerve got to tramp back to the fort  jake gave many promises of silence and although at first he often raised his voice to a point far exceeding that considered by the hunters safe in the woods he was each time checked by such a savage growl on the part of peter or by a punch in the ribs from harold that he quickly fell into the ways of the others and never spoke above a loud whisper  at a short distance from the fort they were joined by the two indians who were also out on a scouting expedition on their own account they had previously been well known both to peter and ephraim they were warriors of the seneca tribe one of the five nations they had now been for two days on the north shore of lake champlain they were sitting round a fire eating a portion of a deer which had been shot by harold that morning so far they had seen nothing of the enemy they knew that 3000 men under schuyler and montgomery had marched to the other end of the lake the colonists had been sending proclamations across the frontier to the inhabitants saying that they were coming as friends to free them from the yoke of england and calling upon them to arise and strike for freedom they were also in negotiation with some of the chiefs of the five nations and with other indian tribes to induce them to join with them  i propose peter said when the meal was finished and he had lighted his pipe to go down the lake and see what theyre doing deer tail here tells me that he knows where theres a canoe he harold and me will go and reconnoiter a bit the other three had best wait here till we comes back with news in course chief he continued to the other indian after explaining to him in his own language what he intended to do youll be guided by circumstancesyou can see a long way down the lake and ef anything should lead you to think that were in trouble you can take such steps as may seem best to you its mighty little i should think of the crowd of colonists but ef as you say a number of the warriors of the five nations indignant at the rejection of their offers by the english general have gone down and joined the colonists itll be a different affair altogether  the elk as the second seneca chief was called nodded his assent in a few words peter told harold what had been arranged jake looked downcast when he heard that he was not to accompany his master but as he saw the latter had since leaving the fort obeyed without questioning every suggestion of the scout he offered no remonstrance  a quarter of an hour later peter rose deer tail followed his example and harold at once took up his rifle and fell in in their steps there was but little talk in the woods and the matter having been settled it did not enter the mind either of peter or of the indian to say a word of adieu to their comrades harold imitated their example but gave a nod and a smile to jake as he started  half an hours tramp took them to the shore of the lake here they halted for a minute while the indian closely examined the locality with the wonderful power of making their way straight through the forest to the required spot which seems to be almost an instinct among indians deer tail had struck the lake within two hundred yards of the point which he aimed at he led the way along the shore until he came to a spot where a great maple had fallen into the lake here he turned into the forest again and in fifty yards came to a clump of bushes these he pushed aside and pointed to a canoe which was lying hidden among them peter joined him the two lifted the boat out placed it on their shoulders and carried it to the lake there were three paddles in it peter motioned harold to take his place in the stern and steer while he and the indian knelt forward and put their paddles in the water  keep her along on the right shore of the lake about fifty yards from the trees theres no fear of anyone lurking about near this end  the canoe was light and well made and darted quickly over the water under the strokes of the two paddlers it was late in the afternoon when they started and before they had gone many miles darkness had fallen the canoe was run in close to shore where she lay in the shadow of the trees until morning just as the sun rose the redskin and peter simultaneously dipped their paddles in the water and sent the canoe under the arches of the trees they had at the same instant caught sight of four canoes making their way along the lake  thems injuns peter whispered theyre scouting to see if the lakes free if the general could have got a couple of gunboats up the sorrel the enemy could never have crossed the lake and it would have given them a months work to take their guns round it its lucky we were well under the trees or we should have been seen what had we best do deer tail  for two or three minutes the scouts conversed together in the indian tongue  the seneca agrees with me peter said its like enough there are injuns scouting along both shores we must lay up here till nightfall ef were seen theyd signal by smoke and we should have them canoes back again in no time by their coming i expect the expedition is starting but it wont do to go back without being sure of it  the canoe was paddled to a spot where the bushes grew thickly by the bank it was pushed among these and the three after eating some cooked deers flesh which they had brought with them prepared to pass the day  the seneca and ill keep watch by turns the scout said well wake you if we want ye  harold was by this time sufficiently accustomed to the ways of the woods to obey orders at once without offering to take his turn at watching as his inclination led him to do and he was soon sound asleep it was late in the afternoon when he was awoke by the scout touching him  theres some critters coming along the bank he said in a whisper they aint likely to see us but its best to be ready  harold sat up in the canoe rifle in hand and listening intently heard a slight sound such as would be produced by the snapping of a twig presently he heard upon the other side of the bushes a few yards distant a few low words in the indian tongue he looked at his companions they were sitting immovable each with his rifle directed toward the sound and harold thought it would fare badly with any of the passers if they happened to take a fancy to peer through the bushes the indians had however no reason for supposing that there were any enemies upon the lake and they consequently passed on without examining more closely the thicket by the shore not until it was perfectly dark did peter give the sign for the continuance of the journey this time instead of skirting the lake the canoe was steered out toward its center for some time they paddled and then several lights were seen from ahead  i thought so the scout said theyve crossed to the isle la motte and theyre making as many fires as if they war having a sort of picnic at home we must wait till they burns out for we darent go near the place with the water lit up for two or three hundred yards round it wont be long for i reckon it must be past eleven oclock now  the fires were soon seen to burn down the paddles were dipped in the water and the canoe approached the island  id give something peter said to know whether theres any redskins there ef there are our chance of landing without being seen aint worth talking of ef there aint we might land a hull fleet at any rate we must risk it now harold the chief and mell land and find out how many men there are here and ef we can how long theyre likely to stop you keep the canoe about ten yards from shore in the shadow of the trees and be ready to move close the instant you hear my call ill jest give the croak of a frog the instant we get in you paddle off without a word ef ye hears any shouts and judges as how weve been seen ye must jest act upon the best of yer judgment  the boat glided noiselessly up to the shore all was still there the encampment being at the other side of the island the two scouts red and white stepped noiselessly on to the land harold backed the canoe a few paces with a quick stroke upon the paddle and seeing close to him a spot where a long branch of a tree dipped into the water he guided the canoe among the foliage and there sat without movement listening almost breathlessly  ere many minutes had elapsed he heard footsteps coming along the shore they stopped when near him three or four minutes passed without the slightest sound and then a voice said in tones which the speaker had evidently tried to lower but which were distinctly audible in the canoe  i tell yer redskin it seems to me as how youve brought us here on a fools errand i dont see no signs of a canoe and it aint likely that the british would be along the lake here seeing as how theres a score of canoes with your people in them scouting ahead  i heard canoe another voice said first at other end of the island and then coming along here  and ef yer did the first speaker said likely enough it was one of the canoes of your people  no the indian answered if canoe come back with news would have come straight to fires  well it aint here anyway the first speaker said and i dont believe yer ever heard a canoe at all its enough to make a man swear to be called up jest as we were making ourselves comfortable for the night on account of an injuns fancies i wonder at the generals listening to them however weve got our orders to go round the island and see ef theres any canoe on either shore so wed better be moving else we shall not get to sleep before morning  harold held his breath as the group passed opposite to him fortunately the trunk of the tree grew from the very edge of the water and there were several bushes growing round it so that at this point the men had to make a slight détour inland harold felt thankful indeed that he had taken the precaution of laying his canoe among the thick foliage for although the night was dark it would have been instantly seen had it been lying on the surface of the lake even as it was a close inspection might have detected it but the eyes of the party were fixed on the shore as it was there if at all that they expected to find an empty canoe lying  harold was uneasy at the discovery that there were still some redskins on the island it was possible of course that the one he had heard might be alone as a scout but it was more likely that others of the tribe were also there  after landing peter and the seneca made their way across the island to the side facing the american shore creeping cautiously along they found a large number of flatbottomed boats in which the americans had crossed from the mainland and which were peter thought capable of carrying 2000 men they now made their way toward the spot where the forces were encamped the fires had burned low but round a few of them men were still sitting and talking motioning to the seneca to remain quiet peter sauntered cautiously out on to the clearing where the camp was formed he had little fear of detection for he wore no uniform and his hunters dress afforded no index to the party to which he was attached  a great portion of the americans were still in their ordinary attire it having been impossible to furnish uniforms for so great a number of men as had been suddenly called to arms throughout the colonies  from the arbors of boughs which had been erected in all directions he judged that the force had been already some days upon the island but large numbers of men were sleeping in the open air and picking his way cautiously among them he threw himself down at a short distance from one of the fires by which three or four men were sitting  for some time they talked of camp matters the shortness of food and want of provisions  it is bad here one said presently it will be worse when we move forward schuyler will be here tomorrow with the rest of the army and we are to move down to isleauxnoix at the end of the lake and i suppose we shall land at once and march against st johns there are only a couple of hundred britishers there and we shall make short work of them  the sooner the better i say another speaker remarked i am ready enough to fight but i hate all this waiting about i want to get back to my farm again  you are in a hurry you are the other said you dont suppose we are going to take canada in a weeks time do you even if the canadians join us and by what i hear that aint so sartin after all we shall have to march down to quebec and thats no childs play i know the country there it is now september 4 another month and the winter will be upon us and a canadian winter is no joke i can tell you  the more reason for not wasting any more time the other one grumbled if montgomery had his way we should go at them quickly enough but schuyler is always delaying he has kept us waiting now since the 17th of last month we might have been halfway to quebec by this time  yes the other said if the britishers had run away as we came but we have got st johns and fort chamblée to deal with and they may hold out some time however the sooner we begin the job the sooner it will be over and i am heartily glad that we move tomorrow  peter had now obtained the information he required and rising to his feet again with a grumbling remark as to the hardness of the ground he sauntered away toward the spot where he had left the indian just as he did so a tall figure came out from an arbor close by a fire was burning just in front and peter saw that he was a tall and handsome man of about forty years of age he guessed at once that he was in the presence of the colonial leader  you are like myself the newcomer said unable to sleep i suppose  yes general peter answered i found i could not get off and so i thought id stretch my legs in the wood a bit theyre lying so tarnal thick down there by the fires one cant move without treading on em  which regiment do you belong to  the connecticut peter replied for he knew by report that a regiment from this province formed part of the expedition  as good men as any i have the general said cordially their only fault is that they are in too great a hurry to attack the enemy  i agree with the rest general peter said its dull work wasting our time here when were wanted at home i enlisted for six months and the sooner the times up the better say i  you have heard nothing moving the general asked one of the chippewas told me that he heard a canoe out in the lake ah here he is  at that moment five or six men headed by an indian issued from the wood close by it was too late for peter to try to withdraw but he stepped aside a pace or two as the party approached  well have you found anything the general asked  no find the chippewa said shortly  i dont believe as there ever was a canoe there the man who followed him said it was jest a fancy of the injuns  no fancy the indian asserted angrily canoe there no find  it might have been one of our own canoes montgomery said in a conciliatory tone the indians are seldom mistaken still if no one has landed it matters not either way  only as we have had a tramp for nothing the colonist said however theres time for a sleep yet hullo he exclaimed as his eye fell on peter lambton what peter why how did you get here why i thought as howgeneral he exclaimed sharply turning to montgomery this man lives close to me at concord hes a royalist he is and went into boston and joined the corps they got up there  seize him montgomery shouted but it was too late  as the man had turned to speak to the general peter darted into the wood the chippewa without waiting to hear the statement of the colonist at once divined the state of things and uttering his warwhoop dashed after the fugitive two or three of the colonists instantly followed and a moment later three or four indians who had been lying on the ground leaped up and darted like phantoms into the wood  the general no sooner grasped the facts than he shouted an order for pursuit and a number of the men most accustomed to frontier work at once followed the first party of pursuers others would have done the same but montgomery shouted that no more should go as they would only be in the others way and there could not be more than two or three spies on the island  after the chippewas first warcry there was silence for the space of a minute in the forest then came a wild scream mingled with another indian yell a moment later the leading pursuers came upon the body of the chippewa his skull had been cleft with a tomahawk and the scalp was gone  as they were clustered round the body two or three of the indians ran up they raised the indian wail as they saw their comrade and with the rest took up the pursuit  peter and the seneca were now far among the trees and as their pursuers had nothing to guide them they reached the spot where they had left the canoe unmolested  on the signal being given harold instantly paddled to the shore not a word was spoken until the canoe was well out in the lake occasional shots were heard on shore as the pursuers fired at objects which they thought were men presently a loud indian cry rose from the shore  they see us peter said were out of shot and can take it easy the redskin said a few words youre right chief the chief says he explained to harold that as there are redskins on the island they have probably some canoes the moons jest getting up beyond that hill and itll be light enough to see us half across the lake it would not matter if the water was free but what with injuns prowling along the shores and out on the lake we shall have to use our wits to save our har look he exclaimed two or three minutes later as two columns of bright flame at a short distance from them shot up at the end of the island theyre injun signals as far as they can be seen injuns will know that there are enemies on the lake now paddle your hardest harold and do you chief keep your eyes and your ears open for sights and sounds  under the steady strokes of the three paddles the bark canoe sped rapidly over the water when the moon was fairly above the edge of the hill they halted for a moment and looked back the two columns of fire still blazed brightly on the island which was now three miles astern and two dark spots could be seen on the water about halfway between them and it  you can paddle my lads peter lambton said to the distant foes but youll never ketch us i wouldnt heed you if it werent for the other varmint ahead  he stood up in the canoe and looked anxiously over the lake  its all clear as far as i can see at present he said  cant we land peter and make our way back on foot  bless you peter said there aint a native along the shore there but has got his eye on this canoe we might as well take her straight back to the island as try to land better for we should get a few hours before they tried and shot us there while the injuns would not give us a minute no we must just keep to the water and now paddle on again but take it quietly its no odds to let them varmints behind gain on us a little you neednt think about them when the danger comes we shall want every ounce of our strength   for half an hour they paddled steadily on the pursuing canoes were now less than a mile behind them  id give a good deal muttered the scout for a few black clouds over the moon wed make for shore then and risk it it will be getting daylight before long ah he exclaimed pausing suddenly as the chief stopped rowing a canoe on each side is rowing out to cut us off  harold was now paddling forward while the scout had the place at the stern the former was surprised to feel the canoe shooting off from its former course at right angles toward the shore then curving still more round they began to paddle back along the lake the canoes which had been pursuing them were nearly abreast of each other they had embarked from opposite sides of the island but they had been gradually drawing together although still some distance apart when peter turned his canoe seeing his maneuver both turned to head him off but by so doing they occupied an entirely different position in relation to each other one canoe being nearly half a mile nearer to them than the other  take it easy peter said these varmints will cut us off and weve got to fight but we can cripple the one nearest to us before the other comes up  the boats were now darting over the water in a line which promised to bring the leading canoe almost in collision with that of peter when within two hundred yards of each other peter ceased rowing  now he said harold see if you can pick one of them fellows off its no easy matter traveling at the pace they are you fire first  harold took a steady aim and fired a yell of derision told that he had missed the indians stopped paddling there was a flash and a ball struck the canoe at the same moment peter fired  theres one down he exclaimed  the seneca fired but without result and the three unwounded indians in the canoefor it had contained four menreplied with a volley  harold felt a burning sensation as if a hot iron passed across his arm  hit boy peter asked anxiously as he gave a short exclamation  nothing to speak of harold replied  the varmints are lying by waiting for the other canoe paddle straight at em  the indians at once turned the boat and paddled to meet their companions who were fast approaching  now peter exclaimed weve got em in a linea steady aim this time  the three rifles spoke out one of the indians fell into the boat and the paddle of another was struck from his grasp  now the scout shouted paddle away weve got em all fairly behind us  day broke just as they were again abreast of the island one canoe was following closely two others were a mile and a half behind while the one with which they had been engaged had made for the shore  what do you mean to do harold asked peter  i mean to run as close as i can round the end of the island and then make for the place where they must have embarked on the mainland they may have seen the signal fires there but will not know what has been going on so now row your best we must leave the others as far behind as possible  for the first time since they started the three paddlers exerted themselves to the utmost they had little fear that there were any more canoes on the island for had there been they would have joined in the chase it was only necessary to keep so far from the end of the island as would take them out of reach of the fire several shots were discharged as they passed but these fell short as the canoe shot along at its highest rate of speed every stroke taking it further from its nearest pursuer  at the end of an hours paddling this canoe was a mile and a half behind its rowers had apparently somewhat abated their speed in order to allow the other two boats to draw up to them for the result of the encounter between their comrades and the fugitives had not been of a nature to encourage them to undertake a singlehanded contest with them     chapter vii   in the forest  see peter harold exclaimed there is a whole fleet of boats ahead  i sees em peter said and have seed em for the last quarter of an hour its schuyler with the rest of what they calls their army steer a little out of the course we must pass close by em they wont suspect nothing wrong and will suppose we are merely carrying a message  in half an hour they were abreast of the flotilla consisting of flatboats laden with troops with them were two or three indian canoes peter steered so as to pass at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards they rowed less strongly now but still vigorously there was a shout from the boat  all well on the island  all well peter shouted back waving his hand and without further word the canoe passed on there do you hear that peter exclaimed theyre firing shots from the canoes to call their attention the chances are they wont hear them for the rattle of their oars and the talking and the row theyre making are enough to drown the sound of a cannon now put it on again as hard as you can another hour will take us to the landing place  they could see when the flotilla came up to the pursuing boats that the canoes which accompanied it turned their heads and joined in the pursuit but they were now near three miles ahead and there was no chance whatever of their being overtaken they slackened their speed slightly as they approached the land and rowed up to the landing place without any signs of extraordinary haste a few men were loitering about  whats the news from the island one asked as they landed  all well there peter said  did you see anything of schuyler  yes we met him about halfway across  what have you come for  general montgomery says that no spare flints have been sent over for the firelocks  ill swear that some went one of the men exclaimed for i packed a sack of them myself in one of the boats  i spose they have been mislaid peter said perhaps some of the stores have got heaped over em ef you are quite sartin we have had our journey for nothing  as sartin as life the man replied ill swear to the sackful of flints and tarnation heavy they was too  well then i need not trouble about it further peter said well take a rest and paddle back in an hour or two was there any marks on the sack so as i may tell the general how to look for it  marks the man repeated why it had flints written on it in big black letters six inches long it must turn up anyhow theyll find it when they come to shift the stores  then accompanied by his two companions peter strolled quietly through the little village stopping at a small store he purchased some flour and tea then he followed the road inland and was soon out of sight of the village he stopped for a moment and then shook his head  its no use trying to hide our trail here he said the roads an inch thick in dust and do what we will theyll be able to see where we turn off its our legs as we have got to trust to for a bit weve got a good half hours start of the canoes they were a long three miles behind when we struck the shore  leaving the road he led the way with a long swinging stride across the cultivated land twenty minutes walk took them into the forest which extended from the shore of the lake many miles inland  take off your boots harold he said as he entered the wood them heels will leave marks that a redskin could pick up at a run now tread as near as you can in the exact spot where the seneca has trodden before you hell follow in my track and you may be sure that ill choose the hardest bits of ground i can come across there the varmints are on shore  as he spoke an angry yell rose from the distant village at a long steady pace which taxed to the utmost harolds powers as a walker they kept their way through the woods not pursuing a straight course but turning winding and zigzagging every few minutes harold could not but feel impatient at what seemed to him such a loss of time especially when a yell from the edge of the wood told that the indians had traced them thus farshowed too that they were far nearer than before but as peter afterward explained to him all this turning and winding made it necessary for the indians to follow every step as they would an animal to guess the direction they had taken the weather had been dry and the ground was hard therefore the most experienced trapper would be obliged to proceed very slowly on the trail and would frequently be for a time at fault whereas had they continued in a straight line the indians could have followed at a run contenting themselves with seeing the trail here and there they came across two or three little streams running down toward the lake these they followed in some cases up in others down for a considerable distance leaving the bed where the bushes grew thick and hid the marks of their feet as they stepped out from the water harold would gladly have gone at a run but peter never quickened his pace he knew that the indians could not pick up the trail at a rate faster than that at which they were going and that great delay would be caused at each of the little streams as it would be uncertain whether they had passed up or down  as the time passed the indian yells which had when they first entered the wood sounded so alarmingly near died away and a perfect stillness reigned in the forest it was late in the afternoon before peter halted  we can rest now he said itll be hours before the critters can be here now let us have some tea  he began to look for some dried sticks harold offered to assist  you sit down the scout said a nice sort of fire we should get with sticks of your picking up why we should have a smoke that would bring all the injuns in the woods on to us no the sticks as the seneca and mell pick up wont give as much smoke as you can put in a teacup but i wouldnt risk even that if we was nigh the lake for it might be seen by any redskins out in a canoe but we are miles back from the lake and there aint no other open space where they could get a view over the treetops  harold watched the indian and the scout collecting dry leaves and sticks and took particular notice for future use of the kinds which they selected a light was struck with a flint and steel and soon a bright blaze sprang up without so far as harold could see the slightest smoke being given off then the hunter produced some food from his wallet and a tin pot he had at the last spring they passed filled a skin which hung on his shoulder with water and this was soon boiling over the fire a handful of tea was thrown in and the pot removed some flour mixed with water was placed on a small iron plate which was put on the redhot ashes a few cakes were baked and with these the cold venison and the tea an ample meal was made  after nearly an hours halt they again proceeded on their way a consultation had taken place between peter and the seneca as to the best course to be pursued they could without much difficulty or risk have continued the way through the woods beyond the lake but it was important that they should reach the other side by the evening of the following day to give warning of the intended attack by the americans there were they knew other redskins in the woods besides those on their trail and the nearer they approached the shore the greater the danger they had determined that they would at all hazards endeavor to obtain another canoe and cross the lake until nightfall they continued their course and then knowing that their trail could no longer be followed they made down to the lake they were many miles distant from it and harold was completely worn out when at last he saw a gleam of water through the trees he was not yet to rest entering the lake they began wading through it at a few feet from the edge  after an hours walking thus they entered the bushes which thickly covered the shore and made their way through these until they came to a spot sufficiently open for them to lie down and harold wrapping himself in the blanket which he carried over his shoulder was sound asleep in less than a minute when he woke the sun was shining brightly  get up youngster were in luck the scout said heres a canoe with two of the varmints making toward the shore by the way theyre going theyll land not far off  the scout led the way crawling on his hands and knees to the waters edge to where the seneca was sitting watching the canoe through a cover of green leaves the course that the boat was taking would lead it to a point some three hundred yards from where they were sitting  we shall have no difficulty in managing them harold said and grasped his rifle eagerly  not too fast peter said the chances are that the varmints have friends on shore like enough they have been out fishing  the shore formed a slight sweep at this point and the bushes in which they were hidden occupied the point at one extremity in the center of the little bay there was a spot clear from bushes to this the canoe was directed as it approached the shore two other indians appeared at the waters edge one of them asked a question and in reply a paddler held up a large bunch of fish  just as i thought like enough there are a dozen of them there said peter  on reaching the shore the men sprang out taking their fish with them the canoe was fastened by its headrope to the bushes and the indians moved a short distance inland  there is their smoke peter said indicating a point some thirty feet from the lake but so slight was it that even when it was pointed out to him harold could hardly make out the light mist rising from among the bushes presently he looked round for the seneca but the indian had disappeared  hes gone scouting peter said in answer to harolds question ef there are only four of them it would be an easy job but i expect theres more of the red varmints there  in ten minutes the seneca returned as noiselessly as he had gone he opened his hand and all the fingers twice the third time he showed only three fingers  thirteen peter said too many of them even for a sudden onslaught  the indian said a few words to peter the latter nodded and deer tail again quietly stole away  hes going to steal the boat peter said its a risky job for where it lies it can be seen by em as they sit now you and me must be ready with our shooting irons to cover him if need be ef hes found out before he gets the boat hell take to the woods and lead them away from us but ef hes fairly in the boat then we must do our best for him ef the wust comes to the wust i reckon we can hold these bushes agin em for some time but in the end i dont disguise from ye youngster theyll beat us  harold now sat intently watching the canoe it seemed an age to him before he saw a hand emerge from the bushes and take hold of the headrope the motion given to the canoe was so slight as to be almost imperceptible it seemed as if it was only drifting gently before the slight breeze which was creeping over the surface of the lake half its length had disappeared from the open space when an indian appeared by the edge of the water he looked at the canoe looked over the lake and withdrew again the hand had disappeared in the bushes on his approach the movement of the canoe slight as it was had caught his eye but satisfied that it was caused only by the wind he had returned to his fire again the hand appeared again through the bushes and the canoe was drawn along until hidden from the sight of those sitting by the fire again the watchful indian appeared but the boat was lying quietly by the bushes at the full length of its headrope he stooped down to see that this was securely fastened and again retired harold held his breath expecting that every moment the presence of the seneca would be discovered scarcely had the indian disappeared than the seneca crawled out from the bushes with a sweep of his knife he cut the rope of the canoe and noiselessly entered it and as he did so gave a shove with his foot which sent it dancing along the shore toward the spot where harold and his companion were hidden then he seized the paddle and in half a dozen strokes brought it within reach of them harold and peter stepped into it as they did so there was a sudden shout the indian had again strolled down to look at the canoe whose movements slight as they had been had appeared suspicious to him he now to his astonishment saw it at the point with two white men and an indian on board he had left his gun behind him and uttering his warcry bounded back for it  round the pint quick peter exclaimed theyll riddle us in the open  two strokes took the canoe round the projecting point of bushes and she then darted along the shore driven by the greatest efforts of which the three paddlers were capable had the shore been open the indians would have gained upon them but they were unable to force their way through the thick bushes at anything like the rate at which the canoe was flying over the water the first start was upward of a hundred yards and this was increased by fifty before the indians arriving at the point opened fire the distance was beyond anything like an accurate range with indian guns several bullets struck the water round the canoe  now steer out peter said as the firing suddenly ceased theyre making a détour among the bushes and ll come down ahead of us if we keep near the shore  two or three more shots were fired but without effect and the canoe soon left the shore far behind  now peter said i think were safe its not likely theyve another canoe anywhere near on this side as most of em would have gone with the expedition ef the firing has been heard it will not attract much attention being on this side and i see nothing in the way of a boat out in the lake still these redskins eyes can see most any distance now chief he went on to the indian in his native language the young un and ill lie down at the bottom of the boat do you paddle quietly and easily as ef you were fishing the canoe with a single indian in it will excite no suspicion and even ef you see other canoes you had better keep on in that way unless you see that any of em are intending to overhaul you  the chief nodded assent peter and harold stretched themselves at full length in the canoe and the indian paddled quietly and steadily on for an hour not a word was spoken in the canoe harold several times dozed off to sleep at last the seneca spoke  many boats out on wateramerican army  harold was about to raise his head to look out when peter exclaimed lie close harold ef a head were shown now it would be wuss than ef we had sat up all the time we know there are injun canoes with the flats and they may be watching us now we may be a long way off but theres no saying how far a redskins eyes can carry can you see where they are going to chief he asked the seneca are they heading for isleauxnoix as we heard em say they were going to do  the seneca nodded  going to island  then peter said the sooner were across the lake the better  the seneca again spoke and after a consultation with peter laid in his paddle  what is he doing now harold asked  our coarse lies pretty near the same way as theirs peter said the island is but a short distance from the shore near the mouth of the sorrel so where were going would take us right across their line we fooled them yesterday but are not likely to do it again today so the chief has stopped paddling and makes as if he were fishing i doubt whether it will succeed for he would hardly be fishing so far out but well soon see its better so than to turn and paddle in any other direction as that would be sure to excite their suspicions  the fleet of boats had already passed the spot where the canoe would have crossed had she been going directly across the lake when she was first seen and was therefore now ahead of it the great flotilla kept on as if the canoe with its single occupant in its rear had not excited suspicion the seneca however knew that sharp eyes must be upon him the manner in which the canoe had baffled pursuit the day before must have inflicted a severe blow upon the pride of the indians and although having driven them off the lake they could have no reason for suspecting that their foes could have obtained a fresh canoe the seneca knew that their vigilance would not sleep for a moment therefore although bending over the side of the canoe as if watching his lines his eyes were never off the boats  there are canoes making for the shore both ways he said at last it is time that my white brother should take the paddle  peter and harold at once sat up in the boat and looked round the lake which at this point was about ten miles wide the canoe was four miles from the eastern side the flotilla was a mile further up the lake and the same distance nearer to the western shore four or five canoes were detaching themselves from the flotilla apparently rowing direct for the shore it would have been easy for the canoe to have regained the eastern side long before she could have been cut off but here they might find the chippewas the indians whose boat they had taken would assuredly follow along the shores of the lake in hopes that something might occur to drive them back besides had they landed there they would be unable to carry in time the news of the approaching attack upon st johns for the same reason it was important to land up the lake near the canadian end  peter rapidly took in the situation he saw that it was possible and only just possible to reach the shore at a point opposite to that at which they now were before the hostile canoes could cut them off from it if they headed them there they would be obliged to run down to the other end of the lake before effecting a landing while he could not calculate on being able to beat all the canoes most of which carried four paddlers who would strain every nerve to retrieve their failure of the previous day  not a word was spoken as the boat darted through the water harold unaccustomed to judge distances could form no idea whether the distant canoes would or would not intercept them at present both seemed to him to be running toward the shore on nearly parallel courses and the shorter distance that the indians would have to row seemed to place them far ahead the courses however were not parallel as the indians were gradually turning their canoes to intercept the course of that which they were pursuing as the minutes went by and the boats converged more and more toward the same point harold saw how close the race would be after twenty minutes hard paddling the boats were within a quarter of a mile of each other and the courses which they were respectively taking seemed likely to bring them together at about a quarter of a mile from the shore there were three indian canoes and these kept well together so close did the race appear that harold expected every moment to see peter sweep the head of the canoe round and make a stern chase of it by running down the lake this peter had no intention of doing the canoes he saw traveled as fast as his own and could each spare a man to fire occasionally while he and his companions would be obliged to continue paddling better accustomed to judge distances than harold he was sure at the speed at which they were going he would be able to pass somewhat ahead of his foes  row all you know harold he said now chief send her along  harold had been rowing to the utmost of his strength but he felt by the way the canoe quivered at every stroke that his companions were only now putting out their extreme strength the boat seemed to fly through the water and he began to think for the first time that the canoe would pass ahead of their pursuers the latter were clearly also conscious of the fact for they now turned their boats heads more toward the shore so that the spot where the lines would meet would be close to the shore itself the canoes were now within two hundred yards of each other the indians were nearer to the shore but the oblique line that they were following would give them about an equal distance to row to the point for which both were making harold could not see that there was the slightest difference in the rate at which they were traveling it seemed to him that the four canoes would all arrive precisely at the same moment at the land which was now some five or six hundred yards distant  another two minutes paddling and when the canoes were but seventy or eighty yards apart peter with a sweep with his paddle turned the boats head nearly half round and made obliquely for the shore so throwing his pursuers almost astern of him the shore was but three hundred yards distant they were but fifty ahead of their pursuers the latter gave a loud yell at seeing the change in the position in the chase they had of course foreseen the possibility of such a movement but had been powerless to prevent it but they were prepared for on the instant one man in each canoe dropped his paddle and standing up fired it is a difficult thing to take aim when standing in a canoe dancing under the vigorous strokes of three paddlers it was the more difficult since the canoes were at the moment sweeping round to follow the movement of the chase the three balls whistled closely round the canoe but no one was hit  the loss of three paddlers for even so short a time checked the pace of the canoes the indians saw that they could not hope to overtake their foes whose canoe was now but a few lengths from shore they dropped their paddles and each man seized his rifle another moment and the nine pieces would have poured their fire into the canoe about fifty yards ahead of them when from the bushes on the shore three puffs of smoke shot out and three of the indians fell one of them upsetting his boat in his fall a yell of surprise and dismay broke from them the guns were thrown down the paddles grasped again and the heads of the canoes turned from the shore the indians in the overturned boat did not wait to right it but scrambled into the other canoes and both were soon paddling at the top of their speed from the shore not without further damage for the guns in the bushes again spoke out and peter and the seneca added their fire the instant they leaped from the boat to shore and another of the indians was seen to fall harold was too breathless when he reached the bank to be able to fire he raised his gun but his hands trembled with the exertion that he had undergone and the beating of his heart and his short panting breath rendered it impossible for him to take a steady aim a minute later jake burst his way through the bushes  ah massa harold he exclaimed bress de lord dat we was here what a fright you hab giben me to be sure we hab been watching you for a long time ephraim and de redskin dey say dey saw little spot far out on lake behind all dose boats den dey say other boats set off in chase for a long time jake see nothing about dat but at last he see dem den we hurry along de shore so as to get near de place to where de boats row ebery moment me tink dat dey catch you up ephraim say no bery close thing but he tink you come along first but dat we must shoot when dey come close we stand watch for some time den ephraim say dat you no able to get to dat point you hab to turn along de shore so we change our place and run along and sure nough de boats head turns and you come along in front of us den we all shoot and the redskins dey tumble over  well jake it is fortunate indeed that you were on the spot for they could scarcely have missed all of us besides even if we had got to shore safely they would have followed us and the odds against us would have been heavy  that ar war a close shave peter ephraim said an allfired close shave i call it  it war ephraim and no mistake  why didnt yer head down along the lake  because i got news that the colonists air going to attack st johns tomorrow and i want to get to the fort in time to put em on their guard besides both sides of the lake are sure to be full of hostile injuns those canoes paddled as fast as we did and in the long run might have worn us out  did you have a fight on the lake two nights ago me and the redskin thought we heard firing  we had a skirmish with em peter said a pretty sharp shave it war too but we managed to slip away from them altogether weve had some mighty close work i can tell yer and i thought more than once as we were going to be wiped out  while they were speaking the men had already started at a steady pace through the woods away from the lake having first drawn up the canoe and carefully concealed it  it was late at night when they reached fort st john a message was at once dispatched to a party of the senecas who were at their village about sixteen miles away they arrived in the morning and together with a portion of the garrison moved out and took their place in the wooded and marshy ground between the fort and the river scouts were sent along the sorrel and these returned about one oclock saying that a large number of boats were coming down the lake from isleauxnoix it had been determined to allow the colonists to land without resistance as the commander of the fort felt no doubt of his ability with the assistance of his indian allies to repulse their attack some twelve hundred men were landed and these at once began to advance toward the fort lead by their two generals schuyler and montgomery scarcely had they entered the swamp when from every bush a fire was opened upon them the invaders were staggered but pushed forward in a weak and undecided way as far as a creek which intercepted their path in vain general montgomery endeavored to encourage them to advance they wavered and soon began to fall back and in an hour from the time of their landing they were again gathered on the bank of the river here they threw up a breastwork and as his numbers were greatly inferior the british officer in command thought it unadvisable to attack them after nightfall the colonists took to their boats and returned to isleauxnoix their loss in this their first attempt at the invasion of canada being nine men  a day or two later the indians again attempted to induce general carleton to permit them to cross the frontier and carry the war into the american settlements and upon the generals renewed refusal they left the camp in anger and remained from that time altogether aloof from the contest  st johns was now left with only its own small garrison captain wilson was ordered to fall back with his company to montreal it being considered that the garrison of st johns was sufficient to defend that place for a considerable time as soon as the indians had marched away having sent word to the colonists that they should take no further part in the fight montgomerywho was now in command schuyler having fallen sicklanded the whole of the force and invested the fort an american officer ethan allen had been sent with a party to try to raise the colonists in rebellion in the neighborhood of chamblée he had with him 30 americans and was joined by 80 canadians dazzled by the success which had attended the surprise of ticonderoga he thought to repeat the stroke by the conquest of montreal he crossed the river in the night about three miles below the city peter and some other scouts who had been watching his movements crossed higher up and brought the news and 36 men of the twentysixth regiment captain wilsons company and 200 or 300 loyal canadians the whole under the command of major campbell attacked ethan allen he was speedily routed and with 38 of his men taken prisoner the siege of st johns made but little progress the place was well provisioned and the americans encamped in the low swampy ground around it suffered much from ill health the men were mutinous and insolent the officers incapable and disobedient so far the invasion of canada of which such great things had been hoped by the americans appeared likely to turn out a complete failure     chapter viii   quebec  general carleton seeing that montgomerys whole force was retained idle before st johns began to hope that the winter would come to his assistance before the invaders had made any serious progress unfortunately he had not reckoned on the utter incapacity of the officer in command of fort chamblée major stopford of the seventh regiment had 160 men and a few artillerymen and the fort was strong and well provided with provisions american spies had found the inhabitants around the place favorable to the americans major brown was sent down by montgomery with a small detachment and being joined by the inhabitants sat down before the fort they had only two sixpounders and could have effected nothing had the fort been commanded by a man of bravery and resources such was not the character of its commander who after a siege of only a day and a half surrendered the place with all its stores which were of inestimable value to the invaders who were upon the edge of giving up the siege of the fort their ammunition being entirely exhausted but the six tons of gunpowder the seventeen cannon mortars and muskets which fell into their hands enabled them to carry on the siege of st johns with renewed vigor there was no excuse whatever for the conduct of major stopford in allowing these stores to fall into the hands of the americans as even had he not possessed the courage to defend the fort he might before surrendering have thrown the whole of the ammunition into the river upon which there was a safe sallyport where he could have carried on the operation entirely unmolested by the enemy the colors of the seventh regiment were captured and sent to congress as the first trophy of the war  the siege of st johns was now pushed on by montgomery with vigor colonel maclean with 800 indians and canadians attempted to relieve it crossing the st lawrence in small boats on nearing the other bank they were received by so heavy a fire by the americans posted there that they were obliged to retire without effecting a landing provisions and ammunition were now running short in st johns there was no hope whatever of relief from the outside and the officer commanding was therefore obliged to surrender on november 14 after a gallant defense  as there were only some fifty or sixty regulars in montreal general carleton was unable to defend that town and upon the news of the fall of st johns he at once retired to quebec and montreal was occupied by the americans in the meantime another expedition had been dispatched by the americans under arnold this officer with 1500 men had started for quebec from a point 130 miles north of boston suffering enormous fatigue and hardship the force made its way up the river past rapids cataracts and through swamps they dragged and carried their boats and stores they followed the bed of the river up to its source and then crossing the watershed descended the chaudière and duloup rivers on to the st lawrence within a few miles of quebec  this was a wonderful marchone scarcely equaled in the annals of military history crossing the st lawrence in canoes arnold encamped with his little force upon the heights of abraham such a daring attempt could not have been undertaken had not the americans been aware of the extreme weakness of the garrison at quebec which consisted only of 50 men of the seventh regiment 240 of the canadian militia a battalion of seamen from the shipsofwar under the command of captain hamilton of the lizard 250 strong and the colonial volunteers under colonel maclean  the fortifications were in a ruinous condition it was fortunate that colonel maclean who had come from the sorrel upon the surrender of st johns by forced marches arrived on the very day on which arnold appeared before the city directly he arrived arnold attacked the city at the gate of st louis but was sharply repulsed he then desisted from active operations and awaited the arrival of montgomery who was marching down from montreal the flotilla in which carleton was descending the river was attacked by the americans who came down the sorrel and was captured with all the troops and military stores which it was bringing down general carleton himself escaped in a small boat under cover of night and reached quebec  captain wilsons company had been attached to the command of colonel maclean and with it arrived in quebec in safety  upon the arrival of montgomery with his army the city was summoned to surrender a strong party in the town were favorable to the invaders but general carleton treated the summons with contempt and turned all the inhabitants who refused to join in the defense of the city outside the town  the winter had now set in in earnest and the difficulties of the besiegers were great arnolds force had been much weakened by the hardships that they had undergone montgomerys by desertions the batteries which they erected were overpowered by the fire of the defenders and the siege made no progress whatever the men became more and more disaffected and mutinous many of them had nearly served the time for which they had enlisted and montgomery feared that they would leave him when their engagement came to an end he in vain tempted the besieged to make a sally carleton was so certain that success would come by waiting that he refused to allow himself to hazard it by a sortie  the weather was fighting for him and the besiegers had before them only the alternatives of taking the place by storm or abandoning the siege altogether they resolved upon a storm it was to take place at daybreak on december 31 montgomery determined to make four attackstwo false and two real ones colonel james livingstone with 200 canadians was to appear before st johns gate and a party under colonel brown were to feign a movement against the upper town and from high ground there were to send up rockets as the signal for the real attacks to commencethat led by montgomery from the south and that under arnold from the northwestboth against the lower town  the false attacks were made too soon the rockets being fired half an hour before the main columns reached their place of attack the british were not deceived but judging these attacks to be feints left but a small party to oppose them and marched the bulk of their forces down toward the lower town their assistance however came too late for before they arrived the fate of the attack was already decided the americans advanced under circumstances of great difficulty a furious wind with cutting hail blew in their faces the ground was slippery and covered with snow  half an hour before the english supports arrived on the spot montgomery with his leading company reached the first barricade which was undefended passing through this they pressed on toward the next the road leading to it was only wide enough for five or six persons abreast on one side was the river on the other a steep cliff in front was a log hut with loopholes for musketry and a battery of two threepounders it was held by a party of 30 canadians and 8 militiamen under john coffin with 9 sailors under bairnsfeather the captain of the transport to work the guns montgomery with 60 men pushed on at a run to carry the battery but when within fifty yards bairnsfeather discharged his pieces which were loaded with grapeshot with deadly aim montgomery his aiddecamp macpherson lieutenant cheeseman and 10 others fell dead at the first discharge and with them the soul of the expedition fled the remaining officers endeavored to get the men to advance but none would do so and they fell back without losing another man so completely cowed were they that they would not even carry off the bodies of their general and his companions these were brought into quebec next day and buried with the honors of war by the garrison  the force under arnold was far stronger than that under montgomery the canadian guard appointed to defend the first barrier fled at the approach but the small body of sailors fought bravely and were all killed or wounded arnold was shot through the leg and disabled morgan who commanded the advanced companies led his men on and carried the second barrier after an obstinate resistance they were attacking the third when maclean with his men from the upper town arrived the british then took the offensive and drove the enemy back and a party going round fell upon their rear fifty were killed in arnolds column 400 taken prisoners and the rest retreated in extreme disorder  thus ended the assault upon quebecan assault which was all but hopeless from the first but in which americans showed but little valor and determination in fact throughout the war it may be said that the americans when fighting on the defensive behind trees and intrenchments fought stubbornly but that they were feeble in attack and wholly incapable of standing against british troops in the open  it would now have been easy for carleton to have sallied out and taken the offensive but he preferred holding quebec quietly he might have easily driven the americans from their position before the walls but with the handful of troops under his orders he could have done nothing toward carrying on a serious campaign in the open  until spring came and the rivers were opened no reenforcements could reach him from england while the americans could send any number of troops into canada carleton therefore preferred to wait quietly within the walls of quebec allowing the winter hardships and disunion to work their natural effects upon the invaders  arnold sent to washington to demand 10000 more troops with siege artillery several regiments were sent forward but artillery could not be spared eight regiments entered canada but they found that instead of meeting as they had expected an enthusiastic reception from the inhabitants the population was now hostile to them the exactions of the invading army had been great and the feeling in favor of the english was now all but universal  on may 5 two frigates and a sloopofwar made their way up the river to quebec the americans endeavored to embark their sick and artillery above the town reenforced by the marines the garrison sallied out and attacked the enemy who fled with precipitation leaving their provisions cannon five hundred muskets and two hundred sick behind them the british pursued them until they reached the mouth of the sorrel  the arrival of the fleet from england brought news of what had taken place since captain wilsons company had marched from boston a short time after the battle of bunkers hill immediately after the battle the colonists had sent two deputies penn and lee with a petition to parliament for the restoration of peace this petition was supported by a strong body in parliament the majority however argued that from the conduct of the americans it was clear that they aimed at unconditional unqualified and total independence in all their proceedings they had behaved as if entirely separated from great britain their professions and petition breathed peace and moderation their actions and preparations denoted war and defiance every attempt that could be made to soften their hostility had been in vain their obstinacy was inflexible and the more england had given in to their wishes the more insolent and overbearing had their demands become the stamp tax had been repealed but their ill will had grown rather than abated the taxations on imports had been entirely taken off save on one small item but rather than pay this they had accumulated arms and ammunition seized cannon belonging to the king and everywhere prepared for armed resistance only two alternatives remained for the british nation to adopteither to coerce the colonists to submission or to grant them their entire independence  these arguments were well founded the concessions which had been made had but encouraged the colonists to demand more no good whatever would have come from entering into negotiation there remained but the two alternatives it would have been far better had parliament instead of deciding on coercion withdrawn altogether from the colonies for although hitherto the americans had shown no great fighting qualities it was clear that so small an army as england could spare could not permanently keep down so vast a country if the people were determined upon independence they might win every battlemight overpower every considerable force gathered against thembut they could only enforce the kings authority over a mere fractional portion of so great an area england however was unaccustomed to defeat her spirit in those days was proud and high and by a large majority parliament voted for the continuance of the war the next step taken was one unworthy of the country it tended still further to embitter the war and it added to the strength of the party in favor of the colonists at home attempts were made by the government to obtain the services of large numbers of foreign troops negotiations were entered into with russia holland hesse and other countries most of these proved ineffectual but a considerable number of troops was obtained from hesse  the news of these proceedings excited the americans to renewed efforts the force under washington was strengthened and he took possession of dorchester heights commanding the town of boston a heavy cannonade was opened on the city the british guns answered it but the american position gave them an immense advantage general howe who was in command at first thought of attempting to storm the heights but the tremendous loss sustained at the battle of bunkers hill deterred him from the undertaking his supineness during the past four months had virtually lost the american colonies to england he had under his command 8000 troops who could have routed with ease the undisciplined levies of washington instead of leading his men out against the enemy he had suffered them to be cooped up for months in the city and had failed to take possession of the various heights commanding the town had he done this boston might have resisted a force many times as strong as that which advanced against it and there was now nothing left for the english but to storm the heights with enormous loss or to evacuate the city  the first was the alternative which had been chosen when the americans seized bunkers hill the second was that which was now adopted  having adopted this resolution howe carried it out in a manner which would in itself be sufficient to condemn him as a military leader nothing was done to destroy the vast stores of arms and ammunition and two hundred and fifty pieces of cannon were left for the colonists to use against england no steps were taken to warn ships arriving from england of the surrender of the town the consequence was that in addition to the vast amount of stores captured in the town numbers of the british storeships fell into the hands of the americansamong them a vessel which in addition to carbines bayonets guncarriages and other stores had on board more than seventy tons of powder while washingtons whole stock was all but exhausted  but worse even than this hurried and unnecessary abandonment of vast munitions of war was the desertion of the loyalist population boston was full of loyalists among whom were many of the wealthier and betterborn persons in the colony who from the commencement of the troubles had left their homes their fortunes and their families to rally round the standard of their sovereign the very least that howe could have done for these loyal men would have been to have entered into some terms of capitulation with washington whereby they might have been permitted to depart to their homes and to the enjoyment of their property nothing of the sort was attempted and the only choice offered to a loyalist was to remain in the town exposed to certain insult and ill treatment perhaps to death at the hands of the rebels or to leave in the transports for england or halifax and to be landed here penniless and starving  howes conduct in this was on a piece with his behavior throughout the campaign but he was little if at all inferior to the other generals who vied with each other in incapacity and folly never in the whole history of england were her troops led by men so inefficient so sluggish and so incapable as those who commanded her armies in the american revolutionary war  the first ships from england which arrived at quebec were followed a few days later by the niger and triton convoy transports with troops the british now took the offensive in earnest from the west captain forster marched from detroit with 40 men of the eighth regiment 100 canadians and some indians against a pass called the cedars situated fifteen leagues above montreal this was held by 400 men with two cannon as soon as the british force opened fire the americans surrendered the following day forsters force advancing came upon 140 men under major sherbourne who were marching to reenforce the garrison at the cedars these were forced to retreat and 100 of them taken prisoners  arnold with 700 men advanced against the british force the british officer fearing that in case of an attack the indians with him might massacre the prisoners released the whole of them 474 in number under the promise that an equal number of british prisoners should be returned this engagement was shamefully broken by the americans who raised a number of frivolous excuses among others that prisoners taken by the british were ill treatedan accusation which excited the indignation of the prisoners themselves some of whom wrote to members of congress stating that nothing could be kinder or more courteous than the treatment which they received  while forster was advancing toward montreal from the west carleton was moving up against the americans at sorrel from quebec at the death of montgomery wooster had taken the command of the main american force he had been succeeded by thompson but the latter dying of smallpox sullivan took his place the new commander determined to take the offensive against the english and dispatched a force of about 2000 men to attack general fraser who held a post at a place called three rivers  a canadian peasant brought news to general fraser of the approach of the americans and as he had received reenforcements from below he determined to anticipate their attack his movements were completely successful some of the americans fought well but the rest dispersed with but little resistance two hundred were killed and 150 taken prisoners the rest succeeded in returning to sorrel  the main body of the british army now came up the river in their ships and as they approached sorrel sullivan broke up his camp and retreated at the same time arnold who commanded at montreal evacuated the town and joined sullivans army at st johns  had the english pushed forward with any energy the whole of the american army of invasion would have fallen into their hands they were completely broken in spirits suffering terribly from sickness and were wholly incapable of making any defense burgoyne who commanded the advance of the english army moved forward very slowly and the americans were enabled to take to their boats and cross first to isleauxnoix and then to crown point an american historian who saw them after they landed says at the sight of so much privation and distress i wept until i had no more power to weep i did not look into a tent or hut in which i did not find either a dead or dying man of about 5000 men full half were invalids in little more than two months they had lost by desertion and death more than 5000 men  captain wilson and his company were not present with the advance of the british troops general howe after evacuating boston had sailed with his army to halifax there to wait until a large body of reenforcements should be sent in the spring from england general carleton had in his dispatches mentioned favorably the services which the little company of loyalists from boston had performed and lord howe wrote requesting that the company should be sent down by ship to halifax as he was about to sail from new york to undertake operations on a large scale and should be glad to have with him a body of men accustomed to scouting and acquainted with the country accordingly the company was embarked in a transport and reached halifax early in june on the 11th they sailed with the army and arrived at sandy hook on the 29th on july 3 the army landed on staten island opposite long island and soon afterward lord howe brother of general howe arrived with the main army from england raising the total force to nearly 30000 men it consisted of two battalions of light infantry two of grenadiers the fourth fifth tenth seventeenth twentysecond twentythird twentyseventh thirtyfifth thirtyeighth fortieth fortysecond fortythird fortyfourth fortyfifth fortyninth fiftysecond fiftyfifth sixtythird and sixtyfourth regiments of foot part of the fortysixth and seventyfirst regiments and the seventeenth regiment of light dragoons there were besides two battalions of volunteers from new york each 1000 strong had this force arrived as it should have done three months earlier it might have achieved great things but the delay had enabled the americans to make extensive preparations to meet the coming storm  lord howe brought with him a communication from parliament giving him and his brother full power to treat with the americans on any terms which they might think fit upon his arrival lord howe addressed a letter to dr franklin informing him of the nature of his communication expressing hopes that he would find in america the same disposition for peace that he brought with him and requesting his aid to accomplish the desired end dr franklin in answer informed lord howe that prior to the consideration of any proposition for friendship or peace it would be required that great britain should acknowledge the independence of america should defray the expense of the war and indemnify the colonists for all damages committed  after such a reply as this lord howe had no alternative but to commence hostilities which he did by landing the army in gravesend bay long island the enemy offered no opposition to the landing but retreated at once setting fire to all the houses and granaries and taking up a position on the wooded heights which commanded the line by which the english must advance  the american main force 15000 strong was posted on a peninsula between mill creek and wallabout bay and had constructed a strong line of intrenchments across the end of the peninsula the intrenchments were strengthened by abattis and flanked by strong redoubts five thousand remained to guard this post and 10000 under general puttenham advanced to hold the line of wooded hills which run across the island  in the center of the plain at the foot of these hills stood the village of flatbush  the hessian division of the british army under general de heister advanced against this while general clinton with the right wing of the english army moved forward to attack the enemys left  this force marched at nine oclock at night on august 26 general sir william howe himself accompanied it the line of hills trended away greatly to the left and the enemy had neglected to secure the passes over the hills on this flank consequently at nine oclock in the morning the british passed the range of hills without resistance and occupied bedford in its rear had sir william howe now pushed on vigorously the whole of puttenhams force must have been captured  in the meantime the hessians from flatbush attacked the center of the americans and after a warm engagement routed them and drove them into the woods with a loss of three pieces of cannon  on the british left general grant also advanced and at midnight carried a strong pass on the enemys left retiring they held a still stronger position further back and offered a fierce resistance until the fires at bedford showed that the english had obtained a position almost in their rear when they retreated precipitately  illustration sketch of the british position on long island  the victory was a complete one but it had none of the consequences which would have attended it had the english pushed forward with energy after turning the american left six pieces of cannon were captured and 2000 men killed or taken prisoners the english lost 70 killed and 230 wounded  so impetuously did the english attack that even sir william howe admitted that they could have carried the intrenchments he alleges he did not permit them to do so because he intended to take the position by regular approaches and wished therefore to avoid the loss of life which an immediate assault would have occasioned on the 27th and 28th regular approaches were commenced but on the 29th under cover of a fog the americans embarked in boats and succeeded in carrying the whole of their force without the loss of a man across to the mainland  the escape of this body of men was disgraceful in the extreme to the english commanders they had a great fleet at their disposal and had they placed a couple of frigates in the east river between long island and new york the escape would have been impossible and general washington and his army of 15000 men must have been taken prisoners whether this misfortune would have proved conclusive of the war it is now too late to speculate but so splendid an opportunity was never before let slip by an english general and the negligence was the more inexcusable inasmuch as the fleet of boats could be seen lying alongside of the american position their purpose must have been known and they could at any moment have been destroyed by the guns of a shipofwar taking up its position outside them  lord howe dispatched the american general sullivan who had been taken prisoner on long island to congress repeating his desire to treat a committee of three members accordingly waited on lord howe who informed them that it was the most ardent wish of the king and the government of great britain to put an end to the dissatisfaction between the mother country and the colonists to accomplish this desire every act of parliament which was considered obnoxious to the colonists should undergo a revisal and every just cause of complaint should be removed if the colonists would declare their willingness to submit to the authority of the british government the committee replied that it was not america which had separated herself from great britain but great britain had separated herself from america the latter had never declared herself independent until the former had made war upon her and even if congress were willing to place america in her former situation it could not do so as the declaration of independence had been made in consequence of the congregated voice of the whole people by whom alone it could be abolished the country was determined not to return under the domination of england  the negotiations were therefore broken off lord howe published a declaration to the people of america giving the answer of the committee to his offer of reconciliation he acquainted them with the fact that the parent country was willing to receive into its bosom and protection all who might be willing to return to their former obedience in taking this step lord howe was convinced that a majority of the inhabitants of america were still willing to enter into an accommodation of the differences between the two powers and the conviction was not ill founded the declaration however produced but little effect for the dominant section that resolved to break off all connection with england had acquired the sole management of affairs and no offers which could possibly have been made would have been accepted by them  convinced that all further negotiations would be ineffectual lord howe prepared to carry his army across from long island to new york where the american army had taken up their post after the retreat from long island the armies were separated by the east river with a breadth of about thirteen hundred yards a cannonade was kept up for several days on september 13 some shipsofwar were brought up to cover the passage washington seeing the preparations began to evacuate the city and to abandon the strong intrenchments which he had thrown up at eleven oclock on the morning of the 15th the menofwar opened a heavy fire and clintons division consisting of 4000 men in eightyfour boats sailed up the river landed on manhattan island at a place called kipps bay and occupied the heights of inclenberg the enemy abandoning their intrenchments at their approach general washington rode toward kipps bay to take command of the troops stationed there but found the men who had been posted at the lines running away and the brigades which should have supported them flying in every direction heedless of the exertions of their generals  puttenhams division of 4000 men was still in the lower city and would be cut off unless the british advance should be checked washington therefore made the greatest efforts to rally the fugitives and to get them to make a stand to check the advancing enemy but in vain for as soon as even small bodies of redcoats were seen advancing they broke and fled in panic  howe as usual delayed giving orders for an advance and thus permitted the whole of puttenhams brigade who were cut off and must have been taken prisoners to escape unharmed and thus with comparatively little loss the americans drew off leaving behind them only a few heavy cannon and some bayonets and stores  so rapid had been their flight at the approach of the english that only fifteen were killed two men falling on the english side     chapter ix   the surprise of trenton  the americans finding that they were not pursued rallied from their panic and took up a position at harlem and kingsbridge so great was the disorganization among them that had the british advanced at once they would have taken the place with scarcely any loss strong as it was by nature and by the intrenchments which washington had prepared great numbers deserted disputes broke out between the troops of the various states insubordination prevailed and the whole army was utterly disheartened by the easy victories which the british had obtained over them washington reported the cowardice of his troops to congress who passed a law inflicting the punishment of death for cowardice  before leaving new york the americans had made preparations for burning the whole town but the speediness of their retreat prevented the preparations being carried into effect fire was set to it in several places and a third of the town was destroyed  the position taken up by the enemy was so strong that it was determined to operate in the rear some redoubts were thrown up to cover new york during the absence of the main part of the british force  a portion of the british army was landed at a point threatening the retreat of the americans and a series of skirmishes of no great importance took place the enemy fell back from their most advanced works but no general move was undertaken although as the numbers on both sides were about even and the superior fighting powers of the english had been amply demonstrated there could have been no doubt as to the result of a general battle lord howe however wasted the time in a series of petty movements which although generally successful had no influence upon the result and served only to enable the americans to recover from the utter depression which had fallen upon them after the evacuation of long island and the loss of new york  gradually the americans fell back across a country so swampy and difficult that it was now no longer possible to bring on a general action their retreat had the effect of isolating the important positions of kingsbridge and fort washington the latter post was of the utmost importance inasmuch as it secured the american intercourse with the jersey shore the fortifications were very strong and stood upon rising and open ground it was garrisoned by 3000 of the best american troops under the command of colonel magaw washington was gradually withdrawing his army and had already given orders that fort washington should be evacuated but general lee who was second in command so strongly urged that it should be retained that greatly against his own judgment he was obliged to consent to its being defended especially as colonel magaw insisted that the fort could stand a siege on the night of november 14 the british passed some troops across the creek and lord howe summoned the place to surrender on pain of the garrison being put to the sword magaw had upon the previous day received large numbers of reenforcements and replied that he should defend the fort soon after daybreak on the 16th the artillery opened on both sides five thousand hessians under the command of general knyphausen moved up the hill penetrated some of the advanced works of the enemy and took post within a hundred yards of the fort the second division consisting of the guards and light infantry with two battalions of hessians and the thirtythird regiment landed at island creek and after some stiff fighting forced the enemy from the rocks and trees up the steep and rugged mountain the third and fourth divisions fought their way up through similar defenses so steep was the hill that the assailants could only climb it by grasping the trees and bushes and so obstinate was the defense that the troops were sometimes mixed up together  the bravery and superior numbers of the british troops bore down all resistance and the whole of the four divisions reached their places round the fort they then summoned it to surrender and its commander after half an hours consideration seeing the impossibility of resisting the assault which was threatened opened the gates  upon the english side about 800 men were killed and wounded of whom the majority were hessians these troops fought with extreme bravery the american loss owing to their superior position was about 150 killed and wounded but the prisoners taken amounted to over 3000  on the 18th lord howe landed a strong body on the jersey shore under lord cornwallis who marched to fort lee and surprised it a deserter had informed the enemy of his approach and the garrison had fled in disorder leaving their tents provisions and military stores behind them lord cornwallis pushing forward with great energy drove the americans out of new jersey another expedition occupied rhode island  cold weather now set in and the english went into winter quarters their success had been complete without a single check and had they been led vigorously the army of washington might on two occasions have been wholly destroyed in such a case the moderate portion of the population of the colonies would have obtained a hearing and a peace honorable to both parties might have been arrived at  the advantage gained by the gallantry of the british troops was however entirely neutralized by the lethargy and inactivity of their general and the colonists had time given them to recover from the alarm which the defeat of their troops had given them to put another army in the field and to prepare on a great scale for the following campaign  the conduct of general howe in allowing washingtons army to retire almost unmolested was to the officers who served under him unaccountable his arrangements for the winter were even more singularly defective instead of concentrating his troops he scattered them over a wide extent of country at a distance too great to support each other and thus left it open to the enemy to crush them in detail  general howe now issued a proclamation offering a free pardon to all who surrendered and great numbers of colonists came in and made their submission even in philadelphia the longing for peace was so strong that general washington was obliged to send a force there to prevent the town from declaring for england  during the operations which had taken place since the landing of the british troops on long island captain wilsons company had taken but little part in the operations all had been straightforward work and conducted on the principles of european warfare the services of the volunteers as scouts had not therefore been called into requisition the success which at first attended the expedition had encouraged captain wilson to hope for the first time since the outbreak of the revolution that the english might obtain such decisive successes that the colonists would be willing to accept some propositions of peace such as those indicated by lord howea repeal of all obnoxious laws freedom from any taxation except that imposed by themselves and a recognition of the british authority when he saw that lord howe instead of actively utilizing the splendid force at his disposal frittered it away in minor movements and allowed washington to withdraw with his beaten army unmolested his hopes again faded and he felt that the colonists would in the long run succeed in gaining all that they contended for  when the army went into winter quarters the company was ordered to take post on the delaware there were four frontier posts at trenton bordentown white horse and burlington trenton opposite to which lay washington with the main body of his army was held by only 1200 hessians and bordentown which was also on the delaware was like trenton garrisoned by these troops no worse choice could have been made the hessians were brave soldiers but their ignorance of the language and of the country made them peculiarly unsuitable troops for outpost work as they were unable to obtain any information as foreigners too they were greatly disliked by the country people  nothing was done to strengthen these frontier posts which were left wholly without redoubts or intrenchments into which the garrison could withdraw in case of attack  captain wilsons little company were to act as scouts along the line of frontier their headquarters were fixed at bordentown where captain wilson obtained a large house for their use most of the men were at home at work of this kind and peter lambton ephraim and the other frontiersmen were dispatched from time to time in different directions to ascertain the movements and intentions of the enemy harold asked his father to allow him as before to accompany peter the inactivity of a life at a quiet little station was wearisome and with peter he was sure of plenty of work with a chance of adventure the life of exercise and activity which he had led for more than a year had strengthened his muscles and widened his frame and he was now able to keep up with peter however long and tiresome the days work might be jake too was of the party he had developed into an active soldier and although he was but of little use for scouting purposes even peter did not object to his accompanying him for the negros unfailing good temper and willingness to make himself useful had made him a favorite with the scout  the weather was now setting in exceedingly cold the three men had more than once crossed the delaware in a canoe and scouted in the very heart of the enemys country they were now sitting by the bank watching some drifting ice upon the river  there wont be many more passages of the river by water peter remarked another ten days and itll be frozen across  then we can cross on foot peter  yes we can do that the scout said and so can the enemy ef their general has got any interprise with him and ef he can get them chaps as he calls soldiers to fight hell be crossing over one of these nights and capturing the hull of them hessians at trenton what general howe means by leaving em there is more nor i can think he might as well have sent so many babies the critters can fight and fight well too and theyre good soldiers but whats the good of em in a frontier post they know nothing of the country they cant speak to the people nor ask no questions nor find out nothing about whats doing the other side of the river they air no more than mere machines what was wanted was two or three battalions of light troops who would make friends with the country people and larn all thats doing opposite if the americans are sharp theyll give us lots of trouble this winter and youll find there wont be much sitting quiet for us at bordentown fortunately bordentown and trenton aint far apart and one garrison ought to be able to arrive to the assistance of the other before its overpowered we shall see now i propose that we cross again tonight and try and find out what the enemys doing then we can come back and manage for you to eat your christmas dinner with yer father as you seem to have bent yer mind upon that though why it matters about dinner one day more than another is more nor i can see  that night the three scouts crossed the river in the canoe avoiding all houses they kept many miles straight on beyond the river and lay down for a few hours before morning dawned then they turned their faces the other way and walked up to the first farmhouse they saw  can we have a drink of milk the hunter asked  you can the farmer replied and some breakfast if you like to pay for it at first i was glad to give the best i had to those who came along but there have been such numbers going one way and the other either marching to join the army or running away to return to their homes that i should be ruined if i gave to all comers  were ready to pay peter said drawing some money from his pocket  then come in and sit down  in a few minutes an excellent breakfast was put before them  you are on your way to join the army of course the farmer asked  jest that peter replied we think its about our time to do a little shooting though i dont suppose therell be much done till the spring  i dont know the farmer said i should not be surprised if the general wakes up them germans when the delaware gets frozen i heard some talk about it from some men who came past yesterday their time was expired they said and they were going home i hear too that they are gathering a force down near mount holly and i reckon that they are going to attack bordentown  is that so peter asked in that case we might as well tramp in that direction it dont matter a cornshuck to us where we fight so as its soon weve come to help lick these british and we means to do it  ah the farmer said i have heard that sentiment a good many times but i have not seen much come of it yet so far it seems to me as the licking has been all the other way  thats so peter agreed but everyone knows that the americans are just the bravest people on the face of the habitable arth i reckon their danders not fairly up yet but when they begin in arnest youll see what theyll do  the farmer gave a grunt which might mean anything he had no strong sympathies either way and the conduct of the numerous deserters and disbanded men who had passed through his neighborhood had been far from impressing him favorably  i dont pretend to be strong either for the congress or the king i dont want to be taxed but i dont see why the colonists should not pay something toward the expenses of the government and now that parliament seems willing to give all we ask for i dont see what we want to go on fighting for  waal peter exclaimed in a tone of disgust youre one of the halfhearted ones  i am like the great majority of the people of this country we are of english stock and we dont want to break with the old country but the affairs have got into the hands of the preachers and the newspaper men and the chaps that want to push themselves forward and make their pile out of the war as i read it its just the civil war in england over again we were all united at the first against what we considered as tyranny on the part of the parliament and now we have gone setting up demands which no one dreamed of at first and which most of us object to now only we have no longer the control of our own affairs  the great heart of this country beats for freedom peter lambton said  pooh said the farmer contemptuously the great heart of the country wants to work its farms and do its business quietly the english general has made fair offers which might well be accepted and as for freedom there was no tyranny greater than that of the new england states as long as they managed their own affairs there was neither freedom of speech nor religion no sir what they call freedom was simply the freedom to make everyone else do and think like the majority  waal we wont argue it out peter said for im not good at argument and i came here to fight and not to talk besides i want to get to mount holly in time to jine in this battle so i guess well be moving  paying for the breakfast they started at once in the direction of mount holly which lay some twentyfive miles away as they approached the place early in the afternoon they overtook several men going in the same direction they entered into conversation with them but could only learn that some 450 of the militia from philadelphia and the counties of gloucester and salem had arrived on the spot the men whom they had overtaken were armed countrymen who were going to take a share in the fight on their own account  entering the place with the others peter found that the information given him was correct  we better be out of this at once he said to harold and make for bordentown  you dont think that there is much importance in the movement harold said as they tramped along  there aint no importance whatever peter said and thats what i want to tell em theyre never thinking of attacking the two thousand hessians at bordentown with that ragged lot  but what can they have assembled them for within twelve miles of the place harold asked  it seems to me the hunter replied that its jest a trick to draw the germans out from bordentown and so away from trenton at any rate its well that the true account of the force here should be known these things gets magnified and they may think that theres a hull army here  it was getting dusk when they entered bordentown and harold was glad when he saw the little town for since sunset on the evening before they had tramped nearly sixty miles the place seemed singularly quiet they asked the first person they met what had become of the troops and they were told that colonel donop who commanded had marched an hour before with his whole force of 2000 men toward mount holly leaving only 80 men in garrison at bordentown  we are too late harold said they have gone by the road and we kept straight through the woods and so missed them  waal i hope no harm ill come of it i suppose they mean to attack at daylight and in course that rabble will run without fighting i hope when the colonel sees as how thars no enemy ther worth speaking of hell march straight back again  unfortunately this was not the case the militia according to their orders at once dispersed when their outposts told them of the approach of the british but the german officer instead of returning instantly remained for two days near mount holly and so gave time to washington to carry out his plans  captain wilsons company had gone out with the force and peter and his companions had the house to themselves that night harold slept late being thoroughly fatigued by his long march the day before carrying his rifle blanket and provisions peter woke him at last  now young un youve had a good sleep its eleven oclock im off to trenton to see whats doing there will you go with me or will you stop here on the chance of eating your dinner with your father  oh its christmas day harold said stretching well what do you think peterare they likely to come back or not  they ought to be back theres no doubt about that but whether they will or not is a different affair altogether ive never seed them hurry themselves yet not since the war began things would have gone a good deal better if they had but time never seems of no consequence to them they marched twelve miles last night and i reckon its likely theyll halt today and wont be back till tomorrow i feel oneasy in my mind about the whole affair for i cant see a single reason for the enemy sending that weak force to mount holly unless it was to draw away the troops from here and the only motive there could be for that would be because they intended to attack trenton  very well peter i will go with you  accompanied by jake they set out at once for trenton on arriving there they found no particular signs of vigilance since the hessians had reached trenton their discipline had much relaxed a broad river separated them from the enemy who were known to be extremely discontented and disorganized they had received instruction on no account to cross the river to attack the colonials and the natural consequence of this forced inactivity had manifested itself discipline was lax and but a slight watch was kept on the movements of the enemy across the stream ignorant of the language of the people they were incapable of distinguishing between those who were friendly and those who were hostile to the crown and they behaved as if in a conquered country taking such necessaries as they required without payment and even sending parties to a considerable distance on plundering expeditions  peter on his arrival proceeded to the headquarters of colonel rhalle who was in commandan officer of great bravery and energy one of his officers was able to speak english and to him peter reported the departure of the force from bordentown of which colonel rhalle was already aware and the weakness of the american force at mount holly he stated also his own belief that it was merely a feint to draw off colonel donop and that preparatory to an attack on trenton the officer treated the information lightly and pointing to the mass of ice floating down the river asked whether it would be possible for boats to cross  when the river freezes he said there may be some chance of attack till then we are absolutely safe  peter shaking his head rejoined his companions and told them of the manner in which his advice had been received  but it would be difficult to cross the river harold said look at the masses of ice on the water  it would be difficult the hunter admitted but not by no manner of means impossible determined men could do it waal ive done my duty and can do no more ef the night passes off quietly well cross again before daybreak and go right into the yankee camp and see what theyre up to now harold you can take it easy till nightfall theres naught to be learned till then and as we shall be on foot all night ye may as well sleep today  returning to a spot on the banks of the river at a short distance from the town they made a fire on which jake cooked some steaks of venison they had procured after smoking a pipe the hunter set the example by stretching himself on the ground near the fire and going to sleep used as he was to night marches he had acquired the faculty of going to sleep at any hour at will jake and harold were some time before they followed his example but they too were at last asleep at sunset they were on their feet again and after taking supper proceeded along the river  the night passed off quietly and harold became convinced that his companions fears were unfounded toward morning he suggested that it was time to be crossing the river  im not going yet the hunter said before i start well go down to trenton ferry a mile below the town ef they come over at all its likely enough to be there therell be time then to get back and cross before its light its six oclock now  they kept along the road by the river until they were within a quarter of a mile of the ferry presently they saw a dark mass ahead  jerusalem peter exclaimed there they are  they immediately discharged their rifles and ran back at full speed to the outposts which were but a quarter of a mile from the town the americans had also pressed forward at full speed and the outposts who had been alarmed by the discharge of the rifles were forced at once to abandon the post and to run into the town whither they had on hearing the rifles already sent in one of their number with the news here all was in confusion the hessian leader was trying to collect his troops who were hurrying in from their quarters but many of them thought more of storing their plunder away in the wagons than of taking their places in the ranks  washington had crossed with 2500 men and a few fieldpieces and upon gaining the jersey side had divided his troops into two detachments one of which marched by the river side the other by an upper road hurrying forward they surrounded the town and placing their fieldpieces in the road opened fire on the astonished hessians rhalle had by this time succeeded in assembling the greater part of his force and charged the americans with his usual courage he received however a mortal wound as he advanced his troops immediately lost heart and finding their retreat cut off at once surrendered a body of hessian light horse succeeded in making their escape the casualties were few on either side but 1000 prisoners were taken two other divisions of the americans had attempted to cross the one at bordentown the other at mackenzies ferry but both had failed owing to the quantity of floating ice washington retired across the delaware the same afternoon  the consequences of this success were great the spirits of the americans which had fallen to the lowest ebb in consequence of the uninterrupted series of defeats rose greatly they found that the british were not invincible and that if unable to oppose them in great battles they might at least inflict heavy losses on them and weary them out with skirmishes and surprises the greatest joy reigned throughout the various states fresh levies were ordered the voices of the moderate party which had been gaining strength were silenced and the determination to continue the war vigorously was in the ascendency  the lesson given at trenton was wholly lost upon the english commanderinchief instead of at once ordering general leslie to advance from princeton and to hold the enemy in check by reoccupying and fortifying trenton he allowed colonel donop to abandon bordentown and to fall back to princetonthus laying it open to washington to cross the delaware again and carry the war into new jersey washington after waiting eight days seeing the indecision and ineptitude of the british general again crossed with 4000 men and occupied trenton  peter lambton and his two companions were not among the prisoners taken at trenton on entering the town harold was about to join the hessians assembling under colonel rhalle but peter gave a violent tug to his coat  come along young un he said the darned fools have let themselves be caught in a trap and theyll find theres no way out of it in ten minutes the americans will be all round the place and as i dont wish to spend a year or two in a yankee prison at present im going to make tracks at once fighting arent no good now men wholl let emselves be caught in a trap like thisll never be able to cut their way out of it come on  much against his will harold yielded to peters wishes and the three kept straight on through the town by the river side and issued into the country beyond before the americans had surrounded it a minute or two after leaving the town the light horse galloped past  there are some more out of the hole and i reckon thats about all there do you hear the guns the yanks have brought their artillery overi reckon the fight wont last long  for two or three minutes there was a roar of musketry then this suddenly ceased  i thought as much peter said theyve surrendered if they had only kept together and fought well they should have cut their way through the enemy lord what poor things regular soldiers are in the dark a frontiersman would just as soon fight in the dark as in the light but here are the men who climbed up the hill to fort washingtonand that was no childs playno better nor a pack of women when theyre attacked halfasleep and halfawake just as day is breaking  the three comrades walked to bordentown which they were relieved to find had not been attacked a few miles beyond this place they met colonel donop marching back at full speed with his corps having received the news of the disaster at trenton from the horsemen who had fled they joined their company and marched to princeton  a fortnight later lord cornwallis with the forces at brunswick under general grant advanced to princeton and then moved forward to attack the army at trenton general washington on his approach retired from the town and crossing a rivulet at the back of it took post on some high ground there with the apparent intention of defending himself against an attack it was late in the afternoon and a heavy cannonade was kept up till nighttime lord cornwallis determined to attack next morning at two in the morning washington retired suddenly leaving his fires burning quitting the main road he made a long circuit through allentown and marched with all speed toward princeton which place he intended to surprise when lord cornwallis advanced he had left the seventeenth fortieth and fiftyfifth regiments there  on arriving at trenton he had sent word back for the seventeenth and fiftyfifth to advance to maidenhead a village halfway between princeton and trenton colonel mawhood who commanded marched at daylight but scarcely had he started when he met washington advancing with his army the morning was foggy and it was at first supposed that the enemy were a body of british troops marching back to princeton but it was soon found that the force was a hostile one its strength could not be seen on account of the fog and he determined to engage it possessing himself of some high ground he sent his wagons back to princeton and ordered the fortieth regiment to come out to his assistance  as the americans advanced the artillery on both sides opened fire the leading columns of the colonists soon snowed signs of disorder the seventeenth regiment fixed bayonets and with great gallantry charged the enemy in front of them driving them back with considerable slaughter and so far did they advance that they were separated from the other battalions and cutting their way through the american force the regiment pursued its march to maidenhead the fortieth and fiftyfifth fought stoutly but were unable to make their way through the american force and fell back to brunswick while the americans occupied princeton at daybreak lord cornwallis discovered the retreat of the american army and being apprehensive for the safety of brunswick where great stores of the army were accumulated marched with all haste toward that town  brigadier matthew the officer commanding there on hearing of the approach of the enemy at once dispatched the store wagons toward the rear and drew up his small command to defend the place to the last the gallant resistance before princeton had delayed the americans so long that the van of the army of cornwallis was already close to their rear as they approached brunswick seeing this washington abandoned his design on that town and crossed the millstone river breaking down the bridge at kingston to stop pursuit  washington now overran east and west jersey penetrated into essex county and making himself master of the country opposite to staten island thus regained almost all the district which the english had taken from him in the autumn  all this greatly heightened the spirit and courage of the americans while the loyalists and the english troops were disheartened and disgusted at seeing an army of 30000 fine troops kept inactive while the enemy with but 4000 men who were wholly incapable of opposing an equal number of english troops were allowed to wander unchecked to attack and harass the english pickets and to utilize the whole of the resources of their country had general howe entertained a fixed desire to see english authority overthrown in america he could not have acted in a manner more calculated to carry those wishes into effect     chapter x   a treacherous planter  it must not be supposed that the whole of the time was spent in scouting and fighting between the armies lay a band of no mans land here as elsewhere the people of the country were divided in their opinions but generally made very little display of these whatever they might be it is true that as a rule noncombatants were but little interfered with still a warm and open display of sympathy with one side or the other was likely to be attended by the loss of cattle and damage to crops when the other party got the upper hand in some other states feeling ran much higher in the carolinas the royalists were most cruelly persecuted their property was destroyed and they were in many cases shot down without mercy but generally throughout the colonies a considerable latitude of opinion was allowed this was especially so in the zone between the armies in the jerseys none could tell what the positions of the armies a week hence might be and any persecution inflicted by the one party might lead to retaliation upon a shift of positions a few weeks later a general toleration therefore reigned  next to peter lambton harolds greatest friend in the corps was a young man named harvey he was of good family and belonged to new york being a strong loyalist he had like many other gentlemen enlisted for service under the old flag he had naturally many acquaintances among the county families and harold often accompanied him in his visits to one or other of them  during the winter when things were quiet the duties of the scouts were light and it was the habit among them that onethird should be on outpost duty at a time the rest being free to move about as they liked the scouts had no fixed order of position they went out alone or in twos or threes as it pleased them their duty simply being to watch everything that was going on along the enemys line of outposts to bring the earliest news of any intended movements and to prevent dashing parties of the enemys horsemen from making raids into or behind the british lines they were not of course expected to check bodies of cavalry starting on a raid but simply to obtain information of their having left their lines and of the direction taken and then to hurry back to the british posts whence a force of cavalry would be sent out to intercept or check the invaders many dashing exploits were performed by the cavalry on both sides in the way of getting behind their opponents quarters cutting off provision trains attacking small posts and carrying off straggling parties  one of the houses to which harold used most frequently to accompany his friend harvey was situated nearly halfway between the rival armies and was about eight miles from either the ownermr jacksonwas a man of considerable wealth and the house was large and well appointed he had before the troubles began a fine business as a lawyer in new york but as the outbreak of hostilities put a stop to all business of a legal kind in that city he had retired to his country house although himself born in england he professed to be entirely neutral but his family were undisguisedly loyal it consisted of his wife and two daughters girls of seventeen and eighteen years old  when the english army advanced to the neighborhood of his property mr jackson was always ready to offer his hospitality to the officers of the corps which might be stationed near him and he similarly opened his house to the americans when they in turn advanced as the british turned back being as he always made a point of saying perfectly neutral in the struggle he was glad to meet gentlemen irrespective of the opinions they held the line taken by mr jackson was the one which was very largely pursued among the inhabitants of the country houses and farms scattered over what was throughout the war a debatable land so frequent were the changes of the position of the armies that none could say who might be in possession in a weeks time and it was therefore an absolute necessity for those who wished to live unmolested to abstain from any stronger show of partisanship  as is always the case in struggles of this kind the female population were more enthusiastic in their partisanship and more pronounced in their opinions than the men and although upon the arrival of a troop of cavalry or a detachment of foot belonging to the other side the master of the house would impartially offer what hospitality he was capable of it was not difficult to perceive by the warmth or coldness of the female welcome what were the private sentiments of the family  harold was not long in discovering from the frequency with which harvey proposed an excursion to the jacksons and from his conduct there that isabelle the eldest daughter was the object which mainly attracted him the families had long been friends and harvey although now serving as a simple scout was of a position equal to her own the friends were always cordially received by mr jackson and harold was soon as intimate there as his comrade they usually left their quarters a little before dusk and started back late at night often as mr jackson pressed them to stay they never accepted his invitation  the scouts from their activity and ubiquitousness were the bêtesnoirs of the americans whose most secret plans were constantly detected and foiled by the sagacity and watchfulness of these men whose unerring rifles made frequent gaps in the ranks of the officers they therefore spared no pains whenever there was a chance of killing or capturing any of these most troublesome foes and harvey and harold knew that a report of their presence at the jacksons would suffice to bring a party of horsemen from the american lines their visits therefore were always made after dark and at irregular intervals and in spite of their inclination to the contrary they made a point of returning at night to their quarters  other visitors were often present at the jacksons the sons and daughters of neighbors and there was generally music and singing and sometimes the young people stood up for a dance  the scouts wore no regular uniform although there was a general similarity in their attire which was that of an ordinary backwoods hunter when off duty they were allowed to dress as they pleased and at mr jacksons the two friends were attired in the ordinary dress of colonists of position at these little gatherings political subjects were never discussed and a stranger spending an evening there would not have dreamed that the house stood between two hostile armies that at any moment a party of horsemen belonging to one side or other might dash into the courtyard and that even those laughing and talking pleasantly together might be of opinions diametrically opposed  harvey and harold were introduced to visitors simply as friends from new york and although the suspicions as to their character and position might be strong no one thought of asking questions  i do not like that fellow chermside harvey said one night as he and his friend were returning to their quarters  they were mounted for although when on duty the scouts worked on foot many of them who were men of property kept horses which they used when not engaged harvey had two horses and one of these was always at harolds service  i am not surprised you dont like him harold replied with a laugh and i imagine the dislike is mutual when two gentlemen are paying attentions to one young lady they seldom appreciate each others merits very cordially  i dont think it is entirely that harvey laughed isabella and i understand each other and i have no fear of his rivalry but i do not like him  i do not think i like him myself harold said more seriously and yet i do not know why i should not when he has been there alone with us and the family he has frequently used expressions showing his strong leaning toward the loyalists side  i dont put much faith in that harvey said he knows how strongly mr jackson and the girls lean toward the crown and would say anything that he thought would please isabelle i have spoken to her and she thinks that he is sincere in fact she has rather a good opinion of him however we shall see it was rather curious that that party of morgans cavalry should have ridden up the other night and searched the house two hours after we left you see we had agreed to sleep there that night and only changed our minds after the others had all left when we remembered that we were both for duty early next morning it might have been a coincidence of course but it had an ugly look i think mr jackson thought so too for he did not ask us to stop tonight anyhow i wish chermsides plantation was not so near this and that he did not drop in so often  a week later they paid another visit when dinner was over harold was chatting with mr and mrs jackson harvey was sitting at the piano where the eldest girl was playing and the younger was looking out of window  we are going to have another fall of snow she said there is not a star to be seen oh she exclaimed suddenly  what is it my dear mr jackson asked  there is a rocket gone up from the woods  a rocket mr jackson repeated  yes papa there are the stars falling now  that is a curious thing mr jackson said while the others went to the window they stood watching for some minutes but nothing was to be seen  i do not like that rocket mr jackson said as they left the window it means something it can only be a signal people dont let off rockets for amusement nowadays did you meet anyone on the road no sir harvey said not a soul  i do not like it their host repeated it means mischief of some sort or other i do not wish to seem inhospitable but my advice to you is get on your horses at once and ride to your quarters you are on duty tomorrow and you told me you would pass near here on your way toward the enemys lines you might look in as you go past and hear whether anything came of it if i mistake not we shall have another visit from morgans horse this evening  much against their inclination the young men followed mr jacksons advice  the next day they with peter and jake stopped at the house as they passed  i was right their host said as the two young men entered an hour after you left twenty of morgans horse rode up here they would not take my word that we were alone but searched the house from top to bottom and were evidently greatly disappointed at finding no one i have been making inquiries this morning and find that all the servants were in the house at the time my daughter saw the rocket so i hope that i have no traitor here still it is clear that someone must be keeping watch over your movements  have you asked sir harvey said after a pause whether anyone came after we had arrived  i do not see how anyone could come but i will ask  he rang the bell and a negro servant appeared  did anyone come to the house yesterday caesar after these gentleman cameany beggar or peddler or anyone of that sort  no sir no one came except massa chermside he get off his horse and ask if you hab any visitors i said that massa harvey and massa wilson were here he say he call again another night when the family alone and rode off  just what i expected sir harvey said when the servant left the room i have always doubted that fellows honesty  oh nonsense mr jackson replied you must be mad harvey chermsides father was an old friend of mine and i have known the young fellow since he was a child i should as soon suspect one of my own daughters of being capable of such an act of gross treachery as laying a plot to bring the american cavalry down upon guests of mine the idea is preposterous bless me how amused the girls will be at your suspecting their old playfellow  i hope i may be mistaken sir harvey said but harolds opinion of him agrees with mine and in talking it over last night we both put our finger on him as the man who fired the rocket well now we must be pushing on we are bound for the ford where morgans horse must have come over and shall hear from our fellows there whether they rode straight here after crossing as if so there can be no doubt whatever that the rocket was a signal  upon arriving at the ford they found that morgans horse had only crossed an hour before the time at which they arrived at mr jacksons one of the scouts had instantly taken word to the nearest cavalry outpost but the enemy had recrossed the river before these had arrived on the spot  after three days on duty at the front the party returned to their lines and the next time that the young men rode out to their friends they took with them jake and peter to whom they related the circumstances  the scouts proceeded on foot and separated from the others a mile before reaching the house having arranged that peter should scout round it while jake should proceed to the plantation of mr chermside and keep a sharp lookout there  they had arranged with mr jackson that no mention of the rocket should be made to anyone however intimate with the family  i am glad to see you again the host said as they entered the room where the family were assembled although i own that these two raids of morgans horse have made me uneasy the girls have been immensely amused at your suspicions of young chermside  how could you think such a thing isabelle said he was here on the following evening and was as indignant as we were at the thought of treachery being at work he quite agreed with us that the coming of the yankees could hardly have been accidental  you said nothing about the rocket i hope harvey asked  no we kept quite silent about that as you made such a point of it but it seemed ridiculous with him but i shall be in a fright now every time you come  we have brought two of our men with us harvey said and they are scouting round so we shall hear if another rocket goes up and even if the person who let it up suspects that the last was seenas he might do from our having left so suddenlyand tries some other plan to warn the enemy we can trust our men to fire a shot and so give us warning in time we have told the groom not to take the saddles off the horses as we may stop but a short time  at eight oclock a disturbance was heard outside and jake entered the room dragging with him by main force the young planter  what is the meaning of this mr jackson asked as they rose from their seats in surprise  me tell you sar jake answered me had orders from massa harold to watch outside ob de house ob dis feller and see what going on dere about half an hour after me got dere a nigger come along running from dis direction dat no business of jakes so he stood in de trees and let him pass he go into de house five minutes afterward dis feller he come out and he walk away jake follow him bery quiet to see what him after he walk more dan a mile den he get on to de oder side of dat big hill den me see him stop and jake tink it time to interfere so he ran up and catch him he had put dis ting against a stump of a tree and had him pistol in him hand and was on de point of firing it close to dis ting so as to light him  as jake spoke he held out a rocket several times while jake had been speaking the planter had tried to interrupt him but each time jake who had not released his hold of him gave him so violent a shake that he was fain to be silent  this is a scandalous indignity he exclaimed furiously when jake finished what do you mean sir he demanded of harvey by setting this nigger to watch my abode i will have satisfaction for this treatment  it seems sir mr jackson said signing to harvey to be silent that you have been detected in a gross act of treachery my friends have suspected you of it but i indignantly denied it could we believe i and my family that you whom we have known as a child would betray our guests to the americans loyalists and republicans are alike welcome here i do not ask my friends their opinions my house is neutral ground and i did not think that anyone who used it would have had the treachery to turn it into a trap still less did i imagine you would do so these gentlemen would be perfectly within their right did they take you out and hang you from the nearest tree but for my sake i trust that they will not do so but should the american cavalry ever again visit this house under circumstances which may lead it to be supposed that they have been brought here to capture my guests i shall let them punish you as you deserve no word of mine will be raised in your favor now sir go and never again enter this house where the loathing and contempt that i feel for you will i know be shared by the ladies of my family  at a nod from harold jake released his hold of the captive who without a word turned and left the room  not a word was spoken for a minute or two after he had left the youngest girl was the first to speak  the wretch she exclaimed to think that herbert chermside should turn out such a mean traitor papa i would have let them hang him at once it would have served him right now he may do us all harm  i do not know that you are not right ada mr jackson replied gravely i am far from saying that i acted wisely young chermside has many friends among the americans and it is possible that he may work us harm however my position as a neutral is well established officers on both sides have at times been welcomed here and his report therefore that our friends here are often with us can do us no harm henceforth he must be regarded as an enemy and there will always be danger in these visits so long as the american outposts are within an hours ride he can have the road watched and although he is not likely to venture upon signaling with rockets he may send or take word on horseback a bonfire too might be lit at the other side of the hill to call them over altogether you will never be safe from home except when you have a strong body of your own troops between this and the river  i am glad to say harvey said that in consequence of the news of morgans raids on this side a body of 200 infantry and a troop of cavalry are to move tomorrow and take up their position by the ford so we shall be safe from any surprise from that direction  i am very glad to hear it mr jackson said it will relieve me of a great anxiety but pray be watchful when you are in this neighborhood you have made a bitter enemy and after what he has proved himself capable of we cannot doubt that he would hesitate at nothing i understand he went on with a smile toward his eldest daughter what is at the bottom of his conduct and as i have long suspected his hopes in that quarter i am not surprised that he is somewhat hostile to you still i never for a moment deemed him capable of this  the next day mr jackson learned that his neighbor had left his plantation and had told his servants that he was not likely to return for some time  shortly after this a series of bad luck attended the doings of the british scouts several parties were killed or captured by the enemy and they were constantly baffled by false reports while the americans appeared to forestall all their movements it was only when enterprises were set on foot and carried out by small bodies that they were ever successful anything like combined action by the orders of the officers constantly turning out ill  there must be a traitor somewhere peter said upon the return of a party from an attempt which although it promised well had been frustrated to carry off a number of cattle from one of the american depots it aint possible that this can be all sheer bad luck it aint no one in our company ill be bound we aint had any new recruits lately and there aint a man among us whom i could not answer for there must be a black sheep in gregorys or vincents corps the enemy seem up to every move and between us we have lost more than thirty men in the last few weeks there aint no doubt about ittheres a traitor somewhere and he must be a clever one and he must have pals with him or he couldnt send news of what we are doing so quickly it beats me altogether and the men are all furious  ive been talking with some of our men peter said a few days afterward and we agree that we are bound to get to the bottom of this matter were sartin sure that the traitor dont belong to us what we propose is this that the hull of us shall go up together without saying a word to a soul and scatter ourselves along the river at all the points where a chap going with a message to the enemy would be likely to cross the night we go out well get the three captains all to give orders to their men for an expedition so that whoever it is that sends messages from here would be sure to send over word to the yankees and itll be hard if we dont ketch him what do you say  i think the plan is a very good one harold answered if you like i will go with my father and ask gregory and vincent to send their men  captain wilson at once went to these officers they were as much irritated and puzzled as were their men by the failures which had taken place and agreed that next evening an order should be issued for the men of the three corps to act in combination and to allow it to leak out that they intended to surprise an american post situated near the river twentyone miles distant captain wilsons scouts instead of going with the others were to act on their own account  on the day arranged as soon as it became dark the forty scouts quietly left their quarters in small parties and made their way toward the river striking it at the point where a messenger would be likely to cross upon his way to give warning to the american post of the attack intended to be made upon it they took post along the river at a distance of fifty or sixty yards apart and silently awaited the result several hours passed and no sound broke the stillness of the woods an hour before dawn peter lambton heard a slight crack as that of a breaking twig it was some distance back in the woods but it seemed to him by the direction that the man who caused it would strike the river between himself and jake who was stationed next to him he noiselessly stole along toward the point another slight sound afforded him a sure indication of the direction in which the man whoever he might be was approaching he hastened his steps and a minute later a negro issued from the wood close to him he stood for an instant on the river bank and was about to plunge in when peter threw his arms around him  although taken by surprise the negro struggled desperately and would have freed himself from the grip of the old scout had not jake run up instantly to his comrades assistance in a minute the negro was bound and two shots were then fired the concerted signal by which it would be known along the line that a capture had been effected in a few minutes the whole body was assembled the negro who refused to answer any questions was carried far back into the woods and a fire was lighted  now nigger peter said taking as captor the lead in the matter jest tell us right away where you was going and who sent you  the negro was silent  now look ye here darky youre in the hands of men who are no jokers ef you tell us at once who put ye on to this trick no harm will happen to you but ef ye dont well jest burn the skin off your body bit by bit  still the negro was silent  half a dozen of yez peter said as have got iron ramrods shove them into the fire well soon find this niggers tongue  not a word was spoken until the ramrods were heated redhot  now peter said two of yez clap your ramrods against this darkys flanks  the negro struggled as the men approached him and gave a terrific yell as the hot iron was applied to his sides  i will tell you sarsoh have mercy upon me and i will tell you eberything  i thought peter said grimly that youd find a tongue soon enough now then who sent you  my massa the negro answered  and who is your master  the negro was again silent but as at a nod from peter the men again raised the ramrods he blurted out  massa chermside  the name was known to many of the scouts and a cry of anger broke from them  i thought as much harvey said i suspected that scoundrel was at the bottom of it all along where is he he asked the negro  me not know sar  you mean you wont say peter said try the vartue of them ramrods again  no no the negro screamed me swear me do not know where him be you may burn me to death if you will but i could not tell you  i think he is speaking the truth harvey said wait a minute have you done this before he asked the negro  yes sar eight or ten times me swim de river at night  with messages to the americans  yes sar messages to american officers  have you any written messageany letter  no sar me never take no letter me only carry dis and he took out from his hair a tiny ball of paper smaller than a pea  it was smoothed out and upon it were the words general washington  where i go sar i show dem dis and dey know den dat de message can be believed  but how do you get the message how do you see your master  masters orders were dat me and two oders were to meet him ebery night after it got dark at a tree a mile from de place where de soldiers are sometimes he no come when he come he gibs each of us a piece of money and tell us to carry a message across the river we start by different ways swim across de water in different places take de message and come back to de plantation  a pretty business peter said now you must come back with us to the post and tell your story to the commanding officer then we must see if we cant lay hands on this rascally master of yours  upon the news being told the general in command sent a party out who after searching the house and outbuildings of the plantation in vain set fire to them and burned them to the ground the negroes were all carried away and employed to labor for the army the town and all the surrounding villages were searched but no trace could be obtained of the missing man one of the men of gregorys corps of scouts disappeared he had recently joined but his appearance as a man with beard and whiskers in no way agreed with that of the planter he might however have been disguised and his disappearance was in itself no proof against him for the scouts were under no great discipline and when tired of the service often left without giving notice of their intention of doing so it was moreover possible that he might have fallen by an enemys bullet  the strongest proof in favor of the deserter being chermside was that henceforth the scouts were again as successful as before often surprising the enemy successfully  now that the ford nearest mr jacksons was strongly guarded the young men had no apprehension of any surprise although such an event was just possible as the cavalry on both sides often made great circuits in their raids upon each others country that chermside was somewhere in the neighborhood they believed having indeed strong reason for doing so as a rifle was one evening fired at them from the wood as they rode over the ball passing between their heads pursuit at the time was impossible but the next day a number of scouts searched the woods without success soon after they heard that chermside had joined the americans and obtained a commission in a body of their irregular horse  harvey was now formally engaged to isabelle jackson and it was settled that the wedding should take place in the early spring at new york when not on duty he naturally spent a good deal of his time there and harold was frequently with him since he had been fired at in the woods isabelle had been in the highest state of nervous anxiety lest her lovers enemy should again try to assassinate him and she begged harold always to come over with him if possible as the thought of his riding alone through the wood filled her with anxiety  although he had no order to do so jake whenever he saw harold and his friend canter off toward the jacksons shouldered his rifle and went out after them to the house where so long as they stayed he scouted round and round with the utmost vigilance very often harold was ignorant of his presence there but when after his return he found by questioning him how he had been employed he remonstrated with him on such excessive precaution  cant be too cautious massa jake said you see dat fellow come one of dese days  jakes presentiment turned out correct one evening when with several friends the young men were at mr jacksons the sound of the report of a rifle was heard at a short distance  that must be jakes rifle harold exclaimed  quick harvey to your horse  it was too late as they reached the door a strong party of american cavalry dashed up to it  surround the house an officer shouted do not let a soul escape  the young men ran upstairs again  we are caught harvey said escape is cut off the yankee cavalry are all round the house goodby isabelle we shall meet one of these days again dear the girl threw herself into his arms  be calm love he said do not let this scoundrel have the satisfaction of triumphing over you  a moment later chermside accompanied by several soldiers entered the room  i am sorry to disturb so pleasant a party he said in a sneering voice but if americans choose to entertain the enemies of their country they must expect these little disagreeables  mr jackson abruptly turned his back upon him and no one else spoke although he was personally well known to all  these are the two men he said to the soldierstwo of the most notorious scouts and spies on the frontier we will take them to headquarters where a short shrift and two strong ropes will be their lot  the less the word spy is in the mouth of such a pitiful traitor as yourself the better i should say harvey said quietly and walking forward with harold he placed himself in the hands of the soldiers  no one else spoke isabelle had fainted when she heard the threat of execution against her lover ada stood before her with a look of such anger and contempt on her young face that chermside fairly winced under it  to horse he said sullenly and turning followed his men and prisoners downstairs  the troop harold saw numbered some 200 sabers they had with them a number of riderless horses whose accouterments showed that they belonged to an english regiment most of the men too had sacks of plunder upon their horses they had evidently made a successful raid and had probably attacked a post and surprised and driven off the horses of a squadron of cavalry and were now on their return toward their lines  this is an awkward business harold harvey said as in the midst of their captors they galloped off from the jacksons of course its all nonsense about our being hung still i have no wish to see the inside of a prison where we may pass years before we are exchanged once handed over to the authorities we shall be safe but i shall not feel that we are out of danger so long as we are in this scoundrels hands fortunately there are officers of superior rank to himself with the squadron otherwise i have no doubt at all that he would hang us at once  such was indeed the case and chermside was at that moment fuming intensely at the chance which had thrown his rival in his hands at a time when he was powerless to carry out his vengeance he had indeed ventured to suggest that it would be less trouble to hang the prisoners at once but the major in command had so strongly rebuked him for the suggestion that he had at once been silenced  i blush that i should have heard such words from the mouth of an american officer it is by such deeds sir that our cause is too often disgraced we are soldiers fighting for the independence of our countrynot lawless marauders had these men been taken in their civilian dress over on our side of the river they would have been tried and hung as spies but they were on neutral ground and in fact in the rear of their own posts there is no shadow of defense for such an accusation should i ever hear a similar suggestion i shall at once report your conduct to general washington who will know how to deal with you  i wonder what has become of jake harold said to his comrade i trust he was not shot down  not he harvey said he made off after firing his rifle you may be sure when he saw that there was nothing to be done the fellow can run like a hare and i have no doubt that by this time he has either got back to the village and given the alarm there or has made for the ford there are 100 cavalry there now as well as the infantry jake will be there in an hour from the time he started the dragoons will be in the saddle five minutes later and it is just possible they may cut off our retreat before we have crossed the river peter is on duty there and if he happens to be at the post when jake arrives he will hurry up with all the scouts he can collect  jake had taken flight as harvey supposed he had after firing his rifle taken to the wood and had remained near the house long enough to see which way the cavalry rode when they started then he made for the post at the ford at the top of his speed it was less than an hour from starting when he arrived there and three minutes later the cavalry trumpets were blowing to horse after giving his message to the officer in command jake went into the village where the sounds of the trumpet brought all the soldiers into the street  hullo jake is that you a familiar voice asked what the tarnal is up now  jake hastily related what had taken place  tarnation peter exclaimed this is a bad job theyre making no doubt for finchleys ford fifteen mile down the river with an hours start theyre sure to be there before us  what are you going to do peter are you thinking of running wid de cavalry  thinking of running to the moon the scout said contemptuously you can run well i dont deny jake but you couldnt run fifteen mile with the dragoons and if you could youd get there too late yer bellows are going pretty fast already now dont stand staring there but hurry through the camp and get all our boys together tell them to meet by the water side get gregory and vincents men as well as our own theres twenty or thirty altogether in the place  without asking a question jake ran off to carry out the orders and in a few minutes twentyfour men were collected together on the bank  now you fellows peter said weve got to rescue these two chaps out of the hands of the yankees them who dont want to jineand mind you the venture is a risky onehad better say so at once and stop behind  no one moved  what i propose is this well take the ferryboat which aint no good to no one seeing as how the yankees are on one side of the river and we the other and well drop down the stream about ten mile then well land on their side of the river and strike inland hiding the boat under the bushes somewhere theyll halt for the night when theyre safe across the river theres five or six hundred of their infantry camped on the ford theres two hundred on our side but the yankeesll ride through in the dark and get across before the redcoats are awake now i propose that after weve landed we make a sweep round until we get near the yanks camp then the restll wait and two or three of usll go in and see if we cant get the young fellows out of wherever theyve put em then well jine you and make a running fight of it back to the boat  the others assented the boat was amply large enough for all and pulling her out into the stream they dropped down keeping under shelter of the trees on the british side half an hour after they had started they heard the faint sound of distant musketry  there peter said the yanks are riding through the british camp close to the ford  a few more shots were heard and then all was silent the stream was swift for it was swollen by recent rains and at three in the morning the boat touched the bank about a mile above the ford the party disembarked noiselessly and fastening the boat to a tree moved along toward the camp  when they were within four or five hundred yards of the village peter chose jake and two others of his band and telling the rest to remain where they were ready for action he struck inland he made a détour and came in at the back of the camp  here there were no sentries as the only danger to be apprehended was upon the side of the river peter therefore entered boldly in front of the principal house a sentry was walking up and down and he in the freeandeasy manner usual in the american army gladly entered into conversation with the newcomers  all pretty quiet about here peter asked were from the west and have jest come down to do a little fighting with the britishers i reckon they aint far off now  they are just across the river the sentry said have you come far  weve made something like two hundred mile this week and mean to have a day or twos rest before we begin weve done some injun fighting my mates and me in our time and we says to ourselves it was about time we burned a little powder against the redcoats things seem quiet enough about here nothing doing eh  not much the sentry said just skirmishes some of our cavalry came across through the redcoats late tonight i hear they have got a quantity of plunder and some fine horses and they have brought in a couple of the british scouts  and what have they done with em peter asked strung em up i suppose  no no we aint fighting indians now we dont hang our prisoners no they are safe under guard over there in the cavalry camp and will be taken to headquarters tomorrow  waal peter said stretching himself i feel mighty tired and shall jest look for a soft place for an hours sleep before morning  so saying he sauntered away and the sentry resumed his walk  peter and his three companions now moved off toward the spot where as the sentry had indicated the cavalry were encamped they were not in tents but were sleeping wrapped up in their blankets two tents had been erected lent probably by the infantry on the spot one was much larger than the other and sentries were placed before each they had some difficulty in making their way for the night was dark and the cavalry had picketed their horses without order or regularity in their search they had to use great caution to avoid stumbling over the sleeping men but at last they saw the tents faintly against the sky they crawled cautiously up there were two sentries on the smaller tent  now jake peter whispered youre the blackest and so had better do the trick dont cut a hole in the tent for theyd be safe to hear the canvas tear crawl under its been put up in haste and aint likely to be pinned down very tight theyre safe to be bound and when youve cut the cords and given them time to get the use of their feet then crawl along and jine us  jake did as he was instructed one of the sentries was pacing up and down before the entrance the other making a circuit round the tent the circle was a somewhat large one to avoid stumbling over the tent ropes jake watching his opportunity had no difficulty in crawling up and squeezing himself under the canvas before the sentry returned  hush he whispered as he let the canvas fall behind him its jake  both the captives were fast asleep jake feeling about in the darkness found them one after the other and putting his hands on their mouths to prevent them making an exclamation he woke them and soon cut the cords with which they were bound hand and foot then in whispers he told them what had happened they chafed their limbs to produce circulation for they had been tightly tied and then one by one they crawled out of the tent  harvey went first and was safely across before the sentry returned harold followed but as he went in his hurry he struck a tent rope  whats that the sentry in front asked sharply bill was that you  no his comrade replied somethings up look into the tent  and so saying he ran round behind while the sentry in front rushed into the tent and kicking about with his feet soon found that it was empty  jake on hearing the exclamation at once crawled from the tent but as he did so the sentry running round saw him and leveled his rifle before he could fire a shot was heard and the man fell dead  jake started to his feet and joined his friends the other sentry also discharged his rifle and the whole camp awoke and sprang to their feet the horses alarmed at the sudden tumult plunged and kicked men shouted and swore everyone asking what was the matter then loud cries were heard that the sentry was shot and the prisoners had escaped  running closely together and knocking down all who stood in their way the fugitives hurried in the darkness until at the edge of the camp and then started at full speed  the trumpets were now sounding to horse and several shots were fired after them many of the horses had not been unsaddled and mounted men at once dashed off several had seen the little party rush away and the horsemen were speedily on their track the six men ran at the top of their speed and were soon close to their hidden friends  this way this way i see them shouted a voice which harold and harvey recognized as that of their enemy who a minute later galloped up with half a dozen troopers it was not until he was within a few yards that his figure was clearly discernible then peter lambtons rifle flashed out and the planter fell from his horse with a bullet in his brain  jake and the other two men also fired and the horsemen astonished at their number reined in their horses to await the coming up of more of their comrades  in another minute the fugitives were with their friends and at a rapid trot the whole ran up the river bank toward the spot where they had hidden their boat  the country was covered with brushwood and forest and as the cavalry now swollen to a considerable force advanced they were greeted by so heavy a fire that astonished at this strong force of foes upon their side of the river and not knowing how numerous they might be they halted and waited for the infantry to come up long before the enemy were prepared to advance against the unknown foe the scouts reached their boat and crossed safely to the other side  shortly after this adventure mr jackson and his family moved for the winter to new york where soon after their arrival the wedding between harvey and isabella took place the former retiring from the corps of scouts     chapter xi   the capture of philadelphia  during the course of the spring of 1777 a large number of loyal colonists had volunteered their services they had been embodied into battalions and when the army prepared to take the field they were placed in garrisons in new york and other places thus permitting the employment of the whole of the british force in the field the americans had occupied themselves in strongly fortifying the more defensible positions especially those in a mountain tract of country called the manor of courland this was converted into a sort of citadel where large quantities of provisions forage and stores of all kinds were collected about fifty miles from new york up the north river was a place called peekskill which served as a port to the manor of courland the country was so difficult and mountainous that general howe shrank from engaging his army in it he determined however to attack and destroy peekskill and a party of 500 men under the command of colonel bird of the fifteenth regiment were sent up the river in two transports to destroy it the garrison consisting of 800 men set fire to the place and withdrew without firing a shot the british completed the destruction of the stores and returned to new york  a little later 2000 men were sent on a similar expedition against the town of danbury another place on the confines of courland manor where great stores had also been collected they proceeded up the east river and landed at camps point they started on foot at ten oclock at night and after a ten hours march arrived at eight oclock at danbury the enemy evacuated the place on their approach and the english set fire to the great magazines filled with stores of all kinds  the news of the march of the english had spread rapidly and the enemy assembled from all quarters and posted themselves under the command of general arnold at a town called ridgefield through which the english would have to pass on their return here they threw up intrenchments it was late in the afternoon when the english fatigued with the long march arrived at this spot they did not hesitate but when the americans opened fire they boldly assailed the intrenchments and carried them with the bayonet they were unable to march further and lying down so as to form an oblong square slept till morning all night the americans continued to come up in great force and in the morning as the troops advanced a terrible fire was opened upon them from the houses and stone walls in which the country abounded the british had to fight every foot of their way general wooster had brought up some fieldartillery on the side of the americans gradually the column fought its way forward until it arrived within half a mile of camps point here two strong bodies of the enemy barred their way the column was by this time greatly exhausted the men had had no real rest for three days and two nights and several dropped on the road with fatigue brigadier general erskine picked out 400 of those who were in the best condition and attacked the two bodies of the enemy with such vigor that he put them utterly to flight and the column again advancing reached their destination without further molestation nearly 200 men including 10 officers were killed and wounded on the part of the british the loss of the americans was still greater and general wooster and some field officers were among the slain  many other skirmishes took place with varied success the americans at bondwick seven miles from brunswick 1200 in number were surprised and routed by cornwallis while on the other hand the american colonel meigs carried out a most dashing expedition by crossing to long island and destroying a quantity of stores at a place called sag harbor burning a dozen brigs and sloops which lay there taking 90 prisoners and returning safely across the sound  in june washington with 8000 men was encamped in a strong position at middlebrook general howe although he had 30000 men hesitated to attack him here by a feigned retreat he succeeded in drawing general washington from his stronghold and inflicted a decisive defeat on 3000 of his men washington fell back to his position in the mountains and general howe retired altogether from jersey and withdrew his troops to staten island a dashing feat was executed at this time by colonel barton of the american army learning that general prescott who commanded at rhode island had his headquarters at a distance of a mile from his troops he crossed from the mainland in two boats seized the general in his bed and carried him off through the british fleet the object of this dashing enterprise was to obtain a general to exchange for the american general lee who had been captured by the british  general howe in june again marched against washington and again fell back without doing anything had he instead of thus frittering away his strength marched to the delaware crossed that river and advanced against philadelphia washington would have been forced to leave his stronghold and either fight in the open or allow that important city to fall into the hands of the english  general howe now embarked his army in transports had he sailed up the north river to albany he would have effected a junction with general burgoynes army which was advancing from canada and with the united force could have marched through america from end to end as he chose instead of doing so he sailed down to chesapeake bay and there disembarked the whole army which had been pent up in transports from july 3 to august 24 not till september 11 did they advance in earnest toward philadelphia the americans thus had ample time to take up a strong position and fortify it this they did on the other side of brandywine creek under cover of a cannonade the british advanced mastered the fort and carried the intrenchments general sullivan with a considerable force had now arrived accompanied by general washington himself he took up his position a short distance from the brandywine his artillery well placed and his flanks covered with woods  the following afternoon the british attacked the americans fought well but the british were not to be denied and rushing forward drove the enemy from their position into the woods in their rear here they made a stand and were only dislodged after a desperate resistance the greater portion of them fled in all directions washington himself with his guns and a small force retreated eight miles from chester and then marched by derby to philadelphia here he waited three days rallying his troops and then having recruited his stores from the magazines marched away  all this time the british remained inactive on the ground they had won in the battle the americans lost 300 killed 600 wounded and 400 prisoners several guns were also taken the british lost 100 killed and 400 wounded  on september 20 they advanced toward philadelphia the american general wayne had concealed himself in the woods with 1500 men with the intention of harassing the rear of the british army news of this having been obtained major general grey was dispatched at once to surprise him he ordered his men not to load but to rely wholly on the bayonet the success of the expedition was complete general waynes outpost was surprised and the british troops rushed into his encampment three hundred of the americans were killed or wounded and 100 taken prisoners the rest escaped through the woods on the english side 1 officer was killed and 7 privates killed and wounded  the capture of philadelphia was an important advantage to the british but it could not be thoroughly utilized until the fleet could come up the river to the town the american congress which had sat at philadelphia until general howe approached the town had taken extensive measures for rendering the passage impracticable three rows of chevauxdefrise composed of immense beams of timber bolted and fastened together and stuck with iron spikes were sunk across the channel and these lines were protected by batteries at these forts were fourteen large rowboats each carrying a heavy cannon two floating batteries carrying nine guns each and a number of fireships and rafts  the forts commanding the chevauxdefrise were abandoned on the approach of the british and captain hammond of the roebuck succeeded in spite of the opposition of the enemys boats and batteries in making an opening through the chevauxdefrise sufficiently wide for the fleet to pass  large numbers of troops having been sent away from germantown a place seven miles from philadelphia where the main body of the british army were posted general washington determined to attempt the surprise of that position for this purpose he reenforced his army by drawing 1500 troops from peekskill and 1000 from virginia and at daybreak on october 4 under cover of a thick fog he made an attack on the troops posted at the head of the village  half of the british force lay on one side of the village and half on the other and had the attack upon the place succeeded the british army would have been cut in two the village was held by the fortieth regiment who fighting obstinately were driven back among the houses the americans were pushing forward in five heavy columns when lieutenant colonel musgrave who commanded the fortieth threw himself into a large stone house here he offered a desperate resistance and so impeded the advance of the enemy that time was given for the rest of the british troops to get under arms  general washington ordered a whole brigade of infantry to attack the house and turned four guns against it colonel musgrave and his men resisted desperately and held the post until major general grey with the third brigade and brigadier general agnew with the fourth brigade came up and attacked the enemy with great spirit the engagement was for some time very hot at length a part of the right wing fell upon the enemys flank and the americans retired with great precipitation the fog was so dense that no pursuit could be attempted  on the part of the english 600 were killed and wounded the loss of the americans amounted to between 200 and 300 killed 600 wounded and 400 taken prisoners general howe had on the previous night been acquainted with the intention of general washington to attack the place and had he taken the proper measures to have received them the american army would have been destroyed he took no measures whatever gave no warning to the army and suffered the camp to be taken by surprise  after this battle the fleet and army united cleared away the chevauxdefrise across the delaware and took the forts commanding them after some hard fighting  the passage of the delaware being thus opened and the water communication secured the army went to their winter quarters at philadelphia  captain wilson and his son had taken no part in any of these operations as a short time after the capture of harold and harvey by the american cavalry the company had been disbanded the men when they entered the service had volunteered for a year this time already had been greatly exceededtwenty months had passed since the battle of bunkers hilland although the men were willing to continue to give their services so long as it appeared to them that there was a prospect of a favorable termination of the war no such hope any longer remained in their minds the great army which england had sent over had done nothing toward restoring the kings authority in the colonies and if after a years fighting its outposts were still within a few miles of new york how could it be expected or even hoped that it could ever subdue a country containing hundreds of thousands of square miles the retreat from the delaware and the virtual handing over of new jersey again to washington was the finishing stroke which decided the volunteers to demand their discharge according to the terms of their engagement except during the canadian campaign they had had but little fighting nor in such a warfare as that which general howe was carrying on was there much scope for their services many of the gentlemen who formed the majority of the company and who for the most part had friends and connections in england sailed for that country some had left wives and families on their estates when they took up arms and most of them despairing of the final success of the war had instructed their agents to sell these estates for any sum that they would fetch othersamong them captain wilsonnow followed their example it was but a mere tithe of the value of the property that was obtained for money was scarce in the colonies and so many had sold out and gone to england rather than take part on one side or the other of the fratricidal strife that land and houses fetched but nominal prices  mrs wilson had long since gone to england and her husband having made arrangements for the disposal of his property now determined to join her fortunately he possessed means irrespective of his estate in america this had come to him through his wife and his own fortune and the money obtained by the sale of his commission had remained invested in english securities while determined on this course for himself he left it to his son to choose his own career harold was now nearly eighteen and his life of adventure and responsibility had made a man of him his father would have preferred that he should have returned with him to england but harold finally decided upon remaining in war mens passions become heated the original cause of quarrel sinks into comparative insignificance and the desire for victory the determination to resist and a feeling of something like individual hatred for the enemy become predominant motives of the strife  this was especially the case in the american war on both sides there were many circumstances which heightened the passions of the combatants the loyalists in the english ranks had been ruined by the action of their opponentsmany had been reduced from wealth to poverty and each man felt a deep passion of resentment at what he regarded his personal grievance then too the persistent misrepresentations both of facts and motives on the part of the american writers and speakers added to the irritation the loyalists felt that there were vast numbers throughout the colonies who agreed with them and regarded congress as a tyrannical faction rather than the expression of the general will in this no doubt they were to some extent mistaken for by this time the vast majority of the people had joined heart and soul in the conflict mens passions had become so stirred up that it was difficult for any to remain neutral and although there were still large numbers of loyalists throughout the states the vast bulk of the people had resolved that the only issue of the contest was complete and entire separation from the mother country  harold had now entered passionately into the struggle he was in constant contact with men who had been ruined by the war he heard only one side of the question and he was determined so long as england continued the struggle to fight on for a cause which he considered sacred he was unable to regard the prospects of success as hopeless he saw the fine army which england had collected he had been a witness of the defeat of the americans whenever they ventured to stand the shock of the british battalions and in spite of the unsatisfactory nature of the first campaign he could not bring himself to believe that such an army could fail  when the company was disbanded he decided to continue to serve as a scout but sharing in the general disgust in the army at the incapacity of general howe he determined to take ship again for canada and take service under general burgoyne who was preparing with a wellappointed army to invade the states from that side  when he communicated his determination to peter lambton the latter at once agreed to accompany him  ive gone into this business the hunter said and i mean to see it through settling down dont suit me i aint got any friends at new york and id be miserable just loafing about all day doing nothing no ill see this business out to the end and id much rather go with you than anyone else  jake was of the same opinion accustomed all his life to obey orders and to the life on his masters plantation he would not have known what to do if left to his own devices captain wilson pointed out to him that he could easily obtain work on the wharves of new york or as a laborer on a farm but jake would not listen to the proposal and was hurt at the thought that he could leave his young masters side as long as harold continued in the war  accordingly the day after captain wilson sailed for england the three comrades embarked in a ship for halifax whence another vessel took them to quebec they then sailed up the river to montreal and took service as scouts in general burgoynes army  for political reasons general burgoyne had been appointed to the command of the expedition which had been prepared and general carleton naturally offended at being passed over at once resigned the governorship his long residence in canada his knowledge of the country of the manners of its inhabitants and the extent of its resources and his acquaintance with the character of the indians rendered him far more fit for command than was general burgoyne in military knowledge and experience too he was his superior and had he retained a command the fate of the expedition would probably have been very different  the army under general burgoyne consisted of 7173 men exclusive of artillerymen of these about half were germans the canadians were called upon to furnish men sufficient to occupy the woods on the frontier and to provide men for the completion of the fortifications at sorrel st johns chamblée and isleauxnoix to furnish horses and carts for carriage and to make roads when necessary a naval force was to go forward with him on the lake the indian question had again to be decided several tribes volunteered to join the british general burgoyne hesitated as general carleton had done before to accept their services and only did so finally on the certainty that if he refused their offers they would join the americans he resolved to use them as little as possible he knew that their object in all wars was murder and destruction and although he wished to conquer the americans he did not desire to exterminate them  on june 16 1777 general burgoyne advanced from st johns the naval force had preceded the army and opened a way for its advance the troops were carried in a flotilla of boats and under the protection of the fleet passed lake champlain and landed at crown point  harold and his companions had joined the army a fortnight previously and as they crossed the lake with the fleet they could not but remember their last expedition there at crown point they were joined by 1000 indians who marched round the lake and at this place general burgoyne gave them a great feast and afterward made a speech to them exhorting them to abstain from all cruelty to avoid any illtreatment of unarmed combatants and to take as prisoners all combatants who fell into their hands  but while thus exhorting the indians to behave with humanity and moderation the general took a most illjudged step which not only did the english cause great harm but was used by the americans with much effect as a proof of the cruel way in which england warred against the colonists he issued a proclamation threatening to punish with the utmost severity all who refused to attach themselves to the british cause and at the same time he magnified the ferocity of the indians pointing out with great emphasis their eagerness to butcher those who continued hostile to the mother country whose interests they had espoused  this proclamation was naturally construed by the americans as a threat to deliver over to the tender mercies of the indians to slay scalp and destroy all who ventured to resist the authority of the king  the americans had fallen back on the approach of the british and upon the landing being effected the scouts were instantly sent forward  among the indians who had joined at crown point were the senecasamong them their old friend deer tail  the scouts received no particular orders and were free to regulate their own movements their duty was to reconnoiter the country ahead and to bring in any information they might gather as to numbers and positions of the enemy  finding that peter and his companions were about to start deer tail said that instead of waiting for the feast he would take five of his warriors and accompany them  it was at ticonderoga that the americans had prepared to make their first stand the place lies on the western shore of the lake a few miles to the northward of the narrow inlet uniting lake champlain to lake george it was to reconnoiter the fort that the party now set out news had been brought that the americans had been executing great additional works and the british general was anxious to learn the nature of these before he advanced  it was certain that the enemy would on their side have sent out scouts to ascertain the movements of the royal army and the party proceeded with the greatest care they marched in the usual fashionin indian file the seneca chief led the way followed by one of his braves then came peter harold and jake the other senecas marched in the rear  when they came within a few miles of the fort their progress was marked with profound caution not a word was spoken their tread was noiseless and the greatest pains were taken to avoid stepping on a twig or dried stick the three scouts when they left st johns had abandoned their boots and had taken to indian moccasins several times slight murmurs were heard in the forest and once a party of four american frontiersmen were seen in the wood the party halted and crouched in the bushes the senecas turned toward peter as if asking if an attack should be made but the latter shook his head a single shot would have been heard far away in the woods and their further progress would have been arrested their object now was not to fight but to penetrate close to the american intrenchments  when the enemy had passed on the party continued its way as they neared the fort the caution observed increased several times they halted while the seneca with one of his braves crawled forward to see that all was clear at last they stood on the edge of a great clearing before them just within gunshot range stood the fort of ticonderoga peter lambton was well acquainted with it and beyond the fact that the space around had been cleared of all trees and the stockades and earthworks repaired little change could be seen  as he was gazing the indian touched his shoulder and pointed to a high hill on the opposite side of the narrow straits this had been cleared of trees and on the top a strong fort had been erected many cannon were to be seen along its crest the roofs of huts and a large number of men halfway up the hill was another battery and a third still lower down to sweep the landing  theyve been working hard the hunter said and the armyll have a mighty tough job before it what do you think of that harold  it is a very strong position harold said and will cost us a tremendous number of men to take it the fort cannot be attacked till that hill has been carried for its guns completely command all this clearing  for some time they stood gazing at the works standing well back among the trees so as to be screened from all observation at last harold said  look at that other hill behind it is a good bit higher than that which they have fortified and must be within easy range both of it and the fort i dont see any works theredo you  peter and the seneca chief both gazed long and earnestly at the hill and agreed that they could see no fortification there  it wont do to have any doubt about it peter said we must go round and have a look at it  we shall have to cross the river harold remarked  ay cross it we must peter said that hills got to be inspected  they withdrew into the wood again and made a circuitous deviation till they came down upon the river two miles above ticonderoga they could not reach the water itself as a road ran along parallel with it and the forest was cleared away for some distance a number of men could be seen going backward and forward on the road  having made their observations the scouts retired again into a thick part of the forest and waited till nightfall  how are we to get across harold asked peter its a good long swim and we could not carry our muskets and ammunition across  easy enough the scout said didnt you notice down by the road a pile of planks i suppose a wagon has broke down there and the planks have been turned out and nobody has thought anything more about em well each take a plank fasten our rifle and ammunition on it and swim across there wont be any difficulty about that then when weve seen whats on the top of that ere hill well tramp round to the other end of the lake i heard that the army was to advance half on each side so well meet em coming  when it was perfectly dark they left their hiding place and crossed the clearing to the spot where peter had seen the planks each took one of them and proceeded to the river side peter harold and jake divested themselves of some of their clothes and fastened these with their rifles and ammunition to the planks to the indians the question of getting wet was one of entire indifference and they did not even take off their hunting shirts entering the water the party swam noiselessly across to the other side pushing their planks before them on getting out they carried the planks for some distance as their appearance by the waters edge might excite a suspicion on the part of the americans that the works had been reconnoitered  after hiding the planks in the bushes they made their way to sugar hill as the eminence was called the ascent was made with great circumspection the indians going on first no signs of the enemy were met with and at last the party stood on the summit of the hill it was entirely unoccupied by the americans  well my fine fellows laughed the scout i reckon yeve been doing a grist of work and ye might jest as well have been sitting down quietly smoking yer pipes what on arth possessed ye to leave this hill unguarded  in point of fact general st clair who commanded the americans had perceived that his position was commanded from this spot he had only 3000 men under him and he considered this number too small to hold ticonderoga mount independence and sugar hill the two former posts could afford no assistance to the garrison of a fort placed on sugar hill and that place must therefore fall if attacked by the british on the other hand he hoped that should the attention of the english not be called to the importance of the position by the erection of works upon it it might be overlooked and that general burgoyne on his arrival might at once attack the position which he had prepared with so much care  having ascertained that the hill was unoccupied peter proposed at once to continue the march harold suggested to him that it would be better to wait until morning as from their lofty position they would be able to overlook the whole of the enemys lines of defense and might obtain information of vital importance to the general peter saw the advantage of the suggestion two of the indians were placed on watch and the rest of the party lay down to sleep at daybreak they saw that the delay had been fully justified for they had now a view of the water which separated ticonderoga from mount independence and perceived that the americans had made a strong bridge of communication between these posts twentytwo piers had been sunk at equal distances and between them boats were placed fastened with chains to the piers a strong bridge of planks connected the whole on the lake champlain side of the bridge a boom composed of great trees fastened together with double chains had been placed thus not only had communication been established across the stream but an effectual barrier erected to the passage of the fleet fully satisfied with the result of their investigations the party set out on their return     chapter xii   the settlers hut  before starting they stood for a minute or two looking over the forest which they were to traverse to harolds eyes all appeared quiet and still here and there were clearings where settlers had established themselves but with these exceptions the forest stretched away like a green sea  tarnation peter exclaimed well have all our work to get through safely eh chief  the seneca nodded  what makes you say so harold asked in surprise i see nothing  peter looked at him reproachfully  im downright ashamed of ye lad you should have been long enough in the woods by this time to know smoke when you see it why there it is curling up from the trees in a dozenay in a score of places there must be hundreds of men out scouting or camping in them woods  harold looked fixedly again at the forests but even now he could not detect the signs which were so plain to the scout  you may call me as blind as a bat peter he said with a laugh but i can see nothing looking hard i imagine i can see a light mist here and there but i believe it is nothing but fancy  its clear enough to me lad and to the redskins what do you say chief  too much men the seneca replied sententiously  for another minute or two he and peter stood watching the forest and then in a few words consulted together as to the best line to follow to avoid meeting the foe who to their eyes swarmed in the forest  its mighty lucky the hunter said as they turned to descend the hill which was covered with trees to its very summit that theyre white men and not redskins out in the woods there i dont say that theres not many frontiersmen who know the way of the woods as well as the redskins i do myself and when it comes to fighting we can lick em on their own ground but in scouting we aint nowherenot the best of us the redskin seems to have an instinct more like that of an animal than a man i dont say as he can smell a man a mile off as a dog can do but he seems to know when the enemys about his ears can hear noises which we cant his eyes see marks on the ground when the keenestsighted white man sees nothing if that wood was as full of redskins as it is of whites today our sculps wouldnt be worth a charge of powder  you are not going to follow the shores of the lake i suppose harold asked  no peter said theyll be as thick as peas down there watching for the first sight of our fleet no we must just keep through the woods and be as still and as silent as if the trees had ears youd best look to the priming of yer piece before we goes further for its likely enough youll have to use it before the days done and a missfire might cost you yer life tell that nigger of yourn that hes not to open his mouth again till i gives him leave  with a long stealthy tread the party descended the mountain and took their way through the woods every hundred yards or so they stopped and listened intently when any noise even of the slightest kind was heard all dropped to the ground until the chief had scouted round and discovered the way was clear once or twice they heard the sound of mens voices and a distant laugh but they passed on without seeing those who uttered them  presently they again heard voices this time raised as if in angry dispute the seneca would as before have made a long détour to avoid them but peter said  lets have a squint at whats going on chief  with redoubled caution they again advanced until they stood at the edge of the clearing it was a patch of land some hundred yards wide and extending from the shore of the lake nearly a quarter of a mile inland in the center stood a log hut neatly and carefully built a few flowers grew around the house and the whole bore signs of greater neatness and comfort than was usual in the cabins of the backwood settlers  the point where the party had reached the edge of the wood was immediately opposite the house near it stood a group of some twenty men one of whom apparently their leader was gesticulating angrily as he addressed a man who stood facing him  i tell ye yere a darned royalistyere a traitor to the country and ive a mind to hang ye and all belonging to ye to the nearest bough  i tell you the man answered calmly but in the still air every word he said could be heard by those at the edge of the forest i hae naething to do with the trouble ane way or the ither i am a quiet settler whose business only is to mak a hame for my wife and bairn but if you ask me to drink success to the congress and confusion to the kings troops i tell you i willna do it not even if you are brutal enough but this i canna believe possible to carry your threats into execution i hae served my time in a kings regiment with the bounty i received instead o pension on my discharge i settled here wi my wife and bairn and no one shall say that duncan cameron was a traitor to his king we do no harm to anyone we tak no part for or against you we only ask to be allowed to live in peace  that ye shall not the man said the kings troops have got injuns with em and theyre going to burn and kill all those who wont take part with em its time we should show em as we can play at that game too now yeve either got to swear to be faithful to the states of america or up you go  i canna swear the settler said firmly you may kill me if you will but if you are men you will nae harm my wife and girl  well just do to you as the redskinsll do to our people the man said well make a sweep of the hull lot of you here you fellows fetch the woman and girl out of the house and then set a light to it  four or five men entered the house a minute later screams were heard and a woman and child were dragged out the settler sprang toward them but three or four men seized him  now the man said stepping toward the house well show em a bonfire  as he neared the door a crack of a rifle was heard and the ruffian fell dead in his tracks a yell of astonishment and rage broke from his followers  jerusalem youngster youve got us into a nice fix howsomever since youve begun it here goes  and the rifle of the hunter brought down another of the americans these following the first impulse of a frontiersman when attacked fled for shelter to the house leaving the settler with his wife and daughter standing alone  yed best get out of the way peter shouted or ye may get a bit of lead that wasnt intended for ye  catching up his child cameron ran toward the forest making for the side on which his unknown friends were placed but keeping down toward the lake so as to be out of their line of fire  make down to em harold peter said tell em theyd best go to some neighbors and stop there for a day or two the armyll be here tomorrow or next day be quick about it and come back as fast as ye can i tell ye were in a hornets nest and itll be as much as we can do to get out of it  a scattering fire was now being exchanged between the redskins behind the shelter of the trees and the americans firing from the windows of the log house harold was but two or three minutes absent  all right peter he exclaimed as he rejoined them  come along then the hunter said now chief lets make up round the top of this clearing and then foot it  the chief at once put himself at the head of the party and the nine men strode away again through the forest it was no longer silent behind them the occupants of the hut were still keeping up a brisk fire toward the trees while from several quarters shouts could be heard and more than once the indian warwhoop rose in the forest  thats just what i was afeared of peter muttered theres some of those darned varmint with em we might have found our way through the whites but the redskinsll pick up our trail as sartin as if we were driving a wagon through the woods  going along at a swinging noiseless trot the party made their way through the forest presently a prolonged indian whoop was heard in the direction from which they had come then there were loud shouts and the firing ceased  one of the red reptiles has found our trail peter said hes with a party of whites and theyve shouted the news to the gang in the clearing waal we may calculate weve got thirty on our trail and as we can hear them all round itll be a sarcumstance if we git out with our sculps  as they ran they heard shouts from those behind answered by others on both flanks shots too were fired as signals to call the attention of other parties several times the seneca chief stopped and listened attentively and then changed his course as he heard suspicious noises ahead those behind them were coming up although still at some distance in the rear they could hear the sound of breaking trees and bushes as their pursuers followed them in a body  ef it was only the fellows behind peter said we could leave them easy enough but the wood seems alive with the varmint  it was evident the alarm had spread through the forest and that the bands scattered here and there were aware that an enemy was in their midst the dropping fire which the pursuers kept up afforded an indication as to the direction in which they were making and the ringing warwhoop of the hostile indians conveyed the intelligence still more surely  presently there was a shout a short distance ahead followed by the sound of a rifle ball as it whizzed close to harolds head and buried itself in a tree that he was passing in a moment each of the party had sheltered behind a tree  its of no use chief peter said well have the hull pack from behind upon us in five minutes we must run for it and take our chances of being hit  swerving somewhat from their former line they again ran on bullets whisked round them but they did not pause to fire a shot in return  tarnation peter exclaimed as the trees in front of them opened and they found themselves on the edge of another clearing it was considerably larger than that which they had lately left being three hundred yards across and extending back from the lake fully half a mile as in the previous case a log hut stood in the center some two hundred yards back from the lake  theres nothing for it chief peter said we must take to the house and fight it out there theres a hull gang of fellows in the forest ahead and theyll shoot us down if we cross the clearing  without a moments hesitation the party rushed across the clearing to the hut several shots were fired as they dashed across the open but they gained the place of refuge in safety the hut was deserted it had probably belonged to royalists for its rough furniture lay broken on the ground boxes and cupboards had been forced open and the floor was strewn with broken crockery and portions of wearing apparel  harold looked round several of the party were bleeding from slight wounds  now to the windows peter said as he barred the door pile up bedding and anything else that ye can find against the shutters and keep yerselves well under cover dont throw away a shot well want all our powder i can tell ye quickly nowthere aint no time to be lost  while some began carrying out his instructions below others bounded upstairs and scattered themselves through the upper rooms there were two windows on each side of the houseone at each end disregarding the latter peter and harold took post at the windows looking toward the forest from which they had just come the chief and another indian posted themselves to watch the other side at first no one was to be seen the party who had fired at them as they ran across the open had waited for the coming up of the strong band who were following before venturing to show themselves the arrival of the pursuers was heralded by the opening of a heavy fire toward the house as the assailants kept themselves behind trees no reply was made and the defenders occupied themselves by piling the bedding against the shutters which they had hastily closed loopholes had been left in the walls when the hut was first built the moss with which they were filled up was torn out and each man took his post at one of these as no answering shot came from the house the assailants became bolder and one or two ventured to show themselves from behind shelter in a moment harold and peter whose rifles would carry more truly and much further than those of the indians fired  two wiped out peter said as the men fell and shouts of anger arose from the woods thatll make them careful  this proof of the accuracy of the aim of the besieged checked their assailants and for some time they were very careful not to expose themselves from both sides of the forest a steady fire was maintained occasionally an answering shot flashed out from the house when one of the enemy incautiously showed an arm or a part of his body from behind the trees and it was seldom the rifles were fired in vain four or five of the americans were shot through the head as they leaned forward to fire and after an hours exchange of bullets the attack ceased  what are they going to do now harold asked  i expect theyre going to wait till nightfall peter said theres no moon and theyll be able to work up all round the house then theyll make a rush at the door and lower windows well shoot down a good many on em and then theyll burst their way in or set fire to the hut and therell be an end of it thats whatll happen  and you think there is no way of making our way out harold asked  its a mighty poor chance if theres one at all the hunter replied i should say by the fire there must be nigh a hundred of em now and its likely that by nightfall therell be three times as many as soon as it gets dusk theyll creep out from the woods and form a circle round the house and gradually work up to it now lets cook some vittles weve had nothing to eat this morning yet and it must be nigh eleven oclock i dont see why we should be starved even if we have got to be killed tonight  one of the party was left on watch on each side of the house and the others gathered in the room below where a fire was lit and the strips of dried deer flesh which they carried were soon frying over it harold admired the air of indifference with which his companions set about preparing the meat everyone was aware of the desperate nature of the position but no allusion was made to it the negro had caught the spirit of his companions but his natural loquacity prevented his imitating their habitual silence  dis bad affair massa harold he said we jess like so many coons up in tree wid a whole pack ob dogs round us and de hunters in de distance coming up wid de guns dis chile reckon dat some ob dem hunters will get hit hard before dey get us jake dont care one bit for himself massa but he bery sorry to see you in such a fix  it cant be helped jake harold said as cheerfully as he could it was my firing that shot which got us into it and yet i cannot blame myself we could not stand by and see those ruffians murder a woman and child  dats so massa harold dere was no possinbility of seeing dat i reckon dat when dose rascals come to climb de stairs deyll find it are bery hard work  i dont think they will try jake they are more likely to heap brushwood against the door and windows and set it alight and then shoot us down as we rush out this hut is not like the one i had to defend against the iroquois that was built to repel indians attacks this is a mere squatters hut  after the meal was over peter and the seneca chief went upstairs looked through the loopholes and talked long and earnestly together then they rejoined the party below  the chief and i are of opinion peter said to harold that it are of no manner of use our waiting to be attacked here theyd burn us out to a sartinty we should have no show of a fight at all anythings better than that now what we propose is that directly it gets fairly dark well all creep out and make for the lake even if they have formed their circle round us they aint likely to be as thick there as they are on the other side what theyll try to do in course is to prevent our taking to the forest and therell be such a grist of em that i dont believe one of us would get through alive if we tried it now theyll not be so strong toward the lake and we might break through to the water i dont say as theres much chance of our getting away for i tell you fairly that i dont believe that theres any chance at all but the chief here and his braves dont want their sculps to hang in the wigwams of the chippewas and i myself ef i had the choice would rather be drownded than shot down it dont make much difference but of the two i had rather ef we can reach the lake we can swim out of gunshot range i know you can swim like a fish and so can jake and the indians swim as a matter of course ef we dive at first we may get off itll be so dark they wont see us with any sartainty beyond fifty yards when were once fairly out in the lake we can take our chance  and is there a chance peter although if there is none i quite agree with you that i would rather be drowned than shot down if one were sure of being killed by the first shot that would be the easiest death but if we were only wounded they would probably hang us in the morning  thats so the hunter said waal i can hardly say that theres a chance and yet i cant say as how there aint in the first place they may have some canoes and come out after us theres pretty safe to be some along the shore here the settlers would have had em for fishing  but what chance will that give us harold asked  waal the hunter replied i reckon in that case as our chance is a fair one ef we dive and come up close alongside we may manage to upset one of em and in that case we might get off thats one chance then ef they dont come out in canoes we might swim three or four miles down the lake and take to land they couldnt tell which way to go and would have to scatter over a long line its just possible as we might land without being seen once in the woods and wed be safe so you see we have two chances in course we must throw away our rifles and ammunition before we come to the water  at any rate harold said the plan is a hopeful one and i agree with you that it is a thousand times better to try it than it is to stop here with the certainty of being shot down before morning  the afternoon passed quietly a few shots were fired occasionally from the wood and taunting shouts were heard of the fate which awaited them when night approached  a vigilant watch was kept from the upper windows but peter thought that it was certain the enemy would make no move until it became perfectly dark although they would establish a strong cordon all round the clearing in case the besieged should try and break out harold trembled with impatience to be off as the night grew darker and darker it seemed to him that at any moment the assailants might be narrowing the circle round the house and had he been a leader he would have given the word long before the scout made a move  at last peter signaled that the time had come it was perfectly dark when the bars were noiselessly removed from the door and the party stole out everything seemed silent but the very stillness made the danger appear more terrible peter had impressed upon harold and jake the necessity for moving without making the slightest noise as soon as they left the house the whole party dropped on their hands and knees peter and the seneca chief led the way two of the braves came next harold and jake followed the remaining indians crawled in the rear peter had told his comrades to keep as close as possible to the indians in front of them and grasping their rifles they crept along the ground as they led the way peter and the seneca carefully removed from before them every dried twig and threw it on one side  the distance to be traversed from the hut to the water was about two hundred yards and half of this was passed over before they encountered any obstacle then suddenly there was an exclamation and peter and the seneca sprang to their feet as they came in contact with two men crawling in the opposite direction they were too close to use their rifles but a crushing blow from the senecas tomahawk cleft down the man in front of him while peter drew his long knife from its sheath and buried it in the body of his opponent  the others had also leaped to their feet and each as he did so fired at the dark figures which rose around them they had the advantage of the surprise several scattered shots answered their volley then with their rifles clubbed they rushed forward for a moment there was a handtohand fight harold had just struck down a man opposite to him when another sprang upon him so sudden was the attack that he fell from the shock but in an instant jake buried his knife between his opponents shoulders and dragged harold to his feet  run for your life massa harold de whole gangs upon us  and indeed the instant the first shot broke the silence of the woods a babel of sounds arose from the whole circuit of the clearing shouts and yells burst out from hundreds of throats there was no further use for concealment and from all sides the men who had been advancing to the attack rushed in the direction where the conflict was taking place this lasted but a few seconds as peter had expected the line was thinner toward the lake than upon the other sides and the rush of nine men had broken through it shouts were heard from the woods on either side extending down to the water showing that the precaution had been taken by the assailants of leaving a portion of their force to guard the line of forest should the defenders break through the circle  at headlong speed the little band rushed down to the waters side dropped their ammunition pouches by its edge threw their rifles a few yards into the water to be recovered perhaps on some future occasion and then dived in the nearest of the pursuers were some thirty yards behind when they neared the waters edge swimming as far under water as they could hold their breath each came to the surface for an instant and then again dived momentarily as they showed themselves they heard the rattle of musketry behind and the bullets splashed thickly on the water the night however was so dark that the fire could only be a random one until far out from the shore they continued diving and then gathered together  were pretty well out of range now peter said and quite out of sight of the varmints now we can wait a bit and see what they do next  the enemy were still keeping up a heavy fire from the shore hallooing and shouting to each other as they fancied they caught a glimpse of their enemies  there must be two or three hundred of em peter said weve fooled em nicely so far  by the crashing of the bushes the fugitives could hear strong parties making their way along the shore in either direction an hour passed during which the fugitives floated nearly opposite the clearing  hullo peter exclaimed presently theres a canoe coming along the lake i expect they got it from camerons  as he spoke a canoe appeared round the point two men were standing up holding blazing torches two others paddled while two rifle in hand sat by them almost at the same moment another canoe similarly manned pushed out from the shore immediately opposite  i wish we had known of that canoe peter said it would have saved us a lot of trouble but we had no time for looking about i suspected them settlers must have had one laid up somewheres now he went on lets make our plans the canoes are sure to keep pretty nigh each other theyll most likely think as weve gone down the lake andll not be looking very sharply after us at present itll never do to let em pass us now jake and i and two of the injuns will take one canoe and the chief and three of his braves the other we must move round so as to get between em and the shore and then dive and come up close to em now harold do you swim out a bit further and then make a splash so as to call their attention do it once or twice till you see that theyve got their eyes turned that way then be very quiet so as to keep em watching for another sound thatll be our moment for attacking em  they waited till the two canoes joined each other and paddled slowly out from the shore then the eight swimmers started off to make their détour while harold swam quietly further out into the lake the canoes were about three hundred yards from shore and were paddling very slowly the occupants keeping a fixed look along the lake there was perfect quiet on the shore now and when harold made a slight splash with his hand upon the water he saw that it was heard both canoes stopped rowing the steerers in each case giving them a steer so that they lay broadside to the land giving each man a view over the lake they sat as quiet as if carved in stone again harold made a splash but this time a very slight one so slight that it could hardly reach the ears of the listeners  a few words were exchanged by the occupants of the boats  they are further out on the lake bill one said  i am not sure another answered i rather think the sound was further down listen again  again they sat motionless harold swam with his eyes fixed upon them every face was turned his way and none was looking shoreward then almost at the same instant there was a shout from both boats the men with torches seemed to lose their balance the lights described a half circle through the air and were extinguished a shout of astonishment broke from the occupants mingled with the wild seneca waryell and he knew that both canoes were upset  there was a sound of a desperate struggle going on oaths and wild cries rose from the water heavy blows were struck while from the shore arose loud shouts of dismay and rage in two minutes all was quiet on the water then came peters shout  this way harold well have the canoes righted and bailed in a minute the varmins all wiped out  with a lightened heart harold swam toward the spot the surprise had been a complete success the occupants of the canoes intent only upon the pursuit and having no fear of attackfor they knew that the fugitives must have thrown away their rifleswere all gazing intently out on the lake when close to each canoe on the shore side four heads rose from out of the water in an instant eight hands had seized the gunwales and before the occupants were aware of their danger the canoes were upset  taken wholly by surprise the americans were no match for their assailants the knives of the latter did their work before the frontiersmen had thoroughly grasped what had happened two or three indeed had made a desperate fight but they were no match for their opponents and the struggle was quickly over  on harold reaching the canoes he found them already righted and half emptied of water the paddles were picked up and in a few minutes with a derisive shout of adieu to their furious enemy on the shore the two canoes paddled out into the lake when they had attained a distance of about half a mile from the shore they turned the boats heads and paddled north in three hours they saw lights in the wood  theres the troops peter said soldiers are never content unless theyre making fires big enough to warn every redskin within fifty miles that theyre coming  as they approached the shore the challenge from the english sentinel came over the water  who comes there  friends peter replied  give the password  how on arth am i to give the password peter shouted back when weve been three days away from the camp  if you approach without the password i fire the sentinel said  i tell ye peter shouted were scouts with news for the general  i cant help who you are the sentinel said i have got my orders  pass the word along for an officer harold shouted we have important news  the sentry called to the one next him and so the word was passed along the line in a few minutes an officer appeared on the shore and after a short parley the party were allowed to land and peter and harold were at once conducted to the headquarters of general burgoyne     chapter xiii   saratoga  what is your report asked general burgoyne as the scouts were conducted into his tent  we have discovered sir that the americans have strongly fortified mount independence which faces ticonderoga and have connected the two places by a bridge across the river which is protected by a strong boom both positions are however overlooked by sugar hill and this they have entirely neglected to fortify if you were to seize this they would have to retire at once  the general expressed his satisfaction at the news and gave orders that steps should be taken to seize sugar hill immediately he then questioned the scouts as to their adventures and praised them highly for their conduct  the next day the army advanced and at nightfall both divisions were in their places having arrived within an hour or two of each other from the opposite sides of the lake sugar hill was seized the same night and a strong party were set to work cutting a road through the trees the next morning the enemy discovered the british at work erecting a battery on the hill and their general decided to evacuate both ticonderoga and mount independence instantly their baggage provisions and stores were embarked in two hundred boats and sent up the river the army started to march by the road  the next morning the english discovered that the americans had disappeared captain lutwych immediately set to work to destroy the bridge and boom whose construction had taken the americans nearly twelve months labor by nine in the morning a passage was effected and some gunboats passed through in pursuit of the enemys convoy they overtook them near skenesborough engaged and captured many of their largest craft and obliged them to set several others on fire together with a large number of their boats and barges  a few hours afterward a detachment of british troops in gunboats came up the river to skenesborough the cannon on the works which the americans had erected there opened fire but the troops were landed and the enemy at once evacuated their works setting fire to their storehouses and mills while these operations had been going on by water brigadier general fraser at the head of the advance corps of grenadiers and light infantry pressed hard upon the division of the enemy which had retired by the hubberton road and overtook them at five oclock in the morning  the division consisted of fifteen hundred of the best colonial troops under the command of colonel francis they were posted on strong ground and sheltered by breastworks composed of logs and old trees general frasers detachment was inferior in point of numbers to that of the defenders of the position but as he expected a body of the german troops under general reidesel to arrive immediately he at once attacked the breastworks the americans defended their post with great resolution and bravery the reenforcements did not arrive so soon as was expected and for some time the british made no way  general reidesel hearing the fire in front pushed forward at full speed with a small body of troops among these was the band which he ordered to play  the enemy hearing the music and supposing that the whole of the german troops had come up evacuated the position and fell back with precipitation colonel francis and many others were killed and two hundred taken prisoners on the english side 120 men were killed and wounded  the enemy from skenesborough were pursued by colonel hill with the ninth regiment and were overtaken near fort anne finding how small was the force that pursued them in comparison to their own they took the offensive a hot engagement took place and after three hours fighting the americans were repulsed with great slaughter and forced to retreat after setting fire to fort anne and fort edward  in these operations the british captured 148 guns with large quantities of stores at fort edward general schuyler was joined by general st clair but even with this addition the total american strength did not exceed fortyfour hundred  instead of returning from skenesborough to ticonderoga whence he might have sailed with his army up to lake george general burgoyne proceeded to cut his way through the woods to the lake the difficulties of the passage were immense swamps and morasses had to be passed bridges had to be constructed over creeks ravines and gulleys the troops worked with great vigor and spirit major general phillips had returned to lake george and transported the artillery provisions and baggage to fort george and thence by land to a point on the hudson river together with a large number of boats for the use of the army in their intended descent to albany  so great was the labor entailed by this work that it was not until july 30 that the army arrived on the hudson river the delay of three weeks had afforded the enemy time to recover their spirits and recruit their strength general arnold arrived with a strong reenforcement and a force was detached to check the progress of colonel st leger who was coming down from montreal by way of lake ontario and the mohawk river to effect a junction with general burgoyne  general burgoyne determined to advance at once the army was already suffering from want of transportation and he decided to send a body of troops to bennington twentyfour miles to the eastward of the hudson river where the americans had large supplies collected instead of sending light infantry he dispatched six hundred germansthe worst troops he could have selected for this purpose as they were very heavily armed and marched exceedingly slowly several of the officers remonstrated with him but with his usual infatuated obstinacy he maintained his disposition  on approaching bennington colonel baum who commanded the germans found that a very strong force was gathered there he sent back for reenforcements and five hundred more germans under lieutenant colonel breyman were dispatched to his assistance long however before these slowly moving troops could arrive colonel baum was attacked by the enemy in vastly superior numbers the germans fought with great bravery and several times charged the americans and drove them back fresh troops continued to come up on the enemys side and the germans having lost a large number of men including their colonel were forced to retreat into the woods the enemy then advanced against colonel breyman who was ignorant of the disaster that had befallen baum and with his detachment had occupied twentyfour hours in marching sixteen miles the germans again fought well but after a gallant resistance were obliged to fall back in these two affairs they lost six hundred men  in the meantime colonel st leger had commenced his attack upon fort stanwix which was defended by seven hundred men the american general herkimer advanced with one thousand men to its relief colonel st leger detached sir john johnson with a party of regulars and a number of indians who had accompanied him to meet them the enemy advanced incautiously and fell into an ambush a terrible fire was poured into them and the indians then rushed down and attacked them hand to hand the americans although taken by surprise fought bravely and succeeded in making their retreat leaving four hundred killed and wounded behind them  colonel st leger had no artillery which was capable of making any impression on the defenses of the fort its commander sent out a man who pretending to be a deserter entered the british camp and informed colonel st leger that general burgoyne had been defeated and his army cut to pieces and that general arnold with two thousand men was advancing to raise the siege colonel st leger did not credit the news but it created a panic among the indians the greater portion of whom at once retired without orders and st leger having but a small british force with him was compelled to follow their example leaving his artillery and stores behind him  on september 13 general burgoyne having with immense labor collected thirty days provisions on the hudson crossed the river by a bridge of boats and encamped on the heights of saratoga his movements had been immensely hampered by the vast train of artillery which he took with him in an open country a powerful force of artillery is of the greatest service to an army but in a campaign in a wooded and roadless country it is of little utility and enormously hampers the operations of an army had general burgoyne after the capture of ticonderoga pressed forward in light order without artillery he could unquestionably have marched to new york without meeting with any serious opposition but the six weeks delay had enabled the americans to collect a great force to oppose them  on the 19th as the army were advancing to stillwater five thousand of the enemy attacked the british right they were led by general arnold and fought with great bravery and determination the brunt of the battle fell on the twentieth twentyfourth and sixtysecond regiments for four hours the fight continued without any advantage on either side and at nightfall the americans drew off each side having lost about six hundred men after the battle of stillwater the whole of the indians with general burgoyne left him and returned to canada  hampered with his great train of artillery unprovided with transportation in the face of a powerful enemy posted in an exceedingly strong position general burgoyne could neither advance nor retreat the forage was exhausted and the artillery horses were dying in great numbers he had hoped that sir william howe would have sailed up the hudson and joined him but the english commanderinchief had taken his army down to philadelphia sir henry clinton who commanded at new york endeavored with a small force at his command to make a diversion by operating against the american posts on the hudson river but this was of no utility  burgoynes army was now reduced to little more than five thousand men and he determined to fall back upon the lakes before doing this however it would be necessary to dislodge the americans from their posts on his left leaving the camp under the command of general hamilton burgoyne advanced with fifteen hundred men against them but scarcely had the detachment started when the enemy made a furious attack on the british left major ackland with the grenadiers was posted here and for a time defended himself with great bravery the light infantry and twentyfourth were sent to their assistance but overpowered by numbers the left wing was forced to retreat into their intrenchments these the enemy led by general arnold at once attacked with great impetuosity for a long time the result was doubtful and it was not until the american leader was wounded that the attack ceased in the meantime the intrenchments defended by the german troops under colonel breyman had also been attacked here the fight was obstinate but the german intrenchments were carried colonel breyman killed and his troops retreated with the loss of all their baggage and artillery two hundred prisoners fell into the hands of the americans  that night the british army was concentrated on the heights above the hospital general gates who commanded the americans moved his army so as to entirely inclose the british and the latter on the night of october 8 retired to saratoga being obliged to leave all their sick and wounded in the hospital these were treated with the greatest kindness by the americans an attempt was now made to retreat to fort george or fort edward but the americans had taken up positions on each road and fortified them with cannon  only about thirtyfive hundred fighting men now remained of whom but onehalf were british and scarcely eight days provisions were left the enemy four times superior in point of numbers held every line of retreat and eluded every attempt of the british to force them to a general engagement  the position was hopeless and on october 13 a council of war was held and it was determined to open negotiations for a surrender two days were spent in negotiations and it was finally agreed that the army should lay down its arms and that it should be marched to boston and there allowed to sail for england on condition of not serving again in north america during the contest the canadians were to be allowed to return at once to their own country on the 16th the army laid down its arms it consisted of thirtyfive hundred fighting men and six hundred sick and nearly two thousand boatmen teamsters and other noneffectives  never did a general behave with greater incompetence than that manifested by general burgoyne from the day of his leaving ticonderoga and the disaster which befell his army was entirely the result of mismanagement procrastination and faulty generalship  had harold remained with the army until its surrender his share in the war would have been at an end for the canadians as well as all others who laid down their arms gave their word of honor not to serve again during the war he had however with peter lambton and jake accompanied colonel baums detachment on its march to bennington scouting in front of the column they had ascertained the presence of large numbers of the enemy and had by hastening back with the news enabled the german colonel to make some preparations for resistance before the attack was made upon him during the fight that ensued the scouts posted behind trees on the german left had assisted them to repel the attack from that quarter and when the germans gave way they effected their escape into the woods and managed to rejoin the army  they had continued with it until it moved to the hospital heights after the disastrous attack by the americans on their camp general burgoyne then sent for peter lambton who was he knew one of his most active and intelligent scouts  could you make your way through the enemys lines down to ticonderoga he asked  i could try general peter said me and the party who work with me could get through if anyone could but more nor that i cant say the yanks are swarming around pretty thick i reckon but if we have luck we might make a shift to get through  i have hopes the general said that another regiment for which i asked general carleton has arrived there here is a letter to general powell who is in command to beg him to march with all his available force and fall upon the enemy posted on our line of communication unless the new regiment has reached him he will not have a sufficient force to attempt this but if this has come up he may be able to do so he is to march in the lightest order and at full speed so as to take the enemy by surprise twelve hours before he starts you will bring me back news of his coming and i will move out to meet him his operations in their rear will confuse the enemy and enable me to operate with a greater chance of success i tell you this because if you are surrounded and in difficulties you may have to destroy my dispatch you can then convey my instructions by word of mouth to general powell if you succeed in getting through  upon leaving headquarters peter joined his friends  its a risksome business he went on after informing them of the instructions he had received but i dont know as its much more risksome than stopping here it dont seem to me that this army is like to get out of the trap into which their general has led em whatever he wanted to leave the lakes for is more nor i can tell however generaling aint my business and i wouldnt change places with the old man today not for a big sum of money now chief what do you say hows this ere business to be carried out  the seneca with the five braves who had from the first accompanied them were now the only indians with the british army the rest of the redskins disgusted with the dilatory progress of the army and foreseeing inevitable disaster had all betaken themselves to their homes they were moreover angered at the severity with which the english general had endeavored to suppress their tendency to acts of cruelty on the defenseless settlers the redskin has no idea of civilized warfare his sole notion of fighting is to kill burn and destroy and the prohibition of all irregular operations and of the infliction of unnecessary suffering was in his eyes an act of incomprehensible weakness the seneca chief remained with the army simply because his old comrade did so he saw that there was little chance of plunder but he and his braves had succeeded in fair fight in obtaining many scalps and would at least be received with high honor on their return to their tribe  a long discussion took place between the chief and peter before they finally decided upon the best course to be pursued they were ignorant of the country and of the disposition of the enemys force and could only decide to act upon general principles they thought it probable that the americans would be most thickly posted upon the line between the british army and the lakes and their best chance of success would therefore be to make their way straight ahead for some distance and then when they had penetrated the american lines to make a long détour round to the lakes  taking four days provisions with them they started when nightfall had fairly set in it was intensely dark and in the shadows of the woods harold was unable to see his hand before him the indians appeared to have a faculty of seeing in the dark for they advanced without the slightest pause or hesitation and were soon in the open country the greatest vigilance was now necessary everywhere they could hear the low hum which betokens the presence of many men gathered together sometimes a faint shout came to their ears and for a long distance around the glow in the sky told of many fires the party now advanced with the greatest caution frequently halting while the indians went on ahead to scout and more than once they were obliged to alter their direction as they came upon bodies of men posted across their front at last they passed through the line of sentinels and avoiding all the camps gained the country in the americans rear  they now struck off to the right and by daybreak were far round beyond the american army on their way to ticonderoga they had walked for fifteen hours when they halted and it was not until late in the afternoon that they continued their journey they presently struck the road which the army had cut in its advance and keeping parallel with this through the forest they arrived the next morning at fort edward a few hours rest here and they continued their march to ticonderoga this place had been attacked by the americans a few days previously but the garrison had beaten off the assailants  on the march they had seen many bodies of the enemy moving along the road but their approach had in every case been detected in time to take refuge in the forest on entering the fort peter at once proceeded to general powells quarters and delivered the dispatch with which he had been intrusted the general read it  no reenforcements have arrived the general said and the force here is barely sufficient to defend the place it would be madness for me to set out on such a march with the handful of troops at my disposal  he then questioned peter concerning the exact position of the army and the latter had no hesitation in saying that he thought the whole force would be compelled to lay down their arms unless some reenforcements reached them from below  this however was not to be general clinton captured forts montgomery and clinton the latter a very strong position defended with great resolution by four hundred americans the seventh and twentysixth regiments and a company of grenadiers attacked on one side the sixtythird regiment on the other they had no cannon to cover their advance and had to cross ground swept by ten pieces of artillery in no event during the war did the british fight with more resolution without firing a shot they pressed forward to the foot of the works climbed over each others shoulders on to the walls and drove the enemy back the latter discharged one last volley into the troops and then laid down their arms notwithstanding the slaughter effected by this wanton fire after all possibility of continuing a resistance was over quarter was given and not one of the enemy was killed after the fort was taken the british loss was 140 killed and wounded 300 americans were killed wounded or taken prisoners the fleet attacked the american squadron on the river and entirely destroyed it beyond sending a flying squadron up the river to destroy the enemys boats and stores of provisions nothing further could be done to effect a diversion in favor of general burgoyne  four days after harolds arrival at ticonderoga the news of the surrender of general burgoyne reached the place upon the following day he suggested to peter lambton that they should visit the clearing of the exsoldier cameron and see whether their interference had saved him and his family upon arriving at the spot whence harold had fired the shot which had brought discovery upon them they saw a few charred stumps alone remaining of the snug house which had stood there in front of it upon the stump of a tree cameron himself was sitting in an attitude of utter depression  they walked across the clearing to the spot but although the sound of their footsteps must have reached his ear the man did not look up until harold touched him on the shoulder  what has happened he asked who has done this ruin  the man still remained with his head bent down as if he had not heard the question  we had hoped that you had escaped harold went on we were hidden in the wood when we saw those ruffians drive your wife and daughter out and it was the shot from my rifle that killed their leader and brought them down on us and a narrow escape we had of it but we hoped that we had diverted them from their determination to kill you and your family  cameron looked up now  i thank ye sir he said i thank ye wi a my hairt for your interference on our behalf i heerd how closely ye were beset that night and how ye escaped they thought nae mair o us and when the royal army arrived the next day we were safe but ye might as weel ha let the matter gang onbetter indeed for then i should be deed instead o suffering this wark and he pointed toward the remains of the house is redskin deviltry a fortnight sin a band o indians fell upon us i was awa they killed my wife and burned my house and ha carried off my bairn  who were they harold asked  i dinna ken cameron replied but a neebor o mine whose place they attacked and whom they had scalped and left for deed told me that they were a band o the iroquois who had come down from lake michigan and advanced wi the british he said that they with the other redskins desairted when their hopes o plunder were disappointed and that on their way back to their tribes they burned and ravaged every settlement they cam across my neebor was an old frontiersman he had fought against the tribe and knew their warcry he deed the next day he was mair lucky than i am  the tarnal ruffians peter exclaimed the murdering varmints and to think of em carrying off that purty little gal of yours i suppose by this time theyre at their old game of plundering and slaying on the frontier its naught to them which side they fight on scalps and plunder is all they care for  the unfortunate settler had sat down again on the log the picture of a brokenhearted man harold drew peter a short distance away  look here peter he said now burgoynes army has surrendered and winter is close at hand it is certain that there will be no further operations here except perhaps that the americans will recapture the place what do you say to our undertaking an expedition on our own account to try and get back this poor fellows daughter i do not know whether the seneca would join us but we threeof course i count jakeand the settler might do something i have an old grudge against these iroquois myself as you have heard and for aught i know they may long ere this have murdered my cousins  the seneca will jine peter said willing enough theres an old feud between his tribe and the iroquois hell jine fast enough but mind youngster this aint no childs play it aint like fighting them american clodhoppers well have to deal with men as sharp as ourselves who can shoot as well hear as well see as well who are in their own country and who are a hundred to one against us weve got hundreds and hundreds of miles to travel afore we gets near em its a big job but if when ye thinks it all over youre ready to go peter lambton aint the man to hold back as you say theres naught to do this winter and we might as well be doing this as anything else  the two men then went back to the settler  cameron harold said it is of no use sitting here grieving why not be up in pursuit of those who carried off your daughter  the man sprang to his feet  in pursuit he cried fiercely in pursuit do ye think donald cameron wad be sitting here quietly if he kenned where to look for his daughterwhere to find the murderers o his wife but what can i do for three days after i cam back and found what had happened i was just mad i couldna think nor rest nor do aught but throw mysel on the ground and pray to god to tak me when at last i could think it was too late it wad hae mattered naething to me that they were a hundred to one if i could ha killed but one o them i wad ha died happy but they were gone and how could i follow themhow could i find them tell me where to look monshow me the way and if it be to the ends o the airth i will go after them  we will do more than that harold said my friend and myself have still with us the seven men who were with us when we were here before five are senecas the other a faithful negro who would go through fire and water for me there is little chance of our services being required during the winter with the british army we are interested in you and in the pretty child we saw here and if you will we will accompany you in the search for her peter lambton knows the country well and if anyone could lead you to your child and rescue her from those who carried her off he is the man  truly gasped the scotchman and will ye truly gang wi me to find my bairn may the guid god o heaven bless you and the tears ran down his cheeks  git your traps together at once man peter said lets go straight back to the fort then ill set the matter before the chief who will i warrant me be glad enough to jine the expedition its too late to follow the track of the red varmints our best plan will be to make straight for the st lawrence to take a boat if we can git one if not two canoes and to make up the river and along the ontario then we must sell our boat cross to erie and git fresh canoes and go on by detroit into lake huron and so up in the country of these reptiles we shall have no difficulty i reckon in discovering the whereabout of the tribe which has been away on this expedition  the scotchman took up the rifle  i am ready he said and without another word the party started for the fort  upon their arrival there a consultation was held with the seneca the prospect of an expedition against his hereditary foes filled him with delight and three of his braves also agreed to accompany them jake received the news with the remark  all right massa harold it make no odds to dis chile whar he goes you say de wordjake ready  half an hour sufficed for making the preparations and they at once proceeded to the point where they had hidden the two canoes on the night when they joined general burgoyne before his advance upon ticonderoga these were soon floating on the lake and they started to paddle to the mouth of the sorrel down this river into the st lawrence and thence to montreal their rifles they had recovered from the lake upon the day following that on which ticonderoga was first captured deer tail having dispatched to the spot two of his braves who recovered them without difficulty by diving and brought them back to the fort  at montreal they stayed but a few hours an ample supply of ammunition was purchased and provisions sufficient for the voyage and then embarking in the two canoes they started up the st lawrence it was three weeks later when they arrived at detroit which was garrisoned by a british force here they heard that there had been continuous troubles with the indians on the frontier that a great many farms and settlements had been destroyed and numbers of persons murdered  their stay at detroit was a short one harold obtained no news of his cousins but there were so many tales told of indian massacres that he was filled with apprehension on their account his worst apprehensions were justified when the canoes at length came within sight of the wellremembered clearing harold gave a cry as he saw that the farmhouse no longer existed the two canoes were headed toward shore and their occupants disembarked and walked toward the spot where the house had stood the site was marked by a heap of charred embers the outhouses had been destroyed and a few fowls were the only living things to be seen in the fields  this here business must have taken place some time ago peter said breaking the silence a month i should say or praps more  for a time harold was too moved to speak the thought of his kind cousins and their brave girl all murdered by the indians filled him with deep grief at last he said  what makes you think so peter  its easy enough to see as it was after the harvest for ye see the fields is all clear and then theres long grass shooting up through the ashes it would take a full month praps six weeks afore it would do that dont you think so chief  the seneca nodded  a moon he said  yes about a month replied peter the grass grows quick after the rains  do you think that it was a surprise peter  no man can tell the hunter answered if we had seen the place soon afterward we might have told there would have been marks of blood or if the house had stood we could have told by the bulletholes and the color of the splintered wood how it happened and how long back as it is not even the chief can give ye an idea  not an attack the seneca said a surprise  how on arth do you know that chief the hunter exclaimed in surprise and he looked round in search of some sign which would have enabled the seneca to have given so confident an opinion you must be a witch surely  a chiefs eyes are not blind the redskin answered with a slight smile of satisfaction at having for once succeeded when his white comrade was at fault let my friend look up the hilltwo dead men there  harold looked in the direction in which the chief pointed but could see nothing the hunter exclaimed  theres something there chief but even my eyes couldnt tell they were bodies  the party proceeded to the spot and found two skeletons a few remnants of clothes lay around but the birds had stripped every particle of flesh from the bones there was a bullet in the forehead of one skull the other was cleft with a sharp instrument  its clear enough the hunter said theres been a surprise likely enough the hull lot was killed without a shot being fired in defense     chapter xiv   rescued  harold was deeply touched at the evidences of the fate which had befallen the occupants of his cousins plantation  if there are any more of these to be found pointing to their remains we might learn for a certainty whether the same fate befell them all  the seneca spoke a word to his followers and the four indians spread themselves over the clearing one more body was foundit was lying down near the water as if killed in the act of making for the canoe  the others are probably there peter said pointing to the ruins the three hands was killed in the fields and most likely the attack was made at the same moment on the house im pretty sure it was so for the body by the water lies face downward with his head toward the lake he was no doubt shot from behind as he was running there must have been injuns round the house then or he would have made for that instead of the water  the seneca touched peter on the shoulder and pointed toward the farm a figure was seen approaching as it came nearer they could see that he was a tall man dressed in the deerskin shirt and leggings usually worn by hunters as he came near harold gave an exclamation  it is jack pearson  it are jack pearson the hunter said but for the moment i cant recollect ye though yer face seems known why he exclaimed in changed tones its that boy harold growed into a man  it is harold replied grasping the frontiersmans hand  and ye may know me too peter lambton said though its twenty year since we fought side by side against the mohawks  why old hoss are you above ground still the hunter exclaimed heartily im glad to see you again old friend and what are you doing here you and harold and these senecas for they is senecas sure enough ive been in the woods for the last hour and have been puzzling myself nigh to death i seed them injuns going about over the clearing sarching and for the life of me i couldnt think what they were adoing then i seed em gathered down here with two white men among em so i guessed it was right to show myself  they were searching to see how many had fallen in this terrible business harold said pointing to the ruins the hunter shook his head  im afeared theyve all gone under i were here a week afterward it were just as it is now i found the three hands lying killed and sculped in the fields the others i reckon is there i has no doubt at all about bill welch and his wife but it may be that the gal has been carried off  do you think so harold exclaimed eagerly if so we may find her too with the other  what other pearson asked  harold gave briefly an account of the reason which had brought them to the spot and of the object they had in view  you can count me in pearson said theres just a chance that nelly welch may be in their hands still and in any case im longing to draw a bead on some of the varmints to pay em for this and he looked round him and a hundred other massacres round this frontier  im glad to hear ye say so peter replied i expected as much of ye jack i dont know much of this country having only hunted here for a few weeks with a party of delawares twenty year afore the iroquois moved so far west  i know pretty nigh every foot of it jack pearson said when the iroquois were quiet i used to do a deal of hunting in their country it are good country for game  well shall we set out at once harold asked impatient to be off  we cant move tonight pearson answered and harold saw that peter and the indians agreed with him  why not he asked every hour is of importance  thats so peter said but theres no going out on the lake tonight in half an hour well have our first snowstorm and by morning it will be two foot deep  harold turned his eyes toward the lake and saw what his companions had noticed long before the sky was overcast and a thick bank of hidden clouds was rolling up across the lake and the thick mist seemed to hang between the clouds and the water  thats snow peter said its late this year and id give my pension if it was a month later  thats so pearson said snow aint never pleasant in the woods but when youre scouting round among injuns it are a caution wed best make a shelter afore it comes on  the two canoes were lifted from the water unloaded and turned bottom upward a few charred planks which had formed part of the roof of the outhouses were brought and put up to form a sort of shelter a fire was lit and a meal prepared by this time the snow had begun to fall after the meal was over pipes were lit and the two hunters earnestly talked over their plans the seneca chief throwing in a few words occasionally the others listened quietly the indians left the matter in the hands of their chief while harold and cameron knew that the two frontiersmen did not need any suggestion from them as to jake the thought of asking questions never entered his mind he was just at present less happy than usual for the negro like most of his race hated cold and the prospect of wandering through the woods in deep snow made him shudder as he crouched close to the great fire they had built  peter and jack pearson were of opinion that it was exceedingly probable that the welches had been destroyed by the very band which had carried off little janet cameron the bodies of indians who had been on the warpath with the army had retired some six weeks before and it was about that time pearson said that the attack on the settlements had been made  i heard some parties of redskins who had been with the british troops had passed through the neighborhood and there was reports that they were greatly onsatisfied with the results of the campaign as likely as not some of that band may have been consarned in the attack on this place three year ago and passing nigh it may have determined to wipe out that defeat an injun never forgives many of their braves fell here and they could scarcely bring a more welcome trophy back to their villages than the scalps of welch and his men  now the first thing to do peter said is to find out what particular chief took his braves with him to the war then weve got to find his village and there likely enough well find camerons daughter and maybe the girl from here how old was she  about fifteen pearson said and a fine girl and a pretty girl too i dun know he went on after a pause which of the chiefs took part in the war across the lakes but i suspect it were war eagle theres three great chiefs and the other two were trading on the frontier it was war eagle who attacked the place afore and would be the more likely to attack it again if he came anywheres near it he made a mess of it afore and d be burning to wipe out his failure if he had a chance  where is his place  his village is the furthest of them all from here he lives up near the falls of sault ste marie betwixt lakes superior and huron its a village with nigh three hundred wigwams  it aint easy to see how its to be done we must make to the north shore of the lake therell be no working down here through the woods but its a pesky difficult jobabout as hard a one as ever i took part in  it is that pearson said it cant be denied to steal two white girls out of a big injun village aint a easy job at no time but with the snow on the ground it comes as nigh to an impossibility as anything can do  for another hour or two they talked over the route they should take and their best mode of proceeding duncan cameron sat and listened with an intent face to every word since he had joined them he had spoken but seldom his whole soul was taken up with the thought of his little daughter he was ever ready to do his share and more than his share of the work of paddling and at the portages but he never joined in the conversation and of an evening when the others sat round the fire he would move away and pace backward and forward in anxious thought until the fire burned low and the party wrapped themselves in their blankets and went off to sleep  all the time the conversation had been going on the snow had fallen heavily and before it was concluded the clearing was covered deep with the white mantle there was little wind and the snow fell quietly and noiselessly at night the indians lay down round the fire while the white men crept under the canoes and were soon fast asleep in the morning it was still snowing but about noon it cleared up it was freezing hard and the snow glistened as the sun burst through the clouds the stillness of the forest was broken now by sharp cracking sounds as boughs of trees gave way under the weight of the snow in the open it lay more than two feet deep  now peter said the sooner were off the better  ill come in my own canoe pearson said one of the injuns can come with me and well keep up with the rest  there is room for you in the other canoes harold said  plenty of room the hunter answered but you see harold the more canoes the better there aint no saying how close we may be chased and by hiding up the canoes at different places we give ourselves so much more chance of being able to get to one or the other theyre all large canoes and at a pinch any one of them might hold the hull party with the two gals throwed in but he added to harold in a low voice dont you build too much on these gals harold i wouldnt say so while that poor fellows listening but the chance is a desperate poor one and i think well be mighty lucky ef we dont leave all our scalps in that ere redskin village the traps were soon placed in the canoes and just as the sun burst out the three boats started it was a long and toilsome journey stormy weather set in and they were obliged to wait for days by the lake till its surface calmed on these occasions they devoted themselves to hunting and killed several deer they knew that there were no indian villages near and in such weather it would be improbable that any redskins would be in the woods they were enabled therefore to fire without fear of the reports betraying their presence the senecas took the opportunity of fabricating snowshoes for the whole party as these would be absolutely necessary for walking in the woods harold jake and duncan cameron at once began to practice their use the negro was comical in the extreme in his first attempts and shouted so loudly with laughter each time that he fell head foremost into the snow that peter said to him angrily  lookahere jake its dangerous enough letting off a rifle at a deer in these woods but it has to be done because we must lay in a supply of food but a musketshot is a mere whisper to yer shouting thunder aint much louder than you laughingit shakes the hull place and might be heard from here wellnigh to montreal ef you cant keep that mouth of yourn shut ye must stop up the idée of learning to use them shoes and must stop in the canoe while were scouting on shore  jake promised to amend and from this time when he fell in the soft snowwreaths he gave no audible vent to his amusement but a pair of great feet with the snowshoes attached could be seen waving above the surface until he was picked up and righted again  harold soon learned and cameron went at the work with grim earnestness no smile ever crossed his face at his own accidents or at the wild vagaries of jake which excited silent amusement even among the indians in a short time the falls were less frequent and by the time they reached the spot where they were determined to cross the lake at the point where lakes huron and michigan join the three novices were able to make fair progress in the snowshoes  the spot fixed upon was about twelve miles from the village of war eagle and the canoes were hidden at distances of three miles apart first pearson harold and cameron disembarked jake peter and one of the indians alighted at the next point and the seneca chief and two of his followers proceeded to the spot nearer to the indian village each party as they landed struck straight into the woods to unite at a point eight miles from the lake and as many from the village the hunters had agreed that should any indians come across the tracks less suspicion would be excited than would have been the case were they found skirting the river as it might be thought that they were made by indians out hunting  harold wondered how the other parties would find the spot to which pearson had directed them but in due time all arrived at the rendezvous after some search a spot was found where the underwood grew thickly and there was an open place in the center of the clump in this the camp was established it was composed solely of a low tent of about two feet high made of deers hides sewed together and large enough to shelter them all the snow was cleared away sticks were driven into the frozen ground and strong poles laid across them the deerskin was then laid flat upon these the top was little higher than the general level of the snow an inch or two of snow was scattered over it and to anyone passing outside the bushes the tent was completely invisible  the indians now went outside the thicket and with great care obliterated as far as possible the marks upon the snow this could not be wholly done but it was so far complete that the slightest wind which would send a drift over the surface would wholly conceal all traces of passage  they had before crossing the lake cooked a supply of food sufficient for some days intense as was the cold outside it was perfectly warm in the tent the entrance as they crept into it was closed with a blanket and in the center a lamp composed of deers fat in a calabash with a cotton wick gave a sufficient light  what is the next move harold asked  the chief ll start when it comes dusk with pearson peter said when they git close to the village hell go in alone hell paint iroquois before he goes  cannot we be near at hand to help them in case of a necessity harold asked  no peter said it wouldnt be no good at all ef it comes to fighting theyre fifty to one and the lot of us would have no more chance than two if theyre found out which aint likely they must run for it and they can get over the snow a deal faster than you could to say nothing of cameron and jake they must shift for themselves and ll make straight for the nearest canoe in the forest they must be run down sooner or later for their tracks would be plain no they must go alone  when night came on the seneca produced his paints and one of his followers marked his face and arms with the lines and flourishes in use by the iroquois then without a word of adieu he took his rifle and glided out from the tent followed by pearson peter also put on his snowshoes and prepared to follow  i thought you were going to stay here peter  no im going halfway with em ill be able to hear the sound of a gun then ef theyre trapped we must make tracks for the canoes at once for after following em to the lake theyre safe to take up their back track to see where theyve come from so ef i hear a gun ill make back here as quick as i can come  when the three men had started silence fell on the tent the redskins at once lay down to sleep and jake followed their example harold lay quiet thinking over the events which had happened to him in the last three years while cameron lay with his face turned toward the lamp with a set anxious look on his face several times he crawled to the entrance and listened when the crack made by some breaking bough came to his ear hours passed and at last harold dozed off but camerons eyes never closed until about midnight the blanket at the entrance moved and peter entered  hae ye seen the ithers cameron exclaimed  no and were not likely to peter answered it was all still to the time i came away and afore i moved i was sure they must have left the village they wont come straight back bless ye theyll go way in the opposite direction and make a sweep miles round they may not be here for hours yet not that theres much chance of their tracks being traced it has not snowed for over a week and the snow round the village must be trampled thick for a mile and more with the squaws coming and going for wood and the hunters going out on the chase ive crossed a dozen tracks or more on my way back ef it wasnt for that we darent have gone at all for ef the snow was new fallen the sight of fresh tracks would have set the first injun that come along awondering and when a redskin begins to wonder he sets to to ease his mind at once by finding out all about it ef it takes him a couple of days sarch to do so no you can lie down now for some hours they wont be here till morning  so saying the scout set the example by wrapping himself up and going to sleep but camerons eyes never closed until the blanket was drawn on one side again and in the gray light of the winter morning the seneca and pearson crawled into the tent  what news harold asked for cameron was too agitated to speak  both gals are there pearson answered  an exclamation of thankfulness broke from harold a sob of joy issued from the heart of the scotchman and for a few minutes his lips moved as he poured forth his silent thankfulness to god  waal tell us all about it peter said i can ask the chief any questions afterward  we went on straight enough to the village the hunter began it are larger than when i saw it last and war eagles influence in the tribe must have increased i didnt expect to find no watch the redskins having so far as they knew no enemies within five hundred mile of em there was a lot of fires burning and plenty of redskins moving about among em we kept on till we got quite close and then we lay up for a time below a tree at the edge of the clearing there were a sight too many of em about for the seneca to go in yet awhile about half an hour arter we got there we saw two white gals come outen one of the wigwams and stand for a while to warm theirselves by one of the fires the tallest of the two wellnigh a woman was nelly welch i knew her in course the other was three or four years younger with yaller hair over her shoulders nelly seemed quiet and sadlike but the other peared more at homeshe laughed with some of the redskin gals and even jined in their play you see he said turning to cameron shed been captured longer and childrens spirits soon rise again arter a while they went back to the wigwam when the fires burned down and the crowd thinned and there was only a few left sitting in groups round the embers the seneca started for a long time i saw nothing of him but once or twice i thought i saw a figure moving among the wigwams presently the fires burned quite down and the last injun went off i had begun to wonder what the chief was doing when he stood beside me we made tracks at once and have been tramping in a long circle all night the chief can tell ye his part of the business hisself  well chief what have you found out peter asked  the indian answered in his native tongue which peter interpreted from time to time for the benefit of his white companions  when deer tail left the white hunter he went into the village it was no use going among the men and he went round by the wigwams and listened to the chattering of the squaws the tribe were all well contented for the band brought back a great deal of plunder which they had picked up on their way back from the army they had lost no braves and everyone was pleased the destruction of the settlement of the white man who had repulsed them before was a special matter for rejoicing the scalps of the white man and his wife are in the village war eagles son young elk is going to marry the white girl there are several of the braves whose heads have been turned by the white skin and her bright eyes but young elk is going to have her there have been great feastings and rejoicings since the return of the warriors but they are to be joined tomorrow by beavers band and then they will feast again when all was quiet i went to the wigwam where the white girls are confined an old squaw and two of war eagles daughters are with them deer tail had listened while they prepared for rest and knew on which side of the wigwam the tall white maiden slept he thought that she would be awake her heart would be sad and sleep would not come to her soon so he crept round there and cut a slit in the skin close to where she lay he put his head in at the hole and whispered do not let the white girl be afraid it is a friend does she hear him she whispered yes friends are near he said the young warrior harold whom she knows and others are at hand to take her away the iroquois will be feasting tomorrow night when she hears the cry of a nightowl let her steal away with her little white sister and she will find her friends waiting then deer tail closed the slit and stole away to his friend the white hunter i have spoken  jest what i expected of you chief peter said warmly i thought as how youd manage to git speech with em somehow if theres a feast tonight its hard ef we dont manage to get em off  i suppose we must lie still all day peter  you must so the hunter said not a soul must show his nose outside the tent except that one of the redskinsll keep watch to be sure that no straggler has come across our tracks and followed em up ef he was to do that he might bring the hull gang down on us yed best get as much sleep as ye can for ye dont know when ye may get another chance  at nightfall the whole party issued from the tent and started toward the indian village all arrangements had been made it was agreed that pearson and the seneca should go up to the village the former being chosen because he was known to nelly peter and one of the redskins were to take post a hundred yards further back ready to give assistance in case of alarm while the rest were to remain about half a mile distant cameron had asked that he might go with the advance party but upon peter pointing out to him that his comparatively slow rate of progression in snowshoes would in case of discovery lead to the recapture of the girls he at once agreed to the decision if the flight of the girls was discovered soon after leaving the camp it was arranged that the seneca and peter should hurry at once with them to the main body while the other two indians should draw off their pursuers in another direction in the event of anything occurring to excite the suspicion of the indians before there was a chance of the girls being brought safely to the main body they were to be left to walk quietly back to camp as they had nothing to fear from the indians peter and the seneca were then to work round by a circuitous route to the boat where they were to be joined by the main body and to draw off until another opportunity offered for repeating the attempt  it was eight oclock in the evening when pearson and the seneca approached the village the fires were burning high and seated round them were all the warriors of the tribe a party were engaged in a dance representing the pursuit and defeat of an enemy the women were standing in an outer circle clapping their hands and raising their voices in loud cries of applause and excitement as the dance became faster and faster the warriors bounded high brandishing their tomahawks a better time could not have been chosen for the evasion of the fugitives nelly welch stood close to a number of indian girls but slightly behind them she held the hand of little janet cameron  although she appeared to share in the interest of the indians in the dance a close observer would have had no difficulty in perceiving that nelly was preoccupied she was indeed intently listening for the signal she was afraid to move from among the others lest her absence should be at once detected but so long as the noise was going on she despaired of being able to hear the signal agreed upon presently an indian brave passed close to her and as he did so whispered in her ear in english behind your wigwamfriends there then he passed on and moved round the circle as if intending to take his seat at another point  the excitement of the dance was momentarily increasing and the attention of the spectators was riveted to the movements of the performers holding janets hand nelly moved noiselessly away from the place where she had been standing the movement was unnoticed as she was no longer closely watched a flight in the depth of winter appearing impossible she kept round the circle till no longer visible from the spot she had left then leaving the crowd she made her way toward the nearest wigwams once behind these the girls stole rapidly along under their shelter until they stood behind that which they usually inhabited two figures were standing there they hesitated for a moment but one of them advanced  jack pearson nelly exclaimed with a low cry of gladness  jest that same nelly and right glad to see you but weve no time for greeting now the hull tribe may be after us in another five minutes come along pretty he said turning to janet youll find somebody ye know close at hand  two minutes later the child was in her fathers arms and after a moments rapturous greeting between father and child and a very delighted one between nelly welch and her cousin harold the flight was continued  how long a start do you think we may have  half an hour maybe the women may be some time afore they miss her and theyll sarch for her everywhere afore they give the alarm as theyll be greatly blamed for their carelessness  there had been a pause in the flight for a few seconds when the seneca and pearson arrived with the girls at the point where peter and the other indian were posted two hundred yards from the camp up to this point the snow was everywhere thickly trampled but as the camp was left further behind the footprints would naturally become more scarce here pearson fastened to the girls feet two pairs of large moccasins inside these wooden soles had been placed they therefore acted to some extent like snowshoes and prevented the girls feet from sinking deeply while the prints which they left bore no resemblance to their own they were strapped on the wrong way so that the marks would seem to point toward the village rather than away from it both girls protested that they should not be able to get along fast in these encumbrances but one of the men posted himself on either side of each and assisted them along and as the moccasins were very light even with the wooden soles inside they were soon able to move with them at a considerable pace  once united the whole party kept along at the top of their speed peter lambton assisted cameron with janet and the girl halflifted from the ground skimmed over the surface like a bird only touching the snow here and there with the moccasins nelly welch needed no assistance from harold or pearson during the long winters she had often practiced on snowshoes and was consequently but little encumbered with the huge moccasins which to some extent served the same purpose  they had been nearly half an hour on their way when they heard a tremendous yell burst from the village  theyve missed you peter said now its a fair race weve got a good start and ll git more for theyll have to hunt up the traces very carefully and it may be an hour perhaps more before they strike upon the right one ef the snow had been new fallen we should have had em arter us in five minutes but even a redskins eye will be puzzled to find out at night one track among such hundreds  i have but one fear pearson said to harold  what is that  im afeared that without waiting to find the tracks they may send off half a dozen parties to the lake theyll be sure that friends have taken the gals away and will know that their only chance of escape is by the water on land we should be hunted down to a certainty and the redskins knowing that the gals could not travel fast will not hurry in following up the trail so i think theyll at once send off parties to watch the lake and ll like enough make no effort to take up the trail till tomorrow morning  this was said in a low whisper for although they were more than two miles from the village it was necessary to move as silently as possible  you had best tell the others what you think pearson it may make a difference in our movements  a short halt was called and the seneca and peter quite agreed with pearsons idea  wed best make for the canoe thats furthest off when the redskins find the others which theyre pretty sure to do for theyll hunt every bush theyre likely to be satisfied and to make sure theyll ketch us at one or the other  this much decided upon they continued their flight now less rapidly but in perfect silence speed was less an object than concealment the indians might spread and a party might come across them by accident if they could avoid this they were sure to reach their canoe before morning and unlikely to find the indians there before them  it was about twelve miles to the spot where they had hidden the canoe and although they heard distant shouts and whoops ringing through the forest no sound was heard near them     chapter xv   the island refuge  the night was intensely cold and still and the stars shone brightly through the bare boughs overhead are you sure you are going all right nelly asked harold it is so dark here that it seems impossible to know which way we are going you can trust the indians harold said even if there was not a star to be seen they could find their way by some mysterious instinct how you are grown nelly your voice does not seem much changed and i am longing to see your face  i expect you are more changed than i am harold the girl answered you have been going through so much since we last met and you seem to have grown so tall and big your voice has changed very much too it is the voice of a man how in the world did you find us here  pearson had gone on ahead to speak to the seneca but he now joined them again  you mustnt talk he said i hope theres no redskins within five miles of us now but theres never any saying where they may be  there was harold thought a certain sharpness in the hunters voice which told of a greater anxiety than would be caused by the very slight risk of the quietly spoken words being heard by passing redskins and he wondered what it could be  they were now he calculated within a mile of the hiding place where they had left the boat and they had every reason for believing that none of the indians would be likely to have followed the shore so far that they would be pursued and that in so heavily laden a canoe they would have great difficulty in escaping he was well aware but he relied on the craft of the hunters and senecas for throwing their pursuers off the trail  all at once the trees seemed to open in front and in a few minutes the party reached the river a cry of astonishment and of something akin to terror broke from harold as far as the eye could reach the lake was frozen their escape was cut off  thats jest what ive been expecting pearson said the ice had begun to form at the edge when we landed and three days and nights of such frost as weve had since was enough to freeze ontario what on arths to be done  no one answered peter and the redskins had shared pearsons anxiety but to harold and cameron the disappointment was a terrible one as to jake he left all the thinking to be done by the others harold stood gazing helplessly on the expanse of ice which covered the water it was not a smooth sheet but was rough and broken as if while it had been forming the wind had broken the ice up into cakes again and again while the frost as often had bound them together  they had struck the river within a few hundred yards of the place where the canoe was hidden and after a short consultation between the seneca chief peter lambton and pearson moved down toward that spot  what are you thinking of doing harold asked when they gathered round the canoe  were going to load ourselves with the ammunition and deers flesh peter said and make for a rocky island which lies about a mile off here i noticed it as we landed theres nothing to do but to fight it out to the last there it are a good place for defense for the redskins wont like to come out across the open and even covered by a dark night theyd show on this white surface  perhaps they wont trace us  not trace us the trapper repeated scornfully why when daylight comes theyll pick up our track and follow it as easy as you could that of a wagon across the snow  they were just starting when harold gave a little exclamation  what is it lad  a flake of snow fell on my face  all looked up the stars had disappeared another flake and another fell on the upturned faces of the party  lets thank the great god peter said quietly theres a chance for our lives yet half an hours snow and the trail ll be lost  faster and faster the snowflakes came down again the leaders consulted  we must change our plans now peter said turning to the others so long as they could easily follow our tracks it mattered nothing that theyd find the canoe here but now its altogether different we must take it along with us  the weight of the canoe was very small the greater part of its contents had already been removed there was a careful look round to see that nothing remained on the bank then four of the men lifted it on their shoulders and the whole party stepped out upon the ice the snow was now falling heavily and to harolds eyes there was nothing to guide them in the direction they were following even the indians would have been at a loss had not the seneca the instant the snow began to fall sent on one of his followers at full speed toward the island harold wondered at the time what his object could be as the indian darted off across the ice but now he understood every minute or two the low hoot of an owl was heard and toward this sound the party directed their way through the darkness and snow  so heavy was the fall that the island rose white before them as they reached it it was of no great extentsome twenty or thirty yards across and perhaps twice that length it rose steeply from the water to a height of from ten to fifteen feet the ground was rough and broken and several trees and much brushwood grew in the crevices of the rock  the seneca and the hunters made a rapid examination of the island and soon fixed upon the spot for their camp toward one end the island was split in two and an indentation ran some distance up into it here a clear spot was found some three or four feet above the level of the water it was completely hidden by thick bushes from the sight of anyone approaching by water there the canoe was turned over and the girls who were both suffering from the intense cold were wrapped up in blankets and placed under its shelter the camp was at the lower end of the island and would therefore be entirely hidden from view of indians gathered upon the shore in such a snowstorm light would be invisible at a very short distance and peter did not hesitate to light a fire in front of the canoe  for three hours the snow continued to fall the fire had been sheltered by blankets stretched at some distance above it long before the snow ceased it had sunk down to a pile of red embers a small tent had now been formed of blankets for the use of the girls brushwood had been heaped over this and upon the brushwood snow had been thrown the whole making a shelter which would be warm and comfortable in the bitterest weather a pile of hot embers was placed in this little tent until it was thoroughly heated blankets were then spread and the girls were asked to leave the shelter of the canoe and take their place there  the canoe itself was now raised on four sticks three feet from the ground bushes were laid round it and snow piled on thus forming the walls of which the canoe was the roof all this was finished long before the snow had ceased falling and this added a smooth white surface all over so that to a casual eye both tent and hut looked like two natural ridges of the ground they were a cheerful party which assembled in the little hut the remainder of the embers of the fire had been brought in and intense as was the cold outside it was warm and comfortable within tea was made and pipes filled and they chatted some time before going to sleep  duncan cameron was like a man transfigured his joy and thankfulness for the recovery of his daughter were unbounded harolds pleasure too at the rescue of his cousin was very great and the others were all gratified at the success of their expedition it was true that the indians had as yet gained no scalps but harold had promised them before starting that should the expedition be successful they should be handsomely rewarded  we mustnt reckon as we are safe yet peter said in answer to one of harolds remarks the redskins aint going to let us slip through their fingers so easy as all that theyve lost our trail and have nothing but their senses to guide em but an injuns senses aint easily deceived in these woods ef this snow begins again and keeps on for two or three days they may be puzzled but ef it stops theyll cast a circle round their camp at a distance beyond where we could have got before the snow ceased and ef they find no new trails theyll know that we must be within that circle then as to the boats when they find as we dont come down to the two as theyve discovered and that weve not made off by land theyll guess as there was another canoe hidden somewhere and theyll sarch high and low for it waal they wont find it and then theyll suppose that we may have taken to the ice and theyll sarch that either theyll git to open water or to the other side ef theres open water anywhere within a few miles they may conclude that weve carried a canoe launched it there and made off in that case when theyve sarched everywhere they may give it up ef there aint no such open water theyll sarch till they find us it aint likely that this island will escape em with nine good rifles here we can hold the place against the hull tribe and as theyd show up against the snow they can no more attack by night than by day  i dont think our food will hold out beyond seven or eight days harold said  jest about that peter answered but we can cut a hole in the ice and fish and can hold out that way if need be for weeks the wust of it is that the ice aint likely to break up now until the spring i reckon our only chance is to wait till we git another big snowstorm and then to make off the snow will cover our trail as fast as we make it and once across to the other shore we may git away from the varmints but i dont disguise from you harold that were in a very awkard trouble and that it ll need all the craft of the chief here and all the experience of pearson and me to get us out of it  the guid god has been vera merciful to us sae far duncan cameron said he will surely protect us to the end had he na sent the snow just when he did the savages could hae followed our trail at once it was a miracle wrought in our favor he has aided us to rescue the twa bairns frae the hands of the indians and we may surely trust in his protection to the end my daughter and her friend hae i am very sure before lying down to sleep entreated his protection let us a do the same  and the old soldier taking off his cap prayed aloud to god to heed and protect them  harold and the frontiersmen also removed their caps and joined in the prayer and the senecas looked on silent and reverent at an act of worship which was rare among their white companions  as peter was of opinion that there was no chance whatever of any search on the part of the indians that night and therefore there was no need to set a watch the whole party wrapped themselves up in their blankets and were soon asleep  when harold woke next morning it was broad daylight the senecas had already been out and had brought news that a strong party of indians could be seen moving along the edge of the forest evidently searching for a canoe one of the indians was placed on watch and two or three hours later he reported that the indians were now entirely out of sight and were when last seen scouting along the edge of the forest  now peter said the sooner we git another snowstorm the better ef wed been alone we could have pushed on last night but the gals was exhausted and would soon have died of the cold now with a fresh start theyd do ef we cant cross the lake i calculate that were about thirty mile from a pint on the north shore below the falls of ste marie and we could land there and strike across through the woods for the settlement itd be a terrible long journey round the north of huron but we must try it ef we cant get across  but we could go off by night surely harold said even if there is no fresh snow  we could do that peter replied no doubt of it but ef they were to find our track the next day ay or within three days theyd follow us and overtake us afore we got to the settlements ef we was alone itd be one thing but with the gals itd be another altogether no we must stop here till a snowstorm comes even if we have to stop for a month theres no saying how soon some of them injuns may be loafing round and we darent leave a trail for em to take up  they had scarcely ceased speaking when a low call from the indian placed on watch summoned the chief to his side a minute later the latter rejoined the group below and said a few words to peter  jest as i thought the latter grumbled rising with his rifle across his arm here are some of the varmints coming out this ere way likely enough its a party of young braves jest scouting about on their own account to try and get honor by discovering us when their elders have failed it would have been better for them to have stopped at home  the party now crept up to the top of the rock keeping carefully below its crest  ef you show as much as a hair above the top line peter said theyll see you sartin  would it not be well harold asked for one of us to show himself there is no possibility of further concealment and if they go off without any of them being killed the others might be less bitter against us than they would if they had lost some of their tribe  peter laughed scornfully  ye havent had much to do with injuns lad but i should have thought youd have had better sense nor that havent these injuns been amurdering and aslaying along the frontier all the summer falling on defenseless women and children marcy and pity aint in their natur and fight or no fight our scalps will dry in their wigwams if they get us into their power they know that we can shoot and mean to and that ll make em careful of attacking us and every hour is important now he said to the others each of you cover a man and fire straight through your sights when i gives the word theres others watching em you may be sure and ef the whole five go down together itll make em think twice afore they attack us again  peering between some loose rocks so that he could see without exposing his head above the line harold watched the five indians approaching they had evidently some doubts as to the wisdom of the course they were pursuing and were well aware that they ran a terrible risk standing there in the open before the rifles of those concealed should the fugitives be really there nevertheless the hope of gaining distinction and the fear of ridicule from those watching them on shore should they turn back with their mission unaccomplished inspired them with resolution when within three hundred yards of the island they halted for a long time they stood gazing fixedly but although no signs of life could be perceived they were too well versed in indian warfare to gain any confidence from the apparent stillness throwing themselves flat on the snow and following each other in single line by which means their bodies were nearly concealed from sight in the track which their leader made through the light yielding snow they made a complete circuit of the island they paused for some time opposite the little forked entrance in which the camp was situated but apparently saw nothing for they kept round until they completed the circuit  when they reached the point from which they had started there was apparently a short consultation among them then they continued their course in the track that they had before made until they reached a spot facing the camp then they changed order and still prone in the snow advanced abreast toward the island  the varmints have guessed that if we are here this is the place where wed be hid peter whispered in harolds ear  as the indians made their circuit the party in the island had changed their position so as always to keep out of sight they were now on the top of the island which was a sort of rough plateau the girls had been warned when they left them to remain perfectly quiet in their shelter whatever noise they might hear peter and the seneca watched the indians through holes which they had made with their ramrods through a bank of snow the others remained flat in the slight depression behind it at the distance of one hundred and fifty yards the indians stopped  the varmints see something peter said maybe they can make out the two snow heaps through the bushes maybe they can see some of our footsteps in the snow theyre going to fire he exclaimed up lads they may send a bullet into the hut whar the gals is hid  in an instant the line of men sprang to their feet the indians taken by surprise at the sudden appearance of a larger number of enemies than they expected fired a hasty volley and then sprang to their feet and dashed toward the shore but they were deadly rifles which covered them peter harold and pearson could be trusted not to miss even a rapidly moving object at that distance and the men were all good shots not in regular order but as each covered his man the rifles were discharged four out of the five indians fell and an arm of the fifth dropped useless by his side however he still kept on the whites reloaded rapidly and harold was about to fire again when pearson put his hand on his shoulder  dont fire weve shown them that we can shoot straight its jest as well at present that they shouldnt know how far our rifles will carry  the four senecas dashed out across the snow and speedily returned each with a scalp hanging at his belt  a loud yell of anger and lamentation had risen from the woods skirting the shore as the indians fell but after this died away deep silence reigned  what will be their next move cameron asked peter as they gathered again in their low hut having placed one of the indians on watch  well hear nothing of em till nightfall peter said their first move now they know as were here will be to send off to fetch up all the tribe whore in search of us when it comes on dark theyll send scouts outside of us on the ice to see as we dont escapenot that theyd much mind ef we did for they could track us through the snow and come up with us whenever they chose no they may be sure well stay where we are it may be theyll attack us tonight maybe not itd be a thing more risksome than redskins often undertake to cross the snow under the fire of nine rifles i aint no doubt theyd try and starve us out for they must know well enough that we can have no great store of provisions but they know as well as we do that if another snowstorm comes on we might slip away from em without leaving a footmark behind its jest that thought as may make em attack  well we can beat them off if they do harold said confidently  waal we may and we may not the scout answered anyhow we can kill a grist of em afore they turn us out on this ere island  thats sartin enough pearson put in but theyre a strong tribe and ef they can harden their hearts and make a rush its all up with us i allow that its contrary to their custom but when they see no other way to do with they may try  i suppose if they do try a rush harold said they will do it against this end of the island  yes you may bet your money on that the scout answered in other places the rock goes pretty nigh straight up from the water but here its an easy landing being so close to em theyre sure to know all about it but even if they didnt the chap that got away would tell em i dont much expect an attack tonightthe bands wont be back yet theyll have a grand palaver tonight and therell be a big talk afore they decide what is best to be done so i think were safe for tonight tomorrow well set to work and build a shelter for the pretty ones up above where theyll be safe from stray shots then well throw up a breastwork with loose rocks on the top of the slope round this cove so as to give it to em hot when they land  you have plenty of powder harold asked  dollops peter replied moren we could fire away if we was besieged here for a month  then you could spare me twenty pounds or so  we could spare you a whole keg if you like weve got three full but what are you thinking of now young un  i was thinking harold answered of forming a line of holes say three feet apart in the ice across the mouth of the cove if we were to charge them with powder and lay a train between them we could when the first dozen or so have passed the line fire the train and break up the ice this would prevent the others following and give them such a bad scare that they would probably make off and we could easily deal with those who had passed the line before we fired it  thats a good idea of yours lad a fustrate idea the ice must be a foot thick by this time and ef you put in your charges eight inches and tamp em well down youll shiver the ice for a long way round the idea is a fustrate one  pearson and cameron assisted in the work and the indians when peter had explained the plan to them gave deep gutteral exclamations of surprise and approval the process of blasting was one wholly unknown to them  i will mak the holes cameron said i hae seen a deal of blasting when i was in the army i can heat the end of a ramrod in a fire and hammer it into the shape of a borer  a better way than that cameron harold said will be to heat the end of a ramrod whitehot you will melt holes in the ice in half the time it would take you to bore them that was what i was thinking of doing  right you are lad pearson said lets set about it at once  a large fire was now lighted outside the hut for there was no longer any occasion for secrecy the ends of three or four of the ramrods were placed in the fire and two lines of holes were bored in the ice across the mouth of the little cove these lines were twelve feet apart and they calculated that the ice between them would be completely broken up even if the fractures did not extend a good way beyond the lines the holes were of rather larger diameter than the interior of a gun barrel it was found that the ice was about fifteen inches thick and the holes were taken down ten inches three or four charges of powder were placed in each a stick of a quarter of an inch in diameter was then placed in each hole and pounded ice was rammed tightly in around it until the holes were filled up a few drops of water being poured in on the top so as to freeze the whole into a solid mass there was no fear of the powder being wetted for the frost was intense then the sticks were withdrawn and the holes left filled with powder with the heated ramrods little troughs were sunk half an inch deep connecting the tops of the holes lines of powder were placed in these trenches narrow strips of skin were laid over them and the snow was then thrown on again the two lines of trenches were connected at the ends at the shore so that they could be fired simultaneously  while the men were occupied with this work the girls had cooked some venison steaks and made some cakes  it was just nightfall when they had finished and all sat down and enjoyed a hearty meal peter and one of the senecas undertook the watch for half the night when they were to be relieved by pearson and the chief the early part of the night passed off quietly but an hour before morning the party were aroused by the sharp crack of two rifles seizing their arms all rushed out  what is it pearson  two of their scouts pearson answered pointing to two dark bodies on the snow at a distance of about one hundred yards i suppose they wanted to see ef we was on the watch we made em out almost as soon as they left the shore but we let em come on until we was sartin of our aim there aint no more about as we can see so ye can all turn in again for another hour or two  there was no fresh alarm before morning and when the sun rose it shone over a wide expanse of snow unbroken save where lay the bodies of the two indianswhose scalps already hung at the belt of the senecaand those of their four comrades who had fallen in the first attack  the day passed quietly toward the afternoon two indians were seen approaching from the shore they were unarmed and held their hands aloft as a sign of amity peter and pearson at once laid down their guns left the island and advanced to meet them they were indian chiefs of importance  why have my white brothers stolen in at night upon the village of war eagle and slain his young men  it is what you have been doing all last year chief pearson who spoke the dialect better than peter replied but we injured no one we didnt kill women and children as your warriors have done in the white villages we only came to take what you had stolen from us and ef your young men have been killed its only because they tried to attack us  the white men must see the chief said that they cannot get away the water is hard and their canoe will not swim in it the snow is deep and the tender feet cannot walk through it my warriors are very numerous and the white men cannot fight their way through them the white settlements are very far away and their friends cannot reach them and it will be many months before the water softens and long before that the white men will have eaten their moccasins  waal chief pearson said were in a tight hole i grant you but im far from allowing that we aint no chances left to us yet what do you propose i suppose youve some proposition to make  let the white men leave behind them their guns and their powder and the maidens they have taken from war eagles camp then let them go in peace they shall not be harmed  pearson gave a short laugh  war eagle must think the white men are foolish whats to prevent the red warriors from taking all our scalps when our arms are in their hands  the word of a great chief war eagle said war eagle never lies  you may not lie chief pearson said bluntly but ive known many a treaty broken afore now you and your people may not touch us but theres other redskins about and i wouldnt give a beavers skin for our sculps ef we were to take the back trail to the settlements without arms in our hands besides that weve among us the father of the gal who was stole far away off from lake champlain and a relative of hers whose parents youve killed down on the lake ef we were to agree to give up our arms it stands to reason it aint likely theyd agree to give up the gals no no chief your terms arent reasonable but i tell ye what we will do ef youll give us your word that neither you nor your tribell molest us in our retreat well go back to the settlements and ll engage that when we get back there well send you nine of the best rifles money can buy with plenty of powder and ball and blankets and such like  the chief waved his hand in contemptuous refusal of the terms  there are six of my young mens scalps at your girdles and their places are empty war eagle has spoken  very well chief pearson said ef nothing but sculps will content you to fighting it must come but i warn you that your tribell lose a good many more afore they get ours  so saying without another word they separated each party making their way back to their friends  what on earth can he have proposed such terms as those for harold asked when pearson had related what had taken place between him and the chief he must have known we should not accept them  i expect pearson said he wanted to see who we were and to judge what sort of spirit we had it may be too that there was a party among the tribe who had no stomachs for the job of attacking this place and so he was obliged to make a show of offering terms to please em but he never meant as they should be accepted no i take it theyll wait a few days to see what hungerll do they must be pretty sure that weve not a very large supply of food     chapter xvi   the great storm  let us overhaul our packages harold said and see what provisions we have left it would be as well to know how we stand  it was found that they had a sufficient supply of flour to last with care for a fortnight the meal was nearly exhausted of tea they had an abundance the sugar was nearly out and they had three bottles of spirits  could we not make the flour last more than the fourteen days by putting ourselves on half rations harold asked  we might do that peter said but i tell you the rations would be small even for fourteen days weve calkilated according to how much we eat when weve plenty of meat but without meat itd be only a starvation ration to each fortunately weve fishhooks and lines and by making holes in the ice we can get as many fish as we like waal we can live on them alone if need be and an ounce or two of flour made into cakes will be enough to go with em that way the flour would last us pretty nigh two months i dont say that if the wust comes to the wust we might not hold on right to the spring on fish the lakes full of em and some of em have so much oil in em that theyre nigh as good as meat  do you think peter that if the indians make one great attack and are beaten off they will try again  no one can say peter answered injun natur cant never be calkilated on i should say if they got a thundering beating they aint likely to try again but theres never no saying  the sooner they attack and get it oer the better cameron said i hae na slept a wink the last twa nights if i doze off for a moment i wake up thinking i hear their yells i am as ready to fight as ony o you when the time comes but the thought o my daughter here makes me nervous and anxious what do you say jake  it all de same to jake massa cameron jake sleeps bery sound but he no like de tought ob eating nothing but fish for five or six months jake neber bery fond ob fish  youll like it well enough when you get used to it jake pearson said its not bad eating on a pinch only you want to eat a sight of it to satisfy you well lets see how the fishll bite  four holes were cut in the ice at a short distance apart the hooks were attached to strong lines and baited with deers flesh and soon the fishing began the girls took great interest in the proceeding nelly was an adept at the sport having generally caught the fish for the consumption of the household at home she took charge of one of the lines harold of another while jake and one of the senecas squatted themselves by the other holes there had been some discussion as to whether the fishing should take place on the side of the island facing the shore or behind the rocks but the former was decided upon this was done because all were anxious that the expected attack should take place as soon as possible and the event was likely to be hastened when the indians saw that they were provided with lines and were thus able to procure food for a considerable time  it was soon manifest that if they could live upon fish they need feel no uneasiness as to its supply scarcely had the lines been let down than fish were fast to them harold and the other men soon had trout from three to six pounds lying on the ice beside them but nelly was obliged to call pearson to her assistance and the fish when brought to the surface was found to be over twenty pounds in weight an hours fishing procured them a sufficient supply for a weeks consumption there was no fear as to the fish keeping for in a very short time after being drawn from the water they were frozen stiff and hard they were hung up to some boughs near the huts and the party were glad enough to get into shelter again for the cold was intense  as before the early part of the night passed quietly but toward morning peter who was on watch ran down and awakened the others  get your shootingirons and hurry up he said the varmints are coming this time in arnest  in a minute everyone was at the post assigned to him a number of dark figures could be seen coming over the ice  theres nigh two hundred of em peter said war eagle has brought the whole strength of his tribe  contrary to their usual practice the indians did not attempt to crawl up to the place they were about to attack but advanced at a run across the ice the defenders lost not a moment in opening fire for some of their rifles would carry as far as the shore  shoot steady peter said dont throw away a shot  each man loaded and fired as quickly as he could taking a steady aim and the dark figures which dotted the ice behind the advancing indians showed that the fire was an effectual one the indians did not return a shot their chief had no doubt impressed upon them the uselessness of firing against men lying in shelter and had urged them to hurry at the top of their speed to the island and crush the whites in a handtohand fight  it was but three or four minutes from the time the first shot was fired before they were close to the island they made as peter had expected toward the little cove which was indeed the only place at which a landing could well be effected harold ran down and hid himself in a bush at the spot where the train terminated carrying with him a glowing brand from the fire  war eagle means to have our sculps this time peter said to pearson i never seed an uglier rush white men couldnt have done better  the indians had run in scattered order across the ice but they closed up as they neared the cove as they rushed toward it four fell beneath the shots of half the defenders and another four a few seconds later from a volley by the other section  in a wonderfully short time the first were ready again and the indians wavered at the slaughter and opened fire upon the breastwork behind which the defenders were crouching those behind pressed on and with terrific yells the mass of indians bounded forward  harold had remained inactive crouching behind the bush he saw the head of the dark mass rush past him and then applied the brand to the train  there was a tremendous explosion yells and screams rent the air and in an instant a dark line of water twenty feet wide stretched across the mouth of the cove  in this were pieces of floating ice and numbers of indians struggling and yelling some made only a faint struggle before they sank while others struck out for the side furthest from the island  the main body of the indians appalled by the explosion checked themselves in their course and at once took to flight some unable to check their impetus fell into the water upon the wounded wretches who were struggling there those who had crossed stood irresolute and then turning leaped into the water as they struggled to get out on the opposite side the defenders maintained a deadly fire upon them but in two or three minutes the last survivor had scrambled out and all were in full flight toward the shore  i think weve seen the last of the attacks peter said as they came down from their breastwork and joined harold in the cove that was a firstrate notion of yours lad ef it hadnt been for that we should have been rubbed out sure enough another minute and wed have gone down they were in arnest and no mistake theyd got steam up and was determined to finish with us at once whatever it cost em  the instant the attack had ceased cameron had hastened to the hut where the girls were lying to assure them that all danger was over and that the indians were entirely defeated in an hour a fresh skim of ice had formed across the streak of water but as through its clear surface many of the bodies of the indians could be seen the men threw snow over it to spare the girls the unpleasantness of such a sight every time they went out from the cove the bodies of all the indians who had fallen near the island were also covered with snow those nearer the shore were carried off by the iroquois in their retreat  i suppose peter harold said as they sat round the fire that evening you have been in quite as awkward scrapes as this before and have got out all right  why this business aint nothing to that affair we had by lake champlain that were as bad a business when we was surrounded in that log hut as ever i went throughand ive been through a good many pearson and me nigh got our har raised more nor once in that business of pontiacs he were a great chief and managed to get up the biggest confederation agin us thats ever been known it were well for us that that business didnt begin a few years earlier when we was fighting the french but you see so long as we and they was at war the indians hoped as we might pretty well exterminate each other and then they intended to come in and finish off whoever got the best of it waal the english they drove the french back and finally a treaty was made in europe by which the french agreed to clear out  it was jest about this time as pontiac worked upon the tribes to lay aside their own quarrels and jine the french in fighting agin us he got the senecas and the delawares and the shawnees the wyandots and a lot of other tribes from the lakes and the hull country between the niagara river and the mississippi  jack pearson and me we happened to be with the miamis when the bloody belt which pontiac were sending round as a signal for war arrived at the fort there jack and me knew the redskins pretty well and saw by their manner as something unusual had happened i went to the commandant of the fort and told him as much he didnt think much of my news the soldier chaps always despises the redskins till they see em come yelling along with their tomahawks and then as often as not its jest the other way howsumdever he agreed at last to pay any amount of trade goods i might promise to the miamis if the news turned out worth finding out i discovered that a great palaver was to be held that evening at the chiefs village which was a mile away from the fort  id seen a good deal of the miamis and had fought with em against the shawnees so i could do as much with em as most off pearson and i goes to the chief and i says to him look ye here chief ive good reasons to believe youve got a message from pontiac and that it means trouble now dont you go and let yourself be led away by him ive heard rumors that hes getting up a great confederation agin the english but i tell you chief if all the redskins on this continent was to jine together they couldnt do nothing agin the english i dont say as you mightnt wipe out a number of little border forts for no doubt you might but what would come of it england would send out as many men as there are leaves in the forest who would scorch up the redskin nations as a fire on the prairie scorches up the grass i tell yer chief no good can come on it dont build yer hopes on the french theyve acknowledged that theyre beaten and are all going out of the country itd be best for you and your people to stick to the english they can reward their friends handsomely and ef you jine with pontiac sooner or later trouble and ruin will come upon you now i can promise you in the name of the officer of the fort a good english rifle for yerself and fifty guns for your braves and ten bales of blankets ef yerll make a clean breast of it and first tell us what deviltry pontiac is up to and next jine us freelyor anyway hold aloof altogether from this conspiracy till yer see how things is going  waal the chief he thought the matter over and said hed do his best at the palaver that night but till that was over and he knew what the council decided on he couldnt tell me what the message was i was pretty well satisfied for prairie dog were a great chief in his tribe and i felt pretty sartin hed git the council to go the way he wanted i told him id be at the fort and that the governor would expect a message after the council was over  it was past midnight when the chief came with four of his braves he told us that the tribe had received a bloody belt from pontiac and a message that the mingoes and delawares the wyandots and shawnees were going to dig up the hatchet against the whites and calling upon him and his people to massacre the garrison of the fort and then march to jine pontiac who was about to fall upon detroit and fort pitt they were directed to send the belt on to the tribes on the wabash but they loved the english and were determined to take no part against them so they delivered the belt to their friend the white commander and hoped that hed tell the great king in england that the miamis were faithful to him the governor highly applauded their conduct and said hed send the news to the english governor at new york and at once ordered the presents which i promised to be delivered to the chief for himself and his braves when theyd gone he said  you were right peter this news is important indeed and its clear that a terrible storms about to bust upon the frontier whether the miamis will keep true is doubtful but now im on my guard theyll find it difficult to take the fort but the great thing is to carry the news of whats happened to detroit to put them on their guard will you and pearson start at once  in course we agreed though it was clear that the job was a risksome one for it wouldnt be no easy matter to journey through the woods with the hull redskin tribes on the warpath  the commander wanted me to carry the belt with me but i said i might jest as well carry my death warrant to the first redskins as i come across major gladwin who commanded at detroit knew me and i didnt need to carry any proof of my story so afore the miamis had been gone half an hour jack and me took the trail for detroit we had got a canoe hid on the lake a few miles away and we was soon on board the next morning we seed a hull fleet of canoes coming down the lake we might have made a race with em but being fully manned the chances was as theyd have cut us off and seeing that at present war had not been declared we judged it best to seem as if we werent afeared so we paddles up to em and found as they were a lot of wyandots whose huntinggrounds lay up by lake superior in course i didnt ask no questions as to whar they was going but jest mentioned as we was on our way down to detroit were going that way too the chief said and ll be glad to have our white brothers with us so we paddled along together until about noon they landed nothing was said to us as how we were prisoners but we could see as how we was jest as much captives as ef wed been tied with buckskin ropes  jack and me talked it over and agreed as it was no manner o use trying to make our escape but that as long as they chose to treat us as guests wed best seem perfectly contented and make no show of considering as they was on the warpath although seeing as they had no women or children with em a baby could have known as they were up to no good  the next morning they started again at daybreak and after paddling some hours landed and hid away their canoes and started on foot nothing was said to us but we saw as we was expected to do as they did we went on till we was within ten mile of detroit and then we halted i thought it were best to find out exactly how we stood so jack and i goes up to the chief and says that as we was near detroit we would jest say goodby to him and tramp in  why should my white brothers hurry he said it is not good for them to go on alone for the woods are very full of indians but i said the hatchets buried between the whites and the redskins so theres no danger in the woods the chief waved his hand my white brothers have joined the wyandots and they will tarry with them until they go into detroit there are many redskins there and there will be a grand palaver the wyandots will be present  jack and me made no signs of being dissatisfied but the position werent a pleasant one i can tell you here was the redskins aclustering like bees around detroit ready to fall upon the garrison and massacre em and we who was the only men as knew of the danger was prisoners among the redskins it was sartin too that though they mightnt take our lives till they had attacked the garrison they was only keeping us for the pleasure of torturing us quietly arterward the situation was plain enough the question was what were to be done there was about sixty of the varmints around us sitting by their fires and looking as ef they didnt even know as we was there but we knew as sharp eyes was watching us and that afore wed gone five yards the hull lot would be on our track  jack and me didnt say much to each other for we knew how closely we was watched and didnt want em to think as we was planning our escape so after a few words we sat down by one of the fires till it got time to lie down for the night but we had both been athinking we saw when we lay down that the injuns lay pretty well around us while two on em with their rifles ready to hand sat down by a fire close by and threw on some logs as if they intended to watch all night  it was a goodishsize clearing as theyd chose for a campingground and we should have had to run some distance afore we got to the shelter of the trees the moon too was up and it were wellnigh as light as day and anxious as we was to git away we agreed that there were no chance of sliding off but that itd be better to wait till next day  when we woke our guns was gone we complained to the chief who said coldly that his young men would carry the guns and give em back to us when we got to detroit it were no use saying more for he might at any moment have ordered us to be bound and it were better to keep the use of our legs as long as we could  for two days we stayed there not seeing the shadow of a chance of gitting away several redskin runners come in and spoke to the chief and we got more and more anxious to be off we was still allowed to walk about provided we didnt go near the edge of the clearing whenever we went that way two injuns who kept guard by turns over us shouted to us to go no furder  the third morning after a runner had come in the chief gave the word for a move and we set out we saw they wasnt taking the direct line to detroit although still going in that direction and after two hours marching through the woods we got down on to the detroit river here was a big encampment and some three or four hundred shawnees and delawares was gathered here a chief come up to us as we entered the open he gave an order to the wyandots and in a minute we was bound hand and foot carried to a small wigwam and chucked down inside like two logs of wood  after a little talk jack and i agreed as after all we had a better chance of escaping now than when we was watched by a hull tribe and we concluded that there werent no time to be lost the wyandots had no doubt been brought up in readiness to strike the blow and even if wed known nothing about the belt wed have been sure that mischief was intended when these three bands of red varmints had gathered so close to the fort it was sartin we couldnt do nothing till night but we both strained our cords as much as possible to get em to stretch a bit and give us a better chance of slipping out of em no one come near us for some time and as we could hear the sound of voices we guessed that a great council was taking place and we agreed at once to loosen the knots so as to be in readiness for work as like enough theyd put a sentry over us at night  it was a risky thing to try for we might be disturbed at any minute still we thought it were our only chance so jack set to work with his teeth at my knots and in a quarter of an hour had loosened them then i undone his we unbound our thongs and then fastened em up again so that to the eye they looked jest the same as before but really with a jerk theyd fall off  i must teach you how to do that harold some time ye may find it of use the knots was tied up as tightly as before and it would have needed a close examination to see that we was not tied as tight as ever not a word was spoken and we was as quiet as mice for we could hear two redskins talking outside you may guess we was pretty slick about it and i dont know as ever i felt so thankful as when we laid ourselves down again jest as we had been throwed without the slit in the tent having opened and a red face peered in  a quarter of an hour later a redskin come in and looked at us seeing as it seemed to him as we hadnt moved he went out again jest before nightfall two on em came in together rolled us over and looked at the knots they found as these was all right then one sat down jest in the door of the tent and the other took his place outside we waited some hours  at last the fires burned low and the camp got quiet we knew it was wellnigh hopeless to wait for em all to be asleep for redskin natur is a restless one and especially when theres anything on hand theyll turn out two or three times in the night to smoke their pipes by the fires and theyd be the more restless since as wed seen there was only four or five wigwams and all would be sleeping on the ground at last i thought the time were come and gave jack a nudge and we both sat up  it were a ticklish moment young un i can tell ye for we knew that it were scarce possible to get off without the alarm being raised ef the wigwam had stood close to the edge of the forest it would have been compartively easy for once among the trees we might have hoped to have outrun em though the moon was so pesky bright but unfortunately it was built not far from the river and we should have to cross the hull clearing to gain the woods the chances werent good i can tell you but it was clear as we had to try em we had purposely moved about pretty often so that our movements would not attract the attention of the injun now it didnt take a minute to slip out of the cords which tight as they looked really were not fastened at all there being two loose double ends between our arms and our bodies we could see the outside sentry through the open door and we waited till he turned his back and looked out on the river then suddenly i gripped the redskin sitting at the entrance by the neck with both my hands pretty tight as you may reckon and jack ketched his knife from his belt and buried it in his body  that was soon over and not a sound made as would have startled a mouse then standing up i made a spring on to the sentry while jack used his knife as before we let him drop softly down and prepared to bolt when of a sudden the warwhoop sounded not twenty feet away one of the redskins finding the ground hard i suppose was strolling up to speak to the sentry when he saw us tackle him for a moment he were too much surprised to holler but when he did he gave a yell as brought the hull tribe to their feet jack had taken up the sentrys rifle  yed better have held yer tongue he said as he leveled on the redskin and before the whoop was out of his lips the bullet hit him and he went down like a log it didnt need to look round to see as there was no chance of getting to the trees for two hundred redskins was between us and them we must take to the river jack i said it were but thirty yards away i expected every moment as we run to hear the rifle bullets whistle round us but i guess pontiac had given orders that no gun was to be fired lest it might be heard at the fort anyhow not a shot was fired and we got down safe to the bank     chapter xvii   the scouts story  luckily enough there was a canoe lying close at our feet shove it out jack says i and then keep along the bank we gave it a shove with all our strength and sent it dancing out into the river then we dived in and swum down close under the bank there was bushes growing all along and we came up each time under em the redskins was some little distance behind us as we reached the river and in course thought we had throwed ourselves flat in the canoe in a minute or two they got another and paddled off to it and we soon heard the shout they raised when they found it was empty by this time we was a hundred yards below the spot where we had taken to the water and knowing as they would be off along the bank and would find us in no time we scrambled straight up and made for the trees  we was within fifty yards of the edge of the forest and none of the redskins was near us as the hull body had clustered down at the spot where we had jumped in we hadnt fairly set foot on the bank afore they saw us and with a whoopwhich sometimes wakes me even now in my sleep and makes me sit up with the sweat on my foreheadthey started i could run faster then than i can now and ye may guess i went my best we plunged into the trees and went as hard as we could foot it the redskins being fifty or sixty yards behind  our hope was to find a place with a thickish underwood it was darker a deal under the trees than in the clearing still it was not dark enough to hide us from redskin eyes we run straight for we knew they could see us and arter about four hundred yards we come upon a place where the undergrowth grew thick here we began to dodge em turning now one way and now another keeping always low in the bushes they had lost us by sight now but there was so many of em that we pretty nigh despaired of getting through some of em had tried to follow us but the best part had run straight on for a bit and then when sure they had headed us scattered right and left so that they were ahead of us now as well as on our traces and we could hear em shouting all round us so we did the only thing there was to be done and made the best of our way back to the clearing keeping low and taking good care not to cross any patch where the moonlight through the trees fell on the ground  it were lucky for us that it was a camp of braves had it been an ordinary redskin encampment there would have been squaws and boys and wuss still dogs who would have seed us the moment we got back but being all braves on the warpath the hull gang had started arter us and not a soul had remained in the clearing we did not rest there long you may be sure but made straight down to the water there we picked out a canoe crossed the river and got into the shade of the trees the other side then we kept along down it till we got close to the fort of detroit  we could see a good many smoldering fires out afore it and guessed that a strong body of redskins pretending to be friends had camped there we made round em and reached the gate of the fort safe the sentries wouldnt let us in but when a sergeant was fetched it turned out as he knew us seeing that we had been scouting out from thar in the summer pretty thankful we was when the gate closed arter us our news would keep so we waited till morning afore we saw the major and then told him the whole history of the matter and how pontiac had raised all the tribes east of the mississippi against us  we found that pontiac had been into the camp with fifty of his warriors three days afore professing great friendship and had said that in two or three days he would call again and pay a formal visit  detroit then was but a trading post defended by a stockade twenty feet high and twelve hundred yards in circumference about fifty houses of traders and storekeepers stood within it the garrison was composed of 120 men of the eighteenth regiment and 8 officers they had three gunstwo sixpounders and a threepounderand three mortars but their carriages was so old and rotten that they was of no real service two vessels mounting some small guns lay in the river off the fort the governor was a good soldier but he was naturally startled at hearing that there was something like a thousand redskins in the woods round but he said that now he had warning he was not afraid of em a messenger was sent off in a canoe to carry the tidings east and to ask for reenforcements and the traders was all told to get their arms ready  at eight oclock in the morning pontiac was seen acoming with three hundred warriors there had been no declaration of war and the redskins was supposed to be friendly so the major didnt like to be the first to commence hostilities as folks who knew nothing of it might likely enough have raised an outcry about massacring the poor injuns howsumever he called all the troops under arms and disposed em behind the houses the traders too with their rifles were drawn up ready the gates was opened when pontiac arrived and he and his warriors entered they had left their rifles behind them as they pretended that their mission was a peaceful one but they had all got their tomahawks and knives under their blankets they advanced in a body toward where major gladwin and his officers was standing in front of his quarters  jack and me and two or three scouts who happened to be in the fort stood just behind careless like with our rifles so that in case of any sudden attack we could keep them back for a moment or two i noticed that pontiac carried in his hand a wampum belt i noticed it because it was green on one side and white on the other and it turned out arterward that when he twisted that belt with two hands it was to be the signal for an attack  pontiac spoke soft for a time he was a fine redskin that cant be denied he was a catawba by birth but had been adopted into the tribe of ottawas and had risen to be their chief he were a great brave and one of the best speakers i ever heard he was a wise chief as you may guess by the way he got all the tribes to lay aside their private quarrels and make common cause against us i watched him close he kept his eyes on the major and spoke as cool and as calm as if he had nothing on his mind but i could see the warrior glancing about wondering no doubt what had become of the soldiers presently the chief changed his tone and began to pretend as he was in a rage at some grievance or other  the major jest put his whistle to his lips and in a moment from behind the houses the soldiers and traders marched out rifle in hand you never saw a more disgusted crew than them redskins ill do pontiac justice to say that he never so much as moved but jest went on talking as if he hadnt noticed the troops at all the major answered him in the same way and after half an hours talk the redskins went out again without so much as a knife having been shown major gladwin gave jack and me papers testifying as how we had saved detroit from destruction and sent an account of it to governor amherst and to this day jack and me draws special pensions for that ere business besides what we earned as british scouts  that was an adventure peter harold said they did not take detroit after all did they no we beat em off handsome when they tried it then they laid siege to fort pitt and tried very hard there too but the place held out till some troops who had come up marched out from here and raised the siege at some of the little places they succeeded lots of settlers was massacred at fort sandusky ensign paulli and the garrison was massacred by a party of hurons and ottawas who come in as friends this was on the same day as they had intended to do for us at detroit  at st josephs an english ensign with fourteen soldiers was killed by the pottawatomies but nowhere did pontiac obtain any real successes the french in illinois were preparing to leave and he couldnt git no assistance from them after the siege of fort pitt was raised peace was patched up again pontiacs confederacy finding as they hadnt got none of the successes he promised em was beginning to break up and the english saw no chance of doing any good by hunting the redskins among the forests so both parties was willing for peace  pontiac never gave any more trouble and some years arterward coming into one of the towns he was killed by an injun who had a private grudge agin him and now im longing for a quiet pipe and youd better turn in theres no saying whether well have a quiet night of it  a fortnight passed without further incident then the sky became overcast and peter and the indians agreed that snow would soon fall all hands were at once set to work to make up their stores into packages the deerskins and blankets were tied in bundles besides these there were only two kegs of powder and about two hundred pounds of frozen fish  harold was in high glee at the thought that their imprisonment was to come to an end although there was no doubt that the attempt would be a hazardous one as the backwoodsmen were sure that the instant the snow began to fall the indians would be out in great numbers round the island to prevent the defenders taking advantage of the storm  several times harold observed the two backwoodsmen talking with the seneca chief and looking at the sky and he thought that their countenances expressed some anxiety  what is it peter he asked at length dont you think we shall have a snowstorm  we may have snow peter said but i think its more than a snowstorm thats coming the clouds are flying past very fast and it seems to me as ef were in for a big gale of wind  but that will drift the snow and cover our footsteps almost as well as a snowstorm harold said  yes it ll do all that the scout answered  what is the objection to it peter  in the first place lad ef it dont snow we may stop where we are for thered be no chance of getting through the injuns unless it snowed so thick you couldnt see five feet away itll be difficult enough anyhow therell be four or five hundred of the varmints out for theyll bring even their boys with em so as to form a pretty close line round the island our only chancell be for the senecas to go first and to silence afore they can give the alarm any they might meet on our line that might be done in a heavy snowstorm but without snow it would be impossible in the next place even if we got through em wed have to carry our canoe  why harold asked surprised what good could the canoe be to us with the lake frozen hard  you see the wind is on the shore here lad and when it does blow on these lakes it blows fit to take the har off your head its as much as a man can do to make way agin it and i doubt whether the gals could face it even with our help as to carrying a canoe in its teeth it couldnt be done  but why carry the canoe at all peter thats what i cannot understand  waal you see lad the force of the wind acting on sech a big sheet of ice will move it and like enough youd see it piled up in a bank forty feet high on this side of the lake and therell be a strip of clear water half a mile wide on the other thats why we must take the canoe  harold was silent in the face of such a probability it was clear that they must encumber themselves with the canoe  the prevision of the scout proved well founded before evening the wind was blowing with tremendous force small flakes of snow were driven before it inflicting stinging blows on the face and eyes of those who ventured out of shelter as it became dark the lookout announced that he could see large numbers of indians starting from the shore at some distance to the right and left of them showing that the redskins were fully alive to the possibility of the garrison of the island taking advantage of the storm which would hide their trail to effect their escape  every hour the fury of the gale increased and it was unanimously agreed that until it diminished it would be impossible for the girls and for men carrying a canoe to face it  two men were placed on watch at the mouth of the cove where mines similar to the first had been sunk in the ice in a semicircle some little distance outside that before exploded this precaution had been taken on the day succeeding the great repulse of the enemy although the scouts felt assured that the attempt would not be repeated but it was thought possible that the indians might toward morning if they found the whites did not attempt to pass them take advantage of the storm to attempt a surprise  after it became dark cameron and harold as was their custom went into the girls hut to chat until it was time to turn in the deerskin and blankets had again been unrolled and the covering of snow kept the interior warm in spite of the storm without  what is that noise nelly asked in a pause of the conversation  i dont know harold answered i have heard it for some time  all were silent intent upon listening even above the fury of the gale a dull grinding sound with occasional crashes could be heard  i think it must be the ice harold said i will go out and see  on issuing from the hut he was for a time blinded by the force of the wind and the flying particles of snow the din was tremendous he made his way with difficulty in the teeth of the storm to the edge of the rocks then he started in surprise a great bank of cakes and fragments of ice was heaped up against the wall of the rock crashing and grinding against each other as they were pressed onward by fresh additions from beyond already the bank was nearly level with the top of the rock and some of the vast blocks two feet in thickness had been thrust on to it the surface of the lake beyond was no longer a brilliant white every particle of snow had been swept away and the dull gray of the rough ice lay unbroken  he made his way at once to the hut of the men and just as he reached the entrance peter who had also been out to reconnoiter came up and before harold had turned to speak he put his head into the hut  turn out he said i tell ye were in a fix this aint no common gale i dont know as ever ive been in a worse one  whats the use of turning out pearson asked we cant do nothing and its warmer here a sight than it is outside  i tell ye yeve got to go the ice is breaking up fast and its level with the top of the island already unless im mistaken therell be forty foot of ice piled over this island afore an hour  this was indeed alarming news and in a minute the occupants of the hut were all in the open air  you can call in your scouts seneca there aint no fear of an attack tonight no mortal soulnot even an injuncould stand the force of the wind out on the lake  a very short examination sufficed to show the truth of peters anticipations  already the upper part of the bank was sliding over the rock and it was clear that in a very short time the whole would be covered  what is to be done peter harold shouted  we must take to the canoe theres clear water on the other side  harold crossed the island and saw that what peter said was correct a broad strip of black water stretched away in the darkness toward the shore the whole icesheet was moving bodily before the wind and as the island stood up in its course the ice to windward of it was forced up over it while under its lee the lake was clear not a moment was lost the canoe was got out carried over the rocks and carefully lowered into the water under shelter of the island all the stores and provisions were lowered into it a deerskin was spread on the bottom and the girls having been helped down into the boat were told to lie down and were then covered with blankets the men wrapped themselves up in skins and blankets and took their places in the canoe the four indians taking paddles  quickly as the preparations had been made there were but a few feet of the island uncovered by the ice as the last man descended into the boat and they pushed off and after a couple of strokes lay with the boats head facing toward the island at a distance of fifty yards from it although somewhat sheltered from the wind the indians were obliged to paddle hard to maintain their position harold wondered at first that they had not kept closer to the island but he soon understood their reason for keeping at a distance the massive blocks of ice pressed forward by the irresistible force behind began to shoot from the top of the island into the water gliding far on beneath the surface with the impetus of the fall and then shooting up again with a force which would have destroyed the canoe at once had they touched it  soon a perfect cataract of ice was falling peter and pearson took their places on each side of the bow of the canoe with poles to push off the pieces as they drifted before the gale toward the shore the work required the utmost strength and care one touch from the sharpedged blocks would have ripped open the side of the bark canoe like a knife and in the icy cold water encumbered by floating fragments of ice even the best swimmer could not have gained the solid ice the peril was great and it needed all the strength and activity of the white men and the skill of the paddlers to avoid the danger which momentarily threatened them so quickly did the blocks float down upon them that pearson thought it might be impossible to avoid them all the skins therefore were hung round the boat dropping some inches into the water and these although they could not have prevented the boat from being stove in by the larger fragments yet protected its sides from the contact of the smaller ones  for upward of an hour the struggle continued and harold felt something like despair at the thought of a long night passed in such a struggle presently sounds like the booming of cannon were heard above the gale  what is that he shouted to the seneca chief next to whom he was sitting  ice break up the chief replied break up altogether  this proved to be the case as the ice was driven away from the further side of the lake the full force of the wind played upon the water there and as the streak widened a heavy sea soon got up the force of the swell extended under the ice aiding the effect of the wind above and the vast sheet began to break up the reports redoubled in strength and frequently the ice was seen to heave and swell then with a sound like thunder it broke and great cakes were forced one on the top of another and soon instead of a level plain of ice a chaos of blocks were tossing about on the waves  harold watched the change with anxiety no longer was the channel on either side marked by regular defined lines but floating pieces encroached upon it and looking toward the shore the channel appeared to be altogether lost the danger was overwhelming but the indians paddling with increased strength urged the boat forward until within a few yards of the island  a few minutes before such an approach would have assured the immediate destruction of the boat but harold saw with surprise that almost simultaneously with the breaking up of the icesheet the fall of blocks from the island had ceased a moments reflection showed him the reason of this phenomenon with the breakup of the icefield the pressure from behind had suddenly ceased no longer were the blocks piled on the island pushed forward by the tremendous pressure of the icefield the torrent was stayed and they could approach the island with safety as soon as they were assured that this was so the canoe was brought close to the rocks  pearson leaped ashore climbed the rocks and the ice piled twenty feet above them and with his pole convinced himself that at this point there were no loose blocks likely to fall having satisfied himself on this head he descended again and took his place in the boat this was moored by a rope a few feet long to a bush growing from a fissure in the rock close to the waters edge he and peter remained on watch with their poles to fend off any pieces of ice which might be brought round by the waves while the rest of the crew wrapping themselves up in their blankets lay down at the bottom of the boat  the next morning the storm still raged and the lake presented the appearance of an angry sea sheltered under the lee of the island the party were protected from its effects although the light canoe rose and fell on the heavy swell the ice had wholly disappeared from the lake the pieces having been ground to atoms against each other in the storm along the line of shore there was a great bank of ice as high as the treetops  the ways of the lord are wonerful duncan cameron said the storm which threatened to be our destruction has proved our salvation when it abates we shall be able to paddle down the lake without fear of interruption  yes peter said the varmints are not likely to follow us in the first place unless they thought of taking their canoes into the forest when the storm first began which aint likely as they was athinking only of cutting off our escape theyd ve been smashed into tinder in the second place they couldnt ketch us if they had canoes for as weve eight paddles counting them we made out of the seats when we was on shore wed be able to laugh at em and lastly theyve had such a taste of the quality of our rifles that even if they had a dozen canoes on hand i doubt if theyd care to attack us no sir when this storms over we have nothing to do but paddle down to the settlements at the other end of the lake  toward the afternoon the storm abated and next morning the sun was shining brilliantly and the waves had gone down sufficiently to enable the canoe to start on her voyage  now boys pearson said cheerfully ef ye dont want to git froze up again youd best be sharp for i can tell ye about thirtysix hours of this weather and the lakell be solid again  five minutes later the canoe with its eight sturdy paddlers started on its way speeding like an arrow from the icecovered island which had done them such good service in their greatest need  now jake peter said the more strength you put into that paddle of yourn the sooner youll have a piece of meat atween your jaws  the negro grinned  dont talk ob him massa peter dont say a word about him until i see him fish bery good when deres noting else to eat but jake never want to see him again he hab eat quite enough for the rest ob his life  cameron who was not accustomed to the use of the paddle sat in the stern with the two girls but the others were all used to the exercise and the boat literally bounded along at each stroke from the sinewy arms and by nightfall they had reached the opposite shore after some hours work together two of them had rested and from that time they took it by turns six paddles being kept constantly going  without any adventure they arrived safely at the end of the lake the clearing where nelly had lived so long and where her father and mother had been killed was passed in the night much to harolds satisfaction as he was afraid that she would have been terribly upset at the many sad memories which the sight of the place could not but call up on their way down they had seen many gaps in the forest caused by the gale but it was not until they reached their landing place that the full effect of its destructive force was visible several scows and other boats lay wrecks upon the shore every house in the little village was leveled to the ground the orchards were ruined palings and fences torn down and the whole place strewn with fragments  a few people were moving among the ruins they gazed with a dull apathy upon the newcomers apparently dazed by the misfortune that had befallen them harold learned on questioning them that twentyseven persons had been killed and the majority of the survivors more or less seriously injured with the exception of the few whom they saw about all the survivors had been taken off to the town in boats down the river or in wagons lent by neighbors whose villages sheltered in the woods had escaped the ravages of the gale after a few hours halt having obtained meat and other stores they proceeded on their way to detroit  here nelly had several friends who had long believed her to have fallen at the massacre at the farm by them she was gladly received and she took up her abode in a family with some daughters of her own age harold found that there was a considerable sum of money in the bank in her fathers name and from this after a consultation with her a sum of money sufficient to provide the seneca and his followers with blankets powder and indian finery for years was drawn and bestowed upon them  a day or two afterward the indians left for their own country highly gratified with the success of the expedition and proud of the numerous scalps which hung from each of their girdles  harold learned that there was but little fighting going on along the canadian frontier the winter had set in again with extreme severity the st lawrence would be frozen and he would have no means of leaving canada he was therefore well content to settle down until the spring at detroit where he received numerous and hearty invitations to stay for any time from the various friends of his cousins jake of course remained with him peter went up to montreal where he had some relatives residing harold promising to call for him on his way east in the spring pearson after a few days stay in detroit started again with a comrade on a hunting expedition cameron and his daughter also spent the winter at detroit  the months passed very pleasantly to harold since the war began he had had no period of rest or quiet and he now entered with zest into the various amusements sleighing and dancing which helped to while away the long winter in america he also joined in many hunting parties for in those days game abounded up to the very edge of the clearings moose were abundant and the hunt of these grand deer was full of excitement except when the snow is on the ground these animals can defy their pursuers but the latter with their snowshoes go lightly over the frozen snow in which the moose sink heavily  there were many discussions as to the future of nelly several of her friends would gladly have adopted her as a member of their family but harold warmly urged that she should go to england and take up her abode with his mother who was her nearest relative and nelly somewhat to the surprise of her friends finally agreed to this proposal a purchaser was readily found for the farm which was an excellent one and the proceeds of the sale with the amount of savings in the bank gave her a little fortune of some twentyfive hundred pounds  when the spring came and the navigation of the lake was open harold nelly the camerons and jake started in a ship for montreal there they were joined by peter and sailed down to quebec where nelly and the camerons took passage for england very deep was the gratitude which duncan expressed to the friends who had restored his daughter to him he had had enough of the colonies and intended to spend the rest of his life among his own people in scotland harold peter and jake sailed to join the english army in the south     chapter xviii   the siege of savannah  after the surrender of general burgoyne at saratoga the english parliament made another effort to obtain peace and passed an act renouncing all rights to tax the colonists and yielding every point as to which they had been in dispute commissioners were sent over with full authority to treat and had the colonists been ready nominally to submit to england a virtual independence similar to that possessed by canada and the australian colonies at the present time would have been granted as a very large body of the americans had from the first been desirous of coming to terms and as the paralyzed state of trade caused great and general distress it is probable that these terms might have been accepted had it not been for the intervention of france that power had all along encouraged the rebellion she had smarted under the loss of canada and although her rule in her own colonies was far more arbitrary than that of england in america she was glad to assist in any movement which could operate to the disadvantage of this country hitherto nominally she had remained neutral but now fearing that the offers of the english would induce the colonists to make peace she came forward recognized their independence and engaged herself to furnish a large fleet for their assistance  the colonists joyfully accepted the offer seeing that the intervention of france in the struggle would completely alter its conditions heretofore the british had been enabled to send over men and stores at will but were they blockaded by a french fleet their difficulties would be immensely increased  as there had been no cause of quarrel between england and france this agreement was an act of wanton hostility on the part of the latter on obtaining information of the signature of the treaty between france and the colonies the english ambassador was recalled from paris and both countries prepared vigorously for war  the first result was that the english deemed it prudent to evacuate philadelphia and retreat to new york washington endeavored to cut off their retreat and a battle took place at freehold court house in which the americans were worsted washington drew off his army and the british army continued its march to new york without further opposition early in may the french sent off a fleet of twelve ships of the line and six frigates carrying a large number of troops commanded by count destaing an english fleet under admiral byron was lying at portsmouth and this sailed on june 9 in pursuit for it was not until that time that information was received of the intended destination of the french fleet  destaing reached the american coast upon the very day on which the english army reentered new york and after making a demonstration before that town the french fleet sailed for rhode island to expel the british troops under sir robert pigott who held it  lord howe sailed with the fleet from new york to give battle to that of destaing for two days the fleets maneuvered in sight of each other howe being inferior in force wished to gain the weathergauge before fighting failing to do this on the third day he offered battle but a tremendous storm prevented the engagement and dispersed both fleets the french vessels retired to boston and the english to new york  taking advantage of the departure of the french fleet sir robert attacked the american force which had crossed to rhode island to act with the french and drove them from it while crossing the atlantic the fleet under admiral byron had met with a tremendous storm which had entirely dispersed it and the vessels arrived singly at new york when their repairs were completed the whole set out to give battle to the french but destaing finding that by the junction of the two english fleets he was now menaced by a superior force sailed away to the west indies  after his departure an expedition was sent down along the coast to georgia and east florida this met with great success savannah was captured and the greater part of south carolina was occupied the majority of the inhabitants joyfully welcomed the troops and many companies of volunteers were raised  harold had arrived in new york early in the spring he had been offered a commission but he preferred remaining with his two comrades in the position of scout in this way he had far greater independence and while enjoying pay and rations sufficient for his maintenance he was to a great extent master of his own movements at an earlier period of the war he was offered by general howe a commission in the army and his father would have been glad had he accepted it harold however although determined to fight until the struggle between the colonists and the mother country came to an end one way or the other had no great liking for the life of an officer in the regular army but had resolved at the conclusion of the war to settle down upon a farm on the lakesa life for which he felt far more fitted than for the strict discipline and regularity of that of an officer in the army  as with the exception of the attack by the french fleet and american army upon rhode island both parties remained quiet all through the summer of 1778 the year passed uneventfully to him and the duties of the scouts were little more than nominal during the winter fighting went on in the carolinas and georgia with varied success  in the spring of 1779 harold and his comrades were with a party of scouts sent down to georgia where constant skirmishes were going on and the services of a body of men accustomed to outpost duty were required they were landed in may and joined general prevosts force on the island of st john situated close to the mainland and connected with it by a bridge of boats at the end of which on the mainland a post had been erected shortly afterward general prevost left for savannah taking with him most of the troops which were carried away in the sloops which had formed the bridge of boats on the american side general lincoln commanded a considerable army which had been dispatched by congress to drive the english from that state and the carolinas  lieutenant colonel maitland who commanded the post on the mainland was left with only a flatboat to keep up his communication with the island he had under his command the first battalion of the seventyfirst highlanders now much weakened in numbers part of a hessian regiment some provincial volunteers and a detachment of artillery the whole not exceeding 500 effective men hearing that general lincoln was advancing against him colonel maitland sent all his sick baggage and horses across to the island and placed the post as far as possible in a defensive position most of the scouts who had come down from new york had accompanied general prevost to savannah but harold with peter lambton jake and three or four others had been ordered to remain with colonel maitland and were sent out to reconnoiter when the enemy were known to be approaching  this is something like our old work peter upon lake champlain harold said as with his two comrades he took his way in the direction from which the enemy were advancing  ay lad but theyve none of the redskins with em and therell be no great difficulty in finding out all about em besides weve got jake with us and jest about here jake can do better nor we can niggers swarm all over the country and are as ready to work for one side as the other jest as their masters go all jake has got to do is to dress himself as a plantation nigger and stroll into their camp no question will be asked him as he will naturally be taken for a slave on some neighboring estate what do you say jake  jake at once assented and when they approached the enemy he left his comrades and carried their plan into execution he was away six hours and returned saying that the enemy were 5000 strong with eight pieces of artillery  we must hurry back peter said them are big odds agin us ef all our troops was regulars i dont say as they might not hold the place but i dont put much count on the germans and the colonists aint seen no fighting however colonel maitland seems a firstrate officer he has been real sharp in putting the place into a state of defense and i reckon ef the yankees thinks as theyre going to eat us up without trouble theyll be mistaken  jake reported that the enemy were on the point of marching forward and the scouts hurried back to give colonel maitland news of their coming  it was late in the afternoon when they reached the post  at what time do you think they will arrive here the colonel asked when jake had made his report dey be pretty close by dark for sure jake replied  but i dont think sir peter added theyll attack before morning they wouldnt be likely to try it in the dark not knowing the nature of the place  the commander was of the same opinion but to prevent the possibility of surprise he placed pickets at some distance round the fort the scouts being of course of the party  the night passed quietly but at seven in the morning peter harold and jake who were at some distance in advance of the others saw the enemy approaching they fired their pieces and fell back upon the outposts their position was rather to the right of the line of defense the pickets were about to fall back when 70 men being two companies of the seventyfirst under captain campbell were sent out to feel the enemy  were going to have a skirmish peter said i know these highlanders instead of jest firing a bit and then falling back theyll be sticking here and fighting as if they thought they could lick the hull army of the yankees  it was as peter predicted the highlanders took post behind a hedge and maintained a desperate resistance to the advance of the enemy harold and his comrades for some time fought with them  its time for us to be out of this peter said presently lets jest get back to the fort  we cannot fall back till they do peter  i dont see that peter said were scouts and i dont see no advantage in our chucking away our lives because these hotheaded highlanders choose to do so peter lambtons ready to do a fair share of fighting but when hes sure that fighting aint no good then he goes  and suiting the action to the word peter rose from his recumbent position and began to make his way back to the camp taking advantage of every bit of cover  harold could not help laughing for an instant he remained irresolute and then seeing the overwhelming forces with which the enemy were approaching he called to jake and followed peters example so obstinately did the highlanders fight that they did not retreat until all their officers were killed or wounded and only 11 men out of the two companies succeeded in regaining the camp  the whole force of the enemy now advanced against the works and halting at a distance of three hundred yards opened a tremendous fire from their cannon on the intrenchments the defenders replied but so overwhelming was the force of the assailants that the hessians abandoned the portion of the works committed to them and fell back  the enemy pressed forward and had already gained the foot of the abattis when colonel maitland brought up a portion of the seventyfirst upon the right and these gallant troops drove the americans back with slaughter colonel maitland and his officers then threw themselves among the hessians and succeeded in rallying them and bringing them back to the front the provincial volunteers had also fought with great bravery they had for a time been pressed backward but finally maintained their position  the americans finding that all their efforts to carry the post were unavailing fell back to the forest on the english side the loss amounted to 129 the americans fought in the open and suffered much more heavily  the position of matters was suddenly changed by the arrival of count destaing with a fleet of fortyone shipsofwar off the coast the american general lincoln at once proposed to him to undertake a combined movement to force the english to quit georgia the arrival of the french fleet was wholly unexpected and the experiment a frigate of fifty guns commanded by sir james wallace having two or three ships under his convoy fell in with them off the mouth of the savannah river although the experiment had been much crippled by a gale through which she had recently passed sir james wallace would not haul down his flag and opposed a desperate resistance to the whole of the french fleet and did not surrender until the experiment was completely dismasted and riddled with shot  upon the news that the french fleet was off the mouth of the river captain henry who commanded the little squadron of four small english ships fell back to savannah after removing all the buoys from the river he landed his guns from the ships and mounted them on the batteries and the marines and bluejackets were also put on shore to assist in the defense two of the brigs of war were sunk across the channel below the town to prevent the french frigates coming up a boom was laid across above the town to prevent firerafts from being sent down  destaing landed the french troops at the mouth of the river and marching to the town summoned general prevost to surrender the english commander who had sent off a messenger to colonel maitland ordering him to march instantly to his assistance with the force under him which now amounted to 800 men asked for twentyfour hours before giving an answer destaing who knew that general lincoln was close at hand made sure that prevost would surrender without resistance and so granted the time asked for before its expiration colonel maitland after a tremendous march arrived at the town as the french commanded the mouth of the river he had been obliged to transport his troops in boats through the marshes by a little creek which for two miles was so shallow that the troops were forced to wade waistdeep dragging the boats by main force through the mud  upon the arrival of this reenforcement general prevost returned an answer to count destaing that the town would be defended to the last some time was spent by the enemy in landing and bringing up heavy artillery from the ships and the french and americans did not begin their works against the town until september 23 the garrison had utilized the time thus afforded to them to erect new defenses the allied force of the assailants consisted of more than 10000 americans and 5000 french troops while the garrison including regulars provincial corps sailors militia and volunteers did not exceed 2500  nevertheless they did not allow the enemy to carry on their work without interruption several sorties were made the first of these under major graham of the sixteenth regiment reached the lines of the enemy and threw them into confusion large reenforcements came up to their assistance and as grahams detachment fell back upon the town the enemy incautiously pursued it so close up to the british lines that both artillery and musketry were brought to bear upon them and they lost a large number of men before they could regain their works on the morning of october 4 the batteries of the besiegers opened fire with fiftythree pieces of heavy artillery and fourteen mortars general prevost sent in a request to count destaing that the women and children might be permitted to leave the town and embark on board vessels lying in the river there to await the issue of the fight but the french commander refused the request in a letter couched in insulting terms  the position of savannah was naturally strong the river protected one of its sides and a deep swamp partially flooded by it covered another the other two were open to the country which in front of them was for several miles level and clear of wood the works which had been thrown up on these sides were extremely strong when the french first landed there were but ten pieces of cannon upon the fortifications but so incessantly did the garrison work that before the conclusion of the siege nearly one hundred pieces of artillery were mounted on the redoubts and batteries erected round the town upon the side of the swamp there was not much fear of attack but three redoubts were erected to prevent a surprise from this direction the defense on the right face of the town was conducted by colonel maitland the defense on the left consisting of two strong redoubts and several batteries was commanded by lieutenant colonel cruger in the center were several strong works of which general prevost himself took the special supervision the whole british line except where the swamp rendered no such defense necessary was surrounded by a thick abattis the french fire made no sensible impression upon the english defenses and finding that the british artillery equaled his own destaing determined to discontinue the attack by regular approaches and to carry the place by storm his position was a perilous one he had already spent a long time before the place and at any moment the english fleet might arrive from the west indies and attack his fleet which was weakened by the men and guns which had been landed to carry on the siege he therefore determined to risk an assault rather than remain longer before the town to facilitate the attack an officer with 5 men on october 8 advanced to the abattis and set fire to it the wood however was still green and the flames were easily extinguished  the attack was fixed for the following morning bodies of the american militia were to feign attacks upon the center and left while a strong force of the combined armies was to make a real attack in two columns upon the right the troops composing the two columns consisted of 3500 french soldiers and 950 americans the principal force commanded by count destaing in person assisted by general lincoln was to attack the springfield redoubt which was situated at the extreme right of the british central line of defense and close to the edge of the swamp the other column under the command of count dillon was to move silently along the margin of the swamp pass the three redoubts and get into the rear of the british lines  the troops were in motion long before daylight the attempt to burn the abattis had excited the suspicion of the english that an assault might be intended and accordingly pickets were thrown out in front of the intrenchments and the scouts were ordered to keep a sharp watch among the trees which grew in and near the swamp  harold with his friends had accompanied colonel maitlands column in its march to savannah and had labored vigorously at the defenses being especially occupied in felling trees and chopping wood for the abattis before daybreak they heard the noise made by the advance of the enemys columns through the wood and hurried back to the springfield redoubt where the garrison at once stood to arms in this redoubt were a corps of provincial dismounted dragoons supported by the south carolina regiment  just as daylight appeared the column led by count destaing advanced toward the springfield redoubt but the darkness was still so intense that it was not discovered until within a very short distance of the works then a blaze of musketry opened upon it while a destructive crossfire was poured in from the adjoining batteries so heavy was the fire that the head of the column was almost swept away the assailants kept on with great bravery until they reached the redoubt here a desperate handtohand contest took place captain tawse fell with many of his men and for a moment a french and an american standard were planted upon the parapet nevertheless the defenders continued to cling to the place and every foot was desperately contested  at this moment colonel maitland with the grenadiers of the sixtieth regiment and the marines advanced and fell upon the enemys column already shaken by the obstinate resistance it had encountered and by its losses by the fire from the batteries the movement was decisive the assailants were driven headlong from the redoubt and retreated leaving behind them 637 of the french troops killed and wounded and 264 of the americans  in the mean time the column commanded by count dillon mistook its way in the darkness and was entangled in the swamp from which it was unable to extricate itself until it was broad daylight and it was fully exposed to the view of the garrison and to the fire from the british batteries this was so hot and so well directed that the column was never able even to form far less to penetrate into the rear of the british lines  when the main attack was repulsed count dillon drew off his column also no pursuit was ordered as although the besiegers had suffered greatly they were still three times more numerous than the garrison  a few days afterward the french withdrew their artillery and reembarked on board ship  the siege of savannah cost the allies 1500 men while the loss of the garrison was only 120 the pleasure of the garrison at their successful defense was marred by the death of colonel maitland who died from the effects of the unhealthy climate and of the exertions he had made  a few days after the raising of the siege the french fleet was dispersed by a tempest and count destaing with the majority of the ships under his command returned to france  during the course of this year there were many skirmishes round new york but nothing of any great importance took place sir henry clinton who was in supreme command was unable to undertake any offensive operations on a large scale for he had not received the reenforcements from home which he had expected england indeed had her hands full for in june spain joined france and america in the coalition against her and declared war spain was at that time a formidable marine power and it needed all the efforts that could be made by the english government to make head against the powerful fleets which the combined nations were able to send to sea against them it was not only in europe that the spaniards were able to give effective aid to the allies they were still a power on the american continent and created a diversion invading west florida and reducing and capturing the town and fort of mobile  in the spring of 1780 sir henry clinton sent down an expedition under the command of lord cornwallis to capture charleston and reduce the state of south carolina this town was extremely strongly fortified it could only be approached by land on one side while the water which elsewhere defended it was covered by the fire of numerous batteries of artillery the water of the bay was too shallow to admit of the larger menofwar passing and the passage was defended by fort moultrie a very formidable work admiral arbuthnot with the renown romulus roebuck richmond blonde raleigh and virginia frigates with a favorable wind and tide ran the gantlet of fort moultrie succeeded in passing up without great loss and cooperated on the sea face with the attack of the army on the land side  a force was landed on sullivans island on which fort moultrie stood and the fort unprepared for an attack in this direction was obliged to surrender the american cavalry force which had been collected for the relief of the town was defeated by the english under general tarleton the trenches were pushed forward with great vigor and the batteries of the third parallel opened at short range on the town with great execution the advances were pushed forward at the ditch when the garrison seeing that further resistance was impossible surrendered five thousand prisoners were taken 1000 american and french seamen and ten french and american shipsofwar  with the fall of charleston all resistance ceased in south carolina the vast majority of the inhabitants made their submission to the british government and several loyalist regiments were raised  colonel tarleton with 170 cavalry and 100 mounted infantry was dispatched against an american force under colonel burford consisting of 350 infantry a detachment of cavalry and two guns which had taken post on the border of north carolina tarleton came up with him and after a sharp action the americans were entirely defeated one hundred and thirteen were killed on the spot and 207 made prisoners of whom 103 were badly wounded  for some months the irregular operations were continued the americans making frequent incursions into the carolinas the british troops suffered greatly from the extreme heat and the unhealthiness of the climate  in august the american general gates advanced toward camden and lord cornwallis also moved out to that town which was held by a british garrison the position there was not hopeful nearly 800 were sick and the total number of effectives was under 2000 of whom 500 were provincials the force under general gates amounted to 6000 men exclusive of the corps of colonel sumpter 1000 strong which were maneuvering to cut off the english retreat cornwallis could not fall back on charleston without abandoning the sick and leaving all his magazines and stores in the hands of the enemy besides which a retreat would have involved the abandonment of the whole state with the exception of charleston he therefore decided upon giving battle to the enemy who were posted at rugeleys mills a few miles distant leaving the defense of camden to major marthur with some provincials and convalescent soldiers and a detachment of the sixtythird regiment which was expected to arrive during the night  the army marched in the following order the first division commanded by lieutenant colonel webster consisting of four companies of light infantry and the twentythird and thirtythird regiments preceded by an advanced guard of 40 cavalry the second division consisting of provincial troops and two battalions of the seventyfirst regiment followed as a reserve the dragoons of the legion formed the rear guard the force marched at ten oclock on the night of august 16 intending to attack at daybreak the next morning but it happened that at the very same hour in which the british set out general gates with his force was starting from rugeleys mills with the intention of attacking camden in the morning  at two oclock in the night the advanced guards of the two armies met and fired into each other in the confusion some prisoners were taken on both sides and the generals finding that the two armies were face to face halted and waited till morning lord cornwallis placed websters division on the right the second division which was under the command of lord rawdon on the left the battalion known as the volunteers of ireland were on the right of lord rawdons division and communicated with the thirtythird regiment on the left of webster in the front line were two sixpounders and two threepounders under the command of lieutenant macleod r a the seventyfirst with two sixpounders was in reserve one battalion being placed behind each wing the dragoons were held in reserve to charge in the event of a favorable opportunity  the flanks of the english position were covered by swamps which somewhat narrowed the ground and prevented the americans from utilizing fully their great superiority of numbers the americans were also formed in two lines  soon after daybreak lord cornwallis ordered colonel webster to advance and charge the enemy so fiercely did the english regiments attack that the virginia and north carolina troops who opposed them quickly gave way threw down their arms and fled general gates and general casswell in vain attempted to rally them they ran like a torrent and spread through the woods in every direction lord rawdon began the action on the left with no less vigor and spirit than lord cornwallis on the right but here and in the center the contest was more obstinately maintained by the americans  illustration plan of the battle fought near camden august 16th 1780  their reserves were brought up and the artillery did considerable execution their left flank was however exposed by the flight of the troops of carolina and virginia and the light infantry and twentythird regiment were halted in the pursuit and wheeling around came upon the flank of the enemy who after a brave resistance of nearly threequarters of an hour were driven into total confusion and forced to give way on both sides their rout was continued by the cavalry who continued their pursuit twentytwo miles from the field of action  between eight and nine hundred of the enemy were killed and about 1000 many of whom were wounded were taken prisoners among these were major general baron de kalb and brigadier general rutherford all the baggage stores and camp packages a number of colors and several pieces of cannon were taken general gates finding himself unable to rally the militia fled first to charlotte 90 miles from the seat of action and then to hillsborough 180 from camden general gist alone of all the american commanders was able to keep together about 100 men who flying across the swamp on their right through which they could not be pursued by the cavalry made their escape in a body the loss of the british troops amounted to 69 killed 245 wounded and 11 missing the loss of the americans in killed wounded and prisoners exceeded the number of british regular troops engaged by at least 300 it was one of the most decisive victories ever won     chapter xix   in an american prison  upon the morning after the victory of camden lord cornwallis dispatched colonel tarleton with the light infantry and the german legion 350 men in all to attack colonel sumpter who with 800 men and two pieces of cannon had upon hearing late at night of general gates defeat marched away at all speed thinking himself out of danger he halted at midday to rest his men the british came upon them by surprise one hundred and fifty were killed or wounded and 300 made prisoners the rest scattered as fugitives two guns one thousand stand of arms and all the stores and baggage were taken and 250 prisoners some of them british soldiers and the rest loyal militiamen whom sumpter had captured near camden were released  lord cornwallis after obtaining supplies for his troops and taking steps for the pacification of the state was about to move forward into north carolina when he received news of the destruction of a column under major fergusson this officer with a detachment of 150 british regulars and 800 provincials was attacked by 5000 mounted partisans most of them border men accustomed to forest fighting fergusson took up a position on a hill called kings mountain this from its height would have been a good position for defense but being covered with wood it offered great opportunities for the assailants who dismounted and fought behind trees in accordance with the tactics taught them in indian warfare again and again the english charged with the bayonet each time driving their assailants back but these instantly recommenced their destructive fire from their shelter behind the trees in little over an hour from the commencement of the fight 150 of the defenders were killed and many more wounded still they repulsed every attack until their commander fell dead then the second in command judging further resistance in vain surrendered  on the news of this misfortune lord cornwallis fell back as the western frontiers of south carolina were now exposed to the incursions of the band which had defeated fergusson in the retreat the army suffered terribly it rained for several days without intermission the soldiers had no tents and the water was everywhere over their shoes the continued rains filled the rivers and creeks prodigiously and rendered the roads almost impassable the climate was most unhealthy and for many days the troops were without rum sometimes the army had beef and no bread sometimes bread and no beef for five days it was supported on indian corn which was collected in the fields five ears being served out as a daily allowance to each two soldiers they had to cook it as they could and this was generally done by parching it over the fire one of the officers of the quartermasters department found some of the loyal militia grating their corn this was done by breaking up a canteen and punching holes in the bottom with their bayonets thus making a kind of rasp the idea was communicated to the adjutant general and afterward adopted for the army  the soldiers supported their hardships and privations cheerfully as their officers were no better provided than themselves and the fare of lords cornwallis and rawdon was the same as their own  the toilsome march came to an end at last and the army had rest after its labors the only other incident of importance which occurred was an action between a force under colonel tarleton and one of considerably superior strength under general sumpter strongly posted on a commanding position the british attack was repulsed but general sumpter being badly wounded was carried off the field during the night and the force under his command at once dispersed  no other event occurred and the army passed its time in winter quarters till the spring of 1781 during this winter the enemies of great britain were reenforced by the accession of the dutch at this time the efforts which england was called upon to make were indeed great in europe france spain and holland were banded against her in india our troops were waging a desperate war with hyder ali while they were struggling to retain their hold on their american colonies here indeed the operations had for the last two years languished the reenforcements which could be spared were extremely small and although the british had almost uniformly defeated the americans in every action in which there was any approach to equality between the forces engaged they were unable to do more than hold the ground on which they stood victorious as they might be the country beyond the reach of their rifles swarmed with their enemies and it became increasingly clear to all impartial observers that it was impossible for an army which in all did not amount to more than 20000 men to conquer a continent in arms against them  harold was not present at the later events of the campaign of 1780 he and jake had been with the column of major fergusson peter lambton had not accompanied him having received a bullet wound in the leg in a previous skirmish which although not serious had compelled him to lay up for a time  me no like de look ob dis affair massa harold jake said as the americans opened fire upon the troops gathered at the top of kings mountain dese chaps no fools dey all backwoodsmen dey know how to fight de redskins great hunters all ob dem  yes harold agreed they are formidable opponents jake i do not like the look of things these men are all accustomed to fighting in the woods while our men have no idea of it their rifles are infinitely superior to these army muskets and every man of them can hit a deer behind the shoulder at the distance of 150 yards while at that distance most of our men would miss a haystack  the scouts and a few of the provincials who had been accustomed to forest warfare took up their position behind trees and fought the advancing enemy in their own way the mass of the defenders however were altogether puzzled by the stealthy approach of their foes who advanced from tree to tree seldom showing as much as a limb to the fire of the defenders and keeping up a deadly fire upon the crowd of soldiers  had there been time for major fergusson before being attacked to have felled a circle of trees and made a breastwork round the top of the hill the result might have been different again and again the british gallantly charged down with the bayonet but the assailants as they did so glided away among the trees after firing a shot or two into the advancing troops and retreated a hundred yards or so only to recommence their advance as soon as the defenders retired again to their position the loss of the assailants was very slight the few who fell being for the most part killed by the rifles of the scouts  it am no use massa harold jake said jest look how dem poor fellows am being shot down its all up wid us dis time  when upon the fall of major fergusson his successor in command surrendered the post the defenders were disarmed the kentucky men accustomed only to warfare against indians had no idea of the usages of war and treated the prisoners with great brutality ten of the loyalist volunteers of carolina they hung at once upon trees there was some discussion as to the disposal of the rest the border men having accomplished their object were anxious to disperse at once to their homes some of them proposed that they should rid themselves of all further trouble by shooting them all this was overruled by the majority presently the prisoners were all bound their hands being tied behind them and a hundred of the border men surrounded them and ordered them to march across the country  jake and several other negroes who were among the captives were separated from the rest and being put up at auction were sold as slaves jake fell to the bid of a tall kentuckian who without a word fastened a rope round his neck mounted his horse and started for his home the guards conducted the white prisoners to woodville eighty miles from the scene of the fight this distance was accomplished in two days march many of the unfortunate men unable to support the fatigue fell and were shot by their guards the rest struggled on utterly exhausted until they arrived at woodville where they were handed over to a strong force of militia gathered there they were now kindly treated and by more easy marches were taken to richmond in virginia where they were shut up in prison here were many english troops for the americans in spite of the terms of surrender had still retained as prisoners the troops of general burgoyne  several weeks passed without incident the prisoners were strongly guarded and were placed in a building originally built for a jail and surrounded by a very high wall harold often discussed with some of his fellowcaptives the possibility of escape the windows were all strongly barred and even should the prisoners break through these they would only find themselves in the courtyard there would then be a wall thirty feet high to surmount and at the corners of this wall the americans had built sentryboxes in each of which two men were stationed night and day escape therefore seemed next to impossible  the sentries guarding the prison and at the gates were furnished by an american regiment stationed at richmond the wardens in the prison were for the most part negroes the prisoners were confined at night in separate cells in the daytime they were allowed in parties of fifty to walk for two hours in the courtyard there were several large rooms in which they sat and took their meals two sentries with loaded muskets being stationed in each room thus although monotonous there was little to complain of their food if coarse was plentiful and the prisoners passed the time in talk playing cards and in such games as their ingenuity could invent  one day when two of the negro wardens entered with the dinners of the room to which harold belonged the latter was astounded at recognizing in one of them his faithful companion jake it was with difficulty that he suppressed an exclamation of gladness and surprise jake paid no attention to him but placed the great tin dish heaped up with yams which he was carrying upon the table and with an unmoved face left the room a fortnight passed without a word being exchanged between them several times each day harold saw the negro but the guards were always present and although when he had his back to the latter jake sometimes indulged in a momentary grin or a portentous wink no further communication passed between them  one night at the end of that time harold when on the point of going to sleep thought he heard a noise as of his door gently opening it was perfectly dark and after listening for a moment he laid his head down again thinking that he had been mistaken when he heard close to the bed the words in a low voice  am you asleep massa harold  no jake he exclaimed directly ah my good fellow how have you got here  dat were a bery easy affair jake said me tell you all about it  have you shut the door again jake there is a sentry coming along the passage every five minutes  me shut him massa but dere aint no fastening on dis side so jake will sit down wid him back against him  harold got up and partly dressed himself and then sat down by the side of his follower  no need to whisper jake said de walls and de doors bery thick no one hear but de sentries on de walls hear if we talk too loud  the windows were without glass which was in those days an expensive article in america and the mildness of the climate of virginia rendered glass a luxury rather than a necessity confident that even the murmur of their voices would not be overheard if they spoke in their usual way jake and harold were enabled to converse comfortably  well massa jake said my story am not a long one dat man dat bought me he rode in two days someting like one hundred miles it wor a lucky ting dat jake had tramp on his feet de last four years else soon enough he tumble down and den de rope round him neck hang

weight as you can  for a week jake work bery hard dat kentuckian hab a way ob always carrying his rifle about on his arm and as long as he do dat dere no chance ob a fair fight de son he always hab a stick and he mighty free wid it he hit jake seberal times and me say to him once young man you better mind what you do me suppose dat he not like de look dat i gib him he speak to his fader and he

sort ob a ladder dat massa  harold explained to him how it should be made  when you have finished it jake you should twist strips of any sort of stuff cotton or woolen round and round each of the wooden steps so that it will make no noise touching the wall as we climb it then we want a grapnel  me no able to make dat massa  not a regular grapnel jake but you might manage something which would do  what sort ob ting jake asked  harold sat for some time in thought  if the wall were not so high it would be easy enough jake for we could do it by fastening the rope within about three inches of the end of a pole six feet long and three inches thick that would never pull over the wall but it is too high to throw the pole over  jake could trow such a stick as dat ober easy enough massano difficulty about dat but me no see how a stick like dat balance massas weight  it would not balance it jake but the pull would be a side pull and would not bring the stick over the wall if it were only bamboo it would be heavy enough  bery well massa harold if you say so dats all right jake can git de wood easy enough deres plenty ob pieces among de firewood dat would do for us  roll it with strips of stuff the same way as the ladder steps so as to prevent it making a noise when it strikes the wall in addition to the ladder we shall want a length of rope long enough to go from this window to the ground and another length of thin rope more than twice the height of the wall  bery well massa harold me understand exactly whats wanted but itll take two or tree days to make de ladder and me can only work ob a night being caught we must choose a dark and windy night bring two files with you so that we can work together and some oil  all right massa now me go  shut the door quietly jake and do not forget to lock it behind you harold said as jake stole noiselessly from the cell  a week passed without jakes again visiting harolds cell on the seventh night the wind had got up and whistled around the jail and harold expecting that jake would take advantage of the opportunity sat down on his bed without undressing and awaited his coming it was but half an hour after the door had been locked for the night that it quietly opened again  here me am sar wid eberyting dats wanted two files and some oil de ropeladder de short rope for us to slide down and de long thin rope and de piece ob wood six feet long and thick as de wrist  they at once set to work with the files and in an hour had sawn through two bars making a hole sufficiently wide for them to pass the rope was then fastened to a bar harold took off his shoes and put them in his pocket and then slid down the rope into the courtyard with the other rope jake lowered the ladder and pole to him and then slid down himself harold had already tied to the pole at four inches from one end a piece of rope some four feet long so as to form a loop about half that length the thin rope was put through the loop and drawn until the two ends came together  noiselessly they stole across the yard until they reached the opposite wall the night was a very dark one and although they could make out the outline of the wall above them against the skyline the sentryboxes at the corners were invisible harold now took hold of the two ends of the rope and jake stepping back a few yards from the wall threw the pole over it then harold drew upon the rope until there was a check and he knew that the pole was hard up against the edge of the wall he tied one end of the ropeladder to an end of the double cord and then hauled steadily upon the other the rope running through the loop drew the ladder to the top of the wall all this was done quickly and without noise  now jake do you go first harold said i will hold the rope tight below and do you put part of your weight on it as you go up when you get to the top knot it to the loop and sit on the wall until i come up  in three minutes they were both on the wall the ladder was hauled up and dropped on the outside while the pole was shifted to the inside of the wall then they descended the ladder and made across the country  which way we go massa jake asked  i have been thinking it over harold replied and have decided on making for the james river we shall be there before morning and can no doubt find a boat we can guide ourselves by the stars and when we get into the woods the direction of the wind will be sufficient  the distance was about twenty miles but although accustomed to scouting at night they would have had difficulty in making their way through the woods by morning had they not struck upon a road leading in the direction in which they wanted to go  thus it was still some hours before daylight when they reached the james river they had followed the road all the way and at the point where it reached the bank there was a village of considerable size and several fishermens boats were moored alongside stepping into one of these they unloosed the headrope and pushed out into the stream the boat was provided with a sail the mast was soon stepped and the sail hoisted  neither harold nor jake had had much experience in boatsailing but the wind was with them and the boat ran rapidly down the river and before daylight they were many miles from their point of starting the banks of the james river are low and swampy and few signs of human habitation were seen from the stream it widened rapidly as they descended and became rougher and rougher they therefore steered into a sheltered spot behind a sharp bend of the river and anchored  in the locker they found plenty of lines and bait and setting to work had soon half a dozen fine fish at the bottom of the boat they pulled up the kedge and rowed to shore and soon made a fire finding flint and steel in the boat the fish were broiled over the fire upon sticks the boat was hauled in under some overhanging bushes and stretching themselves in the bottom harold and jake were soon fast asleep  the sun was setting when they woke  what you going to do sar jake asked are you tinking ob trabeling by land or ob sailing to new york  neither jake harold answered i am thinking of sailing down the coast inside the line of keys to charleston the water there is comparatively smooth and as we shall be taken for fishermen it is not likely that we shall be overhauled we can land occasionally and pick a few ears of corn to eat with our fish and as there is generally a breeze night and morning however still and hot the day we shall be able to do it comfortably i see that there is an iron plate here which has been used for making a fire and cooking on board so we will lay in a stock of dry wood before we start  the journey was made without any adventure while the breeze lasted they sailed when it fell calm they fished and when they had obtained a sufficient supply for their wants they lay down and slept under the shade of their sail stretched as an awning frequently they passed within hail of other fishingboats generally manned by negroes but beyond a few words as to their success no questions were asked they generally kept near the shore and when they saw any larger craft they either hauled the boat up or ran into one of the creeks in which the coast abounds it was with intense pleasure that at last they saw in the distance the masts of the shipping in charleston harbor  two hours later they landed they fastened the boat to the wharf and made their way into the town unquestioned as they were walking along the principal street they saw a wellknown figure sauntering leisurely toward them his head was bent down and he did not notice them until harold hailed him with a shout of halloo peter old fellow how goes it  peter although not easily moved or excited gave a yell of delight which astonished the passersby  ah my boy he exclaimed this is a good sight for my old eyes here have i been afretting and aworrying myself for the last three months and cussing my hard luck that i was not with you in that affair on kings mountain at first when i heard of it i says to myself the young un got out of it somehow he aint going to be caught asleep waal i kept on hoping and hoping youd turn up till at last i couldnt deceive myself no longer and was forced to conclude that youd either been rubbed out or taken prisoner about a month ago we got from the yankees a list of the names of them theyd captured and glad i was to see yours among em as i thought as how you werent likely to be out as long as the war lasted i was athinking of giving it up and going to montreal and settling down there it was lonesome like without you and i missed jakes laugh and altogether things didnt seem natural like jake im glad to see ye your name was not in the list but i thought it likely enough they might have taken you and set you to work and made no account of ye  that is just what they did but he got away after settling his score with his new master and then made for richmond where i was in prison then he got me loose and here we are but it is a long story and i must tell it you at leisure     chapter xx   the war in south carolina  the fishingboat was disposed of for a few pounds and harold and jake were again fitted out in the semiuniform worn by the scouts on december 13 the very day after their arrival a considerable detachment of troops under general leslie arrived and on the 19th marched 1500 strong to join lord cornwallis harold and his mates accompanied them and the united army proceeded northwest between the roanoke and catawba rivers colonel tarleton was detached with a force of 1000 men consisting of light and german legion infantry a portion of the seventh regiment and of the first battalion of the seventyfirst 350 cavalry and two fieldpieces his orders were to pursue and destroy a force of some 800 of the enemy under general morgan the latter finding himself pressed drew up his troops for action near a place called the cowpens then ensued the one action in the whole war in which the english being superior in numbers suffered a severe defeat  tarleton confident of victory led his troops to the attack without making any proper preparations for it the infantry advanced bravely and although the american infantry held the ground for a time with great obstinacy they drove them back and the victory appeared to be theirs tarleton now sent orders to his cavalry to pursue as his infantry were too exhausted having marched at a rapid pace all night to do so the order was not obeyed and major washington who commanded the american cavalry advanced to cover his infantry these rallied behind their shelter and fell upon the disordered british infantry thus suddenly attacked when they believed that victory was in their hands the english gave way and were driven back a panic seized them and a general rout ensued almost the whole of them were either killed or taken prisoners  tarleton in vain endeavored to induce his german legion cavalry to charge they stood aloof and at last fled in a body through the woods their commander and 14 officers remained with tarleton and with these and 40 men of the seventeenth regiment of dragoons he charged the whole body of the american cavalry and drove them back upon the infantry  no partial advantage however brilliant could retrieve the misfortune of the day all was already lost and tarleton retreated with his gallant little band to the main army under lord cornwallis twentyfive miles from the scene of action the british infantry were all killed wounded or taken prisoners with the exception of a small detachment which had been left in the rear and who fell back hastily as soon as the news of the result of the action reached them the legion cavalry returned to camp without the loss of a man  the defeat at cowpens had a serious influence on the campaign it deprived lord cornwallis of the greater portion of his light infantry who were of the greatest utility in a campaign in such a country while the news of the action had an immense influence in raising the spirits of the colonists hitherto they had uniformly met with ill success when they opposed the british with forces even approaching an equality of strength in spite of their superior arms and superior shooting they were unable to stand the charge of the british infantry who had come almost to despise them as foes in the field the unexpected success urged them to fresh exertions and brought to their side vast numbers of waverers  general morgan who was joined by general greene attempted to prevent cornwallis passing the fords of the catawba it was not till february 1 that the river had fallen sufficiently to render a passage possible colonel webster was sent with his division to one of the principal fords with orders to open a cannonade there and make a feint of crossing while the general himself moved toward a smaller and lessknown ford general davidson with 300 americans was watching this point but the brigade of guards were ordered to commence the passage and were led by their light infantry companies under colonel hall the river was five hundred yards across and the stream so strong that the men marching in fours had to support one another to enable them to withstand its force the ford took a sharp turn in the middle of the river  the night being dark the guards were not perceived until they had reached this point when the enemy immediately opened fire upon them the guide at once fled without his absence being noticed until it was too late to stop him colonel hall not knowing of the bend in the ford led his men straight forward toward the opposite bank and although their difficulties were much increased by the greater depth of water through which they had to pass the mistake was really the means of saving them from much loss as the americans were assembled to meet them at the head of the ford and would have inflicted a heavy loss upon them as they struggled in the stream they did not perceive the change in the direction of the columns march until too late and the guards on landing met them as they came on and quickly routed and dispersed them the british lost 4 killed among whom was colonel hall and 36 wounded  the rest of the division then crossed colonel tarleton with the cavalry was sent against 500 of the americans who had fallen back from the various fords and burning with the desire to retrieve the defeat of the cowpens the legion horse charged the enemy with such fury that they were completely routed 50 of them being killed  morgan and greene withdrew their army through the roanoke river hotly pursued by the english for a few days the british army remained at hillsborough but no supplies of food sufficient for its maintenance could be found there so it again fell back general greene being reenforced by a considerable force now determined to fight and accordingly advanced and took up a position near guilford court house  illustration battle of guilford fought on the 16th of march 1781  the american force consisted of 4243 infantry and some 3000 irregularsfor the most part backwoodsmen from the frontierwhile the british force amounted to 1445 exclusive of their cavalry who however took little part in the fight about four miles from guilford the advanced guards of the army met and a sharp fight ensuedthe americans under colonel lee maintaining their ground stanchly until the twentythird regiment came up to the assistance of tarleton who commanded the advance  the main american force was posted in an exceedingly strong position their first line was on commanding ground with open fields in front on their flanks were woods and a strong fence ran along in front of their line the second line was posted in a wood three hundred yards in rear of the first while four hundred yards behind were three brigades drawn up in the open ground round guilford court house colonel washington with two regiments of dragoons and one of riflemen formed a reserve for the right flank colonel lee with his command was in reserve on the left  as soon as the head of the british column appeared in sight two guns upon the road opened fire upon them and were answered by the english artillery while the cannonade continued the british formed in order of attack the seventyfirst with a provincial regiment supported by the first battalion of the guards formed the right the twentythird and thirtythird led by colonel webster with the grenadiers and second battalion of guards formed the left the light infantry of the guards and the cavalry were in reserve  when the order was given to advance the line moved forward in perfect steadiness and at 150 yards the enemy opened fire the english did not fire a shot till within 80 yards when they poured in a volley and charged with the bayonet the first line of the enemy at once fell back upon the second here a stout resistance was made posted in the woods and sheltering themselves behind trees they kept up for some time a galling fire which did considerable execution general leslie brought up the right wing of the first battalion of guards into the front line and colonel webster called up the second battalion the enemys second line now fell back on their third which was composed of their best troops and the struggle was a very obstinate one  the americans from their vastly superior numbers occupied so long a line of ground that the english commanders in order to face them were obliged to leave large gaps between the different regiments thus it happened that webster who with the thirtythird regiment the light infantry and the second battalion of guards turned toward the left found himself separated from the rest of the troops by the enemy who pushed in between him and the twentythird these again were separated from the guards the ground was very hilly the wood exceedingly thick and the english line became broken up into regiments separated from each other each fighting on its own account and ignorant of what was going on in other parts of the field  the second battalion of guards was the first that broke through the wood into the open grounds of guilford court house they immediately attacked a considerable force drawn up there routed them and took their two cannon with them but pursuing them with too much ardor and impetuosity toward the woods in the rear were thrown into confusion by a heavy fire from another body of troops placed there and being instantly charged by washingtons dragoons were driven back with great slaughter and the cannon were retaken  at this moment the british guns advancing along the road through the wood issued into the open and checked the pursuit of the americans by a welldirected fire the seventyfirst and the twentythird now came through the wood the second battalion of guards rallied and again advanced and the enemy were quickly repulsed and put to flight the two guns were recaptured with two others  colonel webster with the thirtythird returned across the ravine through which he had driven the enemy opposed to him and rejoined the rest of the force the americans drew off in good order the twentythird and twentyfirst pursued with the cavalry for a short distance and were then recalled the fight was now over on the center and left but on the right heavy firing was still going on here general leslie with the first battalion of guards and a hessian regiment had been greatly impeded by the excessive thickness of the woods which rendered it impossible to charge with the bayonet as they struggled through the thicket the enemy swarmed around them so that they were at times engaged in front flanks and rear the enemy were upon an exceedingly steep rise and lying along the top of this they poured such a heavy fire into the guards that these suffered exceedingly nevertheless they struggled up to the top and drove the front line back but found another far more numerous drawn up behind as the guards struggled up to the crest they were received by a tremendous fire on their front and flanks and suffered so heavily that they fell into confusion the hessian regiment which had suffered but slightly advanced in compact order to the left of the guards and wheeling to the right took the enemy in the flank with a very heavy fire under cover of this the guards reformed and moved forward to join the hessians and complete the repulse of the enemy opposed to them they were again attacked both in the flank and the rear but at last they completely dispersed the troops surrounding them and the battle came to an end  this battle was one of the most obstinate and wellcontested throughout the war and the greatest credit is due to the british who drove the enemy three times their own number from the ground chosen by them and admirably adapted to their mode of warfare  the loss as might have been expected was heavy amounting to 93 killed and 413 woundednearly a third of the force engaged between two and three hundred of the enemys dead were found on the field of battle and a great portion of their army was disbanded the sufferings of the wounded on the following night were great a tremendous rain fell and the battle had extended over so large an area that it was impossible to find and collect them the troops had had no food during the day and had marched several miles before they came into action nearly 50 of the wounded died during the night  decisive as the victory was its consequences were slight lord cornwallis was crippled by his heavy loss following that which the force had suffered at the cowpens the two battles had diminished the strength of his little force by fully half provisions were difficult to obtain and the inhabitants some of whom had suffered greatly upon previous occasions for their loyal opinions seeing the weakness of the force and the improbability of its being enabled to maintain itself were afraid to lend assistance or to show their sympathy as they would be exposed on its retreat to the most cruel persecutions by the enemy  three days after the battle lord cornwallis retired leaving 70 of the wounded who were unable to move under the protection of a flag of truce from guilford court house he moved his troops to wilmington in north carolina a seaport where he hoped to obtain provisions and stores especially clothing and shoes  general greene left unmolested after his defeat reassembled his army and receiving reenforcements marched at full speed to attack lord rawdon at camden thinking that he would with his greatly superior force be able to destroy him in his isolated situation the english commander fortified his position and the american general drew back and encamped on hobkirk hill two miles distant to await the coming of his heavy baggage and cannon together with some reenforcements lord rawdon determined to take the initiative and marching out with his whole force of 900 men advanced to the attack the hill was covered at its foot by a deep swamp but the english marched round this and stormed the position the americans made an obstinate resistance but the english climbed the hill with such impetuosity in spite of the musketry and grapeshot of the enemy that they were forced to give way several times they returned to the attack but were finally driven off in confusion one hundred prisoners were taken and lord rawdon estimated that 400 of the enemy were killed and wounded the american estimate was considerably lower and as the americans fought with all the advantage of position while the english were exposed during their ascent to a terrible fire which they were unable to return effectively it is probable that the american loss including the wounded was inferior to that of the english whose casualties amounted to 258  harold and his companions did not take part either in the battle of guilford court house or in that of hobkirk hill having been attached to the fort known as ninetysix because a milestone with these figures upon it stood in the village the force here was under the command of lieutenant colonel cruger who had with him 150 men of a provincial corps known as delanceys 200 of the second battalion of the new jersey volunteers and 200 local loyalists the post was far advanced but so long as lord rawdon remained at camden its position was not considered to be dangerous the english general however after winning the battle of hobkirk hill received news of the retirement of lord cornwallis toward wilmington and seeing that he would thereby be exposed to the whole of the american forces in south carolina and would infallibly be cut off from charleston he determined to retire upon that port before falling back he sent several messengers to colonel cruger acquainting him of his intention but so well were the roads guarded by the enemy that none of the messengers reached ninetysix  colonel cruger being uneasy at the length of time which had elapsed since he had received any communication sent harold and the two scouts out with instructions to make their way toward the enemys lines and if possible to bring in a prisoner this they had not much difficulty in doing finding out the position of two parties of the americans they placed themselves on the road between them no long time elapsed before an american officer came along a shot from peters rifle killed his horse and before the officer could recover his feet he was seized by the scouts they remained hidden in the wood during the day and at night returned with their prisoner to ninetysix thirty miles distant avoiding all villages where resistance could be offered by hostile inhabitants  from the prisoner colonel cruger learned that lord rawdon had retreated from camden and that he was therefore entirely isolated the position was desperate but he determined to defend the post to the last confident that lord rawdon would as soon as possible undertake an expedition for his release  the whole garrison was at once set to work stockades were erected earthworks thrown up a redoubtformed of casks filled with earthconstructed and the whole strengthened by ditches and abattis blockhouses were erected in the village to enable the troops to fire over the stockades and covered communications made between various works the right of the village was defended by a regular work called the star to the left was a work commanding a rivulet from which the place drew its supply of water  colonel cruger offered the volunteers who were a mounted corps permission to return to charleston but they refused to accept the offer and turning their horses into the woods determined to share the fate of the garrison in making this offer the colonel was influenced partly by motives of policy as the stock of provisions was exceedingly scanty and he feared that they would not last if the siege should be a long one besides this he feared that as had already too often happened should the place fall even the solemn engagement of the terms of the surrender would not be sufficient to protect the loyalists against the vengeance of their countrymen  on may 21 general greene with his army appeared in sight of the place and encamped in a wood within cannonshot of the village he lost no time and in the course of the night threw up two works within seventy paces of the fortifications the english commander did not suffer so rash and disdainful a step to pass unpunished the scouts who were outside the works brought in news of what was being done and also that the working parties were protected by a strong force  the three guns which constituted the entire artillery of the defenders were moved noiselessly to the salient angle of the star opposite the works and at eleven oclock in the morning these suddenly opened fire aided by musketry from the parapets the covering force precipitately retreated and 30 men sallied out from the fort carried the intrenchments and bayoneted their defenders other troops followed the works were destroyed and the intrenching tools carried into the fort general greene advancing with his whole army arrived only in time to see the last of the sallying party reenter the village  i call that a rightdown good beginning peter lambton said in great exultation theres nothing like hitting a hard blow at the beginning of the fight it raises your spirits and makes tother chap mighty cautious youll see next time theyll begin their works at a much more respectful distance  peter was right the blow checked the impetuosity of the american general and on the night of the 23d he opened his trenches at a distance of four hundred yards having so large a force he was able to push forward with great rapidity although the garrison made several gallant sorties to interfere with the work  on june 3 the second parallel was completed a formal summons was sent to the british commander to surrender this document was couched in the most insolent language and contained the most unsoldierlike threats of the consequences which would befall the garrison and its commander if he offered further resistance colonel cruger sent back a verbal answer that he was not frightened by general greenes menaces and that he should defend the post until the last  the american batteries now opened with a heavy crossfire which enfiladed several of the works they also pushed forward a sap against the star fort and erected a battery composed of gabions thirtysix yards only from the abattis and raised forty feet high so as to overlook the works of the garrison the riflemen posted on its top did considerable execution and prevented the british guns being worked during the day  the garrison tried to burn the battery by firing heated shot into it but from want of proper furnaces they were unable to heat the shot sufficiently and the attempt failed they then protected their parapets as well as they could by sandbags with loopholes through which the defenders did considerable execution with their rifles  harold and his two comrades whose skill with their weapons was notorious had their post behind some sandbags immediately facing the battery and were able completely to silence the fire of its riflemen as it was certain death to show a head above its parapet  the enemy attempted to set fire to the houses of the village by shooting blazing arrows into them a heavy musketry and artillery fire being kept up to prevent the defenders from quenching the flames these succeeded however in preventing any serious conflagration but colonel cruger ordered at once that the whole of the houses should be unroofed thus the garrison were for the rest of the siege without protection from the rain and night air but all risk of a fire which might have caused the consumption of their stores was avoided  while the siege had been going on the town of augusta had fallen and lieutenant colonel lee marching thence to reenforce general greene brought with him the british prisoners taken there with a scandalous want of honorable feeling he marched these prisoners along in full sight of the garrison with all the parade of martial music and preceded by a british standard reversed  if the intention was to discourage the garrison it failed entirely in its effect fired with indignation at so shameful a sight they determined to encounter every danger and endure every hardship rather than fall into the hands of an enemy capable of disgracing their success by so wanton an insult to their prisoners  the americans strengthened by the junction of the troops who had reduced augusta began to make approaches against the stockaded fort on the left of the village which kept open the communication of the garrison with their water supply the operations on this side were intrusted to colonel lee while general greene continued to direct those against the star  on the night of june 9 a sortie was made by two strong parties of the defenders that to the right entered the enemys trenches and penetrated to a battery of four guns which nothing but the want of spikes and hammers prevented them from destroying here they discovered the mouth of a mine intended to be carried under one of the defenses of the star  the division on the left fell in with the covering party of the americans killed a number of them and made their commanding officer a prisoner  on the 12th colonel lee determined to attempt a storm of the stockade on the left and sent forward a sergeant and six men with lighted combustibles to set fire to the abattis the whole of them were killed before effecting their purpose a number of additional cannon now arrived from augusta and so heavy and incessant a fire was opened upon the stockade from three batteries that on the 17th it was no longer tenable and the garrison evacuated it in the night  the suffering of the garrison for want of water now became extreme with great labor a well had been dug in the fort but no water was found and none could be procured except from the rivulet within pistolshot of the enemy in the day nothing could be done but at night negroes whose bodies in the darkness were not easily distinguished from the treestumps which surrounded them went out and at great risk brought in a scanty supply the position of the garrison became desperate colonel cruger however was not discouraged and did his best to sustain the spirits of his troops by assurances that lord rawdon was certain to attempt to relieve the place as soon as he possibly could do so  at length one day to the delight of the garrison an american royalist rode right through the pickets under the fire of the enemy and delivered a verbal message from lord rawdon to the effect that he had passed orangeburg and was on his march to raise the siege  lord rawdon had been forced to remain at charleston until the arrival of three fresh regiments from ireland enabled him to leave that place in safety and march to the relief of ninetysix his force amounted to 1800 infantry and 150 cavalry general greene had also received news of lord rawdons movements and finding from his progress that it would be impossible to reduce the fort by regular approaches before his arrival he determined to hazard an assault  the american works had been pushed up close to the forts and the third parallel had been completed and a mine and two trenches extended within a few feet of the ditch on the morning of june 18 a heavy cannonade was begun from all the american batteries the whole of the batteries and trenches were lined with riflemen whose fire prevented the british from showing their heads above the parapets at noon two parties of the enemy advanced under cover of their trenches and made a lodgment in the ditch these were followed by other parties with hooks to drag down the sandbags and tools to overthrow the parapet they were exposed to the fire of the blockhouses in the village and major green the english officer who commanded the star fort had his detachment in readiness behind the parapet to receive the enemy when they attempted to storm  as the main body of americans did not advance beyond the third parallel and contented themselves with supporting the parties in the ditch with their fire the commander of the fort resolved to inflict a heavy blow two parties each 30 strong under the command of captains campbell and french issued from the sallyport in the rear entered the ditch and taking opposite directions charged the americans who had made the lodgment with such impetuosity that they drove everything before them until they met the bayonet alone was used and the carnage was greattwothirds of those who entered the trenches were either killed or wounded  general greene finding it useless any longer to continue the attempt called off his troops and on the following day raised the siege and marched away with all speed having lost at least 300 men in the siege of the garrison 27 were killed and 58 wounded  on the 21st lord rawdon arrived at ninetysix and finding that it would be hopeless for him to attempt to overtake the retreating enemy who were marching with great speed he drew off the garrison of ninetysix and fell back toward the coast  a short time afterward a sharp fight ensued between a force under colonel stewart and the army of general greene the english were taken by surprise and were at first driven back but they recovered from their confusion and renewed the fight with great spirit and after a desperate conflict the americans were repulsed two cannon and 60 prisoners were taken among the latter colonel washington who commanded the reserve the loss on both sides was about equal as 250 of the british troops were taken prisoners at the first outset the american killed considerably exceeded our own both parties claimed the victory the americans because they had forced the british to retreat the british because they had ultimately driven the americans from the field and obliged them to retire to a strong position seven miles in the rear this was the last action of the war in south carolina     chapter xxi   the end of the struggle  being unable to obtain any supplies at wilmington lord cornwallis determined to march on into virginia and to effect a junction with the british force under general arnold operating there arnold advanced to petersburg and cornwallis effected a junction with him on may 20 the marquis de la fayette who commanded the colonial forces here fell back just at this time the count de grasse with a large french fleet arrived off the coast and after some consultation with general washington determined that the french fleet and the whole american army should operate together to crush the forces under lord cornwallis  the english were hoodwinked by reports that the french fleet was intended to operate against new york and it was not until they learned that the count de grasse had arrived with twentyeight ships of the line at the mouth of the chesapeake bay that the true object of the expedition was seen a portion of the english fleet encountered them but after irregular actions lasting over five days the english drew off and retired to new york the commanderinchief then attempted to effect a diversion in order to draw off some of the enemy who were surrounding cornwallis the fort of new london was stormed after some desperate fighting and great quantities of ammunition and stores and fifty pieces of cannon taken general washington did not allow his attention to be distracted matters were in a most critical condition for although to the english the prospect of ultimate success appeared slight indeed the americans were in a desperate condition their immense and longcontinued efforts had been unattended with any material success it was true that the british troops held no more ground now than they did at the end of the first year of the war but no efforts of the colonists had succeeded in wresting that ground from them the people were exhausted and utterly disheartened business of all sorts was at a standstill money had ceased to circulate and the credit of congress stood so low that its bonds had ceased to have any value whatever the soldiers were unpaid ill fed and mutinous if on the english side it seemed that the task of conquering was beyond them the americans were ready to abandon the defense from sheer exhaustion it was then of paramount necessity to general washington that a great and striking success should be obtained to animate the spirits of the people  cornwallis seeing the formidable combination which the french and americans were making to crush him sent message after message to new york to ask for aid from the commanderinchief and received assurances from him that he would at once sail with 4000 troops to join him accordingly in obedience to his orders lord cornwallis fortified himself at yorktown  on september 28 the combined army of french and americans consisting of 7000 of the former and 12000 of the latter appeared before yorktown and the post at gloucester lord cornwallis had 5960 men but so great had been the effects of the deadly climate in the autumn months that only 4017 men were reported as fit for duty  the enemy at once invested the town and opened their trenches against it from their fleet they had drawn an abundance of heavy artillery and on october 9 their batteries opened a tremendous fire upon the works each day they pushed their trenches closer and the british force was too weak in comparison with the number of its assailants to venture upon sorties the fire from the works was completely overpowered by that of the enemy and the ammunition was nearly exhausted day after day passed and still the promised reenforcements did not arrive lord cornwallis was told positively that the fleet would set sail on october 8 but it came not nor did it leave port until the 19th the day on which lord cornwallis surrendered  on the 16th finding that he must either surrender or break through he determined to cross the river and fall on the french rear with his whole force and then turn northward and force his way through maryland pennsylvania and the jerseys in the night the light infantry the greater part of the guards and part of the twentythird were embarked in boats and crossed to the gloucester side of the river before midnight at this critical moment a violent storm arose which prevented the boats returning the enemys fire reopened at daybreak and the engineer and principal officers of the army gave it as their opinion that it was impossible to resist longer only one eightinch shell and a hundred small ones remained the defenses had in many places tumbled to ruins and no effectual resistance could be opposed to an assault  accordingly lord cornwallis sent out a flag of truce and arranged terms of surrender on the 24th the fleet and reenforcements arrived off the mouth of the chesapeake had they left new york at the time promised the result of the campaign would have been different  the army surrendered as prisoners of war until exchanged the officers with liberty to proceed on parole to europe and not to serve until exchanged the loyal americans were embarked on the bonito sloop of war and sent to new york in safety lord cornwallis having obtained permission to send off the ship without her being searched with as many soldiers on board as he should think fit so that they were accounted for in any further exchange he was thus enabled to send off such of the inhabitants and loyalist troops as would have suffered from the vengeance of the americans  the surrender of lord cornwallis army virtually ended the war the burden entailed on the people in england by the great struggle against france spain holland and america united in arms against her was enormous so long as there appeared any chance of recovering the colony the english people made the sacrifices required of them but the conviction that it was impossible for them to wage a war with half of europe and at the same time to conquer a continent had been gaining more and more in strength even the most sanguine were silenced by the surrender of yorktown and a cry arose throughout the country that peace should at once be made  as usual under the circumstances a change of ministry took place negotiations for peace were at once commenced and the war terminated in the acknowledgment of the entire independence of the united states of america  harold with his companions had fallen back to charleston with lord rawdon after the relief of ninetysix and remained there until the news arrived that the negotiations were on foot and that peace was now certain then he took his discharge and sailed at once for england accompanied by jake peter lambton taking a passage to canada to carry out his intention of settling at montreal  harold was now past twentytwo and his father and mother did not recognize him when without warning he arrived at their residence in devonshire it was six years since his mother had seen him when she sailed from boston before its surrender in 1776  for a year he remained quiet at home and then carried out his plan of returning to the american continent and settling in canada  accompanied by jake he sailed for the st lawrence and purchased a snug farm on its banks near the spot where it flows from lake ontario  he greatly improved it built a comfortable house upon it and two years later returned to england whence he brought back his cousin nelly as his wife  her little fortune was used in adding to the farm and it became one of the largest and best managed in the country peter lambton found montreal too crowded for him and settled down on the estate supplying it with fish and game so long as his strength enabled him to go about and enjoying the society of jack pearson who had married and established himself on a farm close by as years went on and the population increased the property became very valuable and harold before he died was one of the wealthiest and most respected men in the colony so long as his mother lived he and his wife paid occasional visits to england but after her death his family and farm had so increased that it was inconvenient to leave them his father therefore returned with him to canada and ended his life there jake lived to a good old age and was harolds faithful friend and righthand man to the last   the end
