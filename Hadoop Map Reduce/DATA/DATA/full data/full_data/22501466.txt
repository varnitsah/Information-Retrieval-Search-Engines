22501466	prose idylls new and old     contents    a charm of birds    chalkstream studies    the fens    my wintergarden    from ocean to sea    north devon    i  a charm of birds 1    is it merely a fancy that we english the educated people among us at least are losing that love for spring which among our old forefathers rose almost to worship  that the perpetual miracle of the budding leaves and the returning songbirds awakes no longer in us the astonishment which it awoke yearly among the dwellers in the old world when the sun was a god who was sick to death each winter and returned in spring to life and health and glory when the death of adonis at the autumnal equinox was wept over by the syrian women and the death of baldur in the colder north by all living things even to the dripping trees and the rocks furrowed by the autumn rains when freya the goddess of youth and love went forth over the earth each spring while the flowers broke forth under her tread over the brown moors and the birds welcomed her with song when according to olaus magnus the goths and south swedes had on the return of spring a mock battle between summer and winter and welcomed the returning splendour of the sun with dancing and mutual feasting rejoicing that a better season for fishing and hunting was approaching  to those simpler children of a simpler age in more direct contact with the daily and yearly facts of nature and more dependent on them for their bodily food and life winter and spring were the two great facts of existence the symbols the one of death the other of life and the battle between the twothe battle of the sun with darkness of winter with spring of death with life of bereavement with lovelay at the root of all their myths and all their creeds  surely a change has come over our fancies  the seasons are little to us now  we are nearly as comfortable in winter as in summer or in spring  nay we have begun of late to grumble at the two latter as much as at the former and talk and not without excuse at times of the treacherous month of may and of summer having set in with its usual severity  we work for the most part in cities and towns and the seasons pass by us unheeded  may and june are spent by most educated people anywhere rather than among birds and flowers  they do not escape into the country till the elm hedges are growing black and the songbirds silent and the hay cut and all the virgin bloom of the country has passed into a sober and matronly ripenessif not into the sere and yellow leaf  our very landscape painters till creswick arose and recalled to their minds the fact that trees were sometimes green were wont to paint few but brown autumnal scenes  as for the song of birds of which in the middle age no poet could say enough our modern poets seem to be forgetting that birds ever sing  it was not so of old  the climate perhaps was more severe than now the transition from winter to spring more sudden like that of scandinavia now  clearage of forests and drainage of land have equalized our seasons or rather made them more uncertain  more broken winters are followed by more broken springs and mayday is no longer a marked point to be kept as a festival by all childlike hearts  the merry month of may is merry only in stage songs  the may garlands and dances are all but gone  the borrowed plate and the milkmaids who borrowed it gone utterly  no more does mrs pepys go to lie at woolwich in order to a little ayre and to gather may dew for her complexion by mrs turners advice  the maypole is gone likewise and never more shall the puritan soul of a stubbs be aroused in indignation at seeing against maie every parish towne and village assemble themselves together both men women and children olde and young all indifferently and goe into the woodes and groves hilles and mountaines where they spend the night in pastyme and in the morning they returne bringing with them birch bowes and braunches of trees to deck their assembly withal    they have twentie or fourtie yoke of oxen every oxe having a sweete nosegay of flowers tyed on the tippe of his hornes and these draw home this maypole this stincking idol rather which is covered all over with flowers and hearbes with two or three hundred men women and children following it with great devotion    and then they fall to banquet and feast daunce and leap about it as the heathen people did at the dedication of their idolles whereof this is a perfect pattern or the thing itself  this and much more says poor stubbs in his anatomie of abuses and had no doubt good reason enough for his virtuous indignation at mayday scandals  but people may be made dull without being made good and the direct and only effect of putting down may games and such like was to cut off the dwellers in towns from all healthy communion with nature and leave them to mere sottishness and brutality  yet perhaps the may games died out partly because the feelings which had given rise to them died out before improved personal comforts of old men and women fared hardly and slept cold and were thankful to almighty god for every beam of sunshine which roused them out of their long hybernation thankful for every flower and every bird which reminded them that joy was stronger than sorrow and life than death  with the spring came not only labour but enjoyment   in the spring the young mans fancy lightly turned to thoughts of love   as lads and lasses who had been pining for each other by their winter firesides met again like daphnis and chloe by shaugh and lea and learnt to sing from the songs of birds and to be faithful from their faithfulness  then went out troops of fair damsels to seek spring garlands in the forest as scheffel has lately sung once more in his frau aventiure and while the dead leaves rattled beneath their feet hymned la regine avrillouse to the music of some minnesinger whose song was as the song of birds to whom the birds were friends fellowlovers teachers mirrors of all which he felt within himself of joyful and tender true and pure friends to be fed hereafter as walther von der vogelweide had them fed with crumbs upon his grave  true melody it must be remembered is unknown at least at present in the tropics and peculiar to the races of those temperate climes into which the songbirds come in spring  it is hard to say why exquisite songsters and those strangely of an european type may be heard anywhere in tropical american forests  but native races whose hearts their song can touch are either extinct or yet to come some of the old german minnelieder on the other hand seem actually copied from the songs of birds  tanderadei does not merely ask the nightingale to tell no tales it repeats in its cadences the nightingales song as the old minnesinger heard it when he nestled beneath the limetree with his love  they are often almost as inarticulate these old singers as the birds from whom they copied their notes the thinnest chain of thought links together some bird like refrain  but they make up for their want of logic and reflection by the depth of their passion the perfectness of their harmony with nature  the inspired swabian wandering in the pine forest listens to the blackbirds voice till it becomes his own voice and he breaks out with the very carol of the blackbird   vogele im tannenwald pfeifet so hell pfeifet de wald aus und ein wo wird mein schatze sein vogele im tannenwald pfeitet so hell   and he has nothing more to say  that is his whole soul for the time being and like a bird he sings it over and over again and never tires  another a niederrheinischer watches the moon rise over the lowenburg and thinks upon his love within the castle hall till he breaks out in a strange sad tender melodynot without stateliness and manly confidence in himself and in his belovedin the true strain of the nightingale   verstohlen geht der mond auf blau blau blumelein durch silberwolkchen fuhrt sein lauf rosen im thal madel im saal o schonste rosa    und siehst du mich und siehst du sie blau blau blumelein zwei treure herzen sahst du nie rosen im thal u s w   there is little sense in the words doubtless according to our modern notions of poetry but they are like enough to the long plaintive notes of the nightingale to say all that the poet has to say again and again through all his stanzas  thus the birds were to the mediaeval singers their orchestra or rather their chorus from the birds they caught their melodies the sounds which the birds gave them they rendered into words  and the same bird keynote surely is to be traced in the early english and scotch songs and ballads with their often meaningless refrains sung for the mere pleasure of singing   binnorie o binnorie   or    with a hey lillelu and a how lo lan and the birk and the broom blooms bonnie   or    she sat down below a thorn    fine flowers in the valley and there has she her sweet babe born    and the green leaves they grow rarely   or even those fallalas and other nonsense refrains which if they were not meant to imitate birdnotes for what were they meant  in the old ballads too one may hear the bird keynote  he who wrote and a great rhymer he was   as i was walking all alane i heard twa corbies making a mane   had surely the mane of the corbies in his ears before it shaped itself into words in his mind  and he had listened to many a woodwele who first thrummed on harp or fiddled on crowd how    in summer when the shawes be shene    and leaves be large and long it is full merry in fair forest    to hear the fowles song  the woodwele sang and wolde not cease    sitting upon the spray so loud it wakened robin hood    in the greenwood where he lay   and shakespeareare not his scraps of song saturated with these same birdnotes  where the bee sucks when daisies pied under the greenwood tree it was a lover and his lass when daffodils begin to peer ye spotted snakes have all a ring in them which was caught not in the roar of london or the babble of the globe theatre but in the woods of charlecote and along the banks of avon from   the ouzelcock so black of hue    with orangetawny bill the throstle with his note so true    the wren with little quill the finch the sparrow and the lark    the plainsong cuckoo gray    and all the rest of the birds of the air  why is it again that so few of our modern songs are truly songful and fit to be set to music  is it not that the writers of them persons often of much taste and poetic imaginationhave gone for their inspiration to the intellect rather than to the ear  that as shelley does by the skylark and wordsworth by the cuckoo instead of trying to sing like the birds they only think and talk about the birds and therefore however beautiful and true the thoughts and words may be they are not song  surely they have not like the mediaeval songsters studied the speech of the birds the primaeval teachers of melody nor even melodies already extant round which as round a framework of pure music their thoughts and images might crystallize themselves certain thereby of becoming musical likewise the best modern song writers burns and moore were inspired by their old national airs and followed them moore at least with a reverent fidelity which has had its full reward  they wrote words to music and not as modern poets are wont wrote the words first and left others to set music to the words  they were right and we are wrong as long as song is to be the expression of pure emotion so long it must take its key from musicwhich is already pure emotion untranslated into the grosser medium of thought and speechoften as in the case of mendelssohns songs without words not to be translated into it at all  and so it may be that in some simpler age poets may go back like the old minnesingers to the birds of the forest and learn of them to sing  and little do most of them know how much there is to learn what variety of character as well as variety of emotion may be distinguished by the practised ear in a charm of birds to use the old southern phrase from the wild cry of the misselthrush ringing from afar in the first bright days of march a passage of one or two bars repeated three or four times and then another and another clear and sweet and yet defiantfor the great stormcock loves to sing when rain and wind is coming on and faces the elements as boldly as he faces hawk and crowdown to the delicate warble of the wren who slips out of his hole in the brown bank where he has huddled through the frost with wife and children all folded in each others arms like human beings for the sake of warmthwhich alas does not always suffice for many a lump of wrens may be found frozen and shrivelled after a severe winter  yet even he sitting at his housedoor in the low sunlight says grace for all mercies as a little child once worded it in a song so rapid so shrill so loud and yet so delicately modulated that you wonder at the amount of soul within that tiny body and then stops suddenly as a child who has said its lesson or got to the end of the sermon gives a selfsatisfied flirt of his tail and goes in again to sleep  character  i know not how much variety of character there may be between birds of the same species but between species and species the variety is endless and is shownas i fondly believein the difference of their notes  each has its own speech inarticulate expressing not thought but hereditary feeling save a few birds who like those little dumb darlings the spotted flycatchers seem to have absolutely nothing to say and accordingly have the wit to hold their tongues and devote the whole of their small intellect to sitting on the iron rails flitting off them a yard or two to catch a butterfly in air and flitting back with it to their nest  but listen to the charm of birds in any sequestered woodland on a bright forenoon in june  as you try to disentangle the medley of sounds the first perhaps which will strike your ear will be the loud harsh monotonous flippant song of the chaffinch and the metallic clinking of two or three sorts of titmice  but above the treetops rising hovering sinking the woodlark is fluting tender and low  above the pastures outside the skylark singsas he alone can sing and close by from the hollies rings out the blackbirds tenorrollicking audacious humorous all but articulate  from the tree above him rises the treble of the thrush pure as the song of angels  more pure perhaps in tone though neither so varied nor so rich as the song of the nightingale  and there in the next holly is the nightingale himself  now croaking like a frog now talking aside to his wife on the nest below and now bursting out into that song or cycle of songs in which if any man finds sorrow he himself surely finds none  all the morning he will sing and again at evening till the small hours and the chill before the dawn  but if his voice sounds melancholy at night heard all alone or only mocked by the ambitious blackcap it sounds in the bright morning that which it is the fulness of joy and love  miltons   sweet bird that shunst the noise of folly most musical most melancholy   is untrue to fact  so far from shunning the noise of folly the nightingale sings as boldly as anywhere close to a stagecoach road or a public path as anyone will testify who recollects the wranglers walk from cambridge to trumpington forty years ago when the covert which has now become hollow and shelterless held at every twenty yards an unabashed and jubilant nightingale  coleridge surely was not far wrong when he guessed that    some nightwandering man whose heart was pierced with the remembrance of a grievous wrong or slow distemper or neglected love and so poor wretch filled all things with himself and made all gentle sounds tell back the tale of his own sorrowhe and such as he first named these sounds a melancholy strain and many a poet echoes the conceit   that the old greek poets were right and had some grounds for the myth of philomela i do not dispute though sophocles speaking of the nightingales of colonos certainly does not represent them as lamenting  the elizabethan poets however when they talked of philomel her breast against a thorn were unaware that they and the greeks were talking of two different birds that our english lusciola luscinia is not lusciola philomela one of the various birds called bulbul in the east  the true philomel hardly enters venetia hardly crosses the swiss alps ventures not into the rhineland and denmark but penetrates strangely enough further into south sweden than our own luscinia  ranging meanwhile over all central europe persia and the east even to egypt  whether his song be really sad let those who have heard him say  but as for our own luscinia who winters not in egypt and arabia but in morocco and algeria the only note of his which can be mistaken for sorrow is rather one of too great joy that cry which is his highest feat of art which he cannot utter when he first comes to our shores but practises carefully slowly gradually till he has it perfect by the beginning of june that cry long repeated loudening and sharpening in the intensity of rising passion till it stops suddenly exhausted at the point where pleasure from very keenness turns to pain and    in the topmost height of joy his passion clasps a secret grief   how different in character from his song is that of the gallant little blackcap in the tree above him  a gentleman he is of a most ancient house perhaps the oldest of european singing birds  how perfect must have been the special organization which has spread seemingly without need of alteration or improvement from norway to the cape of good hope from japan to the azores  how many ages must have passed since his forefathers first got their black caps  and how intense and fruitful must have been the original vitality which after so many generations can still fill that little body with so strong a soul and make him sing as miltons newcreated birds sang to miltons eve in miltons paradise  sweet he is and various rich and strong beyond all english warblers save the nightingale but his speciality is his force his rush his overflow not so much of love as of happiness  the spirit carries him away  he riots up and down the gamut till he cannot stop himself his notes tumble over each other he chuckles laughs shrieks with delight throws back his head droops his tail sets up his back and sings with every fibre of his body  and yet he never forgets his good manners  he is never coarse never harsh for a single note  always graceful always sweet he keeps perfect delicacy in his most utter carelessness  and why should we overlook common though he be yon hedgesparrow who is singing so modestly and yet so firmly and so true  or cock robin himself who is here as everywhere honest selfconfident and cheerful  most people are not aware one sometimes fancies how fine a singer is cockrobin now in the springtime when his song is drowned by or at least confounded with a dozen other songs  we know him and love him best in winter when he takes up as he does sometimes in cold wet summer days that sudden wistful warble struggling to be happy half in vain which surely contradicts coleridges verse   in nature there is nothing melancholy   but he who will listen carefully to the robins breeding song on a bright day in may will agree i think that he is no mean musician and that for force variety and character of melody he is surpassed only by blackcap thrush and nightingale  and what is that song sudden loud sweet yet faltering as if half ashamed  is it the willow wren or the garden warbler  the two birds though very remotely allied to each other are so alike in voice that it is often difficult to distinguish them unless we attend carefully to the expression  for the garden warbler beginning in high and loud notes runs down in cadence lower and softer till joy seems conquered by very weariness while the willow wren with a sudden outbreak of cheerfulness though not quite sure it is impossible to describe birdsongs without attributing to the birds human passions and frailties that he is not doing a silly thing struggles on to the end of his story with a hesitating hilarity in feeble imitation of the blackcaps bacchanalian dactyls  and now againis it true that   in nature there is nothing melancholy   mark that slender graceful yellow warbler running along the high oak boughs like a perturbed spirit seeking restlessly anxiously something which he seems never to find and uttering every now and then a long anxious cry four or five times repeated which would be a squeal were it not so sweet  suddenly he flits away and flutters round the pendant tips of the beechsprays like a great yellow butterfly picking the insects from the leaves then flits back to a bare bough and sings with heaving breast and quivering wings a short shrill feeble tremulous song and then returns to his old sadness wandering and complaining all day long  is there no melancholy in that cry  it sounds sad  why should it not be meant to be sad  we recognize joyful notes angry notes fearful notes  they are very similar strangely enough in all birds  they are very similar more strangely still to the cries of human beings especially children when influenced by the same passions  and when we hear a note which to us expresses sadness why should not the bird be sad  yon wood wren has had enough to make him sad if only he recollects it and if he can recollect his road from morocco hither he may be recollects likewise what happened on the roadthe long weary journey up the portuguese coast and through the gap between the pyrenees and the jaysquivel and up the landes of bordeaux and across brittany flitting by night and hiding and feeding as he could by day and how his mates flew against the lighthouses and were killed by hundreds and how he essayed the british channel and was blown back shrivelled up by bitter blasts and how he felt nevertheless that that wan water he must cross he knew not why  but something told him that his mother had done it before him and he was flesh of her flesh life of her life and had inherited her instinctas we call hereditary memory in order to avoid the trouble of finding out what it is and how it comes  a duty was laid on him to go back to the place where he was bred and he must do it  and now it is done and he is weary and sad and lonely and for aught we know thinking already that when the leaves begin to turn yellow he must go back again over the channel over the landes over the pyrenees to morocco once more  why should he not be sad  he is a very delicate bird as both his shape and his note testify  he can hardly keep up his race here in england and is accordingly very uncommon while his two cousins the willow wren and the chiffchaff who like him build for some mysterious reason domed nests upon the ground are stout and busy and numerous and thriving everywhere  and what he has gone through may be too much for the poor wood wrens nerves and he gives way while willow wren blackcap nightingale who have gone by the same road and suffered the same dangers have stoutness of heart enough to throw off the past and give themselves up to present pleasure  why notwho knows  there is labour danger bereavement death in nature and why should not some at least of the socalled dumb things know it and grieve at it as well as we  why notunless we yield to the assumption for it is nothing more that these birds act by some unknown thing called instinct as it might be called x or y and are in fact just like the singing birds which spring out of snuffboxes only so much better made that they can eat grow and propagate their species  the imputation of acting by instinct cuts both ways  we too are creatures of instinct  we breathe and eat by instinct  but we talk and build houses by reason and so may the birds  it is more philosophical surely to attribute actions in them to the same causes to which we attribute them from experience in ourselves  but if so some will say birds must have souls  we must define what our own souls are before we can define what kind of soul or nosoul a bird may or may not have  the truth is that we want to set up some dignity of human nature some innate superiority to the animals on which we may pride ourselves as our own possession and not return thanks with fear and trembling for it as the special gift of almighty god  so we have given the poor animals over to the mechanical philosophy and allowed them to be considered as only mere cunningly devised pieces of watchwork if philosophy would only spare us and our fine human souls of which we are so proud though they are doing all the wrong and folly they can from one weeks end to the other  and now our selfconceit has brought its own nemesis the mechanical philosophy is turning on us and saying the birds nature and your human nature differ only in degree but not in kind  if they are machines so are you  they have no souls you confess  you have none either  but there are those who neither yield to the mechanical philosophy nor desire to stifle it  while it is honest and industrious as it is now it can do nought but good because it can do nought but discover facts  it will only help to divide the light from the darkness truth from dreams health from disease  let it claim for itself all that it can prove to be of the flesh fleshly  that which is spiritual will stand out more clearly as of the spirit  let it thrust scalpel and microscope into the most sacred penetralia of brain and nerve  it will only find everywhere beneath brain and beneath nerve that substance and form which is not matter nor phenomenon but the divine cause thereof and while it helps with ruthless but wholesome severity to purge our minds from idols of the cave and idols of the fane it will leave untouched more clearly defined and therefore more sacred and important than ever          those first affections    those shadowy recollections    which be they what they may are yet the fountain light of all our day    are yet the master light of all our seeing uphold us cherish and have power to make    our noisy years seem moments in the being of the eternal silence truths that wake       to perish never which neither listlessness nor mad endeavour       nor man nor boy    nor all that is at enmity with joy    can utterly abolish or destroy    then sing ye birds sing out with joyous sound   as the poetphilosopher bids you  victorious analysis will neither abolish you nor the miraculous and unfathomable in you and in your song which has stirred the hearts of poets since first man was man and if anyone shall hint to us that we and the birds may have sprung originally from the same type that the difference between our intellect and theirs is one of degree and not of kind we may believe or doubt  but in either case we shall not be greatly moved so much the better for the birds we will say and none the worse for us  you raise the birds towards us  but you do not lower us towards them  what we are we are by the grace of god  our own powers and the burden of them we know full well  it does not lessen their dignity or their beauty in our eyes to hear that the birds of the air partake even a little of the same gifts of god as we  of old said st guthlac in crowland as the swallows sat upon his knee he who leads his life according to the will of god to him the wild deer and the wild birds draw more near and this new theory of yours may prove st guthlac right  st francis toohe called the birds his brothers  whether he was correct either theologically or zoologically he was plainly free from that fear of being mistaken for an ape which haunts so many in these modern times  perfectly sure that he himself was a spiritual being he thought it at least possible that birds might be spiritual beings likewise incarnate like himself in mortal flesh and saw no degradation to the dignity of human nature in claiming kindred lovingly with creatures so beautiful so wonderful who as he fancied in his oldfashioned way praised god in the forest even as angels did in heaven  in a word the saint though he was an ascetic and certainly no man of science was yet a poet and somewhat of a philosopher and would have possiblyso do extremes meethave hailed as orthodox while we hail as truly scientific wordsworths great saying       therefore am i still a lover of the meadows and the woods and mountains and of all that we behold from this green earth of all the mighty world of eye and earboth what they half create and what perceive well pleased to recognize in nature and the language of the sense the anchor of my purest thoughts the nurse the guide the guardian of my heart and soul of all my moral being    ii  chalkstream studies 29    fishing is generally associated in mens minds with wild mountain scenery if not with the alps and cataracts of norway still with the moors and lochs of scotland or at least with the rocky rivers the wooded crags the crumbling abbeys of yorkshire derbyshire hereford or the lowlands  and it cannot be denied that much of the charm which angling exercises over cultivated minds is due to the beauty and novelty of the landscapes which surround him to the sense of freedom the exhilarating upland air  who would prefer the certainty of taking trout out of some sluggish preserve to the chance of a brace out of edno or llyn dulyn  the pleasure lies not in the prize itself but in the pains which it has cost in the upward climbs through the dark plantations beside the rockwalled stream the tramp over the upland pastures one gay flowerbed of blue and purple butterwort the steady breathless climb up the crags which looked but one mile from you when you started so clear against the sky stood out every knoll and slab the first stars of the white saxifrage goldeneyed bloodbedropt as if a fairy had pricked her finger in the cup which shine upon some green cushion of wet moss in a dripping crack of the cliff the first grey tufts of the alpine clubmoss the first shrub of crowberry or seagreen roseroot with its strange fleshy stems and leaves which mark the twothousandfeetline and the beginning of the alpine world the scramble over the arid waves of the porphyry sea aloft as you beat round and round like a weary pointer dog in search of the hidden lake the last despairing crawl to the summit of the syenite pyramid on moel meirch the hasty gaze around far away into the green vale of ffestiniog and over wooded flats and long silver riverreaches and yellow sands and blue sea flecked with flying clouds and isles and capes and wildernesses of mountain peaks east west south and north one glance at the purple gulf out of which snowdon rises thence only seen in full majesty from base to peak  and then the joyful run springing over bank and boulder to the sad tarn beneath your feet  the loosening of the limbs as you toss yourself bathed in perspiration on the turf the almost awed pause as you recollect that you are alone on the mountaintops by the side of the desolate pool out of all hope of speech or help of man and if you break your leg among those rocks may lie there till the ravens pick your bones the anxious glance round the lake to see if the fish are moving the still more anxious glance through your book to guess what they will choose to take what extravagant bundle of red blue and yellow feathers like no insect save perhaps some jewelled monster from amboyna or brazilmay tempt those sulkiest and most capricious of trout to cease for once their lifelong business of picking leeches from among those syenite cubes which will twist your ankles and break your shins for the next three hours  what matter to a minute philosopher at least if after two hours of such enjoyment as that he goes down again into the world of man with empty creel or with a dozen pounders and twopounders shorter gamer and redderfleshed than ever came out of thames or kennet  what matter if he has not caught them he might have caught them he has been catching them in imagination all the way up and if he be a minute philosopher he holds that there is no falser proverb than that devils beatitudeblessed is he who expecteth nothing for he shall not be disappointed  say rather blessed is he who expecteth everything for he enjoys everything once at least  and if it falls out true twice also  yes  pleasant enough is mountain fishing  but there is one objection against it that it is hard work to get to it and that the angler often enough halftired before he arrives at his stream or lake has left for his days work only the lees of his nervous energy  another objection more important perhaps to a minute philosopher than to the multitude is that there is in mountainfishing an element of excitement  an element which is wholesome enough at times for every one most wholesome at all times for the man pent up in london air and london work but which takes away from the anglers most delicate enjoyment that dreamy contemplative repose broken by just enough amusement to keep his body active while his mind is quietly taking in every sight and sound of nature  let the londoner have his six weeks every year among crag and heather and return with lungs expanded and muscles braced to his nine months prison  the countryman who needs no such change of air and scene will prefer more homelike though more homely pleasures  dearer than wild cataracts or alpine glens are the still hidden streams which bewick has immortalized in his vignettes and creswick in his pictures the long glassy shallow paved with yellow gravel where he wades up between low walls of fernfringed rock beneath nut and oak and alder to the low bar over which the stream comes swirling and dimpling as the waterouzel flits piping before him and the murmur of the ringdove comes soft and sleepy through the wood  there as he wades he sees a hundred sights and hears a hundred tones which are hidden from the traveller on the dusty highway above  the traveller fancies that he has seen the country  so he has the outside of it at least  but the angler only sees the inside  the angler only is brought close face to face with the flower and bird and insect life of the rich river banks the only part of the landscape where the hand of man has never interfered and the only part in general which never feels the drought of summer the trees planted by the waterside whose leaf shall not wither  pleasant are those hidden waterways  but yet are they the more pleasant because the hand of man has not interfered with them  it is a question and one which the older one grows the less one is inclined to answer in the affirmative  the older one grows the more there grows on one the sense of waste and incompleteness in all scenery where man has not fulfilled the commission of eden to dress it and to keep it and with that a sense of loneliness which makes one long for home and cultivation and the speech of fellow men  surely the influence of mountain scenery is exaggerated nowadays in spite of the reverend name of wordsworth whose poetry be it remembered too often wants that element of hardihood and manliness which is supposed to be the birthright of mountaineers one cannot help as a lowlander hoping that there is a little truth in the threnodes of a certain peevish friend who literally hates a mountain and justifies his hatred in this fashion  i do hate mountains  i would not live among them for ten thousand a year  if they look like paradise for three months in the summer they are a veritable inferno for the other nine and i should like to condemn my mountainworshipping friends to pass a whole year under the shadow of snowdon with that great black head of his shutting out the sunlight staring down into their garden overlooking all they do in the most impertinent way sneezing and spitting at them with rain hail snow and bitter freezing blasts even in the hottest sunshine a mountain  he is a great stupid giant with a perpetual cold in his head whose highest ambition is to give you one also  as for his beauty no natural object has so little of its own he owes it to the earthquakes that reared him up to the rains and storms which have furrowed him to every gleam and cloud which pass over him  in himself he is a mere helpless stoneheap  our old scandinavian forefathers were right when they held the mountain yotuns to be helpless puddingheaded giants the sport of gods and men  and their english descendant in spite of all his secondhand sentiment holds the same opinion at his heart for his first instinct jolly honest fellow that he is on seeing a snow alp is to scramble up it and smoke his cigar upon the top  and this great stupid braggart pretending to be a personage and an entity which like popes monument on fishstreet hill   like a tall bully lifts the head and lies   i am called upon nowadays to worship as my better my teacher shall i the son of odin and thor worship hrymir the frost giant and his cows the waterfalls  shall i bow down to the stock of a stone  my better  i have done an honest thing or two in my life but i never saw a mountain do one yet  as for his superiority to me in what does it consist  his strength  if he be stronger than i let him cut stones out of my ribs as i can out of his  his size am i to respect a mountain the more for being 10000 feet high  as well ask me to respect daniel lambert for weighing fiveandtwenty stone  his cunning construction  there is not a child which plays at his foot not an insect which basks on his crags which is not more fearfully and wonderfully made while as for his grandeur of form any college youth who scrambles up him peel him out of his shooting jacket and trousers is a hundred times more beautiful and more grand too by all laws of art  but so it is  in our prurient prudery we have got to despise the human and therefore the truly divine element in art and look for inspiration not to living men and women but to leaves and straws stocks and stones  it is an idolatry baser than that of the old canaanites for they had the courage to go up to the mountain tops and thence worship the host of heaven  but we are to stay at the bottom and worship the mountains themselves  byron began the folly with his misanthropic childe harold  sermons in stones  i dont believe in them  i have seen a better sermon in an old peasant womans face than in all the alps and apennines of europe  did you ever see any one who was the better for mountains  have the alps made    a whit honester or    a whit more goodnatured or lady    a whit cleverer  do they alter one hairs breadth for the better the characters of the ten thousand male and female noodles who travel forth to stare at them every year  do mountains make them loftyminded and generoushearted  no  caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt  dont talk to me of the moral and physical superiority of mountain races for i tell you it is a dream  civilization art poetry belong to the lowlands  are the english mountaineers pray or the french or the germans  were the egyptians mountaineers or the romans or the assyrians as soon as they became a people  the greeks lived among mountains but they took care to inhabit the plains and it was the sea and not the hills which made them the people which they were  does scotland owe her life to the highlander or to the lowlander  if you want an experimentum crucis there is one  as for poetry will you mention to me one mountain race which has written great poetry  you will quote the hebrews  i answer that the life of palestine always kept to the comparatively low lands to the west of jordan while the barbarous mountaineers of the eastern range never did anythinghad but one elijah to show among them  shakspeare never saw a hill higher than malvern beacon and yet i suppose you will call him a poet  mountaineers look well enough at a distance seen close at hand you find their chief distinctions to be starvation and ignorance fleas and goitre with an utter unconsciousnessunless travellers put it into their headsof the soulelevating glories by which they have been surrounded all their lives  he was gently reminded of the existence of the tyrolese  you may just as wisely remind me of the circassians  what can prove my theory more completely than the fact that in them you have the two finest races of the world utterly unable to do anything for humanity utterly unable to develop themselves because to their eternal misfortune they have got caged among those abominable stoneheaps and have not yet been able to escape  it was suggested that if mountain races were generally inferior ones it was because they were the remnants of conquered tribes driven up into the highlands by invaders  and what does that prove but that the stronger and cunninger races instinctively seize the lowlands because they half know and providence knows altogether that there alone they can become nations and fulfil the primaeval missionto replenish the earth and subdue it  no no my good sir  mountains are very well when they are doing their only dutythat of making rain and soil for the lowlands  but as for this newfangled admiration of them it is a proof that our senses are dulled by luxury and books and that we require to excite our palled organ of marvellousness by signs and wonders aesthetic brandy and cayenne  no  i have remarked often that the most unimaginative people who can see no beauty in a cultivated english field or in the features of a newborn babe are the loudest ravers about glorious sunsets and alpine panoramas just as the man with no music in his soul to whom a fugue of sebastian bach or one of mendelssohns songs without words means nothing and is nothing thinks a monster concert of drums and trumpets uncommonly fine  this is certainly a sufficiently onesided diatribe  still it is onesided  and we have heard so much of the other side of late that it may be worth while to give this side also a fair and patient hearing  at least he who writes wishes that it may have a fair hearing  he has a sort of sympathy with lord macaulays traveller of a hundred and fifty years since who amid the horrible desolation of the scotch highlands sighs for the true mountain scenery of richmond hill  the most beautiful landscape he has ever seen or cares to see is the vale of thames from taplow or from cliefden looking down towards windsor and up toward reading to him bramshill looking out far and wide over the rich lowland from its eyrie of dark pines or littlecote nestling between deerspotted upland and rich water meadow is a finer sight than any robber castle of the rhine  he would not complain of course were either of the views backed like those glorious ones of turin or venice by the white sawedge of the distant alps  but chiefly because the perpetual sight of that alp wall would increase the sense of home of guarded security which not the mountain but the sea or the very thought of the sea gives to all true englishmen  let others therefore to come back to angling tell of moor and loch but let it be always remembered that the men who have told of them best have not been mountaineers but lowlanders who carried up to the mountain the taste and knowledge which they had gained below  let them remember that the great sutherlandshire sportsman and sporting writer the late mr st john was once a fine gentleman about town that christopher north was an edinburgh professor a man of city learning and city cultivation and as one more plea for our cockney chalkstreams of the south that mr scrope who passed many pleasant years respected and beloved by kennet side with purdy at his heels enjoyed they say the killing of a littlecote trout as heartily as he did that of a tweed salmon  come then you who want pleasant fishingdays without the waste of time and trouble and expense involved in two hundred miles of railway journey and perhaps fifty more of highland road and try what you can see and do among the fish not sixty miles from town  come to pleasant country inns where you can always get a good dinner or better still to pleasant country houses where you can always get good society to rivers which will always fish brimfull in the longest droughts of summer instead of being as those mountain ones are very like a turnpikeroad for three weeks and then like bottled porter for three days to streams on which you have strong southwest breezes for a week together on a clear fishing water instead of having as on those mountain ones foul rain spate as long as the wind is southwest and clearing water when the wind chops up to the north and the chill blast of clarus aquio sends all the fish shivering to the bottom streams in a word where you may kill fish and large ones four days out of five from april to october instead of having as you will most probably in the mountain just one days sport in the whole of your months holiday  deluded friend who suffered in scotland last year a month of tantalus his torments furnished by art and nature with rods flies whisky scenery keepers salmon innumerable and all that man can want except water to fish in and who returned having hooked accidentally by the tail one salmonwhich broke all and ween to seawhy did you not stay at home and take your twopounders and threepounders out of the quiet chalk brook which never sank an inch through all that drought so deep in the caverns of the hills are hidden its mysterious wells truly wise men bide at home with george riddler while a fools eyes are in the ends of the earth  repent then and come with me at least in fancy at six oclock upon some breezy morning in june not by roaring railway nor by smoking steamer but in the cosy fourwheel along brown heather moors down into green clay woodlands over white chalk downs past roman camps and scattered blocks of sarsden stone till we descend into the long green vale where among groves of poplar and abele winds silver whit  come and breakfast at the neat white inn of yore a postinghouse of fame  the stables are now turned into cottages and instead of a dozen spruce ostlers and helpers the last of the postboys totters sadly about the yard and looks up eagerly at the rare sight of a horse to feed  but the house keeps up enough of its ancient virtue to give us a breakfast worthy of pantagruels self and after it while we are looking out our flies you can go and chat with the old postboy and hear his tales told with a sort of chivalrous pride of the noble lords and fair ladies before whom he has ridden in the good old times gone byeven so he darkly hints before his royal highness the prince himself  poor old fellow he recollects not and he need not recollect that these great posting houses were centres of corruption from whence the newest vices of the metropolis were poured into the toowilling ears of village lads and lasses and that not even the new poor law itself has done more for the morality of the south of england than the substitution of the rail for coaches  now we will walk down through the meadows some half mile   while all the land in flowery squares beneath a broad and equalblowing wind smells of the coming summer   to a scene which as we may find its antitype anywhere for miles round we may boldly invent for ourselves  a red brick mill not new red brick of course shall hum for ever below giant poplarspires which bend and shiver in the steady breeze  on its lawn laburnums shall feather down like dropping wells of gold and from under them the stream shall hurry leaping and laughing into the light and spread at our feet into a broad bright shallow in which the kine are standing kneedeep already  a hint alas that the day means heat  and there to the initiated eye is another and a darker hint of glaring skies perspiring limbs and empty creels  small fish are dimpling in the central eddies  but here in six inches of water on the very edge of the ford road great tails and backfins are showing above the surface and swirling suddenly among the tufts of grass sure sign that the large fish are picking up a minnowbreakfast at the same time that they warm their backs and do not mean to look at a fly for many an hour to come  yet courage for on the rail of yonder wooden bridge sits chatting with a sunbrowned nymph her bonnet pushed over her face her hayrake in her hand a rivergod in coat of velveteen elbow on knee and pipe in mouth who rising when he sees us lifts his wideawake and halloas back a roar of comfort to our mystic adjuration   keeper  is the fly up  mortial strong last night gentlemen  wherewith he shall lounge up to us landingnet in hand and we will wander up stream and away  we will wanderfor though the sun be bright here are good fish to be picked out of sharps and stopholesinto the watertables ridged up centuries since into furrows forty feet broad and five feet high over which the crystal water sparkles among the roots of the rich grass and hurries down innumerable drains to find its parent stream between tufts of great blue geranium and spires of purple loosestrife and the delicate white and pink comfreybells and the avensfairest and most modest of all the waterside nymphs who hangs her head all day long in pretty shame with a soft blush upon her tawny check  but at the mouth of each of those drains if we can get our flies in and keep ourselves unseen we will have one cast at least  for at each of them in some sharprippling spot lies a great trout or two waiting for beetle caterpillar and whatsoever else may be washed from among the long grass above  thence and from brimming feeders which slip along weedchoked under white hawthorn hedges and beneath the great roots of oak and elm shall we pick out full many a goodly trout  there in yon stophole underneath that tree not ten feet broad or twenty long where just enough water trickles through the hatches to make a ripple are a brace of noble fish no doubt and one of them you may be sure of if you will go the proper way to work and fish scientifically with the brace of flies i have put on for youa governor and a black alder  in the first place you must throw up into the little pool not down  if you throw down they will see you in an instant and besides you will never get your fly close under the shade of the brickwork where alone you have a chance  what use in throwing into the still shallow tail shining like oil in the full glare of the sun  but i cannot get below the pool without  without crawling through that stiff stubbed hedge well set with trees and leaping that tenfoot feeder afterwards  very well  it is this sort of thing which makes the stayathome cultivated chalk fishing as much harder work than mountain angling as a gallop over a stiffly enclosed country is harder than one over an open moor  you can do it or not as you like  but if you wish to catch large trout on a bright day i should advise you to employ the only method yet discovered  thereyou are through and the keeper shall hand you your rod  you have torn your trousers and got a couple of thorns in your shins the one can be mended the other pulled out  now jump the feeder there is no run to it soyou have jumped in  never mind  but keep the point of your rod up  you are at least saved the lingering torture of getting wet inch by inch and as for cold water hurting any onecredat judaeus  now make a circuit through the meadow forty yards away  stoop down when you are on the ridge of each table  a trout may be basking at the lower end of the pool who will see you rush up and tell all his neighbours  take off that absurd black chimneypot which you are wearing i suppose for the same reason as homers heroes wore their koruthous and phalerous to make yourself look taller and more terrible to your foes  crawl up on three legs and when you are in position kneel down  so  shorten your line all you canyou cannot fish with too short a line upstream and throw not into the oilbasin near you but right up into the darkest corner  make your fly strike the brickwork and drop inso  no rise  then dont work or draw it or your deceit is discovered instantly  lift it out and repeat the throw  what  you have hooked your fly in the hatches  very good  pull at it till the castingline breaks put on a fresh one and to work again  there you have him  dont rise fight him kneeling hold him hard and give him no line but shorten up anyhow  tear and haul him down to you before he can make to his home while the keeper runs round with the net    there he is on shore  two pounds good weight  creep back more cautiously than ever and try again    there  a second fish over a pound weight  now we will go and recover the flies off the hatches and you will agree that there is more cunning more science and therefore more pleasant excitement in foxing a great fish out of a stophole than in whipping far and wide over an open stream where a halfpounder is a wonder and a triumph  as for physical exertion you will be able to compute for yourself how much your back knees and forearm will ache by nine oclock tonight after some ten hours of this scrambling splashing leaping and kneeling upon a hot june day  this item in the days work will of course be put to the side of loss or of gain according to your temperament  but it will cure you of an inclination to laugh at us wessex chalkfishers as cockneys  so we will wander up the streams taking a fish here and a fish there tillreally it is very hot  we have the whole day before us the fly will not be up till five oclock at least and then the real fishing will begin  why tire ourselves beforehand  the squire will send us luncheon in the afternoon and after that expect us to fish as long as we can see and come up to the hall to sleep regardless of the ceremony of dressing  for is not the green drake on  and while he reigns all hours meals decencies and respectabilities must yield to his caprice  see here he sits or rather tens of thousands of him one on each stalk of grassgreen drake yellow drake brown drake white drake each with his gauzy wings folded over his back waiting for some unknown change of temperature or something else in the afternoon to wake him from his sleep and send him fluttering over the stream while overhead the black drake who has changed his skin and reproduced his species dances in the sunshine empty hard and happy like festus baileys great black crow who all his life sings ho ho ho   for no one will eat him he well doth know   however as we have insides and he has actually none and what is more strange not even a mouth wherewith to fill the said insides we had better copy his brothers and sisters below whose insides are still left and settle with them upon the grass awhile beneath you goodly elm  comfort yourself with a glass of sherry and a biscuit and give the keeper one and likewise a cigar  he will value it at five times its worth not merely for the pleasure of it but because it raises him in the social scale  any cad so he holds smokes pipes but a good cigar is the mark of the quality and of them who keep company with the quality as keepers do  he puts it in his hatcrown to smoke this evening in presence of his compeers at the publichouse retires modestly ten yards lies down on his back in a dry feeder under the shade of the long grass and instantly falls fast asleep poor fellow he was up all last night in the covers and will be again tonight  let him sleep while he may and we will chat over chalkfishing  the first thing probably on which you will be inclined to ask questions is the size of the fish in these streams  we have killed this morning four fish averaging a pound weight each  all below that weight we throw in as is our rule here but you may have remarked that none of them exceeded half a pound that they were almost all about herring size  the smaller ones i believe to be yearold fish hatched last spring twelvemonth the pound fish twoyearolds  at what rate these last would have increased depends very much i suspect on their chance of food  the limit of life and growth in coldblooded animals seems to depend very much on their amount of food  the boa alligator shark pike and i suppose the trout also will live to a great age and attain an enormous size give them but range enough and the only cause why there are trout of ten pounds and more in the thames lashers while one of four pounds is rare here is simply that the thames fish has more to eat  here were the fish not sufficiently thinned out every year by anglers they would soon become largeheaded brown and flabby and cease to grow  many a good stream has been spoilt in this way when a squire has unwisely preferred quantity to quality of fish  and if it be not the quantity of feed i know no clear reason why chalk and limestone trout should be so much larger and better flavoured than any others  the cause is not the greater swiftness of the streams for paradoxical as it may seem to many a trout likes swift water no more than a pike does except when spawning or cleaning afterwards  at those times his blood seems to require a very rapid oxygenation and he goes to the sharps to obtain it but when he is feeding and fattening the water cannot be too still for him  streams which are rapid throughout never produce large fish and a handlong trout transferred from his native torrent to a still pond will increase in size at a ten times faster rate  in chalk streams the largest fish are found oftener in the millheads than in the mill tails  it is a mistake though a common one to fancy that the giant trout of the thames lashers lie in swift water on the contrary they lie in the very stillest spot of the whole pool which is just under the hatches  there the rush of the water shoots over their heads and they look up through it for every eatable which may be swept down  at night they run down to the fan of the pool to hunt minnow round the shallows but their home by day is the still deep and their preference of the lasher pool to the quiet water above is due merely to the greater abundance of food chalk trout then are large not merely because the water is swift  whether trout have not a specific fondness for lime whether water of some dozen degrees of hardness is not necessary for their development are questions which may be fairly asked  yet is not the true reason this that the soil on the banks of a chalk or limestone stream is almost always richred loam carrying an abundant vegetation and therefore an abundant crop of animal life both in and out of the water  the countless insects which haunt a rich hay meadow all know who have eyes to see and if they will look into the stream they will find that the waterworld is even richer than the airworld  every still spot in a chalk stream becomes so choked with weed as to require moving at least thrice a year to supply the mills with water  grass milfoil water crowfoot hornwort starwort horsetail and a dozen other delicate plants form one tangled forest denser than those of the amazon and more densely peopled likewise  to this list will soon be added our transatlantic curse babingtonia diabolica alias anacharis alsin astrum  it has already ascended the thames as high as reading and a few years more owing to the present aquavivarium mania will see it filling every millhead in england to the torment of all millers  young ladies are assured that the only plant for their vivariums is a sprig of anacharis for which they pay sixpencethe market value being that of a wasp flea or other scourge of the human race and when the vivarium fails its contents anacharis and all are tost into the nearest ditch for which the said young lady ought to be fined five pounds and would be if governments governed  what an if  but come for the sun burns bright and fishing is impossible  lie down upon the bank above this stop  there is a campshutting a boarding in english on which you can put your elbows  lie down on your face and look down through two or three feet of water clear as air into the water forest where the great trout feed  here look into this opening in the milfoil and crowfoot bed  do you see a grey film around that sprig  examine it through the pocket lens  it is a forest of glass bells on branching stalks  they are vorticellae and every one of those bells by the ciliary current on its rim is scavenging the watertill a tadpole comes by and scavenges it  how many millions of living creatures are there on that one sprig  look herea brown polype with long waving armsa gigantic monster actually a full halfinch long  he is hydra fusca most famous and earliest described i think by trembley  ere we go home i may show you perhaps hydra viridis with long peagreen arms and rosea most beautiful in form and colour of all the strange family  you see that lump just where his stalk joins his bellhead that is a budding baby  ignorant of the joys and cares of wedlock he increases by gemmation  see here is another with a fullsized young one growing on his back  you may tear it off if you willhe cares not  you may cut him into a dozen pieces they say and each one will grow as a potato does  i suppose however that he also sends out of his mouth little free ovamedusoidscall them what you will swimming by ciliae which afterwards unless the water beetles stop them on the way will settle down as stalked polypes and in their turn practise some mystery of owenian parthenogenesis or steenstruppian alternation of generations in which all traditional distinctions of plant and animal male and female are laughed to scorn by the magnificent fecundity of the divine imaginations  that dusty cloud which shakes off in the water as you move the weed under the microscope would be one mass of exquisite formsdesmidiae and diatomaceae and what not  instead of running over long names take home a little in a bottle put it under your microscope and if you think good verify the species from hassall ehrenberg or other wise book but without doing that one glance through the lens will show you why the chalk trout grow fat  do they then eat these infusoria  that is not clear  but minnows and small fry eat them by millions and so do tadpoles and perhaps caddis baits and water crickets  what are they  look on the soft muddy bottom  you see numberless bits of stick watch awhile and those sticks are alive crawling and tumbling over each other  the weed too is full of smaller ones  those live sticks are the larvacases of the caperersphryganeaeof which one family nearly two hundred species have been already found in great britain  fish up one and you find amid sticks and pebbles a comfortable silk case tenanted by a goodly grub  six legs he has like all insects and tufts of white horns on each ring of his abdomen which are his gills  a goodly pair of jaws he has too and does good service with them  for he is the great water scavenger decaying vegetable matter is his food and with those jaws he will bark a dead stick as neatly as you will with a penknife  but he does not refuse animal matter  a dead brother his not yours makes a savoury meal for him and a party of those vorticellae would stand a poor chance if he came across them  you may count these caddis baits by hundreds of thousands whether the trout eat them case and all is a question in these streams  in some rivers the trout do so and what is curious during the spring have a regular gizzard a temporary thickening of the coats of the stomach to enable them to grind the pebbly cases of the caddises  see here is one whose house is closed at both endsgrille as pictet calls it in his unrivalled monograph of the genevese phryganeae on which he spent four years of untiring labour  the grub has stopped the mouth of his case by an open network of silk defended by small pebbles through which the water may pass freely while he changes into his nymph state  open the case you find within not a grub but a strange birdbeaked creature with long legs and horns laid flat by its sides and miniature wings on its back  observe that the sides of the tail and one pair of legs are fringed with dark hairs  after a fortnights rest in this prison this nymph will gnaw her way out and swim through the water on her back by means of that fringed tail and paddles till she reaches the bank and the upper air  there under the genial light of day her skin will burst and a fourwinged fly emerge to buzz over the water as a fawncoloured caperer deadliest of trout flies if she be not snapped up beforehand under water by some spotted monarch in search of supper  but look again among this tangled mass of weed  here are more larvae of waterflies  some have the sides fringed with what look like paddles but are gills  of these one part have whisks at the tail and swim freely  they will change into ephemerae cockwinged duns with long whisked tails  the larvae of the famous green drake ephemera vulgata are like these  but we shall not find them they are all changed by now into the perfect fly and if not they burrow about the banks and haunt the crayfishholes and are not easily found  some again have the gills on their sides larger and broader and no whisks at the tail  these are the larvae of sialis the black alder lord stowells fly shorm fly hunchback of the welsh with which we have caught our best fish today  and here is one of a delicate yellowgreen whose tail is furnished with three broad paddleblades  these i believe are gills again the larva is probably that of the yellow sallychrysoperla viridis a famous fly on hot days in may and june  among the pebbles there below the fall we should have found a month since a similar but much larger grub with two paddles at his tail  he is the creeper of the northern streams and changes to the great crawling stone fly mayfly of tweed perla bicaudata an ugly creature which runs on stones and posts and kills right well on stormy days when he is beaten into the stream  there  now we have the larvae of the four great troutfly families phryganeae ephemerae sialidae perlidae so you have no excuse for tellingas not only cockneys but really good sportsmen who write on fishing have donesuch fibs as that the green drake comes out of a caddisbait or giving such vague generalities as this fly comes from a waterlarva  these are surely in their imperfect and perfect states food enough to fatten many a good trout  but they are not all  see these transparent brown snails limneae and succinae climbing about the posts and these other pretty ones coil laid within coil as flat as a shilling planorbis  many a million of these do the trout pick off the weed day by day and no food not even the leech which swarms here is more fattening  the finest trout of the high snowdon lakes feed almost entirely on leech and snailbaits they have noneand fatten till they cut as red as a salmon  look here too once more  you see a grey moving cloud about that pebble bed and underneath that bank  it is a countless swarm of sug or watershrimp a bad food but devoured greedily by the great trout in certain overstocked preserves  add to these plenty of minnow stoneloach and millers thumbs a second course of young crayfish and for one gormandizing week of bliss thousands of the great greendrake fly  and you have food enough for a stock of trout which surprise by their size and number an angler fresh from the mountain districts of the north and west to such a fisherman the tale of mr   of ramsbury who is said to have killed in one day in his own streams on kennet seventysix trout all above a pound sounds like a travellers imagination  yet the fact is i believe accurately true  this however is an extraordinary case upon an extraordinary stream in general if a man shall bring home beside small fish a couple of brace of from one to three pounds apiece he may consider himself as a happy man and that the heavens have not shone but frowned upon him very propitiously  and now comes another and an important question  for which of all these dainty eatables if for any do the trout take our flies and from that arises another  why are the flies with which we have been fishing this morning so largeof the size which is usually employed on a scotch lake  you are a northcountry fisher and are wont upon your clear streams to fish with nothing but the smallest gnats  and yet our streams are as clear as yours  what can be clearer  whether fish really mistake our artificial flies for different species of natural ones as englishmen hold or merely for something good to eat the colour whereof strikes their fancy as scotchmen thinka theory which has been stated in detail and with great semblance of truth in mr stewarts admirable practical angler is a matter about which much good sense has been written on both sides  whosoever will may find the great controversy fully discussed in the pages of ephemera  perhaps as in most cases the truth lies between the two extremes at least in a chalkstream  ephemeras list of flies may be very excellent but it is about ten times as long as would be required for any of our southern streams six or seven sort of flies ought to suffice for any fisherman if they will not kill the thing which will kill is yet to seek  to name them  1  the caperer  2  the marchbrown  3  the governor  4  the black alder  and two or three large palmers red grizzled and cochabonddhu each with a tuft of red floss silk at the tail  these are enough to show sport from march to october and also like enough to certain natural flies to satisfy the somewhat dull memory of a trout  but beyond this list there is little use in roaming as far as my experience goes  a yellow dun kills sometimes marvellously on chalk streams and always upon rocky ones  a turkeybrown ephemera the wing made of the bright brown tail of the cock partridge will even just after the mayfly is off show good sport in the forenoon when he is on the water and so will in the evening the claret spinner to which he turns  excellent patterns of these flies may be found in ronalds  but after all they are uncertain flies and as harry verney used to say they casualty flies be all havers which sentence the reader if he understands good wessex can doubtless translate for himself  and there are evenings on which the fish take greedily small transparent ephemerae  but did you ever see large fish rise at these ephemerae  and even if you did can you imitate the natural fly  and after all would it not be waste of time  for the experience of many good fishers is that trout rise at these delicate duns black gnats and other microscopic trash simply faute de mieux  they are hungry as trout are six days in the week just at sunset  a supper they must have and they take what comes but if you can give them anything better than the minute fairy compact of equal parts of glass and wind which naturalists call an ephemera or baetis it will be most thankfully received if there be ripple enough on the water which there seldom is on a fine evening to hide the line  and even though the water be still take boldly your caperer or your white moth either of them ten times as large as what the trout are rising at hurl it boldly into a likely place and let it lie quiet and sink not attempting to draw or work it and if you do not catch anything by that means comfort yourself with the thought that there are others who can  and now to go through our list beginning with   1  the caperer  this perhaps is the best of all flies it is certainly the one which will kill earliest and latest in the year and though i would hardly go as far as a friend of mine who boasts of never fishing with anything else i believe it will from march to october take more trout and possibly more grayling than any other fly  its basis is the woodcock wing red hackle legs which should be long and pale and a thin mohair body of different shades of redbrown from a dark claret to a pale sandy  it may thus tied of different sizes do duty for halfadozen of the commonest flies for the early claret redbrown of ronalds a nemoura according to him which is the first springfly for the red spinner or perfect form of the march brown ephemera for the soldier the softwinged reddish beetle which haunts the umbelliferous flowers and being as soft in spirit as in flesh perpetually falls into the water and comes to grief therein and last but not least for the true caperers or whole tribe of phryganidae of which a sketch was given just now  as a copy of them the body should be of a pale red brown all but sandy but never snuffcoloured as shopgirls often tie it and its best hour is always in the evening  it kills well when fish are gorged with their morning meal of green drakes and after the green drake is off it is almost the only fly at which large trout care to look a fact not to be wondered at when one considers that nearly two hundred species of english phryganidae have been already described and that at least half of them are of the fawntint of the caperer  under the title of flamebrown cinnamon or redhackle and rails wing a similar fly kills well in ireland and in scotland also and is sometimes the best seatrout fly which can be laid on the water  let this suffice for the caperer  2  of the marchbrown ephemera there is little to be said save to notice ronalds and ephemeras excellent description and ephemeras good hint of fishing with more than one marchbrown at once viz with a sandybodied male and a greenishbodied female  the fly is a worthy fly and being easily imitated gives great sport in number rather than in size for when the marchbrown is out the two or three pound fish are seldom on the move preferring leeches tom toddies and caddisbait in the nether deeps to slim ephemerae at the top and if you should as you may get hold of a big fish on the fly youd best hit him in again as we say in wessex for he will be like the ancient mariner    long and lank and brown as is the ribbed seasand   3  the governorin most sandy banks and dry poor lawns will be found numberless burrows of ground bees who have a great trick of tumbling into the water  perhaps like the honey bee they are thirsty souls and must needs go down to the river and drink perhaps like the honey bee they rise into the air with some difficulty and so in crossing a stream are apt to strike the further bank and fall in  be that as it may an imitation of these little ground bees is a deadly fly the whole year round and if worked within six inches of the shore will sometimes fill a basket when there is not a fly on the water or a fish rising  there are those who never put up a cast of flies without one and those too who have killed large salmon on him in the north of scotland when the streams are low  his tie is simple enough  a pale partridge or woodcock wing short red hackle legs a peacockherl body and a tailon which too much artistic skill can hardly be expendedof yellow floss silk and gold twist or tinsel  the orangetailed governors of ye shops as the old drugbooks would say are all havers for the proper colour is a honey yellow  the mystery of this allconquering tail seems to be that it represents the yellow pollen or bee bread in the thighs or abdomen of the bee whereof the bright colour and perhaps the strong musky flavour makes him an attractive and savoury morsel  be that as it may there is no better rule for a chalk stream than thiswhen you dont know what to fish with try the governor  4  the black alder sialis nigra or lutaria  what shall be said or not be said of this queen of flies  and what of ephemera who never mentions her  his alder fly isi know not what certainly not that black alder shorm fly lord stowells fly or hunchback which kills the monsters of the deep surpassed only by the green drake for one fortnight but surpassing him in this that she will kill on till september from that happy day on which   you find her out on every stalk wheneer you take a river walk when swifts at eve begin to hawk   o thou beloved member of the brute creation  songs have been written in praise of thee statues would ere now have been erected to thee had that hunch back and those flabby wings of thine been susceptible of artistic treatment  but ugly thou art in the eyes of the uninitiated vulgar a little stumpy old maid toddling about the world in a black bonnet and a brown cloak laughed at by naughty boys but doing good wherever thou comest and leaving sweet memories behind thee so sweet that the trout will rise at the ghost or sham of thee for pure love of thy past kindnesses to them months after thou hast departed from this sublunary sphere  what hours of bliss do i not owe to thee  how have i seen in the rich meads of wey after picking out wretched quarterpounders all the morning on marchbrown and redhackle the great trout rush from every hover to welcome thy first appearance among the sedges and buttercups  how often late in august on thames on test on loddon heads have i seen the three and four pound fish prefer thy dead image to any live reality  have i not seen poor old si wilder king of thames fishermen now gone home to his rest shaking his huge sides with delight over thy mighty deeds as his fourteeninch whiskers fluttered in the breeze like the horsetail standard of some great bashaw while crystal thames murmured over the white flints on monkey island shallow and the soft breeze sighed in the colossal poplar spires and the great trout rose and rose and would not cease at thee my alderfly have i not seen after a day in which the earth below was iron and the heavens above as brass as the threepounders would have thee and thee alone in the purple august dusk old moodys red face grow redder with excitement half proud at having advised me to put on thee half fearful lest we should catch all my ladys pet trout in one evening  beloved alderfly would that i could give thee a soul if indeed thou hast not one already thou and all things which live and make thee happy in all aeons to come  but as it is such immortality as i can i bestow on thee here in small return for all the pleasant days thou hast bestowed on me  bah  i am becoming poetical let us think how to tie an alderfly  the common tie is good enough  a brown mallard or dark henpheasant tail for wing a black hackle for legs and the necessary peacock herl body  a better still is that of jones jones beddgelert the famous fishing clerk of snowdonia who makes the wing of dappled peacockhen and puts the black hackle on before the wings in order to give the peculiar hunchbacked shape of the natural fly  many a good fish has this tie killed  but the best pattern of all is tied from the mottled wingfeather of an indian bustard generally used when it can be obtained only for salmon flies  the brown and fawn check pattern of this feather seems to be peculiarly tempting to trout especially to the large trout of thames and in every river where i have tried the alder i have found the bustard wing facile princeps among all patterns of the fly  of palmers the hairy caterpillars are many sorts  ephemera gives by far the best list yet published  ronalds has also three good ones but whether they are really taken by trout instead of the particular natural insects which he mentions is not very certain the little cochabonddhu palmer so killing upon moor streams may probably be taken for young larvae of the fox and oakegger moths abundant on all moors upon trefoils and other common plants but the lowland caterpillars are so abundant and so various in colour that trout must be good entomologists to distinguish them  some distinction they certainly make for one palmer will kill where another does not  but this depends a good deal on the colour of the water the red palmer being easily seen will kill almost anywhere and any when simply because it is easily seen and both the grizzle and brown palmer may be made to kill by adding to the tail a tuft of red floss silk for red it would seem has the same exciting effect on fish which it has upon many quadrupeds possibly because it is the colour of flesh  the mackerel will often run greedily at a strip of scarlet cloth and the most killing pikefly i ever used had a body made of remnants of the huntsmans new pink  still there are local palmers  on thames for instance i have seldom failed with the grizzled palmer while the brown has seldom succeeded and the usually infallible red never  there is one more palmer worth trying which scotsmen i believe call the royal charlie a cochabonddhu or furnace hackle over a body of goldcoloured floss silk ribbed with broad gold tinsel  both in devonshire and in hampshire this will kill great quantities of fish wherever furzy or otherwise wild banks or oakwoods afford food for the oakegger and fox moths which children call devils gold rings and scotsmen hairy oubits  two hints more about palmers  they must not be worked on the top of the water but used as stretchers and allowed to sink as living caterpillars do and next they can hardly be too large or rough provided that you have skill enough to get them into the water without a splash  i have killed well on thames with one full three inches long armed of course with two small hooks  with palmersand perhaps with all baitsthe rule is the bigger the bait the bigger the fish  a large fish does not care to move except for a good mouthful  the best pikefisher i know prefers a halfpound chub when he goes after one of his fifteenpound jack and the largest pike i ever ranand lost alaswho seemed of any weight above twenty pounds was hooked on a live white fish of full threequarters of a pound  still no good angler will despise the minute northcountry flies  in yorkshire they are said to kill the large chalk trout of driffield as well as the small limestone and grit fish of craven if so the gentlemen of the driffield club who are said to think nothing of killing threepound fish on midge flies and cobweb tackle must be as canny yorkshiremen are likely enough to be the best anglers in england  in one spot only in yorkshire as far as i know do our large chalk flies kill  namely in the lofty limestone tarn of malham  there palmers caperers and rough black flies of the largest thames and kennet sizes seem the only attractive baits  and for this reason that they are the flies of the place  the cinnamon phryganea comes up abundantly from among the stones and the large peat moss to the west of the tarn abounds as usual in houseflies and bluebottles and in the caterpillars of the fox and oakegger moths  another proof that the most attractive flies are imitations of the real insects  on the other hand there are said to be times when midges and nothing else will rise fish on some chalk streams  the delicate black hackle which mr stewart praises so highly and which should always be tied on a square sneckbend hook will kill in june and july and on the itchen at winchester hardly any flies but small ones are used after the green drake is off  but there is one sad objection against these said midgeswhat becomes of your fish when hooked on one in a stream full of weeds as all chalk streams are after june save   one struggle more and i am free from pangs which rend my heart in twain   winchester fishers have confessed to me that they lose three good fish out of every four in such cases and as it seems pretty clear that chalk fish approve of no medium between very large flies and very small ones i advise the young angler whose temper is not yet schooled into perfect resignation to spare his own feelings by fishing with a single large flysay the governor in the forenoon the caperer in the evening regardless of the clearness of the water i have seen flies large enough for april raise fish excellently in test and other clear streams in july and august and what is more drag them up out of the weeds and into the landingnet where midges would have lost them in the first scuffle  so much for our leading chalk flies all copies of live insects  of the entomology of mountain streams little as yet is known  but a few scattered hints may suffice to show that in them as well as in the chalk rivers a little natural science might help the angler  the wellknown fact that smaller flies are required on the moors than in the lowlands is easily explained by the fact that poorer soils and swifter streams produce smaller insects  the large phryganeae or true caperers whose caddisbaits love still pools and stagnant ditches are there rare and the office of waterscavenger is fulfilled by the rhyacophiles torrentlovers and hydropsyches whose tiny pebblehouses are fixed to the stones to resist the violence of the summer floods  in and out of them the tiny larva runs to find food making in addition in some species galleries of earth along the surface of the stones in which he takes his walks abroad in full security  in any of the brown rivulets of windsor forest towards the middle of summer the pebblehouses of these little creatures may be seen in millions studding every stone  to the hydropsyches species montana or variegata of pictet belongs that curious little welsh fly known in snowdon by the name of the gwynnant whose tesselated wing is best imitated by brown mallard feather and who so swarms in the lower lakes of snowdon that it is often necessary to use three of them on the line at once all other flies being useless  it is perhaps the abundance of these tesselated hydropsyches which makes the mallard wing the most useful in mountain districts as the abundance of the fawn and grey phryganidae in the south of england makes the woodcock wing justly the favourite  the rhyacophiles on the other hand are mostly of a shining sootgrey or almost black  these may be seen buzzing in hundreds over the pools on a wet evening and with them the sooty mystacides called silverhorns in scotland from their antennae which are of preposterous length and ringed prettily enough with black and white these delicate fairies make moveable cases or rather pipes of the finest sand generally curved and resembling in shape the dentalium shell  guarded by these they hang in myriads on the smooth ledges of rock where the water runs gently a few inches deep  these are abundant everywhere  but i never saw so many of them as in the exquisite cother brook near middleham in yorkshire  in that delicious glen while wading up beneath the ashfringed crags of limestone out of which the great ring ouzel too wild it seemed to be afraid of man hopped down fearlessly to feed upon the strand or past flowerbanks where the golden globeflower and the great blue geranium and the giant campanula bloomed beneath the white tassels of the birdcherry i could not tread upon the limestone slabs without crushing at every step hundreds of the delicate mystacide tubes which literally paved the shallow edge of the stream and which would have been metamorphosed in due time into small sooty mothlike fairies best represented i should say by the soft black hackle which mr stewart recommends as the most deadly of north country flies  not to these however but to the phryganeae who when sticks and pebbles fail often make their tubes of sand eg p flava should i refer the redcow fly which is almost the only autumn killer in the dartmoor streams  a red cowhair body and a woodcock wing is his type and let those who want westcountry trout remember him  another fly common on some rocky streams but more scarce in the chalk is the yellow sally which entomologists with truer appreciation of its colour call chrysoperla viridis  it may be bought at the shops at least a yellow something of that name but bearing no more resemblance to the delicate yellowgreen natural fly with its warm grey wings than a preraphaelite portrait to the human being for whom it is meant  copied like most trout flies from some traditional copy by the hands of cockney maidens who never saw a fly in their lives the mistake of a mistake a sham raised to its tenth power it stands a signal proof that anglers will never get good flies till they learn a little entomology themselves and then teach it to the tackle makers  but if it cannot be bought it can at least be made and i should advise everyone who fishes rocky streams in may and june to dye for himself some hackles of a brilliant greenish yellow and in the most burning sunshine when fish seem inclined to rise at no fly whatsoever examine the boulders for the chrysoperla who runs over them her wings laid flat on her back her yellow legs moving as rapidly as a forestflys try to imitate her and use her on the stream or on the nearest lake  certain it is that in snowdon this fly and the gwynnant hydropsyche will fill a creel in the most burning northeaster when all other flies are useless a sufficient disproof of the scotch theorythat fish do not prefer the fly which is on the water 74  another disproof may be found in the fern web bracken clock of scotland the tiny cockchafer with brown wingcases and darkgreen thorax which abounds in some years in the haymeadows on the fern or on the heads of umbelliferous flowers  the famous lochawe fly described as an alderfly with a rails wing seems to be nothing but this fat little worthy  but the best plan is to make the wings either buzz or hackle of the bright neckfeather of the cock pheasant thus gaining the metallic lustre of the beetle tribe  tied thus either in devonshire or snowdon few flies surpass him when he is out  his fatness proves an attraction which the largest fish cannot resist  the ephemerae too are far more important in rapid and rocky streams than in the deeper stiller waters of the south  it is worth while for a good fish to rise at them there the more luxurious chalk trout will seldom waste himself upon them unless he be lying in shallow water and has but to move a few inches upward  but these ephemerae like all other naiads want working out  the species which mr ronalds gives are most of them by his own confession very uncertain  of the phryganidae he seems to know little or nothing mentioning but two species out of the two hundred which are said to inhabit britain and his land flies and beetles are in several cases quite wrongly named  however the professed entomologists know but little of the mountain flies and the angler who would help to work them out would confer a benefit on science as well as on the gentle craft  as yet the only approach to such a good work which i know of is a little book on the trout flies of ripon with excellent engravings of the natural fly  the authors name is not given but the book may be got at ripon and most valuable it must be to any northcountry fisherman  but come we must not waste our time in talk for here is a cloud over the sun and plenty more coming up behind before a ruffling southwest breeze as shelley has it    calling white clouds like flocks to feed in air   let us up and onward to that long still reach which is now curling up fast before the breeze there are large fish to be taken one or two at least even before the fly comes on  you need not change your flies the cast which you have ongovernor and black alderwill take if anything will  only do not waste your time and muscle as you are beginning to do by hurling your flies wildly into the middle of the stream on the chance of a fish being there  fish are there no doubt but not feeding ones  they are sailing about and enjoying the warmth but nothing more  if you want to find the hungry fish and to kill them you must stand well back from the bankor kneel down if you are really in earnest about sport and throw within a foot of the shore above you or below but if possible above with a line short enough to manage easily by which i mean short enough to enable you to lift your flies out of the water at each throw without hooking them in the docks and comfrey which grow along the brink you must learn to raise your hand at the end of each throw and lift the flies clean over the landweeds  or you will lose time and frighten all the fish by crawling to the bank to unhook them believe me one of the commonest mistakes into which young anglers fall is that of fishing in skipjack broad in plain english in midstream where few fish and those little ones are to be caught those who wish for large fish work close under the banks and seldom take a midstream cast unless they see a fish rise there  the reason of this is simple  walking up the strand in search of a dinner a reasonable man will keep to the trottoir and look in at the windows close to him instead of parading up the midstreet  and even so do all wise and ancient trout  the banks are their shops and thither they go for their dinners driving their poor little children tyrannously out into the midriver to fare as hap may hap over these children the tyro wastes his time flogging the stream across and across for weary hours while the big papas and mammas are comfortably under the bank close at his feet grubbing about the sides for water crickets and not refusing at times a leech or a young crayfish but perfectly ready to take a fly if you offer one large and tempting enough  they do but act on experience  all the largest surfacefoodbeetles bees and palmerscomes off the shore and all the caperers and alders after emerging from their pupacases swim to the shore in order to change into the perfect insect in the open air  the perfect insects haunt sunny sedges and treestemswhence the one is often called the sedge the other the alderflyand from thence drop into the trouts mouths and within six inches of the bank will the good angler work all the more sedulously and even hopefully if he sees no fish rising  i have known good men say that they had rather not see fish on the rise if the day be good that they can get surer sport and are less troubled with small fish by making them rise and certain it is that a day when the fish are rising all over the stream is generally one of disappointment  another advantage of bank fishing is that the fish sees the fly only for a moment  he has no long gaze at it as it comes to him across the water  it either drops exactly over his nose or sweeps down the stream straight upon him  he expects it to escape on shore the next moment and chops at it fiercely and hastily instead of following and examining  add to this the fact that when he is under the bank there is far less chance of his seeing you and duly considering these things you will throw away no more time in drawing at least in chalkstreams flies over the watery wastes to be snapped at now and then by herringsized pinkeens  in rocky streams where the quantity of bank food is far smaller this rule will perhaps not hold good though who knows not that his best fish are generally taken under some tree from which the little caterpillars having determined on slow and deliberate suicide are letting themselves down gently by a silken thread into the mouth of the spotted monarch who has but to sail about and about and pick them up one by one as they touch the streama sight which makes one thinkas does a herd of swine crunching acorns each one of which might have become a builder oakhow nature is never more magnificent than in her waste  the next mistake natural enough to the laziness of fallen man is that of fishing downstream and not up  what mr stewart says on this point should be read by every tyro  by fishing upstream even against the wind he will on an average kill twice as many trout as when fishing down  if trout are out and feeding on the shallows up or down will simply make the difference of fish or no fish and even in deeps where the difference in the chance of not being seen is not so great many more fish will be hooked by the man who fishes up stream simply because when he strikes he pulls the hook into the trouts mouth instead of out of it  but he who would obey mr stewart in fishing upstream must obey him also in discarding his light london rod which is in three cases out of four as weak and floppy in the middle as a waggon whip and get to himself a stiff and powerful rod strong enough to spin a minnow whereby he will obtain after some weeks of aching muscles two good thingsa fore arm fit for a sculptors model and trout hooked and killed instead of pricked and lost  killed as well as hooked for how large trout are to be killed in a weedy chalkstream without a stiff rod which will take them down is a question yet unsolved  even the merest cockney will know if he thinks that weeds float with their points downstream and that therefore if a fish is to be brought through them without entangling he must be combed through them in the same direction  but how is this to be done if a fish be hooked below you on a weak rod  with a strong rod indeed you can at the chance of tearing out the hook keep him by main force on the top of the water till you have run past him and below him shortening your line anyhow in loopsthere is no time to wind it up with the reeland then do what you might have done comfortably at first had you been fishing upviz bring him downstream and let the water run through his gills and drown him  but with a weak rodalas for the tyro  he catches one glimpse of a silver side plunging into the depths he finds his rod double in his hand he finds fish and flies stop suddenly somewhere he rushes down to the spot sees weeds waving around his line and guesses from what he feels and sees that the fish is grubbing upstream through them five feet under water  he tugs downwards and backwards but too late the dropfly is fast wrapt in ceratophyllum and glyceria callitriche and potamogeton and halfadozen more horrid things with long names and longer stems and what remains but the fate of campbells lord ullin    the waters wild went oer his child    and he was left lamenting   unless in fact large fish can be got rapidly downstream the chance of killing them is very small and therefore the man who fishes a willowfringed brook downward is worthy of no crown but ophelias besides being likely enough if he attempt to get down to his fish to share her fate  the best fisherman however will come to shame in streams bordered by pollard willows and among queer nooks which can be only fished downstream  i saw but the other day a fish hooked cleverly enough by throwing to an inch where he ought to have been and indeed was and from the only point whence the throw could be made  out of the water he came head and tail the moment he felt the hook and showed a fair side over two pounds weight     and then  instead of running away he ran right at the fisherman for reasons which were but too patent  between man and fish were ten yards of shallow then a deep weedy shelf and then the hole which was his house  and for that weedy shelf the spotted monarch made knowing that there he could drag himself clear of the fly as perhaps he had done more than once before  what was to be done  take him downstream through the weed  alas on the mans left hand an old pollard leant into the water barring all downward movement  jump in and run round  he had rather to run back from the bank from fear of a loose line the fish was coming at him so fast that there was no time to wind up  safe into the weeds hurls the fish the man as soon as he finds the fish stop jumps in midleg deep and staggers up to him in hopes of clearing finds the dropper fast in the weeds and the stretcher which had been in the fishs mouth wantoning somewhere in the depthsquid plura  let us draw a veil over that mans return to shore  no mortal skill could have killed that fish  mortal luck which is sometimes as most statesmen know very great might have done it if the fish had been irretrievably fast hooked as per contra i once saw a fish of nearly four pounds hooked just above an alder bush on the same bank as the angler  the stream was swift  there was a great weedbed above the man had but about ten feet square of swift water to kill the trout in  not a foot downstream could he take him in fact he had to pull him hard upstream to keep him out of his hover in the alder roots  three times that fish leapt into the air nearly a yard high and yet so merciful is luck and so firmly was he hooked in five breathless minutes he was in the landingnet and when he was there and safe ashore just of the shape and colour of a silver spoon his captor lay down panting upon the bank and with sir hugh evans manifested a great disposition to cry  but it was a beautiful sight  a sharper round between man and fish never saw i fought in merry england  i saw once however a cleverer though not a more dashing feat  a handy little fellow i wonder where he is now hooked a trout of nearly three pounds with his dropper and at the same moment a post with his stretcher  what was to be done  to keep the fish pulling on him and not on the post  and that being favoured by standing on a fourfoot bank he did so well that he tired out the fish in some six feet square of water stopping him and turning him beautifully whenever he tried to run till i could get in to him with the landingnet  that was fiveandthirty years since  if the little man has progressed in his fishing as he ought he should be now one of the finest anglers in england        so  thanks to bank fishing we have you see landed three or four more good fish in the last two hoursand  what is here  an ugly twopound chub chevin echevin or alderman as the french call him  how is this keeper  i thought you allowed no such vermin in this water  the keeper answers with a grunt that they allow themselves  that there always were chub hereabouts and always will be for the more he takes out with the net the more come next day  probably  no nets will exterminate these spawneating fryeating alleating pests who devour the little trout and starve the large ones and at the first sign of the net fly to hover among the most tangled roots  there they lie as close as rats in a bank and work themselves the farther in the more they are splashed and poked by the poles of the beaters  but the fly well used willif not exterminate themstill thin them down greatly and very good sport they give in my opinion in spite of the contempt in which they are commonly held as chickenhearted fish who show no fight  true but their very cowardice makes them the more difficult to catch for no fish must you keep more out of sight and further off  the very shadow of the line not to mention that of the rod sends them flying to hover and they rise so cautiously and quietly that they give excellent lessons in patience and nerve to a beginner  if the fly is dragged along the surface or jerked suddenly from them they flee from it in terror and when they do after due deliberation take it in their rise is so quiet that you can seldom tell whether your fish weighs half a pound or four pounds and a halfunless you like most beginners attempt to show your quickness by that most useless exertion a violent strike  then the snapping of your footlink or just as likelyof the top of your rod makes you fully aware if not of the pluck at least of the brute strength of the burly alderman of the waters  no fish therefore will better teach the beginner the good old lesson not to frighten a fish before you have tired him  for flieschub will rise greedily at any large palmers the larger and rougher the better  a red and a grizzled hackle will always take them but the best fly of all is an imitation of the black beetle the undertaker of the london shops  he too can hardly be too large and should be made of a fat body of black wool with the metallic black feather of a cocks tail wrapped loosely over it  a still better wing is one of the neck feathers of any metallicplumed bird eg phlogophorus impeyanus the menaul pheasant laid flat and whole on the back to imitate the wingshells of the beetle the legs being represented by any loose black feathersnot hackles which are too fine  tied thus it will kill not only every chub in a pool if you give the survivors a quarter of an hour wherein to recover from their horror at their last friends fate but also here and there very large trout  another slur upon the noble sport of chub fishing is the fact of his not being worth eatinga fact which in the true sportsmans eyes will go for nothing  but though the man who can buy fresh soles and salmon may despise chub there are those who do not  true you may make a most accurate imitation of him by taking one of palmers patent candles wick and all stuffing it with needles and split bristles and then stewing the same in ditchwater  nevertheless strange to say the agricultural stomach digests chub and if after having filled your creel or three creels as you may too often with them you will distribute them on your way home to all the old women you meet you will make many poor souls happy after having saved the lives of many trout  but here we come to a strip of thick cover part of our squires home preserves which it is impossible to fish so closely do the boughs cover the water  we will walk on through it towards the hall and there getwhat we begin sorely to needsomething to eat  it will be of little use fishing for some time to come for these hot hours of the afternoon from three till six are generally the deadest time of the whole day  and now when we have struggled in imagination through the last bit of copse and tumbled over the palings into the lawn we shall see a scene quite as lovely if you will believe it as any alp on earth  what shall we see as we look across the broad still clear river where the great dark trout sail to and fro lazily in the sun  for having freewarren of our fancy and our paper we may see what we choose  white chalkfields above quivering hazy in the heat  a park full of merry haymakers gay red and blue waggons stalwart horses switching off the flies dark avenues of tall elms groups of abele tossing their whispering silver to the sun and amid them the house  what manner of house shall it be  tudor or elizabethan with oriels mullioned windows gables and turrets of strange shape  no  that is commonplace  everybody builds tudor houses now  our house shall smack of inigo jones or christopher wren a great square redbrick mass made light and cheerful though by quoins and windows of white sarsden stone with highpeaked french roofs broken by louvres and dormers haunted by a thousand swallows and starlings  old walled gardens gay with flowers shall stretch right and left  clipt yew alleys shall wander away into mysterious glooms  and out of their black arches shall come tripping children like white fairies to laugh and talk with the girl who lies dreaming and reading in the hammock there beneath the black velvet canopy of the great cedar tree like some fair tropic flower hanging from its boughs  then they shall wander down across the smoothshorn lawn where the purple rhododendrons hang double bush and image over the waters edge and call to us across the stream what sport and the old squire shall beckon the keeper over the long stone bridge and return with him bringing luncheon and good ale and we will sit down and eat and drink among the burdock leaves and then watch the quiet house and lawn and flowers and fair human creatures and shining water all sleeping breathless in the glorious light beneath the glorious blue till we doze off lulled by the murmur of a thousand insects and the rich minstrelsy of nightingale and blackcap thrush and dove  peaceful graceful complete english country life and country houses everywhere finish and polish nature perfected by the wealth and art of peaceful centuries  why should i exchange you even for the sight of all the alps for bad roads bad carriages bad inns bad food bad washing bad beds and fleas fleas fleas  let that last thought be enough  there may be follies there may be sorrows there may be sinsthough i know there are no very heavy onesin that fine old house opposite  but thanks to the genius of my native land there are at least no fleas  think of that wandering friend and of this also that you will find your warm bath ready when you go to bed tonight and your cold one when you rise tomorrow morning and in content and thankfulness stay in england and be clean       here then let us lounge a full two hours too comfortable and too tired to care for fishing till the hallbell rings for that dinner which we as good anglers will despise  then we will make our way to the broad reaches above the house  the evening breeze should be ruffling them gallantly and see the fly is getting up  countless thousands are rising off the grass and flickering to and fro above the stream  stand still a moment and you will hear the air full of the soft rustle of innumerable wings  hundreds more even more delicate and gauzy are rising through the water and floating helplessly along the surface as aphrodite may have done when she rose in the aegean half frightened at the sight of the new upper world  and see the great trout are moving everywhere  fish too large and well fed to care for the fly at any other season who have been lounging among the weeds all day and snapping at passing minnows have come to the surface and are feeding steadily splashing five or six times in succession and then going down awhile to bolt their mouthful of victims while here and there a heavy silent swirl tells of a fly taken before it has reached the surface untimely slain before it has seen the day  nowput your greendrake on and throw regardless of bankfishing or any other rule wherever you see a fish rise  do not work your flies in the least but let them float down over the fish or sink if they will he is more likely to take them under water than on the top  and mind this rule  be patient with your fish and do not fancy that because he does not rise to you the first or the tenth time therefore he will not rise at all  he may have filled his mouth and gone down to gorge and when he comes up again if your fly be the first which he meets he will probably seize it greedily and all the more so if it be under water so seeming drowned and helpless  besides a fish seldom rises twice exactly in the same place unless he be lying between two weeds or in the corner of an eddy  his small wits when he is feeding in the open seem to hint to him that after having found a fly in one place he must move a foot or two on to find another and therefore it may be some time before your turn comes and your fly passes just over his nose which if it do not do he certainly will not amid such an abundance go out of his way for it  in the meanwhile your footlink will very probably have hit him over the back or run foul of his nose in which case you will not catch him at all  a painful fact for you but if you could catch every fish you saw where would be the trout for next season  put on a dropper of some kind say a caperer as a second chance  i almost prefer the dark claretspinner with which i have killed very large fish alternately with the greendrake even when it was quite dark and for your stretcher of course a greendrake  for a blustering evening like this your drake can hardly be too large or too rough in brighter and stiller weather the fish often prefer a fly half the size of the natural one  only bear in mind that the most tempting form among these millions of drakes is that one whose wings are very little coloured at all of a pale greenish yellow whose body is strawcoloured and his head thorax and legs spotted with dark brownbest represented by a pheasant or cochabonddhu hackle  the best imitation of this or of any drake which i have ever seen is one by mr macgowan whilome of ballyshannon now of no 7 brutonstreet berkeleysquare whose drakes known by a waxy body of some mysterious material do surpass those of all other men and should be known and honoured far and wide  but failing them you may do well with a drake which is ribbed through the whole length with red hackle over a strawcoloured body  a northcountryman would laugh at it and ask us how we fancy that fish will mistake for that delicate waxy fly a heavy rough palmer made heavier and rougher by two thick tufts of yellow mallard wing  but if he will fish therewith he will catch trout and mighty ones they will be  i have found again and again this drake in which the hackle is ribbed all down the body beat a barebodied one in the ratio of three fish to one  the reason is difficult to guess  perhaps the shining transparent hackle gives the fly more of the waxy look of the natural insect or perhaps the buzzly look of the fly causes the fish to mistake it for one half emerged from its pupa case fluttering entangled and helpless  but whatever be the cause i am sure of the fact  nowsilence and sport for the next three hours        there  all things must end  it is so dark that i have been fishing for the last five minutes without any end fly and we have lost our two last fish simply by not being able to guide them into the net but what an evenings sport we have had  beside several over a pound which i have thrown in i trust you have been generous and done likewise there are six fish averaging two pounds apiece and what is the weight of that monster with whom i saw you wrestling dimly through the dusk your legs stuck kneedeep in a mudbank your head embowered in nettles while the keeper waltzed round you roaring mere incoherenciesfour pounds full  now is there any sherry left in the flask  no  then we will give the keeper five shillings he is well worth his pay and then drag our weary limbs towards the hall to bath supper and bed while you confess i trust that you may get noble sport hard exercise and lovely scenery without going sixty miles from london town    iii the fens    a certain sadness is pardonable to one who watches the destruction of a grand natural phenomenon even though its destruction bring blessings to the human race  reason and conscience tell us that it is right and good that the great fen should have become instead of a waste and howling wilderness a garden of the lord where   all the land in flowery squares beneath a broad and equalblowing wind smells of the coming summer   and yet the fancy may linger without blame over the shining meres the golden reedbeds the countless waterfowl the strange and gaudy insects the wild nature the mystery the majestyfor mystery and majesty there werewhich haunted the deep fens for many a hundred years  little thinks the scotsman whirled down by the great northern railway from peterborough to huntingdon what a grand place even twenty years ago was that holme and whittlesea which is now but a black unsightly steaming flat from which the meres and reed beds of the old world are gone while the corn and roots of the new world have not as yet taken their place  but grand enough it was that black ugly place when backed by caistor hanglands and holme wood and the patches of the primaeval forest while darkgreen alders and palegreen reeds stretched for miles round the broad lagoon where the coot clanked and the bittern boomed and the sedgebird not content with its own sweet song mocked the notes of all the birds around while high overhead hung motionless hawk beyond hawk buzzard beyond buzzard kite beyond kite as far as eye could see  far off upon the silver mere would rise a puff of smoke from a punt invisible from its flatness and its white paint  then down the wind came the boom of the great stanchiongun and after that sound another sound louder as it neared a cry as of all the bells of cambridge and all the hounds of cottesmore and overhead rushed and whirled the skein of terrified wildfowl screaming piping clacking croaking filling the air with the hoarse rattle of their wings while clear above all sounded the wild whistle of the curlew and the trumpet note of the great wild swan  they are all gone now  no longer do the ruffs trample the sedge into a hard floor in their fightingrings while the sober reeves stand round admiring the tournament of their lovers gay with ears and tippets no two of them alike  gone are ruffs and reeves spoonbills bitterns avosets the very snipe one hears disdains to breed  gone too not only from whittlesea but from the whole world is that most exquisite of english butterflies lycaena disparthe great copper and many a curious insect more  ah well at least we shall have wheat and mutton instead and no more typhus and ague and it is to be hoped no more brandydrinking and opiumeating and children will live and not die  for it was a hard place to live in the old fen a place wherein one heard of unexampled instances of longevity for the same reason that one hears of them in savage tribesthat few lived to old age at all save those iron constitutions which nothing could break down  and now when the bold fenmen who had been fighting water by the help of wind have given up the more capricious element for that more manageable servant fire have replaced their windmills by steam engines which will work in all weathers and have pumped the whole fen dryeven too dry as the last hot summer proved when the only bit of the primaeval wilderness left as far as i know is 200 acres of sweet sedge and lastraea thelypteris in wicken fen  there can be no harm in lingering awhile over the past and telling of what the great fen was and how it came to be that great flat which reaches roughly speaking from cambridge to peterborough on the southwest side to lynn and tattershall on the northeast some forty miles and more each way  to do that rightly and describe how the fen came to be one must go back it seems to me to an age before all history an age which cannot be measured by years or centuries an age shrouded in mystery and to be spoken of only in guesses  to assert anything positively concerning that age or ages would be to show the rashness of ignorance  i think that i believe i have good reason to suspect i seem to see are the strongest forms of speech which ought to be used over a matter so vast and as yet so little elaborated  i seem to see then an epoch after those strata were laid down with which geology generally deals after the kimmeridge clay oxford clay and gault clay which form the impervious bedding of the fens with their intermediate beds of coralrag and green sand had been deposited after the chalk had been laid on the top of them at the bottom of some ancient ocean after and what a gulf of time is implied in that last after the boulderclay coeval probably with the till of scotland had been spread out in the age of ice on top of all after the whole had been upheaved out of the sea and stood about the same level as it stands now  but before the great valley of the cam had been scooped out and the strata were still continuous some 200 feet above cambridge and its colleges from the top of the gogmagogs to the top of madingley rise  in those ageswhile the valleys of the cam the ouse the nene the welland the glen and the witham were sawing themselves out by no violent convulsions but simply as i believe by the same slow action of rain and rivers by which they are sawing backward into the land even nowi seem to see a time when the straits of dover did not exista time when a great part of the german ocean was dry land through it into a great estuary between north britain and norway flowed together all the rivers of northeastern europeelbe weser rhine scheldt seine thames and all the rivers of east england as far north as the humber  and if a reason be required for so daring a theoryfirst started if i recollect right by the late lamented edward forbesa sufficient one may be found in one look over a bridge in any river of the east of england  there we see various species of cyprinidae rough or white fishroach dace chub bream and so forth and with them their natural attendant and devourer the pike  now these fish belong almost exclusively to the same system of riversthose of northeast europe  they attain their highest development in the great lakes of sweden  westward of the straits of dover they are not indigenous  they may be found in the streams of south and western england but in every case i believe they have been introduced either by birds or by men  from some now submerged centre of creation to use poor edward forbess formula they must have spread into the rivers where they are now found and spread by fresh water and not by salt which would destroy them in a single tide  again there lingers in the cam and a few other rivers of north eastern europe that curious fish the eelpout or burbot molva lota  now he is utterly distinct from any other freshwater fish of europe  his nearest ally is the ling molva vulgaris a deepsea fish even as his ancestors have been  originally a deepsea form he has found his way up the rivers even to cambridge and there remains  the rivers by which he came up the land through which he passed ages and ages since have been all swept away and he has never found his way back to his native saltwater but lives on in a strange land degraded in form dwindling in numbers and now fast dying out  the explanation may be strange  but it is the only one which i can offer to explain the factwhich is itself much more strangeof the burbot being found in the fen rivers  another proof may be found in the presence of the edible frog of the continent at foulmire on the edge of the cambridge fans  it is a moot point still with some whether he was not put there by man  it is a still stronger argument against his being indigenous that he is never mentioned as an article of food by the mediaeval monks who would have knownfrenchmen italians germans as many of them were that he is as dainty as ever was a spring chicken  but if he be indigenous his presence proves that once he could either hop across the straits of dover or swim across the german ocean  but there can be no doubt of the next proofthe presence in the fens where he is now probably extinct and in certain spots in east anglia which i shall take care not to mention of that exquisite little bird the bearded tit calamophilus biarmicus  tit he is none rather it is said a finch but connected with no other english bird  his central home is in the marshes of russia and prussia his food the mollusks which swarm among the reedbeds where he builds and feeding on those from reedbed to reed bed all across what was once the german ocean has come the beautiful little bird with long tail orange tawny plumage and black moustache which might have been seen forty years ago in hundreds on ever reedrond of the fen  one more prooffor it is the heaping up of facts each minute by itself which issues often in a sound and great result  in draining wretham mere in norfolk not so very far from the fens in the year 1856 there were found embedded in the peat moss which is not the scotch and western sphagnum palustre but an altogether different moss hypnum fluitans remains of an ancient lakedwelling supported on piles  a dwelling like those which have lately attracted so much notice in the lakes of switzerland  like those which the dyaks make about the ports and rivers of borneo dwellings invented it seems to me to enable the inhabitants to escape not wild beasts only but malaria and night frosts and perched above the cold and poisonous fogs to sleep if not high and dry at least high and healthy  in the bottom of this mere were found two shells of the freshwater tortoise emys lutaria till then unknown in england  these little animals who may be seen in hundreds in the meres of eastern europe sunning their backs on fallen logs and diving into the water at the sound of a footstep are eaten largely in continental capitals as is their cousin the terrapin emys picta in the southern states  they may be bought at paris at fashionable restaurants  thither they may have been sent from vienna or berlin for in north france holland and northwest germany they are unknown  a few specimens have been found buried in peat in sweden and denmark and there is a tale of a live one having been found in the extreme south part of sweden some twenty years ago 103  into sweden then as into england the little freshwater tortoise had wandered as to an extreme limit beyond which the change of climate and probably of food killed him off  but the emys which came to the wretham bog must have had a long journey and a journey by fresh water too  down elbe or weser he must have floated icepacked or swept away by flood till somewhere off the doggerbank in that great network of rivers which is now open sea he or his descendants turned up ouse and little ouse till they found a mere like their old prussian one and there founded a tiny colony for a few generations till they were eaten up by the savages of the table dwelling or died outas many a human family has died outbecause they found the world too hard  and lastly my friend mr brady well known to naturalists has found that many forms of entomastraca are common to the estuaries of the east of england and to those of holland  it was thus necessary in order to account for the presence of some of the common animals of the fen to go back to an epoch of immense remoteness  and how was that great lowland swept away  who can tell  probably by no violent convulsion  slow upheavals slow depressions there may have beenindeed must have beenas the sunken firforests of brancaster and the raised beach of hunstanton on the extreme north east corner of the wash testify to this day  but the main agent of destruction has been doubtless that same evergnawing seawash which devours still the soft strata of the whole east coast of england as far as flamborough head and that great scavenger the tidewave which sweeps the fallen rubbish out to sea twice in every twentyfour hours  wave and tide by sea rain and river by land these are gods mighty mills in which he makes the old world new and as longfellow says of moral things so may we of physical   though the mills of god grind slowly yet they grind exceeding small though he sit end wait with patience with exactness grinds he all   the lighter and more soluble particles during that slow but vast destruction which is going on still to this day have been carried far out to sea and deposited as ooze  the heavier and coarser have been left along the shores as the gravels which fill the old estuaries of the east of england  from these gravels we can judge of the larger animals which dwelt in that old world  about these lost lowlands wandered herds of the woolly mammoth  elephas primigenius whose bones are common in certain cambridge gravels whose teeth are brought up by dredgers far out in the german ocean off certain parts of the norfolk coast with them wandered the woolly rhinoceros r tichorhinus the hippopotamus the lionnot according to some to be distinguished from the recent lion of africathe hyaena the bear the horse the reindeer and the musk ox the great irish elk whose vast horns are so well known in every museum of northern europe and that mighty ox the bos primigenius which still lingered on the continent in caesars time as the urus in magnitude less only than the elephantand not to be confounded with the bison a relation of if not identical with the buffalo of north americawhich still lingers carefully preserved by the czar in the forests of lithuania  the remains of this gigantic ox be it remembered are found throughout britain and even into the shetland isles  would that any gentleman who may see these pages would take notice of the fact that we have not so i am informed in these islands a single perfect skeleton of bos primigenius while the museum of copenhagen to its honour possesses five or six from a much smaller field than is open to us and be publicspirited enough the next time he hears of ox bones whether in gravel or in peat as he may in the draining of any northern moss to preserve them for the museum of his neighbourhood or send them to cambridge  but did all these animals exist at the same time  it is difficult to say  the study of the different gravels is most intricatealmost a special science in itselfin which but two or three men are adepts it is hard at first sight to believe that the hippopotamus could have been the neighbour of the arctic reindeer and musk ox  but that the woolly mammoth not only may have been such but was such there can be no doubt  his remains imbedded in ice at the mouth of the great siberian rivers with the wool skin and flesh in some cases still remaining on the bones prove him to have been fitted for a cold climate and to have browsed upon the scanty shrubs of northern asia  but indeed there is no reason a priori why these huge mammals now confined to hotter countries should not have once inhabited a colder region or at least have wandered northwards in whole herds in summer to escape insects and find fresh food and above all water  the same is the case with the lion and other huge beasts of prey  the tiger of hindostan ranges at least in summer across the snows of the himalaya and throughout china  even at the river amoor where the winters are as severe as at st petersburg the tiger is an ordinary resident at all seasons  the lion was undoubtedly an inhabitant of thrace as late as the expedition of xerxes whose camels they attacked and the nemaean lion and the other lions which stand out in grecian myth as having been killed by hercules and the heroes may have been the last remaining specimens of that felis spelaea undistinguishable according to some from the african lion whose bones are found in the gravels and the caverns of these isles  and how long ago were those days of mammoths and reindeer lions and hyaenas  we must talk not of days but of ages we know nothing of days or years  as the late lamented professor sedgwick has well said  we allow that the great european oscillation which ended in the production of the drift the boulder clay or till was effected during a time of vast but unknown length  and if we limit our inquiries and ask what was the interval of time between the newest bed of gravel near cambridge and the oldest bed of bogland or silt in cambridgeshire and norfolk we are utterly at a loss for a definite answer  the interval of time may have been very great  but we have no scale on which to measure it  let us suppose then the era of gravels past the valleys which open into the fen sawn out by rivers to about their present depth what was the special cause of the fen itself why did not the great lowland become a fertile carse of firm alluvial soil like that of stirling  one reason is that the carse of stirling has been upheaved some twenty feet and thereby more or less drained since the time of the romans  a fact patent and provable from cramond the old roman port of alaterna up to blair drummond above stirling where whales skeletons and bone tools by them have been found in loam and peat twenty feet above highwater mark  the alluvium of the fens on the other hand has very probably suffered a slight depression  but the main reason is that the silt brought down by the fen rivers cannot like that of the forth and its neighbouring streams get safe away to sea  from flamborough head in yorkshire all down the lincolnshire coast the land is falling falling for ever into the waves and swept southward by tide and current the debris turns into the wash between lincolnshire and norfolk there to repose as in a quiet haven  hence that vast labyrinth of banks between lynn and wisbeach of mud inside brought down by the fen rivers but outside contrary to the usual rule of shifting sand which has come inward from the sea and prevents the muds escapebanks parted by narrow gullies the delight of the gunner with his punt haunted by million wildfowl in winter and in summer hazy steaming flats beyond which the trees of lincolnshire loom up raised by refraction far above the horizon while the masts and sails of distant vessels quiver fantastically distorted and lengthened sometimes even inverted by a refraction like that which plays such tricks with ships and coasts in the arctic seas  along the top of the mud banks lounge the long black rows of seals undistinguishable from their reflection in the still water below distorted too and magnified to the size of elephants  long lines of seapies wing their way along at regular tidehours from or to the ocean  now and then a skein of geese paddle hastily out of sight round a mudcape or a brown robber gull generally richardsons skua raises a tumult of screams by making a raid upon a party of honest white gulls to frighten them into vomiting up their prey for his benefit or a single cormorant flaps along close to the water towards his fishing ground  even the fish are shy of haunting a bottom which shifts with every storm and innumerable shrimps are almost the only product of the shallow barren sea beside all is silence and desolation as of a world waiting to be made  so strong is the barrier which these seaborne sands oppose to the riverborne ooze that as soon as a seabank is builtas the projectors of the victoria county have built themacross any part of the estuary the mud caught by it soon warps the space within into firm and rich dry land  but that same barrier ere the fen was drained backed up for ages not only the silt but the very water of the fens and spread it inland into a labyrinth of shifting streams shallow meres and vast peat bogs on those impervious clays which floor the fen  each river contributed to the formation of those bogs and meres instead of draining them away repeating on a huge scale the process which may be seen in many a highland strath where the ground at the edge of the stream is firm and high the meadows near the hillfoot a few hundred yards away bogland lower than the bank of the stream  for each flood deposits its silt upon the immediate bank of the river raising it year by year tillas in the case of the levee of the mississippi and probably of every one of the old fen riversthe stream runs at last between two natural dykes at a level considerably higher than that of the now swamped and undrainable lands right and left of it  if we add to this a slope in the fen rivers so extraordinarily slight that the river at cambridge is only thirteen and a half feet above the mean sea level fiveandthirty miles away and that if the great seasluice of denver the key of all the eastern fen were washed away the tide would back up the cam to within ten miles of cambridge if we add again the rainfall upon that vast flat area utterly unable to escape through rivers which have enough to do to drain the hills around it is easy to understand how peat the certain product of standing water has slowly overwhelmed the rich alluvium fattened by the washing of those phosphatic greensand beds which discovered by the science of the lamented professor henslow are now yielding round cambridge supplies of manure seemingly inexhaustible  easy it is to understand how the alldevouring yet allpreserving peatmoss swallowed up gradually the stately forests of fir and oak ash and poplar hazel and yew which once grew on that rank land how trees torn down by flood or storm floated and lodged in rafts damming the waters back still more how streams bewildered in the flats changed their channels mingling silt and sand with the peatmoss how nature left to herself ran into wild riot and chaos more and more till the whole fen became one dismal swamp in which the last of the english like dred in mrs stowes tale took refuge from their tyrants and lived like him a free and joyous life awhile  for there were islands and are still in that wide fen which have escaped the destroying deluge of peatmoss outcrops of firm land which even in the middle age preserved the fauna and flora of the primaeval forest haunted by the descendants of some at least of those wild beasts which roamed on the older continent of the gravel age  the allpreserving peat as well as the monkish records of the early middle age enable us to repeople tolerably well the primaeval fen  the gigantic ox bos primigenius was still there though there is no record of him in monkish tales  but with him had appeared not unknown toward the end of the gravel age another ox smaller and with shorter horns bos longifrons which is held to be the ancestor of our own domestic shorthorns and of the wild cattle still preserved at chillingham and at cadzow  the reindeer had disappeared almost or altogether  the red deer of a size beside which the largest scotch stag is puny and even the great carpathian stag inferior abound so does the roe so does the goat which one is accustomed to look on as a mountain animal  in the woodwardian museum there is a portion of a skull of an ibexprobably capra sibiricawhich was found in the drift gravel at fulbourne  wild sheep are unknown  the horse occurs in the peat but whether wild or tame who can tell  horses enough have been mired and drowned since the romans set foot on this island to account for the presence of horses skulls without the hypothesis of wild herds such as doubtless existed in the gravel times  the wolf of course is common wild cat marten badger and otter all would expect but not so the beaver which nevertheless is abundant in the peat and damage enough the busy fellows must have done cutting trees damming streams flooding marshes and like selfish speculators in all ages sacrificing freely the public interest to their own  here and there are found the skulls of bears in one case that of a polar bear ice drifted and one of a walrus probably washed in dead after a storm  beautiful after their kind were these fenisles in the eyes of the monks who were the first settlers in the wilderness  the author of the history of ramsey grows enthusiastic and after the manner of old monks somewhat bombastic also as he describes the lonely isle which got its name from the solitary ram who had wandered thither either in some extreme drought or over the winter ice and never able to return was found fat beyond the wont of rams feeding among the wild deer  he tells of the stately ashesmost of them cut in his time to furnish mighty beams for the church roof of the rich pastures painted with all gay flowers in spring of the green crown of reed and alder which girdled round the isle of the fair wide mere with its sandy beach along the forest side  a delight he says to all who look thereon  in like humour william of malmesbury writing in the first half of the twelfth century speaks of thorney abbey and isle  it represents he says a very paradise for that in pleasure and delight it resembles heaven itself  these marshes abound in trees whose length without a knot doth emulate the stars  the plain there is as level as the sea which with green grass allures the eye and so smooth that there is nought to hinder him who runs through it neither is therein any waste place for in some parts are apple trees in other vines which are either spread on the ground or raised on poles  a mutual strife is there between nature and art so that what one produces not the other supplies  what shall i say of those fair buildings which tis so wonderful to see the ground among those fens upbear  but the most detailed picture of a fenisle is that in the second part of the book of ely wherein a single knight of all the french army forces his way into the isle of st etheldreda and hospitably entertained there by hereward and his english is sent back safe to william the conqueror to tell him of the strength of ely isle  he cannot praise enoughhis speech may be mythical but as written by richard of ely only one generation after it must describe faithfully what the place was likethe wonders of the isle  its soil the richest in england its pleasant pastures its noble huntinggrounds its store of sheep and cattle though its vines he says as a frenchman had good right to say were not equally to be praised its wide meres and bogs about it like a wall  in it was to quote roughly abundance of tame beasts and of wild stag roe and goat in grove and marsh martens and ermines and fitchets which in hard winter were caught in snares or gins  but of the kind of fish and fowl which bred therein what can i say  in the pools around are netted eels innumerable great water wolves and pickerel perch roach burbot lampreys which the french called seaserpents smelts too and the royal fish the turbot surely a mistake for sturgeon are said often to be taken  but of the birds which haunt around if you be not tired as of the rest we will expound innumerable geese gulls coots divers watercrows herons ducks of which when there is most plenty in winter or at moulting time i have seen hundreds taken at a time by nets springes or birdlime and so forth till as he assures william the frenchman may sit on haddenham field blockading ely for seven years more ere they will make one ploughman stop short in his furrow one hunter cease to set his nets or one fowler to deceive the birds with springe and snare  and yet there was another side to the picture  man lived hard in those days under dark skies in houseseven the most luxurious of themwhich we should think from draughts and darkness unfit for felons cells  hardly they lived and easily were they pleased and thankful to god for the least gleam of sunshine the least patch of green after the terrible and long winters of the middle age  and ugly enough those winters must have been what with snowstorm and darkness flood and ice ague and rheumatism while through the long drear winter nights the whistle of the wind and the wild cries of the waterfowl were translated into the howls of witches and demons and as in st guthlacs case the delirious fancies of marsh fever made fiends take hideous shapes before the inner eye and act fantastic horrors round the old fenmans bed of sedge  the romans seem to have done something toward the draining and embanking of this dismal swamp  to them is attributed the cardyke or catchwater drain which runs for many miles from peterborough northward into lincolnshire cutting off the land waters which flow down from the wolds above  to them too is to be attributed the old roman bank or vallum along the seaface of the marshlands marked to this day by the names of walsoken walton and walpoole  but the english invaders were incapable of following out even of preserving any public works  each village was isolated by its own march of forest each yeoman all but isolated by the eavesdrip or green lane round his farm  each cared for his own things and none for those of others and gradually during the early middle age the fensave those old roman villagesreturned to its primaeval jungle under the neglect of a race which caricatured local selfgovernment into public anarchy and looked on every stranger as an alien enemy who might be lawfully slain if he came through the forest without calling aloud or blowing a horn  till late years the english feeling against the stranger lasted harsh and strong  the farmer strong in his laws of settlement tried at once to pass him into the next parish  the labourer not being versed in law hove half a brick at him or hooted him through the town  it was in the fens perhaps that the necessity of combined effort for fighting the brute powers of nature first awakened public spirit and associate labour and the sense of a common interest between men of different countries and races  but the progress was very slow and the first civilizers of the fen were men who had nothing less in their minds than to conquer nature or call together round them communities of men  hermits driven by that passion for isolated independence which is the mark of the teutonic mind fled into the wilderness where they might if possible be alone with god and their own souls  like st guthlac of crowland after wild fighting for fiveandtwenty years they longed for peace and solitude and from their longing carried out with that iron will which marked the mediaeval man for good or for evil sprang a civilization of which they never dreamed  those who wish to understand the old fen life should read ingulfs history of crowland mr bohn has published a good and cheap translation and initiate themselves into a state of society a form of thought so utterly different from our own that we seem to be reading of the inhabitants of another planet  most amusing and most human is old ingulf and his continuator peter of blois and though their facts are not to be depended on as having actually happened they are still instructive as showing what might or ought to have happened in the opinion of the men of old  even more naive is the anglosaxon life of st guthlac written possibly as early as the eighth century and literally translated by mr goodwin of cambridge  there we may read how the young warriornoble guthlac the battle play the sport of war tired of slaying and sinning bethought him to fulfil the prodigies seen at his birth how he wandered into the fen where one tatwin who after became a saint likewise took him in his canoe to a spot so lonely as to be almost unknown buried in reeds and alders and among the trees nought but an old law as the scots still call a mound which men of old had broken into seeking for treasure and a little pond and how he built himself a hermits cell thereon and saw visions and wrought miracles and how men came to him as to a fakir or shaman of the east notably one beccel who acted as his servant and how as beccel was shaving the saint one day there fell on him a great temptation  why should he not cut st guthlacs throat and install himself in his cell that he might have the honour and glory of sainthood  but st guthlac perceived the inward temptation which is told with the naive honesty of those halfsavage times and rebuked the offender into confession and all went well to the end  there we may read too a detailed account of a fauna now happily extinct in the fens  of the creatures who used to hale st guthlac out of his hut drag him through the bogs carry him aloft through frost and firedevelen and luther gostessuch as tormented likewise st botolph from whom botulfstonboston has its name and who were supposed to haunt the meres and fens and to have an especial fondness for old heathen barrows with their fancied treasure hoards how they filled the house with their coming and poured in on every side from above and from beneath and everywhere  they were in countenance horrible and they had great heads and a long neck and a lean visage they were filthy and squalid in their beards and they had rough ears and crooked nebs and fierce eyes and foul mouths and their teeth were like horses tusks and their throats were filled with flame and they were grating in their voice they had crooked shanks and knees big and great behind and twisted toes and cried hoarsely with their voices and they came with such immoderate noise and immense horror that him thought all between heaven and earth resounded with their voices  and they tugged and led him out of the cot and led him to the swart fen and threw and sunk him in the muddy waters  after that they brought him into the wild places of the wilderness among the thick beds of brambles that all his body was torn  after that they took him and beat him with iron whips and after that they brought him on their creaking wings between the cold regions of the air  but there are gentler and more human touches in that old legend  you may read in it how all the wild birds of the fen came to st guthlac and he fed them after their kind  how the ravens tormented him stealing letters gloves and what not from his visitors and then seized with compunction at his reproofs brought them back or hanged them on the reeds and how as wilfrid a holy visitant was sitting with him discoursing of the contemplative life two swallows came flying in and lifted up their song sitting now on the saints hand now on his shoulder now on his knee  and how when wilfrid wondered thereat guthlac made answer know you not that he who hath led his life according to gods will to him the wild beasts and the wild birds draw the more near  after fifteen years of such a life in fever agues and starvation no wonder if st guthlac died  they buried him in a leaden coffin a grand and expensive luxury in the seventh century which had been sent to him during his life by a saxon princess and then over his sacred and wonderworking corpse as over that of a buddhist saint there rose a chapel with a community of monks companies of pilgrims who came to worship sick who came to be healed till at last founded on great piles driven into the bog arose the lofty wooden abbey of crowland in its sanctuary of the four rivers its dykes parks vineyards orchards rich ploughlands from which in time of famine the monks of crowland fed all people of the neighbouring fens with its tower with seven bells which had not their like in england its twelve altars rich with the gifts of danish vikings and princes and even with twelve white bearskins the gift of canutes self while all around were the cottages of the corrodiers or folk who for a corrody or life pittance from the abbey had given away their lands to the wrong and detriment of their heirs  but within these four rivers at least was neither tyranny nor slavery  those who took refuge in st guthlacs peace from cruel lords must keep his peace toward each other and earn their living like honest men safe while they did so for between those four rivers st guthlac and his abbot were the only lords and neither summoner nor sheriff of the king nor armed force of knight or earl could enter the inheritance of the lord the soil of st mary and st bartholomew the most holy sanctuary of st guthlac and his monks the minster free from worldly servitude the special almshouse of most illustrious kings the sole refuge of anyone in worldly tribulation the perpetual abode of the saints the possession of religious men specially set apart by the common council of the realm by reason of the frequent miracles of the holy confessor st guthlac an everfruitful mother of camphire in the vineyards of engedi and by reason of the privileges granted by the kings a city of grace and safety to all who repent  does not all this soundas i said just nowlike a voice from another planet  it is all gone and it was good and right that it should go when it had done its work and that the civilization of the fen should be taken up and carried out by men like the good knight richard of rulos who two generations after the conquest marrying herewards granddaughter and becoming lord of deeping the deep meadow thought that he could do the same work from the hall of bourne as the monks did from their cloisters got permission from the crowland monks for twenty marks of silver to drain as much as he could of the common marshes and then shut out the welland by strong dykes built cottages marked out gardens and tilled fields till out of slough and bogs accursed he made a garden of pleasure  yet one lasting work those monks of crowland did besides those firm dykes and rich corn lands of the porsand which endure unto this day for within two generations of the norman conquest while the old wooden abbey destroyed by fire was being replaced by that noble pile of stone whose ruins are still standing the french abbot of crowland sent french monks to open a school under the new french donjon in the little roman town of grantebrigge wherebyso does all earnest work however mistaken grow and spread in this world infinitely and for everst guthlac by his canoevoyage into crowland island became the spiritual father of the university of cambridge in the old world and therefore of her noble daughter the university of cambridge in the new world which fenmen sailing from boston deeps colonized and christianized 800 years after st guthlacs death  the drainage of the fens struggled on for these same 800 years slowly and often disastrously  great mistakes were made as when a certain bishop some 700 years ago bethought him to make a cut from littleport drain to rebeck or priestshouses and found to his horror and that of the fenmen that he had let down upon lynn the pentup waters of the whole higher bogs that rivers were running backwards brooks swelling to estuaries and the whole northeastern fen ruinate to be yet more ruinate by banks confusedly thrown up in selfdefence till some order was restored in 1332 and the fens prosperedsuch little of them as could be drained at allfor nigh two hundred years  honour meanwhile to another prelate good bishop morton who cut the great learn from guyhirnthe last place at which one could see a standing gallows and two irish reapers hanging in chains having murdered the old witch of guyhirn for the sake of hidden treasure which proved to be some thirty shillings and a few silver spoons  the belief is more general than wellfounded that the drainage of the fens retrograded on account of the dissolution of the monasteries the state of decay into which those institutions had already fallen and which alone made their dissolution possible must have extended itself to these fenlands  no one can read the account of their debts neglect malversation of funds in the time of henry viii without seeing that the expensive works necessary to keep fenlands dry must have suffered as did everything else belonging to the convents  it was not till the middle or end of elizabeths reign that the recovery of these drowned lands was proceeded with once more and during the first half of the seventeenth century there went on more and more rapidly that great series of artificial works which though often faulty in principle often unexpectedly disastrous in effect have got the work done as all work is done in this world not as well as it should have been done but at least done  to comprehend those works would be impossible without maps and plans to take a lively interest in them impossible likewise save to an engineer or a fenman  suffice it to say that in the early part of the seventeenth century we find a great company of adventurersmore than one cromwell among them and francis the great and good earl of bedford at their headtrying to start a great scheme for draining the drowned middle level east of the isle of ely  how they sent for vermuyden the dutchman who had been draining in north lincolnshire about goole and axholme isle how they got into his hands and were ruined by him how francis of bedford had to sell valuable estates to pay his share how the fenmen looked on francis of bedford as their champion how charles i persecuted him meanly though indeed bedford had in the matter of the lynn law of 1630 given way as desperate men are tempted to do to something like sharp practice unworthy of him how charles took the work into his hands and made a government job of it how bedford died and the fenmen looked on him as a martyr how oliver cromwell arose to avenge the good earl as his family had supported him in past times how oliver st john came to the help of the fenmen and drew up the socalled pretended ordinance of 1649 which was a compromise between vermuyden and the adventurers so able and useful that charles iis government were content to call it pretended and let it stand because it was actually draining the fens and how sir cornelius vermuyden after doing mighty works and taking mighty moneys died a beggar writing petitions which never got answered how william earl of bedford added in 1649 to his fathers old bedford river that noble parallel river the hundred foot both rising high above the land between dykes and washes ie waste spaces right and left to allow for flood water how the great bedford rivers silted up the mouth of the ouse and backed the floods up the cam how denver sluice was built to keep them back and so forthall is written or rather only half or quarter written in the histories of the fens  another matter equally or even more important is but half written indeed only hinted atthe mixed population of the fens  the sturdy old girvii gyrwas men of the gyras or marshes who in herewards time sang their threeman glees more girviorum tripliciter canentes had been crossed with the blood of scandinavian vikings in canutes conquest crossed again with english refugees from all quarters during the french conquest under william after the st bartholomew they received a fresh cross of huguenot fleeing from francedarkhaired fiery earnest folk whose names and physiognomies are said still to remain about wisbeach whittlesea and thorney  then came vermuydens dutchmen leaving some of their blood behind them  after the battle of dunbar another cross came among them of scotch prisoners who employed by cromwells government on the dykes settled down among the fenmen to this day  within the memory of man scotchmen used to come down into the fens every year not merely for harvest but to visit their expatriated kinsmen  to these successive immigrations of strong puritan blood more than even the influence of the cromwells and other puritan gentlemen we may attribute that strong calvinist element which has endured for now nigh three centuries in the fen and attribute too that sturdy independence and selfhelp which drove them of old out of boston town to seek their fortunes first in holland then in massachusetts over sea  and that sturdy independence and selfhelp is not gone there still lives in them some of the spirit of their mythic giant hickafrid the hickathrift of nursery rhymes who when the marshland men possibly the romanized inhabitants of the wall villages quarrelled with him in the field took up the cartaxle for a club smote them hip and thigh and pastured his cattle in their despite in the green cheesefens of the smeeth  no one has ever seen a fenbank break without honouring the stern quiet temper which there is in these men when the northeaster is howling above the springtide roaring outside the brimming tideway lapping up to the dyketop or flying over in sheets of spray when round the one fatal thread which is trickling over the dykeor worse through some forgotten rats hole in its sidehundreds of men are clustered without tumult without complaint marshalled under their employers fighting the brute powers of nature not for their employers sake alone but for the sake of their own years labour and their own years bread  the sheep have been driven off the land below the cattle stand ranged shivering on high dykes inland they will be saved in punts if the worst befall  but a hundred spades wielded by practised hands cannot stop that tiny rathole  the trickle becomes a rushthe rush a roaring waterfall  the dyketop trembles gives  the men make efforts desperate dangerous as of sailors in a wreck with faggots hurdles sedge turf  but the bank will break and slowly they draw off sullen but uncomplaining beaten but not conquered  a new cry rises among them  up to save yonder sluice that will save yonder lode that again yonder farm that again some other lode some other farm far back inland but guessed at instantly by men who have studied from their youth as the necessity of their existence the labyrinthine drainage of lands which are all below the water level and where the inner lands in many cases are lower still than those outside  so they hurry away to the nearest farms the teams are harnessed the waggons filled and drawn down and emptied the beercans go round cheerily and the men work with a sort of savage joy at being able to do something if not all and stop the sluice on which so much depends  as for the outer land it is gone past hope through the breach pours a roaring salt cataract digging out a hole on the inside of the bank which remains as a deep sullen pond for years to come  hundreds thousands of pounds are lost already past all hope be it so then  at the next neap perhaps they will be able to mend the dyke and pump the water out and begin again beaten but not conquered the same everlasting fight with wind and wave which their forefathers have waged for now 800 years  he who seesas i have seena sight like that will repine no more that the primaeval forest is cut down the fair mere drained  for instead of mammoth and urus stag and goat that fen feeds cattle many times more numerous than all the wild venison of the primaeval jungle and produces crops capable of nourishing a hundred times as many human beings and moreit produces men a hundred times as numerous as ever it produced before more healthy and longlivedand if they will more virtuous and more happythan ever was girvian in his logcanoe or holy hermit in his cell  so we who knew the deep fen will breathe one sigh over the last scrap of wilderness and say no more content to know that    the old order changeth yielding place to new and god fulfils himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world    iv  my winter garden 135    so my friend  you ask me to tell you how i contrive to support this monotonous country life how fond as i am of excitement adventure society scenery art literature i go cheerfully through the daily routine of a commonplace country profession never requiring a six weeks holiday not caring to see the continent hardly even to spend a day in london having never yet actually got to paris  you wonder why i do not grow dull as those round me whose talk is of bullocksas indeed mine is often enough why i am not by this time all over blue mould why i have not been tempted to bury myself in my study and live a life of dreams among old books  i will tell you  i am a minute philosopher  though one thank heaven of a different stamp from him whom the great bishop berkeley silencedalas only for a while i am possibly after all a man of small mind content with small pleasures  so much the better for me meanwhile i can understand your surprise though you cannot understand my content  you have played a greater game than mine have lived a life perhaps more fit for an englishman certainly more in accordance with the taste of our common fathers the vikings and their patron odin the goer father of all them that go ahead  you have gone ahead and over many lands and i reverence you for it though i envy you not  you have commanded a regimentindeed an army and drank delight of battle with your peers you have ruled provinces and done justice and judgment like a noble englishman as you are old friend among thousands who never knew before what justice and judgment were  you have tasted and you have deserved to taste the joy of old davids psalm when he has hunted down the last of the robber lords of palestine  you have seen a people whom you have not known serve you  as soon as they heard of you they obeyed you but the strange children dissembled with you yet before you too the strange children failed and trembled in their hillforts  noble work that was to do and nobly you have done it and i do not wonder that to a man who has been set to such a task and given power to carry it through all smaller work must seem paltry that such a mans very amusements in that grand indian land and that free adventurous indian life exciting the imagination calling out all the selfhelp and daring of a man should have been on a par with your work that when you go a sporting you ask for no meaner preserve than the primaeval forest no lower park wall than the snow peaks of the himalaya  yes you have been a burra shikarree as well as a burra sahib you have played the great game in your work and killed the great game in your play  how many tons of mighty monsters have you done to death since we two were schoolboys together fiveandtwenty years ago  how many starving villages have you fed with the flesh of elephant or buffalo  how many have you delivered from maneating tigers or wary old alligators their craws full of poor girls bangles  have you not been charged by rhinoceroses all but ript up by boars  have you not seen face to face ovis ammon himself the giant mountain sheepprimaeval ancestor perhaps of all the flocks on earth  your memories must be like those of theseus and hercules full of slain monsters  your brains must be one fossiliferous deposit in which gaur and sambur hog and tiger rhinoceros and elephant lie heaped together as the old ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs are heaped in the lias rocks at lyme  and therefore i like to think of you  i try to picture your feelings to myself  i spell over with my boy mayne reids amusing books or the old forest ranger or williamss old tiger book with howitts plates and try to realize the glory of a burra shikarree  and as i read and imagine feel with sir hugh evans a great disposition to cry  for there were times full many a year ago when my brains were full of bison and grizzly bear mustang and bighorn blackfoot and pawnee and hopes of wild adventure in the far west which i shall never see for ere i was threeandtwenty i discovered plainly enough that my lot was to stay at home and earn my bread in a very quiet way that england was to be henceforth my prison or my palace as i should choose to make it  and i have made it by heavens help the latter  i will confess to you though that in those first heats of youth this little englandor rather this little patch of moor in which i have struck roots as firm as the wild firtrees dolooked at moments rather like a prison than a palace that my foolish young heart would sigh oh that i had wingsnot as a dove to fly home to its nest and croodle therebut as an eagle to swoop away over land and sea in a rampant and selfglorifying fashion on which i now look back as altogether unwholesome and undesirable  but the thirst for adventure and excitement was strong in me as perhaps it ought to be in all at twentyone  others went out to see the glorious new worlds of the west the glorious old worlds of the eastwhy should not i  others rambled over alps and apennines italian picturegalleries and palaces filling their minds with fair memorieswhy should not i others discovered new wonders in botany and zoologywhy should not i  others too like you fulfilled to the utmost that strange lust after the burra shikar which even now makes my pulse throb as often as i see the stags heads in our friend as hall  why should not i  it is not learnt in a day the golden lesson of the old collect to love the thing which is commanded and desire that which is promised  not in a day  but in fifteen years one can spell out a little of its worth and when one finds ones self on the wrong side of forty and the first grey hairs begin to show on the temples and one can no longer jump as high as ones third buttonscarcely alas to any button at all and what with innumerable sprains bruises soakings and chillings ones lower limbs feel in a cold thaw much like an old posthorses why one makes a virtue of necessity  and if one still lusts after sights takes the nearest and looks for wonders not in the himalayas or lake ngami but in the turf on the lawn and the brook in the park and with good alphonse karr enjoys the macromicrocosm in one tour autour de mon jardin  for there it is friend the whole infinite miracle of nature in every tuft of grass if we have only eyes to see it and can disabuse our minds of that tyrannous phantom of size  only recollect that great and small are but relative terms that in truth nothing is great or small save in proportion to the quantity of creative thought which has been exercised in making it that the fly who basks upon one of the trilithons of stonehenge is in truth infinitely greater than all stonehenge together though he may measure the tenth of an inch and the stone on which he sits fiveandtwenty feet  you differ from me  be it so  even if you prove me wrong i will believe myself in the right  i cannot afford to do otherwise  if you rob me of my faith in minute philosophy you rob me of a continual source of content surprise delight  so go your way and i mine each working with all his might and playing with all his might in his own place and way  remember only that though i never can come round to your sphere you must some day come round to me when wounds or weariness or merely as i hope a healthy old age shall shut you out for once and for all from burra shikar whether human or quadrupedfor you surely will not take to politics in your old age  you will not surely live to solicit as many a fine fellow alas did but last year the votes not even of the people but merely of the snobocracy on the ground of your having neither policy nor principles nor even opinions upon any matter in heaven or earththen in that day will you be forced my friend to do what i have done this many a year to refrain your soul and keep it low  you will see more and more the depth of human ignorance the vanity of human endeavours  you will feel more and more that the world is going gods way and not yours or mine or any mans and that if you have been allowed to do good work on earth that work is probably as different from what you fancy it as the tree is from the seed whence it springs  you will grow content therefore not to see the real fruit of your labours because if you saw it you would probably be frightened at it and what is very good in the eyes of god would not be very good in yours content also to receive your discharge and work and fight no more sure that god is working and fighting whether you are in hospital or in the field and with this growing sense of the pettiness of human struggles will grow on you a respect for simple labours a thankfulness for simple pleasures a sympathy with simple people and possibly my trusty friend with me and my little tours about that moorland which i call my wintergarden and which is to me as full of glory and of instruction as the himalaya or the punjab are to you and in which i contrive to find as much health and amusement as i have time forand who ought to have more  i call the said garden mine not because i own it in any legal sense for only in a few acres have i a life interest but in that higher sense in which ten thousand people can own the same thing and yet no mans right interfere with anothers  to whom does the apollo belvedere belong but to all who have eyes to see its beauty  so does my wintergarden and therefore to me among the rest  besides which is a gain to a poor man my pleasure in it is a very cheap one  so are all those of a minute philosopher except his microscope  but my wintergarden which is far larger at all events than that famous one at chatsworth costs me not one penny in keeping up  poor did i call myself  is it not true wealth to have all i want without paying for it  is it not true wealth royal wealth to have some twenty gentlemen and noblemen nay even royal personages planting and improving for me  is it not more than royal wealth to have sun and frost gulfstream and southwesters laws of geology phytology physiology and other ologiesin a word the whole universe and the powers thereof day and night paving planting roofing lighting colouring my wintergarden for me without my even having the trouble to rub a magic ring and tell the genii to go to work  yes  i am very rich as every man may be who will  in the doings of our little country neighbourhood i find tragedy and comedy too fantastic sometimes too sad to be written down  in the words of those whose talk is of bullocks i find the materials of all possible metaphysic and long weekly that i had time to work them out  in fifteen miles of moorland i find the materials of all possible physical science and long that i had time to work out one smallest segment of that great sphere  how can i be richer if i have lying at my feet all day a thousand times more wealth than i can use  some peoplemost peoplein these runabout railway days would complain of such a life in such a narrow sphere so they call it as monotonous  very likely it is so  but is it to be complained of on that account  is monotony in itself an evil  which is better to know many places ill or to know one place well  certainlyif a scientific habit of mind be a gainit is only by exhausting as far as possible the significance of an individual phenomenon is not that sentence a true scientific one in its magniloquence that you can discover any glimpse of the significance of the universal  even men of boundless knowledge like humboldt must have had once their speciality their pet subject or they would have strictly speaking no knowledge at all  the volcanoes of mexico patiently and laboriously investigated in his youth were to humboldt possibly the key of the whole cosmos  i learn more studying over and over again the same bagshot sand and gravel heaps than i should by roaming all europe in search of new geologic wonders  fifteen years have i been puzzling at the same questions and have only guessed at a few of the answers  what sawed out the edges of the moors into long narrow banks of gravel  what cut them off all flat atop  what makes erica tetralix grow in one soil and the bracken in another  how did three species of clubmossone of them quite an alpine oneget down here all the way from wales perhaps upon this isolated patch of gravel  why did that one patch of carex arenaria settle in the only square yard for miles and miles which bore sufficient resemblance to its native sandhill by the seashore to make it comfortable  why did myosurus minimus which i had hunted for in vain for fourteen years appear by dozens in the fifteenth upon a newmade bank which had been for at least two hundred years a farmyard gateway  why does it generally rain here from the southwest not when the barometer falls but when it begins to rise again  whywhy is everything which lies under my feet all day long  i dont know and you cant tell me  and till i have found out i cannot complain of monotony with still undiscovered puzzles waiting to be explained and so to create novelty at every turn  besides monotony is pleasant in itself morally pleasant and morally useful  marriage is monotonous  but there is much i trust to be said in favour of holy wedlock  living in the same house is monotonous  but three removes say the wise are as bad as a fire locomotion is regarded as an evil by our litany  the litany as usual is right  those who travel by land or sea are to be objects of our pity and our prayers and i do pity them  i delight in that same monotony  it saves curiosity anxiety excitement disappointment and a host of bad passions  it gives a man the blessed invigorating feeling that he is at home that he has roots deep and wide struck down into all he sees and that only the being who will do nothing cruel or useless can tear them up  it is pleasant to look down on the same parish day after day and say i know all that lies beneath and all beneath know me  if i want a friend i know where to find him if i want work done i know who will do it  it is pleasant and good to see the same trees year after year the same birds coming back in spring to the same shrubs the same banks covered with the same flowers and broken if they be stiff ones by the same gaps  pleasant and good it is to ride the same horse to sit in the same chair to wear the same old coat that man who offered twenty pounds reward for a lost carpetbag full of old boots was a sage and i wish i knew him  why should one change ones place any more than ones wife or ones children  is a hermitcrab slipping his tail out of one strange shell into another in the hopes of its fitting him a little better either a dignified safe or graceful animal  no george riddler was a true philosopher   let vules go sarching vur and nigh we bides at whum my dog and i   and become there not only wiser but more charitable for the oftener one sees the better one knows and the better one knows the more one loves  it is an easy philosophy especially in the case of the horse where a man cannot afford more than one as i cannot  to own a stud of horses after all is not to own horses at all but ridingmachines your rich man who rides crimaea in the morning sir guy in the afternoon and sultan tomorrow and something else the next day may be a very gallant rider  but it is a question whether he enjoys the pleasure which one horse gives to the poor man who rides him day after day one horse who is not a slave but a friend who has learnt all his tricks of voice hand heel and knows what his master wants even without being told who will bear with his masters infirmities and feels secure that his master will bear with his in turn  possibly after all the grapes are sour and were one rich one would do even as the rich are wont to do  but still i am a minute philosopher  and therefore this afternoon after i have done the same work visited the same people and said the same words to them which i have done for years past and shall i trust for many a year to come i shall go wandering out into the same wintergarden on the same old mare and think the same thoughts and see the same fir trees and meet perhaps the same good fellows hunting of their fox as i have done with full content this many a year and rejoice as i said before in my own boundless wealth who have the whole universe to look at without being charged one penny for the show  as i have said the grapes may be sour and i enjoy the want of luxuries only because i cannot get them but if my selfdeception be useful to me leave it alone  no one is less inclined to depreciate that magnificent wintergarden at the crystal palace  yet let me if i choose prefer my own i argue that in the first place it is far larger  you may drive i hear through the grand one at chatsworth for a quarter of a mile you may ride through mine for fifteen miles on end  i prefer too to any glass roof which sir joseph paxton ever planned that dome above my head some three miles high of soft dappled grey and yellow cloud through the vast latticework whereof the blue sky peeps and sheds down tender gleams on yellow bogs and softly rounded heather knolls and pale chalk ranges gleaming far away  but above all i glory in my evergreens  what wintergarden can compare for them with mine  true i have but four kindsscotch fir holly furze and the heath and by way of relief to them only brows of brown fern sheets of yellow boggrass and here and there a leafless birch whose purple tresses are even more lovely to my eye than those fragrant green ones which she puts on in spring  well  in painting as in music what effects are more grand than those produced by the scientific combination in endless new variety of a few simple elements  enough for me is the one purple birch the bright hollies round its stem sparkling with scarlet beads the furzepatch rich with its lacework of interwoven light and shade tipped here and there with a golden bud the deep soft heather carpet which invites you to lie down and dream for hours and behind all the wall of red firstems and the dark firroof with its jagged edges a mile long against the soft grey sky  an ugly straightedged monotonous firplantation  well i like it outside and inside  i need no sawedge of mountain peaks to stir up my imagination with the sense of the sublime while i can watch the sawedge of those fir peaks against the red sunset  they are my alps little ones it may be  but after all as i asked before what is size  a phantom of our brain an optical delusion  grandeur if you will consider wisely consists in form and not in size  and to the eye of the philosopher the curve drawn on a paper two inches long is just as magnificent just as symbolic of divine mysteries and melodies as when embodied in the span of some cathedral roof have you eyes to see  then lie down on the grass and look near enough to see something more of what is to be seen and you will find tropic jungles in every square foot of turf mountain cliffs and debacles at the mouth of every rabbit burrow  dark strids tremendous cataracts deep glooms and sudden glories in every footbroad rill which wanders through the turf  all is there for you to see if you will but rid yourself of that idol of space and nature as everyone will tell you who has seen dissected an insect under the microscope is as grand and graceful in her smallest as in her hugest forms  the march breeze is chilly  but i can be always warm if i like in my wintergarden  i turn my horses head to the red wall of firstems and leap over the furzegrown bank into my cathedral wherein if there be no saints there are likewise no priestcraft and no idols but endless vistas of smooth red greenveined shafts holding up the warm dark roof lessening away into endless gloom paved with rich brown firneedlea carpet at which nature has been at work for forty years  red shafts green roof and here and there a pane of blue skyneither owen jones nor willement can improve upon that ecclesiastical ornamentationwhile for incense i have the fresh healthy turpentine fragrance far sweeter to my nostrils than the stifling narcotic odour which fills a roman catholic cathedral there is not a breath of air within  but the breeze sighs over the roof above in a soft whisper  i shut my eyes and listen  surely that is the murmur of the summer sea upon the summer sands in devon far away  i hear the innumerable wavelets spend themselves gently upon the shore and die away to rise again  and with the innumerable wavesighs come innumerable memories and faces which i shall never see again upon this earth  i will not tell even you of that old friend  it has two notes two keys rather that eolianharp of firneedles above my head according as the wind is east or west the needles dry or wet  this easterly key of today is shriller more cheerful warmer in sound though the day itself be colder  but grander still as well as softer is the sad soughing key in which the southwest wind roars on rainladen over the forest and calls me forthbeing a minute philosopherto catch trout in the nearest chalkstream  the breeze is gone a while and i am in perfect silencea silence which may be heard  not a sound and not a moving object absolutely none  the absence of animal life is solemn startling  that ringdove who was cooing half a mile away has hushed his moan that flock of longtailed titmice which were twinging and pecking about the fircones a few minutes since are gone  and now there is not even a gnat to quiver in the slant sunrays  did a spider run over these dead leaves i almost fancy i could hear his footfall  the creaking of the saddle the soft step of the mare upon the fir needles jar my ears  i seem alone in a dead world  a dead world and yet so full of life if i had eyes to see  above my head every firneedle is breathingbreathing for ever currents unnumbered circulate in every bough quickened by some undiscovered miracle around me every firstem is distilling strange juices which no laboratory of man can make and where my dull eye sees only death the eye of god sees boundless life and motion health and use  slowly i wander on beneath the warm roof of the wintergarden and meditate upon that one wordlife and specially on all that mr lewes has written so well thereonfor instance    we may consider life itself as an everincreasing identification with nature  the simple cell from which the plant or animal arises must draw light and heat from the sun nutriment from the surrounding world or else it will remain quiescent not alive though latent with life as the grains in the egyptian tombs which after lying thousands of years in those sepulchres are placed in the earth and smile forth as golden wheat  what we call growth is it not a perpetual absorption of nature the identification of the individual with the universal  and may we not in speculative moods consider death as the grand impatience of the soul to free itself from the circle of individual activitythe yearning of the creature to be united with the creator  as with life so with knowledge which is intellectual life  in the early days of mans history nature and her marvellous ongoings were regarded with but a casual and careless eye or else with the merest wonder  it was late before profound and reverent study of her laws could wean man from impatient speculations and now what is our intellectual activity based on except on the more thorough mental absorption of nature  when that absorption is completed the mystic drama will be sunny clear and all natures processes be visible to man as a divine effluence and life   true  yet not all the truth  but who knows all the truth  not i  we see through a glass darkly said st paul of old and what is more dazzle and weary our eyes like clumsy microscopists by looking too long and earnestly through the imperfect and by no means achromatic lens  enough  i will think of something else  i will think of nothing at all   stay  there was a sound at last a light footfall  a hare races towards us through the ferns her great bright eyes full of terror her ears aloft to catch some sound behind  she sees us turns short and vanishes into the gloom  the mare pricks up her ears too listens and looks  but not the way the hare has gone there is something more coming i can trust the finer sense of the horse to which and no wonder the middle age attributed the power of seeing ghosts and fairies impalpable to mans gross eyes  beside that hare was not travelling in search of food  she was not loping along looking around her right and left but galloping steadily she has been frightened she has been put up  but what has put her up  and there far away among the firstems rings the shriek of a startled blackbird  what has put him up  that old mare at sight whereof your wise eyes widen till they are ready to burst and your ears are first shot forward towards your nose and then laid back with vicious intent  stand still old woman  do you think still after fifteen winters that you can catch a fox  a fox it is indeed a great dogfox as red as the firstems between which he glides  and yet his legs are black with fresh peatstains he is a hunted fox  but he has not been up long  the mare stands like a statue  but i can feel her trembling between my knees  positively he does not see us  he sits down in the middle of a ride turns his great ears right and left and then scratches one of them with his hind foot seemingly to make it hear the better now he is up again and on  beneath yon firs some hundred yards away standeth or rather lieth for it is on dead flat ground the famous castle of malepartus which beheld the base murder of lampe the hare and many a seely soul beside  i know it well a patch of sandheaps mingled with great holes amid the twining firroots ancient home of the last of the wild beasts  and thither unto malepartus safe and strong trots reinecke where he hopes to be snug among the labyrinthine windings and innumerable startingholes as the old apologue has it of his ballium covertway and donjon keep  full blown in self satisfaction he trots lifting his toes delicately and carrying his brush aloft as full of cunning and conceit as that worldfamous ancestor of his whose deeds of unchivalry were the delight if not the model of knight and kaiser lady and burgher in the middle age  suddenly he halts at the great gate of malepartus examines it with his nose goes on to a postern examines that also and then another and another while i perceive afar projecting from every caves mouth the red and green end of a new firfaggot  ah reinecke fallen is thy conceit and fallen thy tail therewith  thou hast worse foes to deal with than bruin the bear or isegrim the wolf or any foolish brute whom thy great ancestor outwitted  man the many counselled has been beforehand with thee and the earths are stopped  one moment he sits down to meditate and scratches those trusty counsellors his ears as if he would tear them off revolving swift thoughts in a crafty mind  he has settled it now  he is up and offand at what a pace  out of the way fauns and hamadryads if any be left in the forest  what a pace  and with what a grace beside  oh reinecke beautiful thou art of a surety in spite of thy great naughtiness  art thou some fallen spirit doomed to be hunted for thy sins in this life and in some future life rewarded for thy swiftness and grace and cunning by being made a very messenger of the immortals  who knows  not i  i am rising fast to pistols vein  shall i ejaculate  shall i notify  shall i waken the echoes  shall i break the grand silence by that scream which the vulgar viewhalloo call  it is needless for louder and louder every moment swells up a sound which makes my heart leap into my mouth and my mare into the air  music  wellbeloved soul of hullah would that thou wert here this day and not in st martins hall to hear that chorus as it pours round the firstems rings against the roof above shatters up into a hundred echoes till the air is live with sound  you love madrigals and whatever weekes or wilbye or orlando gibbons sang of old  so do i  theirs is music fit for men  worthy of the age of heroes of drake and raleigh spenser and shakspeare  but oh that you could hear this madrigal  if you must have four parts then there they are  deepedmouthed bass rolling along the ground rich joyful tenor wild wistful alto and leaping up here and there above the throng of sounds delicate treble shrieks and trills of trembling joy  i know not whether you can fit it into your laws of music any more than you can the song of that ariel sprite who dwells in the eolian harp or the roar of the waves on the rock or   myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn and murmur of innumerable bees   but music it is  a madrigal  rather a whole opera of der freischutzdaemoniac element and allto judge by those red lips fierce eyes wild hungry voices and such as should make reinecke had he strong aesthetic sympathies well content to be hunted from his cradle to his grave that such sweet sounds might by him enrich the air  heroes of old were glad to die if but some vates sacer would sing their fame in worthy strains  and shalt not thou too be glad reinecke  content thyself with thy fate  music soothes care let it soothe thine as thou runnest for thy life thou shalt have enough of it in the next hour  for as the etruscans says athenaeus were so luxurious that they used to flog their slaves to the sound of the flute so shall luxurious chanter and challenger sweetlips and melody eat thee to the sound of rich organpipes that so thou mayest   like that old fabled swan in music die   and now appear dim at first and distant but brightening and nearing fast many a right good fellow and many a right good horse  i know three out of four of them their private histories the private histories of their horses  and could tell you many a good story of them  but shall not being an english gentleman and not an american litterateur  they may not all be very clever or very learned or very anything except gallant men but they are all good enough company for me or anyone and each has his own specialite for which i like him  that huntsman i have known for fifteen years and sat many an hour beside his fathers deathbed  i am godfather to that whips child  i have seen the servants of the hunt as i have the hounds grow up round me for two generations and i feel for them as old friends and like to look into their brave honest weather beaten faces  that red coat there i knew him when he was a schoolboy and now he is a captain in the guards and won his victoria cross at inkermann  that bright green coat is the best farmer as well as the hardest rider for many a mile round one who plays as he works with all his might and might have been a beau sabreur and colonel of dragoons  so might that black coat who now brews good beer and stands up for the poor at the board of guardians and rides like the green coat as well as he works  that other black coat is a county banker but he knows more of the fox than the fox knows of himself and where the hounds are there will he be this day  that red coat has hunted kangaroo in australia that one as clever and good as he is brave and simple has stood by napiers side in many an indian fight  that one won his victoria at delhi and was cut up at lucknow with more than twenty wounds  that one hasbut what matter to you who each man is  enough that each can tell one a good story welcome one cheerfully and give one out here in the wild forest the wholesome feeling of being at home among friends  there is music again if you will listen in the soft tread of these hundred horsehoofs upon the spongy vegetable soil  they are trotting now in common time  you may hear the whole croats march the finest trotting march in the world played by those iron heels the time as it does in the croats march breaking now and then plunging jingling struggling through heavy ground bursting for a moment into a jubilant canter as it reaches a sound spot  the hounds feather a moment round malepartus puzzled by the windings of reineckes footsteps  you can hear the flap and snort of the dogs nostrils as they canter round and one likes it  it is exciting  but whywho can tell  what beautiful creatures they are too  next to a greek statue i mean a real old greek one for i am a thoroughly antipreraphaelite benighted pagan heathen in taste and intend some day to get up a cinquecento club for the total abolition of gothic artnext to a greek statue i say i know few such combinations of grace and strength as in a fine foxhound  it is the beauty of the theseus light and yet massive and light not in spite of its masses but on account of the perfect disposition of them  i do not care for grace in man woman or animal which is obtained as in the old german painters at the expense of honest flesh and blood  it may be all very pure and unearthly and saintly and what not but it is not healthy and therefore it is not really high art let it call itself such as much as it likes  the highest art must be that in which the outward is the most perfect symbol of the muward and therefore a healthy soul can be only exprest by a healthy body and starved limbs and a hydrocephalous forehead must be either taken as incorrect symbols of spiritual excellence or aswhat they were really meant forsymbols of certain spiritual diseases which were in the middle age considered as ecclesiastical graces and virtues wherefore i like pagan and naturalist art consider titian and correggio as unappreciated geniuses whose excellences the world will in some saner mood rediscover hold in direct opposition to rio that rafaelle improved steadily all his life through and that his noblest works are not his somewhat simpering madonnas and somewhat impish bambinos very lovely though they are but his great coarse naturalist protestant cartoons which with andrea mantegnas heathen triumph cromwell saved for the british nation  probably no one will agree with all this for the next quarter of a century  but after that i have hopes  the world will grow tired of pretending to admire manichaean pictures in an age of natural science and art will let the dead bury their dead and beginning again where michael angelo and rafaelle left off work forward into a nobler truer freer and more divine school than the world has yet seenat least so i hope  and all this has grown out of those foxhounds  why not  theirs is the sort of form which expresses to me what i want art to express nature not limited but developed by high civilization  the old savage ideal of beauty was the lion type of mere massive force that was succeeded by an overcivilized ideal say the fawn type of delicate grace  by cunning breeding and choosing through long centuries man has combined both and has created the foxhound lion and fawn in one just as he might create noble human beings did he take half as much trouble about politics in the true old sense of the word as he does about fowls  look at that old hound who stands doubtful looking up at his master for advice  look at the severity delicacy lightness of every curve  his head is finer than a deers his hind legs tense as steel springs his forelegs straight as arrows  and yet see the depth of chest the sweep of loin the breadth of paw the mass of arm and thigh and if you have an eye for form look at the absolute majesty of his attitude at this moment majesty is the only word for it  if he were six feet high instead of twentythree inches with what animal on earth could you compare him  is it not a joy to see such a thing alive  it is to me at least  i should like to have one in my study all day long as i would have a statue or a picture and when mr morrell gave as they say two hundred guineas for hercules alone i believe the dog was well worth the money only to look at  but i am a minute philosopher  i cap them on to the spot at which reinecke disappeared  old virginals stern flourishes instantly her pace quickens  one whimper and she is away fullmouthed through the wood and the pack after her  but not i  i am not going with them  my hunting days are over  let it suffice that i have in the days of my vanity drank delight of battle with my peers far on the ringing plains of many a county grass and forest down and vale  no my gallant friends  you know that i could ride if i chose and i am vain enough to be glad that you know it  but useless are your coaxings solicitations wavings of honest right hands  life as my friend tom brown says is not all beer and skittles it is past two now and i have four old women to read to at three and an old man to bury at four and i think on the whole that you will respect me the more for going home and doing my duty  that i should like to see this fox fairly killed or even fairly lost i deny not  that i should like it as much as i can like any earthly and outward thing i deny not  but sugar to ones bread and butter is not good and if my wintergarden represent the bread and butter then will foxhunting stand to it in the relation of superfluous and unwholesome sugar  so farewell and long may your noble sport prosperthe image of war with only half its danger to train you and your sons after into gallant soldiersfull of   the reason firm the temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill   so homeward i go through a labyrinth of firstems and what is worse firstumps which need both my eyes and my horses at every moment and woe to the anchorite as old bunbury names him who carries his nose in the air and his fore feet well under him  woe to the self willed or hardhided horse who cannot take the slightest hint of the heel and wince hind legs or fore out of the way of those jagged points which lie in wait for him  woe in fact to all who are clumsy or cowardly or in anywise not masters of the situation  pleasant riding it is though if you dare look anywhere but over your horses nose under the dark roof between the red firpillars in that rich subdued light  now i plunge into a gloomy dell wherein is no tinkling rivulet ever pure but instead a bog hewn out into a chessboard of squares parted by deep narrow ditches some twenty feet apart  blundering among the stems i go fetlockdeep in peat and jumping at every third stride one of the said uncanny gripes half hidden in long hassock grass  oh aira caespitosa most stately and most variable of british grasses why will you always grow where you are not wanted  through you the mare all but left her hind legs in that last gripe  through you a redcoat ahead of me avoiding one of your hassocks jumped with his horses nose full butt against a firstem and stopped   as one that is struck dead by lightning ere he falls   as we shall soon in spite of the mares cleverness  would we were out of this  out of it we shall be soon  i see daylight ahead at last bright between the dark stems  up a steep slope and over a bank which is not very big but being composed of loose gravel and peat mould gives down with me nearly sending me head over heels in the heather and leaving me a sheer gap to scramble through and out on the open moor  grand old moor stretching your brown flats right away toward windsor for many a milefar to our right is the new wellington college looking stately enough here all alone in the wilderness in spite of its two ugly towers and pinched waist  close over me is the long firfringed ride of easthampstead ending suddenly in caesars camp and hounds and huntsmen are already far ahead and racing up the roman road which the clods of these parts unable to give a better account of it call the devils highway  racing indeed for as reinecke gallops up the narrow heatherfringed pathway he brushes off his scent upon the twigs at every stride and the hounds race after him showing no head indeed and keeping for convenience in one long line upon the track  but going heads up sterns down at a pace which no horse can followi only hope they may not overrun the scent  they have overrun it halt and put their heads down a moment  but with one swift cast in fall gallop they have hit it off again fifty yards away in the heather long ere the horsemen are up to them for those hounds can hunt a fox because they are not hunted themselves and so have learnt to trust themselves and act for themselves as boys should learn at school even at the risk of a mistake or two now they are showing head indeed down a halfcleared valley and over a few ineffectual turnips withering in the peat a patch of growing civilization in the heart of the wilderness and then over the brook while i turn slowly away through a green wilderness of selfsown firs  there they stand in thousands the sturdy scots colonizing the desert in spite of frost and gales and barrenness and clustering together too as scotsmen always do abroad little and big every one under his neighbours lee according to the good old proverb of their native land caw me and ill caw thee  i respect them those scotch firs  i delight in their forms from james the firsts gnarled giants up in bramshill parkthe only place in england where a painter can learn what scotch firs aredown to the little green pyramids which stand up out of the heather triumphant over tyranny and the strange woes of an untoward youth seven years on an average have most of them spent in ineffectual efforts to become a foot high  nibbled off by hares trodden down by cattle cut down by turfparers seeing hundreds of their brethren cut up and carried off in the turffuel they are as gnarled and stubbed near the ground as an old thornbush in a pasture  but they have conquered at last and are growing away eighteen inches a year with fair green brushes silvertipt reclothing the wilderness with a vegetation which it has not seen forhow many thousand years  no man can tell  for when last the scotch fir was indigenous to england and mixed with the larch stretched in one vast forest from norfolk into wales england was not as it is now  snowdon was it may be fifteen thousand feet in height and from the edges of its glaciers the marmot and the musk ox the elk and the bear wandered down into the lowlands and the hyena and the lion dwelt in those caves where fox and badger only now abide  and how did the scotch fir die out  did the whole land sink slowly from its subalpine elevation into a warmer climate below  or was it never raised at all  did some change of the atlantic seafloor turn for the first time the warm gulf stream to these shores and with its soft sea breezes melt away the age of ice till glaciers and pines marmots and musk oxen perspired to death and vanished for an aeon  who knows  not i  but of the fact there can be no doubt  whether as we hold traditionally here the scotch fir was reintroduced by james the first when he built bramshill for raleighs hapless pet henry the prince or whatever may have been the date of their re introduction here they are and no one can turn them out  in countless thousands the winged seeds float down the southwest gales from the older trees and every seed which falls takes root in ground which however unable to bear broadleaved trees is ready by long rest for the seeds of the needleleaved ones  thousands perish yearly but the eastward march of the whole up hill and down dale is sure and steady as that of lynceus goths in goethes helena   ein lang und breites volkegewicht der erate wusste vom letzen nicht  der erste fiel der zweite stand des dritten lanze war zur hand ein jeder hundertfach gestarkt erschlagene tausend unbemerkt     till as you stand upon some eminence you see stretching to the eastward of each tract of older trees a long cloud of younger ones like a green comets taili wish their substance was as yielding this day  truly beautifulgrand indeed to me it isto see young live nature thus carrying on a great savage process in the heart of this old and seemingly allartificial english land and reproducing here as surely as in the australian bush a native forest careless of mankind  still i wish it were easier to ride through  stiff are those scotchmen and close and stout they stand by each other and claw at you as you twist through them the biggest aiming at your head or even worse at your knees while the middlesized slip their brushes between your thigh and the saddle and the little babies tickle your horses stomach or twine about his forefeet  whish whish we are enveloped in what seems an atmosphere of scrubbing brushes  fain would i shut my eyes  but dare not or i shall ride against a tree  whishwhish alas for the horse which cannot wind and turn like a hare  plungestagger  what is this  a broad line of ruts perhaps some celtic trackway two thousand years old now matted over with firs dangerous enough out on the open moor when only masked by a line of higher and darker heath  but doubly dangerous now when masked by dark undergrowth  you must find your own way here mare  i will positively have nothing to do with it  i disclaim all responsibility  there are the reins on your neck do what you will only do somethingand if you can get forward and not back  there is daylight at last and fresh air  i trot contemptuously through the advanced skirmishers of the scotch invading army and watch my friends some mile and a half off who have threaded a practicable trackway through a long dreary yellow bog too wet for firs to root in and are away in a streamer  now a streamer is produced in this wise  there is but one possible gap in a bank one possible ford in a brook one possible path in a cover and as each man has to wait till the man before him gets through and them gallops on each man loses twenty yards or more on the man before him  wherefore by all laws of known arithmetic if ten men tail through a gap then will the last of the ten find himself two hundred yards behind the foremost which process several times repeated produces the phenomenon called a streamer viz twenty men galloping absurdly as hard as they can in a line half a mile long and in humours which are celestial in the few foremost contented in the central and gradually becoming darker in the hindmost till in the last man they assume a hue altogether tartarean  farewell brave gentlemen  i watch half sadly half selfcontented the red coats scattered like sparks of fire over hill and dale and turn slowly homeward to visit my old women  i pass through a gateway out upon a village green planted with rows of oaks surrounded by trim sunny cottages a pleasant oasis in the middle of the wilderness  across the village cricketgroundwe are great cricketers in these parts and long may the good old game live among us and then up another hollow lane which leads between damp shaughs and copses toward the further moor  curious things to a minute philosopher are these same hollow lanes they set him on archaeological questions more than he can solve and i meditate as i go how many centuries it took to saw through the warm sandbanks this dyke ten feet deep up which he trots with the oak boughs meeting over his head  was it ever worth mens while to dig out the soil  surely not  the old method must have been to remove the softer upper spit till they got to tolerably hard ground and then macadams metal being as yet unknown the rains and the wheels of generations sawed it gradually deeper and deeper till this roadditch was formed  but it must have taken centuries to do it many of these hollow lanes especially those on flat ground must be as old or older than the conquest  in devonshire i am sure that they are  but there many of them one suspects were made not of malice but of cowardice prepense  your indigenous celt was one fears a sneaking animal and liked to keep when he could under cover of banks and hillsides while your bold roman made his raised roads straight over hill and dale as ridgeways from which as from an eagles eyrie he could survey the conquered lowlands far and wide  it marks strongly the difference between the two races that difference between the roman paved road with its established common way for all passengers its regular stations and milestones and the celtic trackway winding irresolutely along in innumerable ruts parting to meet again as if each savage for they were little better had taken his own fresh path when he found the next line of ruts too heavy for his cattle  around the spurs of dartmoor i have seen many ancient roads some of them long disused which could have been hollowed out for no other purpose but that of concealment  so i go slowly up the hill till the valley lies beneath me like a long green garden between its two banks of brown moor and on through a cheerful little green with red brick cottages scattered all round each with its large neat garden and beehives and pigs and geese and turfstack and clipt yews and hollies before the door and rosy darkeyed children and all the simple healthy comforts of a wild hethcroppers home  when he can the good man of the house works at farm labour or cuts his own turf and when work is scarce he cuts copses and makes heathbrooms and does a little poaching true he seldom goes to church save to be christened married or buried  but he equally seldom gets drunk  for church and public stand together two miles off so that social wants sometimes bring their own compensations with them and there are two sides to every question  hark  a faint dreary hollo off the moor above  and then another and another  my friends may trust it for the clod of these parts delights in the chase like any barelegged paddy and casts away flail and fork wildly to run shout assist and interfere in all possible ways out of pure love  the descendant of many generations of broomsquires and deerstealers the instinct of sport is strong within him still though no more of the kings deer are to be shot in the winter turnipfields or worse caught by an applebaited hook hung from an orchard bough  he now limits his aspirations to hares and pheasants and too probably once in his life hits the keeper into the river and reconsiders himself for a while after over a crank in winchester gaol  well he has his faults and i have mine but he is a thorough good fellow nevertheless quite as good as i civil contented industrious and often very handsome and a far shrewder fellow tooowing to his dash of wild forest blood from gipsy highwayman and what notthan his bulletheaded and flaxen polled cousin the pure southsaxon of the chalkdowns  darkhaired he is ruddy and tall of bone swaggering in his youth but when he grows old a thorough gentleman reserved stately and courteous as a prince  sixteen years have i lived with him hail fellow well met and never yet had a rude word or action from him  with him i have cast in my lot to live and die and be buried by his side and to him i go home contented to look after his petty interests cares sorrowspetty trulyseeing that they include the whole primal mysteries of lifefood raiment and work to earn them withal love and marriage birth and death right doing and wrong doing schicksal und eigene schuld and all those commonplaces of humanity which in the eyes of a minute philosopher are most divine because they are most commonplacecatholic as the sunshine and the rain which come down from the heavenly father alike upon the evil and the good  as for doing fine things my friend with you i have learnt to believe that i am not set to do fine things simply because i am not able to do them and as for seeing fine things with you i have learnt to see the sightas well as to try to do the dutywhich lies nearest me and to comfort myself with the fancy that if i make good use of my eyes and brain in this life i shall seeif it be of any use to meall the fine things or perhaps finer still in the life to come  but if notwhat matter  in any life in any state however simple or humble there will be always sufficient to occupy a minute philosopher and if a man be busy and busy about his duty what more does he require for time or for eternity    v  from ocean to sea    the point from which to start in order best to appreciate the change from ocean to sea is perhaps biarritz  the point at which to stop is cette  and the change is important  between the two points races are changed climates are changed scenery is changed the very plants under your feet are changed from a western to an eastern type  you pass from the wild atlantic into the heart of the roman empirefrom the influences which formed the discoverers of the new world to those which formed the civilizers of the old  gascony not only in its scenery but in its very legends reminds you of devon and cornwall languedoc of greece and palestine  in the sea as was to be expected the change is even more complete from biarritz to cette you pass from poor edward forbess atlantic to his mediterranean centre of creation  in plain english and fact whether you agree with his theory or not you pass from the region of respectable whales herrings and salmon to that of tunnies sciaenas dorados and all the gorgons hydras and chimaeras dire which are said to grace the fishmarkets of barcelona or marseilles  but to this assertion as to most concerning nature there are exceptions  mediterranean fishes slip out of the straits of gibraltar and up the coast of portugal and once in the bay of biscay find the feeding good and the wind against them and stay there  so it befalls that at worthy m garderes hotel at biarritz he has seen service in england and knows our english ways you may have at dinner day after day salmon louvine shad sardine dorado tunny the first is unknown to the mediterranean for fluellen mistook when he said that there were salmons in macedon as well as monmouth the louvine is none other than the nasty bass or seaperch of the atlantic the shad extinct in these islands save in the severn is a gigantic herring which comes up rivers to spawn a fish common with slight differences to both sides of the north atlantic while the sardine the dorado and the tunny whether he be the true tunny or the alalonga are mediterranean fish  the whale fishery of these shores is long extinct  the biscayan whale was supposed to be extinct likewise  but like the ibex and some other animals which man has ceased to hunt because he fancies that he has killed them all they seem inclined to reappear  for in 1854 one was washed ashore near st jean de luz at news whereof eschricht the great danish naturalist travelled night and day from copenhagen and secured the skeleton of the newold monster  but during the latter part of the middle ages and onif i recollect arightinto the seventeenth century bayonne biarritz guettary and st jean de luz sent forth their hardy whalefishers who slew all the whales of the biscayan seas and then crossed the atlantic to attack those of the frozen north  british and american enterprise drove them from the west coast of the atlantic and now their descendants are content to stay at home and take the sardineshoals and send them in to bayonne on their daughters heads  pretty enough it was at least in outward seeming to meet a party of those fishergirls barelegged highkilted lithe as deer trotting at a long loping pace up the high road toward bayonne each with her basket on her head as she laughed and sang and tossed her black hair and flashed her brown eyes full of life and the enjoyment of life  pretty enough  and yet who will blame the rail which now sends her quickly into bayonneor even her fish without her and relieves the fair young maiden from being degraded into a beast of burden  handsome folk are these brown basques  a mysterious people who dwell alone and are not counted among the nations speaking an unique language and keeping up unique customs for which the curious must consult m michels interesting book  there may be a cross of english blood among them too about biarritz and bayonne english features there are plainly to be seen  and whether or not one accepts the story of the country that anglets near by is an old english colony left by our black prince it is certain that bayonne cathedral was built in part by english architects and carries the royal arms of england and every school history will tell us how this corner of france was long in our hands and was indeed english long before it was properly french  moorish blood there may be too here and there left behind by those who built the little atalaya or firebeacon over the old harbour to correspond by its smoke column with a long line of similar beacons down the spanish coast the basques resemble in look the southern welshquickeyed neat in feature neat in dress often both men and women beautiful  the men wear a flat scotch cap of some bright colour and call it berretta  the women tie a gaudy handkerchief round their heads and compel one corner to stand forward from behind the ear in a triangle in proportion to the size and stiffness whereof the lady seems to think herself well dressed  but the pretty basque handkerchief will soon give place to the parisian bonnet  for every cove among the rocks is now filled with smart bathinghouses from which in summer the gay folk of paris issue in costume de bain to float about all day on calabasheshaving literally no room for the soles of their feet on land  then are opened casinos theatre shops which lie closed all the winter  then do the basque house owners flee into the moors and camp out it is said on the hills all night letting their rooms for ten francs a night as mere bed chambersfor all eating and living is performed in public while the dovecoloured oxen with brown holland pinafores over their backs who dawdle in pairs up and down the long street with their light carts have to make way for wondrous equipages from the bois de boulogne  not then for the wise man is biarritz a place to see and to love but in the winter when a little knot of quiet pleasant english hold the place against all comers and wander undisturbed by fashion about the quaint little rocks and caves and natural bridgesand watch tumbling into the sea before the biscayan surges the trim walks and summerhouses which were erected by the municipality in honour of the empress and her suite  yearly they tumble in and yearly are renewed as the soft greensand strata are graven away and what must have been once a long promontory becomes a group of fantastic pierced rocks exactly like those which are immortalized upon the willowpattern plates  owing to this rapid destruction the rocks of biarritz are very barren in seabeasts and seaweeds  but there is one remarkable exception where the pools worn in a hard limestone are filled with what seem at first sight beds of chinaasters of all loveliest coloursprimrose seagreen dove purple crimson pink ashgrey they are all prickly seaeggs presumably the echinus lividus which is found in similar places in the west of ireland each buried for life in a cupshaped hole which he has excavated in the rock and shut in by an overhanging lip of living limeseemingly a nullipore coralline  what they do there what they think of or what food is brought into their curious grindingmills by the atlantic surges which thunder over them twice a day who can tell  however they form without doubt the most beautiful object which i have ever seen in pool or cove  but the glory of biarritz after all is the moors above and the view to be seen therefrom  under blazing blue skies tempered by soft dappled cloud for ever sliding from the atlantic and the asturias mountains in a climate soft as milk and exhilarating withal as wine one sees far and wide a panorama which from its variety as well as its beauty can never weary  to the north the long sandline of the biscayan shorethe bar of the adour marked by a cloud of grey spray  then the dark pineflats of the landes and the towers of bayonne rising through rich woods to the eastward lies a high country furred with woods broken with glens a country exactly like devon through the heart of which hidden in such a gorge as that of dart or taw runs the swift stream of the nive draining the western pyrenees  and beyond to the southeast in early spring the pyrenean snows gleam bright white clouds above the clouds  as one turns southward the mountains break down into brown heatherhills like scottish grouse moors  the two nearest and seemingly highest are the famous rhune and bayonette where lie to this day amid the heath and crags hundreds of unburied bones  for those great hills skilfully fortified by soult before the passage of the bidassoa were stormed yard by yard by wellingtons army in october 1813  that mighty deed must be read in the pages of one who saw it with his own eyes and fought there with his own noble body and even nobler spirit  it is not for me to tell of victories of which sir william napier has already told  towards that hill and the nivelle at its foot the land slopes down still wooded and broken bounded by a long sweep of clayey crumbling cliff  the eye catches the fort of secoa at the mouth of the nivelleonce wellingtons seabase for his great french campaign then fontarabia at the bidassoa mouth and far off the cove within which lies the fatal citadel of st sebastian all backed up by the fantastic mountains of spain the fourhorned quatre couronnes the pyramidal jaysquivel and beyond them again sloping headlong into the sea peak after peak each one more blue and tender than the one before leading the eye on and on for seemingly countless leagues till they die away into the ocean horizon and the boundless west not a sail often for days together passes between those mountains and the shore on which we stand to break the solitude and peace and vast expanse and we linger looking and looking at we know not what and find repose in gazing purposeless into the utter void  very unlike france are these basque uplands very like the seaward parts of devon and cornwall  large oakcopses and boggy meadows fill the glens while above the small fields with their fivebarred gates relics of the english occupation and high furze and heath grown banks make you fancy yourself for a moment in england  and the illusion is strengthened as you see that the heath of the banks is the goonhilly heath of the lizard point and that of the bogs the orangebelled erica ciliaris which lingers though rare both in cornwall and in the south of ireland  but another glance undeceives you  the wild flowers are new saving those cosmopolitan seeds like nettles and poppies which the romans have carried all over europe and the british are now carrying over the world  every sandy bank near the sea is covered with the creeping stems of a huge reed which grows in summer tall enough to make not only high fences but fishingrods  poverty though there is none of what we call poverty in britain fills the little walled court before its cottage with bay trees and standard figs while wealth though there is nothing here of what we call wealth in britain asserts itself uniformly by great standard magnolias and rich trailing roses in full bloom here in april instead ofas with usin july  both on bank and in bog grow scorzoneras dandelions with swordshaped leaves of which there are none in these isles and every common is ablaze with strange and lovely flowers  each dry spot is brilliant with the azure flowers of a prostrate lithospermum so exquisite a plant that it is a marvel why we do not see it as springbedding in every british garden the heath is almost hidden in places by the large white flowers and trailing stems of the sageleaved cistus  delicate purple ixias and yet more delicate hooppetticoat narcissus spring from the turf and here and there among furze and heath crop out great pink bunches of the daphne cneorum of our gardens perfuming all the air  yes we are indeed in foreign parts in the very home of that atlantic flora of which only a few species have reached the southwest of these isles and on the limit of another flora alsoof that of italy and greece  for as we descend into the glen every lanebank and low tree is entwined not with ivy but with a still more beautiful evergreen the smilax of southeastern europe with its zigzag stems and curving heartshaped leaves and hooked thorns the very oak scrub is of species unknown to britain  and what are these tall lilies which fill every glade breasthigh with their swordlike leaves and spires of white flowers lilacpencilled  they are the classic flower the asphodel of greece and grecian song the asphodel through which the ghosts of homers heroes strode  as heroes ghosts might stride even here  for here we are on sacred ground  the vegetation is rank with the blood of gallant invaders and of no less gallant patriots  in the words of campbells hohenlinden    every turf beneath our feet may be a heros sepulchre   that little tarn below has bubbled with crimson foam when the kings of europe arose to bring home the bourbons as did the lake regillus of old in the day when the thirty cities swore to bring the tarquins home  turn to the left above the tarn and into the great spanish road from bayonne to the frontier at what was lately la negresse but is now a gay railway station  where that station is was another tarn now drained  the road ran between the two  and that narrow space of two hundred yards on which we stand was for three fearful days the gate of france  for on the 10th of december 1813 soult driven into bayonne by wellingtons advance rushed out again in the early morn and poured a torrent of living men down this road and upwards again towards the british army which crested that long ridge in front  the ridge slopes rapidly away at the back toward the lowlands of the bidassoa and once thrust from it the english army would have been cut in twoone half driven back upon their seabase at st jean de luz  the other half left on the further side of the adour  and this was the gate which had to be defended during a three days battle  that long copse which overhangs the road is the famous wood which was taken and retaken many times  you house above it embowered in trees is the mayors house in which sir john hope was so nearly captured by the french  somewhere behind the lane where we came down was the battery which blasted off our troops as they ran up from the lowlands behind to support their fellows  of the details of the fight you must read in napiers peninsular war and in mr gleigs subaltern  they are not to be described by one who never saw a battle great or small  and now if you choose to start upon your journey from the ocean to the sea you will take the railroad here and run five miles through the battlefields into bayonne the quaint old fortress city girdled with a labyrinth of walls and turfdykes and outside them meadows as rich and trees as stately as if war had never swept across the land  you may stop if you will to look at the tall spanish houses with their piazzas and jalousies and the motley populace french basques spaniards jews and most worth seeing of all the lovely ladies of bayonne who swarm out when the sun goes down for air and military music  you may try to find in which you will probably fail the arms of england in the roof of the ugly old cathedral you may wander the bridges over which join the three quarters of the city for the adour and the nive meet within the walls and probably lose your waya slight matter among folk who if you will but take off your hat call them monsieur apologize for the trouble you are giving begin the laugh at your own stupidity and compliment them on their city and their fair ladies will be delighted to walk a mile out of their own way to show you yours  you will gaze up at the rockrooted citadel from whence in the small hours of april 14 1813 after peace was agreed on but unhappily not declared for napier has fully exculpated the french generals three thousand of thouvenots men burst forth against sir john hopes unsuspecting besiegers with a furious valour which cost the english more than 800 men  there in the pine woods on the opposite side is the boucault where our besieging army lay  across the reach below stretched sir john hopes famous bridge and as you leave bayonne by rail you run beneath the english cemetery where lie the soldiers officers of the coldstream guards among them who fell in the frenchmans last struggle to defend his native land  but enough of this  i should not have recalled to mind one of these battles had they not one and all been as glorious for the french and their great captainwearied with long marches disheartened by the apathy of their own countrymen and as they went on overpowered by mere numbersas they were for our veterans and wellington himself  and now once through bayonne we are in the pignadas and the landes  to form a conception of these famous landes it is only necessary to run down by the southwestern railway through the moors of woking or ascot spread them out flat and multiply them to seeming infinity the same sea of brown heather broken only by the same dark pignadas or fir plantations extends for nigh a hundred miles and when the traveller northward has lost sight first of the spanish mountains and then of the pyrenean snows he seems to be rushing along a brown ocean without wave or shore  only instead of the three heaths of surrey and hants the same species as those of scotland larger and richer southern heaths cover the grey sands and notably the delicate upright spires of the bruyere or erica scoparia which grows full six feet high and furnishes from its roots those bruyere pipes which british shopkeepers have rechristened briarroots  instead again of the scotch firs of ascot the pines are all pinasters miscalled p maritima  each has the same bent stem carrying at top long ragged scanty leaftufts instead of the straight stem and dense short foliage of the sturdier scotchman and down each stem runs a long fresh scar and at the bottom in spring at least hangs a lip of tin and a neat earthen pipkin into which distils turpentine as clear as glass  the trees have mostly been planted within the last fifty years to keep the drifting sands from being blown away  as timber they are about as valuable as those jersey cowcabbage stalks of which the curious will at times make walking sticks  but as producers of turpentine they have their use and give employment to the sad stunted illfed folk unhealthy for want of water and barbarous from utter loneliness whose only employment in old times was the keeping ragged flocks about the moors  few and far between the natives may be seen from the railway seemingly hung high in air till on nearer approach you find them to be stalking along on stilts or standing knitting on the same a sheepskin over their shoulders an umbrella strapped to their side and stuck into the small of the back a long crutch which serves when resting as a third wooden leg  so run on the landes mile after mile station after station varied only by an occasional stunted cork tree or a starved field of barley or maize  but the railroad is bringing to them as elsewhere labour civilization agricultural improvement  pretty villages orchards gardens are springing up round the lonely gares  the late emperor helped forward it is said new pine plantations and sundry schemes for reclaiming the waste  arcachon on a pinefringed lagoon of the atlantic has great artificial ponds for oyster breeding and is rising into a gay wateringplace with a distinguished scientific society  nay more  it saw a few years since an international exposition of fish and fishculture and fishingtackle and all things connected with the fisheries not only of europe but of america likewise  heaven speed the plan and restore thereby oysters to our shores and shad and salmon to the rivers both of western europe and eastern north america  as for the cause of the landes it may be easily divined by the help of a map and of common sense  the gironde and the adour carry to the sea the drainage of nearly a third of france including almost all the rain which falls on the north side of the pyrenees  what has become of all the sand and mud which has been swept in the course of ages down their channels  what has becomea very small part be it recollected of the whole amountof all the rock which has been removed by rain and thunder frost and snow in the process of scooping out the deep valleys of the pyrenees  out of that one crack which men call the val dossau stone has been swept enough to form a considerable island  where is it all  in these landes  carried down year by year to the atlantic it has been driven back again year by year by the fierce gales of the bay of biscay and rolled up into banks and dunes of loose sand till it has filled up what was once a broad estuary 140 miles across and perhaps 70 miles in depth  upheaved it may have been also slowly from the sea for recent seashells are found as far inland as dax and thus the whole upper end of the bay of biscay has transformed itself during the lapse of it may be countless ages into a desolate wilderness  it is at dax that we leave the main line and instead of running north for bordeaux and the land of clarets turn southeast to orthez and pau and the gaves and the pyrenees  and now we pass through ragged uplands woody and moorish with the long yellow maizestalks of last years crop rotting in the swampy glens  for the petite culture whatever be its advantages gives no capital or power of combined action for draining wet lands and the valleys of gascony and bearn in the south as well as great sheets of the pas de calais in the north are in a waterlogged state equally shocking to the eye of a british farmer and injurious to the health and to the crops of the peasants  soon we strike the adour here of the shape and size of a second class scotch salmonstream with swirling brown pools beneath grey crags which make one long to try in them the virtues of jock scott the butcher or the dusty miller  and perhaps not without effect for salmon are there still and will be more and more as french pisciculture develops itself under government supervision  here we touch again the line of that masterly retreat of soults before the superior forces of wellington to which napier has done such ample and deserved justice  there is berenz where the sixth and light divisions crossed the gave and clambered into the high road up steep ravines and there is orthez itself with the beautiful old gothic bridge which the french could not blow up as they did every other bridge on their retreat and the ruins of that robber den to which gaston phoebus count of foix of whom you may read in froissart used to drag his victims and there overhead upon the left of the rail and road is the old roman camp and the hill of orthez and st boes and the high church of baights the scene of the terrible battle of orthez  the roman camp then open and grassy with a few trees says napier is now covered with vineyards  everywhere the fatal slopes are rich with cultivation plenty and peace  god grant they may remain so for ever  and so along the gave de pau we run on to pau the ancient capital of bearn the birthplace of henri quatre and of bernadotte king of sweden where in the charming old chateau restored by louis philippe those who list may see the tortoise which served as the great henrys cradle and believe if they list also the tale that that is the real shell  for in 1793 when the knights of the bonnet rouge and carmagnole complete burst into the castle to destroy every memorial of hated royalty the shell among the rest there chancedmiraculous coincidenceto be in pau in the collection of a naturalist another shell of the same shape and size  swiftly and deftly pious hands substituted it for the real relic leaving it to be battered in pieces and trampled in the mud while the royal cradle lay perdu for years in the roof of a house to reappear duly at the restoration of the bourbons  of pau i shall say nothing  it would be real impertinence in one who only spent three days in it to describe a city which is known to all europe which is a permanent english colony and boasts of one and sometimes two packs of english foxhounds  but this i may be allowed to say  that of all delectable spots i have yet seen pau is the most delectable  of all the landscapes which i have beheld that from the place royale is for variety richness and grandeur the most glorious at least as i saw it for the first time  beneath the wall of the high terrace are rich meadows vocal with frogs rejoicing in the rain and expressing their joy not in the sober monotone of our english frogs but each according to his kind one bellowing the next barking the next cawing and the next probably the little green hylas who has come down out of the trees to breed quacking in treble like a tiny drake  the bark i suspect is that of the gorgeous edible frog and so suspect the young recruits who lounge upon the wall and look down wistfully longing i presume to eat him  and quite right they are for he at least his thigh is exceeding good to eat tenderer and sweeter than any spring chicken  beyond the meadow among the poplars the broad gave murmurs on over shingly shallows between aspenfringed islets grey with the melting snows and beyond her again rise broken wooded hills dotted with handsome houses and beyond them a veil of mist and rain  on a sudden that veil lifts and fiveandtwenty miles away beneath the black edge of the cloud against the clear blue sky stands out the whole snowrange of the pyrenees and in the midst exactly opposite filling up a vast gap which is the val dossau the huge cone still snowy white of the pic du midi  he who is conversant with theatres will be unable to overlook the seeming artand even artificeof such an effect  the clouds lift like a dropscene the mountains are so utterly unlike any natural object in the north that for the moment one fancies them painted and not real the pic du midi stands so exactly where it ought and is yet so fantastic and unexpected in its shape that an artist seems to have put it there  but lie who knows nothing and cares less about theatres and their sham glories and sees for the first time in his life the eternal snows of which he has read since childhood draws his breath deeply and stands astounded whispering to himself that god is great  one hint more ere we pass on from pau  here at least in spring time of all places in europe may a man feed his ears with song of birds  the copses by the gave the public walks and woods wherein english prejudices have happily protected what is elsewhere shot down as game even to the poor little cockrobins whose corpses lie by dozens in too many french markets are filled with all our english birds of passage finding their way northwards from morocco and algiers and with our english nightingales blackcaps willowwrens and whitethroats are other songsters which never find their way to these isles for which you must consult the pages of mr gould or mr breeand chief among them the dark orpheus and the yellow hippolais surpassing the blackcap and almost equalling the nightingale for richness and variety of songthe polyglot warbler which penetrates in summer as far north as the shores of the british channel and there stops short scared by the twenty miles of sea after a land journeyand by night too as all the warblers journeyfrom africa  at pau the railroad ended when i was there and who would go eastward had to take carriage and go by the excellent road all public roads in the south of france are excellent and equal to our best english roads over the high landes to tarbes and on again over fresh landes to montrejeau and thence by railway to toulouse  they are very dreary these high flat uplands from which innumerable streams pour down to swell the adour and the garonne and as one rolls along listening to the eternal tinkle of the horsebells only two roadside objects are particularly worthy of notice  first the cultivation spreading rapidly since the revolution over what was open moor and next the great natural parks which one traverses here and there the remnants of those forests which were once sacred to the seigneurs and their field sports  the seigneurs are gone now and the game with them and the forests are almost goneso ruinate indeed by the peasantry that the government i believe has interfered to stop a destruction of timber which involves the destruction both of firewood and of the annual fall of rain  but the trees which remain whether in forest or in homestead are sadly mangled  the winters are sharp in these high uplands and firing scarce and the country method of obtaining it is to send a woman up a tree where she hacks off with feeble arms and feeble tools boughs halfway out from the stem disfiguring and in time destroying by letting the wet enter splendid southern oaks chestnuts and walnuts  painful and hideous to an eye accustomed to british parks are the forms of these once noble trees  suddenly we descend a brow into the yale of tarbes  a good land and large a labyrinth of clear streams watermeadows cherryorchards and crops of every kind and in the midst the pleasant old city with its once famous university  of tarbes you may read in the pages of froissartor if you prefer a later authority in those of dumas trois mousquetaires for this is the native land of the immortal ulysses of gascony the chevalier dartagnan  there you may see to your surprise not only gentlemen but ladies taking their pleasure on horseback after the english fashion for there is close by a great haras or government establishment for horsebreeding  you may watch the quaint dresses in the marketplace you may rest as froissart rested of old in a right pleasant inn you may eat of the delicious cookery which is to be found even in remote towns throughout the south of france and evenif you dare of coquilles aux champignons  you may sit out after dinner in that delicious climate listening to the rush of the clear adour through streets and yards and culverts for the city like romsey or salisbury is built over many streams  you may watch the pyrenees changing from white to rose from rose to lead colour and then dying away into the nightfor twilight there is little or none here in the far south   the suns rim dips the stars rush out at one stride comes the dark   and soon from street to street you hear the clarion of the garrison that singularly wild and sweet trumpetcall which sends french soldiers to their beds  and at that the whole populace swarms out rich and poor and listens entranced beneath the trees in the place maubourguet as if they had never heard it before with an order and a sobriety and a good humour and a bowing to each other and asking and giving of cigarlights between men of every classand a little quiet modest lovemaking on the outskirts of the crowd which is very pleasant to behold  and when the music is silent and the people go off suddenly silently and soberly withal for there are no drunkards in these parts to their early beds you stand and look up into the purple night as homer calls itthat southern sky intensely dark and yet transparent withal through which you seem to look beyond the stars into the infinite itself and recollect that beyond all that and through all that likewise there is an infinite good god who cares for all these simple kindly folk and that by him all their hearts are as well known and all their infirmities as mercifully weighed as are you trust your own  and so you go to rest content to say with the wise american it takes all sorts to make a world  the next morn you rise to roll on over yet more weary uplands to montrejeau over long miles of sandy heath a magnified aldershott which during certain summer months is gay here and there like aldershott with the tents of an army at play  but in spring the desolation is utter and the loneliest grousemoor and the boggiest burn are more cheerful and varied than the landes of lannemezan and the foul streamlets which have sawn gorges through the sandy waste  but all the while on your right hand league after league ever fading into blue sky behind you and growing afresh out of blue sky in front hangs high in air the white saw of the pyrenees  high i say in air for the land slopes or seems to slope down from you to the mountain range and all their roots are lost in a dim sea of purple haze  but shut out the snow line above and you will find that the seeming haze is none but really a clear and richly varied distance of hills and woods and towns which have become invisible from the contrast of their greens and greys and purples with the glare and dazzle of the spotless snows of spring  there they stand one straight continuous jagged wall of which no one point seems higher than another  from the pic dossau by the mont perdu and the maladetta to the pic de lart are peaks past countinghard clear white against the hard clear blue and blazing with keen light beneath the high southern sun  each peak carries its little pet cushion of cloud hanging motionless a few hundred yards above in the blue sky a row of them as far as eye can see  but ever and anon as afternoon draws on one of those little clouds seeming tired of waiting at its post ever since sunrise loses its temper boils swells settles down on its own private peak and explodes in a fierce thunderstorm down its own private valley without discomposing in the least its neighbour cloudcushions right and left  faintly the roll of the thunder reaches the ear  across some great blackness of cloud and cliff a tiny spark darts down  a long wisp of mist sweeps rapidly toward you across the lowlands and a momentary brush of cold rain lays the dust  and then the pageant is played out and the disturbed peak is left clear again in the blue sky for the rest of the day to gather another cloudcushion when to morrows sun shall rise  to him who looks day after day on this astonishing natural wall stretching without visible gap for nearly three hundred miles it is easy to see why france not only is but must be a different world from spain  even human thought cannot to any useful extent fly over that great wall of homeless rock and snow  on the other side there must needs be another folk with another tongue other manners other polities and if not another creed yet surely with other and utterly different conceptions of the universe and of mans business therein  railroads may do somewhat  but what of one railroad or even of two one on the ocean one on the sea two hundred and seventy miles apart  before french civilization can inform and elevate the spanish people you must plane down the pyrenees  at montrejeau a pretty town upon a hill which overhangs the garonne you find again verdure and a railroad and turning your back upon the pyrenees run down the rich ugly vale of the garonne through crops of exceeding richnesswheat which is reaped in july to be followed by buckwheat reaped in october then by green crops to be cut in may and that again by maize to be pulled in october and followed by wheat and the same rotation  thus you reach toulouse a noble city of which it ill befits a passerthrough to speak  volumes have been written on its antiquities and volumes on its history and all of either that my readers need know they will find in murrays handbook  at toulouseor rather on leaving it to go eastwardyou become aware that you have passed into a fresh region  the change has been of course gradual  but it has been concealed from you by passing over the chilly dreary uplands of lannemezan  now you find yourself at once in languedoc  you have passed from the atlantic region into the mediterranean from the old highlands of the wild vascones into those lowlands of gallia narbonensis reaching from the headwaters of the garonne to the mouths of the rhone which were said to be more italian than italy itself  the peculiarity of the district is its gorgeous colouring everywhere over rich plains you look away to low craggy banks of limestone the grey whereof contrasts strongly with the green of the lowland and with the even richer green of the mulberry orchards and beyond them again southward to the now distant snows of the pyrenees and northward to the orange downs and purple glens of the cevennes all blazing in the blazing sun  green grey orange purple and in the farthest distance blue as of the heaven itself make the land one vast rainbow and fit dwellingplace for its sunny folk still happy and industriousonce the most cultivated and luxurious people in europe  as for their industry it is hereditary  these lands were it may be as richly and carefully tilled in the days of augustus caesar as they are now or rather as they were at the end of the eighteenth century  for since then the delver and sowerfor centuries the slave of the roman and for centuries after the slave of teutonic or saracenic conquerorshas become his own master and his own landlord and an impulse has been given to industry which is shown by trim cottages gay gardens and fresh olive orchards pushed up into glens which in a state of nature would starve a goat  the special culture of the countrymore and more special as we run eastwardis that of the mulberry the almond and the olive  along every hillside down every glen lie orchardrows of the precious pollards  the mulberries are of richest dark velvet green the almonds one glory of rosecolour in early spring are now of a paler and colder green the olives as all the world knows of a dusty grey which looks all the more desolate in the pruning time of early spring when half the boughs of the evergreen are cut out leaving the trees stripped as by a tempest and are carried home for fire wood in the quaint little carts with their solid creaking wheels drawn by dovecoloured kine  very ancient are some of these olives or rather olivegroups  for when the tree grows old it splits and falls asunder as do often our pollard willows the bark heals over on the inside of each fragment and what was one tree becomes many springing from a single root and bearing such signs of exceeding age that one can well believe the country tale how in the olive grounds around nismes are still fruiting olives which have furnished oil for the fair roman dames who cooled themselves in the sacred fountain of nemausa in the days of the twelve caesars  between the pollard rows are everywhere the rows of vines or of what will be vines when summer comes but are now black knobbed and gnarled clubs without a sign of life save here and there one fat green shoot of leaf and tendril bursting forth from the seemingly dead stick  one who sees that sight may find a new meaning and beauty in the mystic words i am the vine ye are the branches  it is not merely the connection between branch and stem common to all trees not merely the exhilarating and seemingly inspiring properties of the grape which made the very heathens look upon it as the sacred and miraculous fruit the special gift of god not merely the pruning out of the unfruitful branches to be burned as firewood orafter the old roman fashion which i believe endures still in these parts buried as manure at the foot of the parent stem not merely these but the seeming death of the vine shorn of all its beauty its fruitfulness of every branch and twig which it had borne the year before and left unsightly and seemingly ruined to its winters sleep and then bursting forth again by an irresistible inward life into fresh branches spreading and trailing far and wide and tossing their golden tendrils to the sun  this thought surelythe emblem of the living church springing from the corpse of the dead christ who yet should rise and be alive for evermoreenters into it may be forms an integral part of the meaning of that prophecy of all prophecies  one ought to look with something of filial reverence on the agriculture of the district into which we are penetrating for it is the parent of our own  from hence or strictly speaking from the mediterranean shore beyond us spread northward and westward through france belgium and britain all the tillage which we knewat least till a hundred years agobeyond the primaeval plan of clearing or surfaceburning the forests growing miserable white crops as long as they would yield and then letting the land relapse for twenty years into miserable pasture  this process which lingered thirty years ago in remote parts of devon and nothing better seems to have been that change of cultivated lands which tacitus ascribes to the ancient germans  rotation of crops in any true sense came to us from provence and languedoc and with it subsoiling irrigation all our artificial grasses with lucerne at the head of the list our peas and beans some of our most important roots almost all our garden flowers vegetables fruits the fig the mulberry the vine the olive and the maize came with them from the east but dared go no further northand i know not what more till we may say that saving subsoildraining which their climate does not needthe ancestors of these good folks were better farmers fifteen hundred years ago than too many of our countrymen are at this day  so they toil and thrive and bless god under the glorious sun and as for rainthey have not had rain for these two monthsi speak of april 1864and though the white limestone dust is ankle deep on every road say that they want none for two months more thanks it is to be presumed to their deep tillage which puts the plantroots out of the reach of drought  in spring they feed their silkworms and wind their silk  in summer they reap their crops and hang the maizeheads from their rafters for their own winter food while they sell the wheat to the poor creatures objects of their pity who live in towns and are forced to eat white bread  from spring to autumn they have fruit and to spare for themselves and for their customers and with the autumn comes the vintage and all its classic revelries  a happy folkunder a happy clime which yet has its drawbacks like all climes on earth  terrible thunderstorms sweep over it hailladen killing battering drowning destroying in an hour the labours of the year and there are ugly mistral winds likewise of which it may be fairly said that he who can face an eight days mistral without finding his life a burden must be either a very valiant man or have neither liver nor mucous membrane  for on a sudden after still and burning weather the thermometer suddenly falls from thirty to forty degrees and out of the north west rushes a chilly hurricane blowing fiercer and fiercer each day toward nightfall and lulling in the small hours only to burst forth again at sunrise  parched are all lips and eyes for the air is full of dust yea even of gravel which cuts like hail  aching are all rightsides for the sudden chill brings on all manner of liver complaints and indigestions  all who can afford it draw tight the jalousies and sulk in darkness the leaves are parched as by an atlantic gale the air is filled with lurid haze as in an english northeast wind and no man can breathe freely or eat his bread with joy until the plague is past  what is the cause of these mistrals why all the cold air of central france should be suddenly seized with madness and rush into the sea between the alps and the pyrenees whether the great heat of the sun acting on the mediterranean basin raises up thenceas from the gulf of mexicocolumns of warm light air whose place has to be supplied by colder and heavier air from inland whether the northwest mistral is or is not a diverted northeaster an arctic current which in its right road toward the tropics across the centre of france has been called to the eastward of the pyrenees instead of as usual to the westward by the sudden demand for cold airall this let men of science decide and having discovered what causes the mistral discover also what will prevent it  that would be indeed a triumph of science and a boon to tortured humanity  but after all man is a worse enemy to man than any of the brute forces of nature  and a more terrible scourge than mistral or tempest swept over this land six hundred years ago when it was perhaps the happiest and the most civilized portion of europe  this was the scene of the albigense crusade  a tragedy of which the true history will never perhaps be written  it was not merely a persecution of real or supposed heretics it was a national war embittered by the ancient jealousies of race between the frank aristocracy of the north and the gothic aristocracy of the south who had perhaps acquired with their halfroman halfsaracen civilization mixtures both of roman and of saracen blood  as aquitanians provencauxroman provincials as they proudly called themselves speaking the langue doc and looking down on the northerners who spoke the langue doil as barbarians they were in those days guilty of the capital crime of being foreigners and as foreigners they were exterminated  what their religious tenets were we shall never know  with the vaudois waldenses poor men of lyons they must not be for a moment confounded  their creed remains to us only in the calumnies of their enemies  the confessions in the archives of the tolosan inquisition as elicited either under torture or fear of torture deserve no confidence whatsoever  and as for the licentiousness of their poetrywhich has been alleged as proof of their profligacyi can only say that it is no more licentious than the fabliaux of their french conquerors while it is far more delicate and refined  humanity at least has done justice to the troubadours of the south and confessed even in the middle age that to them the races of the north owed grace of expression delicacy of sentiment and that respect for women which soon was named chivalry which looks on woman not with suspicion and contempt but with trust and adoration and is not ashamed to obey her as mistress instead of treating her as a slave  but these albigenses must have had something in their hearts for which it was worth while to die  at aviguonet that little grey town on the crag above the railway they burst into the place maddened by the cruelties of the inquisitor an archdeacon if i recollect rightly from toulouse and slew him then and there  they were shut up in the town and withstood heroically a long and miserable siege at last they were starved out  the conquerors offered them their livesso say the french storiesif they would recant  but they would not  they were thrust together into one of those stonewalled enclosures below the town heaped over with vinetwigs and maize stalks and burned alive and among them a young lady of the highest rank who had passed through all the horrors of the siege and was offered life wealth and honour if she would turn  surely profligate infidels do not so die and these poor souls whatever were their sins or their confusions must be numbered among the heroes of the human race  but the world has mended since then and so has the french character even before the revolution of 1793 it was softening fast  the massacres of 1562 were not as horrible as those of the albigense crusade though committedwhich the former were notunder severe provocation  the massacres of 1793in spite of all that has been saidwere far less horrible than those of 1562 though they were the outpouring of centuries of pardonable fury and indignation  the crimes of the terreur blanche at the restorationthough ugly things were done in the south especially in nismeswere far less horrible again though they were for the most part acts of direct personal retaliation on the republicans of 1793  and since then the french heart has softened fast  the irritating sense of hereditary wrong has passed away  the frenchman conceives that justice is done to him according to his own notions thereof  he has his share of the soil without which no celtic populace will ever be content  he has fair play in the battle of life and a carriere ouverte aux talens he has equal law and justice between man and man  and he is content and under the sunshine of contentment and selfrespect his native goodnature expands and he shows himself what he is not merely a valiant and capable but an honest kindly charitable man  yes  france has grown better and has been growing better i believe for centuries past  and the difference between the france of the middle age and the france of the present day is fitly typified by the difference between the new carcassone below and the old carcassone above where every traveller even if he be no antiquarian should stop and gaze about a while  the contrast is complete and one for which a man who loves his fellowmen should surely return devout thanks to almighty god below on the west bank of the river is the new town spreading and growing unwalled for its fortifications are now replaced by boulevards and avenues full of handsome houses squares where beneath the planetree shade marble fountains pour out perpetual health and coolness manufactories of gay woollens healthy cheerful market folk comfortable burghers industry and peace  we pass outside to the great basin of the canal de languedoc and get more avenues of stately trees and among them the red marble statue of riquet whose genius planned and carried out the mighty canal which joins the ocean to the sea the wonder of its day which proved the french to be at least in the eighteenth century the master engineers of the world the only people who still inherited the mechanical skill and daring of their roman civilizers  riquet bore the labour of that canaland the calumny and obstructiveness too which tried to prevent its formation france bore the expense louis quatorze of course the glory and no one it is to be feared the profit  for the navigation of the garonne at the one extremity and of the mediterranean shallows at the other were left unimproved till of late years and the canal has become practically useful only just in time to be superseded by the railroads  now cross the aude  look down upon the willow and aspen copses where over the heads of busy washerwomen the nightingale and the hippolais crowded together away from the dusty plains and downs shake the copses with their song and then toil upward to the grey fortress tower on the grey limestone knoll and pass out of nature and her pure sunshine into the black shadow of the unnatural middle age into the region of dirt and darkness cruelty and fear grim fortresses crowded houses narrow streets and pestilence  pass through the outer circle of walls of the latter part of the thirteenth century to examinefor their architecture is a whole history engraved in stonesthe ancient walls of the inner enceinte massive roman below patched with striped visigothic work with mean and hasty moorish with graceful though heavy romanesque of the times of the troubadours a whole museum of ancient fortifications which has been restored stone by stone through the learning of m viollet le duc and the public spirit of the late emperor  pass in under the gateway and give yourself up to legends  there grins down on you the broad image of the mythic dame carcas who defended the town singlehanded against charlemagne till this tower fell down by miracle and let in the christian host  but do not believe that she gave to the place its name of carcassone for the first syllable of the word is hint enough that it was long ere her days a celtic caer or hillfortress  pause at the inner gate you need not exactly believe that when the english crusader simon de montfort burst it open and behold the town within was empty and desolate he cried  did i not tell you that those heretics were devils and behold being devils they have vanished into air  you must believe i fear that of the great multitude who had been crowded starving and feverstricken within he found four hundred poor wretches who had lingered behind and burnt them all alive  you need not believe that that is the mouth of the underground passage which runs all the way from the distant hills through which the vicomte de beziers after telling simon de montfort and the abbot of citeaux that he would sooner be flayed alive than betray the poor folk who had taken refuge with him got them all safe away men women and children  you need not believe that that great vaulted chamber was the chamber of the inquisition  but you must believe that those two ugly rings let into the roof were put there for the torture of the cord and that many a naked wretch has dangled from them ere now confessing anything and everything that heor alas shewas bidden but these and their like are the usual furniture of every mediaeval court of justice and torture was not altogether abolished in france till the latter part of the eighteenth century  you need not believe again that that circular tower on the opposite side of the town was really the tower of the inquisition for many a feudal lord besides the inquisitors had their dens of cruelty in those old times  you need not even believethough it is too likely to be truethat that great fireplace in the little firstfloor room served for the torture of the scarpines  but you must believe that in that little round den beneath it only approached by a trap in the floor two skeletons were found fastened by those chains to that central pillar having died and rotted forgotten in that horrid oubliette how many centuries ago  plusieurs ont gemis la bas said m viollet le ducs foreman of the works as he led us out of that evil hole to look with eyes and hearts refreshed by the change at a curious visigothic tower in which the good bishop sidonius apollinaris may have told of the last burgundian invasion of his auvergne to the good king theodoric of the west goths  if anyone wishes to learn what the middle ages were like let him go to carcassone and see  and now onward to narbonneor rather to what was once narbonne one of the earliest colonies ever founded by the romans then the capital of the visigothic kingdom then of an arab kingdom  now a dull fortified townof a filth unspeakable and not to be forgotten or forgiven  stay not therein an hour lest you take fever or worse but come out of the gate over the drawbridge and stroll down the canal  look back a moment though across the ditch  the whole face of the wall is a museum of roman gods tombs inscriptions bas reliefs  the wreck of martials pulcherrima narbo the old roman city which was demolished by louis xiii to build the ugly fortifications of the then new fashion now antiquated and useless take one glance and walk on to look at live naturefar more interesting than dead art  everything fattens in the close damp air of the canal  the great flat with its heavy crops puts you in mind of the richest english lowlandsave for the total want of old meadows  the weeds on the bank are english in type only larger and richeras becomes the climate  but as you look among them you see forms utterly new and strange whose kinship you cannot fancy but which remind you that you are nearing italy and greece and africa  and in the hedges are great baytrees and inside them orchards of standard fig and white mulberry with its long yearling shoots of glorious greensoon to be stripped bare for the silkworms and here and there long lines of cypresses black against the bright green plain and bright blue sky no you are not in britain  certainly not for there is a drake not a duck quacking with feeble treble in that cypress six feet over your head and in britain drakes do not live in trees  you look for the climbing palmipede and see nothing  nor will you see for the quacker is a tiny green treefrog who holds on by the suckers at the ends of his toes with which he can climb a pane of glass like a fly and has learnt the squirrels art of going invisible without the receipt of fernseed by simply keeping always on the further side of the branch  but come back for the air even here is suggestive of cholera and fever  the uncleanliness of these narbonnois is shameless and shocking and immondices of every kind lie festering in the rainless heat  the sickened botanist retreats and buys a bottle of eau bullyalias aromatic vinegar  there crowding yon hill with handsome houses and churches is beziersthe bloodstained city  beneath the pavement of that church it is said lie heaped together the remains of thousands of men women and children slaughtered around their own altars on that fatal day when the legate amalric asked by the knights how they should tell catholics from heretics cried kill them allthe lord will know his own  we will pass on  we have had enough of horrors  and beside we are longing to hurry onward for we are nearing the mediterranean now there are small skiffs lying under the dark tower of agde another place of blood fitly built of black lava blocks the offspring of the nether pit  the railway cuts through rolling banks of dark lava and now ahead of us is the conical lavahill of cette and the mouth of the canal du midi   there it is at last  the long line of heavenly blue and over it far away the whitepeaked lateen sails which we have seen in pictures since our childhood and there close to the rail beyond the sandhills delicate wavelets are breaking for ever on a yellow beach each in exactly the same place as the one which fell before one glance shows us children of the atlantic that we are on a tideless sea  there it isthe sacred sea  the sea of all civilization and almost all history girdled by the fairest countries in the world set there that human beings from all its shores might mingle with each other and become humanethe sea of egypt of palestine of greece of italy of byzant of marseilles and this narbonnaise more roman than rome herself to which we owe the greater part of our own progress the sea too algeria and carthage and cyrene and fair lands now desolate surely not to be desolate for everthe sea of civilization  not only to the christian nor to the classic scholar but to every man to whom the progress of his race from barbarism toward humanity is dear should the mediterranean sea be one of the most august and precious objects on this globe and the first sight of it should inspire reverence and delight as of coming homehome to a rich inheritance in which he has long believed by hearsay but which he sees at last with his own mortal corporal eyes  exceedingly beautiful is that first view of the sea from cette though altogether different in character from the views of the mediterranean which are common in every gallery of pictures  there is nothing to remind one of claude or vernet or stanfield  no mountainranges far aloft no cliffs toppling into the water with convents and bastides perched on their crags and seaports with their landlocked harbours and quaint lighthouses nestling on the brink  that scenery begins on the other side of the rhone mouth and continues i believe almost without interruption to the shores of southern palestine one girdle of perpetual beauty  but here the rail runs along a narrow strip of sand covered with straggling vines and tall white iris between the sea and the great etang de thau a long narrow saltlake beyond which the wide lowlands of the herault slide gently down there is not a mountain hardly a hill visible for miles  but all around is the great sheet of blue glassy water  while the air is as glassy clear as the water and through it at seemingly immense distances the land shows purple and orange blue and grey till the landscape is one great rainbow white ships slide to and from faroff towns fishermen lounge on the marshes drying long lines of net  everywhere is vastness freedom repose gentle and yet not melancholy because with all under the burning blue there is that fresh wholesome heat which in itself is life and youth and joy  beyond nearer the mouths of the rhone there are so men say desolate marshes tenanted by herds of halfwild horses foul mud banks haunted by the pelican and the flamingo and waders from the african shore a region half land half water where dwell savage folk decimated by fever and ague  but short of those bouches du rhone the railway turns to the north toward montpellier and   arli dove il rhodano stagna   and at cette ends this little tour from ocean to sea with the wish that he who next travels that way may have as glorious weather and as agreeable a companion as the writer of these lines had in 1864    vi north devon 225a    iexmoor  we were riding up from lynmouth on a pair of ragged ponies claude mellot and i along the gorge of watersmeet  and as we went we talked of many things and especially of some sporting book which we had found at the lyndale hotel the night before and which we had not by any means admired 225b  i do not object to sporting books in general least of all to one on exmoor  no place in england is more worthy of one  there is no place whose beauties and peculiarities are more likely to be thrown into strong relief by being looked at with a sportsmans eye  it is so with all forests and moorlands the spirit of robin hood and johnny of breadislee is theirs  they are remnants of the home of mans fierce youth still consecrated to the genius of animal excitement and savage freedom after all not the most ignoble qualities of human nature  besides there is no better method of giving a living picture of a whole country than by taking some one feature of it as a guide and bringing all other observations into harmony with that original key  even in merely scientific books this is very possible  look for instance at hugh millers old red sandstone the voyage of the beagle and professor forbess work we had almost said epic poem on glaciers even an agricultural writer if he have a real insight in himif he have anything of that secret of the piu nel uno the power of discovering the infinite in the finite of seeing like a poet trivial phenomena in their true relation to the whole of the great universe into which they are so cunningly fitted if he has learned to look at all things and men down to the meanest as living lessons written with the finger of god if in short he has any true dramatic power  then he may impart to that apparently muddiest of sciences a poetic or a humorous tone and give the lie to mephistopheles when he dissuades faust from farming as an occupation too mean and filthy for a man of genius  the poetry of agriculture remains as yet no doubt unwritten and the comedy of it also though its farcetragedy has been too often extensively enacted in practiceunconsciously to the players  as for the old pastoral school it only flourished before agriculture really existedthat is before sound science hard labour and economy were necessary and has been for the last two hundred years simply a dream nevertheless as signs of what may be done even now by a genial man with so stubborn a subject as turnips barley clover wheat it is worth while to look at old arthur youngs books both travels and treatises and also at certain very spirited chronicles of a clay farm by talpa which teem with humour and wisdom  in sporting literaturea tenth muse exclusively indigenous to englandthe same observation holds good tenfold  some of our most perfect topographical sketches have been the work of sportsmen  old izaak walton and his friend cotton of dovedale whose names will last as long as their rivers have been followed by a long train of worthy pupils  whites history of selborne sir humphry davys salmonia the wild sports of the west mr st johns charming little works on highland shooting and above all christopher norths recreationsdelightful book to be read and reread the tenth time even as the firstan inexhaustible fairy well springing out of the granite rock of the sturdy scotch heart through the tender green turf of a genial boyish old age  sporting books when they are not filledas they need never bewith low slang and ugly sketches of ugly characterswho hang on to the skirts of the sporting world as they would to the skirts of any other world in default of the sporting oneform an integral and significant and it may be an honourable and useful part of the english literature of this day and therefore all shallowness vulgarity stupidity or bookmaking in that class must be as severely attacked as in novels and poems  we english owe too much to our field sports to allow people to talk nonsense about them  claude smiled at some such words of mine that day  you talk often of the poetry of sport  i can see nothing in it but animal excitement and a certain quantity i suppose of that animal cunning which the red indian possesses in common with the wolf and the cat and any other beast of prey  as a fact the majority of sportsmen are of the most unpoetical type of manhood  more unpoetical than the average man of business or man of law claude  or even than the average preacher  i believe on the contrary that for most of them it is sport which at once keeps alive and satisfies what you would call their aesthetic faculties and so smile if you willhelps to make them purer simpler more genial men  little enough of aesthetic appears either in their conversation or their writing  esau is a dumb soul especially here in england but he has as deep a heart in him as jacob nevertheless and as tender  do you fancy that the gentleman over whose book we were grumbling last night attached no more to his own simple words than you do  his account of a stags run looks bald enough to you  but to him unless diana struck him blind for intruding on her privacy what a whole poem of memories there must be in those few wordsturned down   water for a mile and crossed the forest to watersmeet where he was run into after a gallant race  a whole poem  why not  how can there be less if he had eyes to see  does he fancy that it is an account of a run to tell us that found at     cover held away at a slapping pace for     barn then turned down the    water for a mile and crossed the forest made for    hill but being headed went by   woods to d    where he was run into after a gallant race of     hours and    miles  it is nearly as dull as a history book  nay i never rode with those staghounds  and yet i can fill up his outline for him wherever the stag was roused  do you think that he never marked how the panting cavalcade rose and fell on the huge milelong waves of that vast heather sea how one long brown hill after another sunk down greyer and greyer behind them and one long grey hill after another swelled up browner and browner before them and how the sandstone rattled and flew beneath their feet as the great horses like homers of old devoured up the plain and how they struggled down the hillside through bushes and rocks and broad slipping rattling sheets of screes and saw beneath them stag and pack galloping down the shallow glittering riverbed throwing up the shingle striking out the water in long glistening sheets and how they too swept after them down the flat valley rounding crag and headland which opened one after another in interminable vista along the narrow strip of sand and rushes speckled with stunted mossbearded heatherbedded hawthorns between the great grim lifeless mountain walls  did he feel no pleasant creeping of the flesh that day at the sound of his own horsehoofs as they swept through the long ling with a sound as soft as the brushing of a womans tresses and then rang down on the spongy black reverberating soil chipping the honeyladen fragrant heather blossoms and tossing them out in a rosy shower  or if that were really too slight a thing for the observation of an average sportsman surely he must recollect the dying away of the hounds voices as the woodland passes engulfed them whether it were brendon or at badgerworthy or any other place how they brushed through the narrow forest paths where the ashes were already golden while the oaks still kept their sombre green and the red leaves and berries of the mountainash showed bright beneath the dark forest aisles and how all of a sudden the wild outcry before them seemed to stop and concentrate thrown back louder and louder as they rode off the same echoing crag till at a sudden turn of the road there stood the stag beneath them in the stream his back against the black rock with its green cushions of dripping velvet kneedeep in the clear amber water the hounds around him some struggling and swimming in the deep pool some rolling and tossing and splashing in a mad half terrified ring as he reared into the air on his great haunches with the sparkling beads running off his red mane and dropping on his knees plunged his antlers down among them with blows which would have each brought certain death with it if the yielding water had not broken the shock  do you think that he does not remember the death the huge carcass dragged out of the stream followed by dripping panting dogs the blowing of the mort and the last wild halloo when the hornnote and the voices rang through the autumn woods and rolled up the smooth flat mountain sides and brendon answered countisbury and countisbury sent it on to lynmouth hills till it swept out of the gorge and died away upon the severn sea  and then does he not remember the pause and the revulsion and the feeling of sadness and littleness almost of shame as he looked up for the first timeone can pardon his not having done so beforeand saw where he was and the beauty of the hillsides with the lazy autumn clouds crawling about their tops and the great sheets of screes glaciers of stone covering acres and acres of the smooth hillside eating far into the woods below bowing down the oak scrubs with their weight and the circular sweeps of down flecked with innumerable dark spots of gorse each of them guarded where they open into the river chasm by two fortresses of giantsnouted crags delicate pink and grey sandstone from which blocks and crumbling boulders have been toppling slowly down for ages beneath the frost and the whirlwind and now lie in long downward streams upon the slope as if the mountain had been weeping tears of stone  and then as the last notes of the mort had died away did not there come over him an awe at the silence of the woods not broken but deepened by the unvarying monotone of the roaring stream beneath which flashed and glittered halfhidden in the dark chasm in clear brown pools reflecting every leaf and twig in boiling pits and walls of foam ever changing and yet for ever the fleeting on past the poor dead reeking stag and the silent hounds lying about on the moss embroidered stones their lolling tongues showing like bright crimson sparkles in the deep rich venetian air of the green sombre shades while the startled waterousel with his white breast flitted a few yards and stopped to stare from a rocks point at the strange intruders and a single stockdove out of the bosom of the wood began calling sadly and softly with a dreamy peaceful moan  did he not see and hear all this for surely it was there to see and hear  not he  the eye only sees that which it brings within the power of seeing and all i shall say of him is that a certain apparition in white leathers was at one period of its appearance dimly conscious of equestrian motion towards a certain brown twohorned phenomenon and other spotted phenomena at which he had been taught by habit to make the articulate noises stag and hounds among certain grey and green and brown phenomena at which the same habit and the example of his fellows had taught him to say rock and wood and mountain and perhaps the further noises of lovely splendid majestic  as usual sir  you dwellers in babylon fancy that you have the monopoly of all the intellect and all the taste because you earn your livings by talking about pretty things and painting pretty things  little do you suspect shut up together in your little literary worlds and your artistic worlds how many thousands of us outside barbarians there are who see as clearly and enjoy as deeply as you do  but hold their tongues about their own feelings simply because they have never been driven by emptiness of pocket to look round for methods of expressing them  and after allhow much of nature can you express  you confest yourself yesterday baffled by all the magnificence around you  yes to paint it worthily one would require to be a turner a copley fielding and a creswick all in one  and did you ever remark how such scenes as this gorge of the watersmeet stir up a feeling of shame almost of peevishness before the sense of a mysterious meaning which we ought to understand and cannot  he smiled  our torments do by length of time become our elements and painful as that sensation is to the earnest artist he will feel it i fancy at last sublime itself into an habitually gentle reverent almost melancholy tone of mind as of a man bearing the burden of an infinite and wonderful message which his own frivolity and laziness hinder him from speaking out  then it should beget in him too something of merciful indulgence towards the seeming stupidity of those who see after all only a very little shallower than he does into the unfathomable depths of nature  well sporting books and sportsmen seem to me by their very object not to be worth troubling our heads about  out of nothing comes nothing  see my hands are as soft as any ladys in belgravia  i could not to save my life lift a hundredweight a foot off the ground while you have been a wild man of the woods a leaper of ditches a rower of races and a wanton destroyer of all animal life and yet  you would hint politely that you are as open as me to all noble and chivalrous and truly manly emotions  what think you  that you are far worthier in such matters than i friend  but do not forget that it may be your intellect and your professionin one word heavens mercywhich have steered you clear of shoals upon which you will find the mass of our class founder  woe to the class or the nation which has no manly physical training  look at the manners the morals the faces of the young men of the shopkeeping classes if you wish to see the effects of utterly neglecting the physical development of man 235 of fancying that all the muscular activity he requires under the sun is to be able to stand behind a counter or sit on a deskstool without tumbling off  be sure be sure that ever since the days of the persians of old effeminacy if not twinsister of cowardice and dishonesty has always gone hand in hand with them  to that utter neglect of any exercises which call out fortitude patience selfdependence and daring i attribute a great deal of the low sensuality the conceited vulgarity the want of a high sense of honour which is increasing just now among the middle classes and from which the navigator the engineer the miner and the sailor are comparatively free  and perhaps too that similar want of a high sense of honour which seems from the religious periodicals to pervade a large proportion of a certain more venerable profession  seriously claude i believe you are not far wrong  but we are getting on delicate ground there  however i have always found that of whatever profession he may beto travestie shakspeares words    the man that hath not sporting in his soul is fit for treasons direst stratagems    and so forth  civil to me  oh you have a sporting soul in you like hundreds of other englishmen who never handled rod or gun or you would not be steering for exmoor today  if a lad be a genius you may trust him to find some original means for developing his manly energies whether in art agriculture science or travels discovery and commerce  but if he be not as there are a thousand chances to one he will not be then whatever you teach him let the two first things be as they were with the old persians to speak the truth and to draw the bow  by this time we had reached the stream just clearing from the last nights showers  a long transparent amber shallow dimpled with fleeting silver rings by rising trout a low cascade of greenveined snow a deep dark pool of swirling orangebrown walled in with heathery rocks and paved with sandstone slabs and boulders distorted by the changing refractions of the eddiessight delicious to the angler  i commenced my sport at once while claude wandered up the glen to sketch a knoll of crags on which a halfwild moorland pony the only living thing in sight stood staring and snuffing at the intruder his long mane and tail streaming out wildly against the sky  i had fished on for some hour or two claude had long since disappeared among the hills i fancied myself miles from any human being when a voice at my elbow startled me  a bleak place for fishing this sir  i turned it was an old greywhiskered labouring man with pick and spade on shoulder who had crept on me unawares beneath the wall of the neighbouring deercover  keen honest eyes gleamed out from his brown scarred weatherbeaten face and as he settled himself against a rock with the deliberate intention of a chat i commenced by asking after the landlord of those parts well known and honoured both by sportsman and by farmer  he was gone to maltaa warmer place that than exmoor  what have you been in malta  yes he had been in malta and in stranger places yet  he had been a sailor  he had seen the landing in egypt and heard the french cannon thundering vainly from the sandhills on the english boats he had himself helped to lift abercrombie up the ships side to the deathbed of the brave  he had seen caraccioli hanging at his own yardarm and heard so he said i know not how correctly lady hamilton order out the barge herself and row round the frigate of the murdered man to glut her eyes with her revenge  he had seen too the ghastly corpse floating upright when nelson and the enchantress met their victim returned from the seadepths to stare at them as banquos ghost upon macbeth  but she was a mortal fine woman was lady hamilton though she was a queer one and cruel kind to the sailors and many a man she saved from flogging and one from hanging too that was a marine that got astealing for nelson though he was kind enough yet it was a word and a blow with him and quite right he sir for there be such rascals on board ship that if you aint as sharp with them as with wild beastesses no mans life nor the ships neither would be worth a days purchase  so he with his simple straightforward notions of right and wrong worth much maudlin unmerciful indulgence which we hear in these days  and yet not going to the bottom of the matter either as we shall see in the next war  but rambling on he told me how he had come home warworn and crippled to marry a wife and get tall sons and lay his bones in his native village till which time for death to the aged poor man is a sabbath of which he talks freely calmly even joyously he just got his bread by the squires kindness patching and mending at the stone deerfences  i gave him something to buy tobacco and watched him as he crawled away with a sort of stunned surprise  and he had actually seen nelson sit by lady hamilton  it was so strange to have that gay italian bay with all its memoriesthe orgies of baiae and the unburied wrecks of ancient towns with the smoking crater far above and the worldfamous nilemouths and those great old wars big with the destinies of the world and those great old heroes with their awful deeds for good and evil all brought so suddenly and livingly before me up there in the desolate moorland where the deer and birds and heath and rushes were even as they had been from the beginning  like wordsworth with his leechgatherer a poem which i in spite of laughter must rank among his very highest    while he was talking thus the lonely place the old mans shape and speechall troubled me in my minds eye i seemed to see him pace about the weary moors continually wandering about alone and silently    and when he ended i could have laughed myself to scorn to find in that decrepit man so firm a mind   just then i heard a rustle and turning saw claude toiling down to me over the hillside  he joined me footsore and weary but in great excitement for the first minute or two he could not speak and at last   oh i have seen such a sightbut i will tell you how it all was after i left you i met a keeper  he spoke civilly to meyou know my antipathy to game and those who live thereby  but there was a wild bold selfhelping look about him and his gun alone there in the wasteand after all he was a man and a brother  well we fell into talk and fraternized and at last he offered to take me to a neighbouring hill and show me sixty head of reddeer all together and as he spoke he looked quite proud of his words  i was lucky he said to come just then for the stags had all just got their heads again  at which speech i wondered but was silent and followed him i claude the cockney such a walk as i shall never take again  behold these trousersbehold these hands scratched to pieces by crawling on allfours through the heather  but i saw them  a sight worth many pairs of plaid trousers  worth saint chrysostoms seven years nakedness on allfours  and so i told the fellow who by some cunning calculations about wind and sun and so forth which he imparted to my uncomprehending ears brought me suddenly to the top of a little crag below which some hundred yards off the whole herd stood stags hindsbut i cant describe them  i have not brought away a scrap of sketch though we watched them full ten minutes undiscovered and then the stare and the toss of those antlers and the rush  that broke the spell with me for i had been staring stupidly at them trying in vain to take in the sight with the strangest new excitement heaving and boiling up in my throat and at the sound of their hoofs on the turf i woke and found the keeper staring not at them but at me who i verily believe had something very like a tear in these excitable eyes of mine  aint you well sir said he  you neednt be afeard its only at the fall of the year the stags is wicked  i dont know what i answered at first but the fellow understood me when i shook his hand frantically and told him that i should thank him to the last day of my life and that i would not have missed it for a thousand pounds  in partproof whereof i gave him a sovereign on the spot which seemed to clear my character in his eyes as much as the crying at the sight of a herd of deer had mystified it  claude wellbeloved said i will you ever speak contemptuously of sportsmen any more  do manus i have been vilifying them as one does most things in the world only for want of understanding them  how shall i do penance  go and take service with edwin landseer as pupil colour grinder footboy  you will then be very near to a very great poet quoth i and one whose works will become as centuries roll on more and more valuable to art and to science and possibly to something higher than either  i begin to guess your meaning answered claude  so we lounged and dreamt and fished in heathery highland as mr clough would say while the summer snipes flitted whistling up the shallow before us and the soft southeastern clouds slid lazily across the sun and the little trout snapped and dimpled at a tiny partridge hackle with a twist of orange silk whose elegance for shape and colour reconciled claudes heart somewhat to my everlasting whipping of the water  when as last  you seem to have given up catching anything  you have not stirred a fish in this last two pools except that little saucy yellow shrimp who jumped over your fly and gave a spiteful slap at it with his tail  too true and what could be the cause  had that impudent sandpiper frightened all the fish on his way up  had an otter paralysed them with terror for the morning  or had a stag been down to drink  we saw the fresh slot of his broad claws by the bye in the mud a few yards back  we must have seen the stag himself if he had been here lately said claude  mr landseer knows too well by this time that that is a non sequitur  i am no more a non sequitur than you are answered the cornish magistrate to the barrister  fish and deer friend see us purblind sons of men somewhat more quickly than we see them fear sharpening the senses  perhaps after all the fault is in your staring whitestraw hat a garment which has spoilt many a good days fishing  ah no there is the cause the hat of a mightier than youthe thunderspirit himself  thor is at hand while the breeze awestricken falls dead calm before his march  behold climbing above that eastern ridge his huge powdered cauliflowerwig barred with a grey horizontal handkerchief of mist  oh profane and uncomely similewhich will next i presume liken the coming hailstorm to hairpowder shaken from the said wig  to shot rather than to powder  flee oh flee to yonder pile of crags and thank your stars that there is one at hand for these mountain tornadoes are at once tropic in their ferocity and siberian in their cutting cold  down it came  the brown hills vanished in white sheets of hail first falling perpendicularly then slanting and driving furiously before the cold blast which issued from the storm  the rock above us rang with the thunderpeals and the lightning which might have fallen miles away seemed to our dazzled eyes to dive into the glittering river at our feet  we sat silent some halfhour listening to the voice of one more mighty than ourselves and it was long after the uproar had rolled away among the hills and a steady sighing sheet of warmer rains from banks of low grey fog had succeeded the rattling of the hail upon the crisp heather that i turned to claude  and now since your heart is softened towards these wild stag hunting trout fishing jovial westcountrymen consider whether it should not be softened likewise toward those old outlaw ballads which i have never yet been able to make you admire  they express feelings not yet extinct in the minds of a large portion of the lower orders as you would know had you lived like me all your life in poaching counties and on the edges of one forest after anotherfeelings which must be satisfied even in the highest development of the civilization of the future for they are innate in every thoughtful and energetic racefeelings which though they have often led to crime have far oftener delivered from swinish sensuality the feelings which drove into the merry greenwood robin hood scarlet and john adam bell and clym of the cleugh and william of cloudislee the feelings which prompted one half of his inspiration to the nameless immortal who wrote the nutbrown maidfeelings which could not then and cannot now be satisfied by the drudgery of a barbaric agriculture which without science economy or enterprise offers no food for the highest instincts of the human mind its yearnings after nature after freedom and the noble excitement of selfdependent energy  our talk ended  but the rain did not  and we were at last fain to leave our shelter and let ourselves be blown by the gale the difficulty being not to progress forward but to keep our feet back to the shed where our ponies were tied and to canter home to lynmouth with the rain cutting our faces like showers of pebbles and our little mountain ponies staggering against the wind and more than once if londoners will believe me blown sheer up against the bank by some mad gust which rushed perpendicularly not down but up the chasms of the glens below   iithe coast line   it is four oclock on a may morning and claude and i are just embarking on board a clovelly trawling skiff which having disposed of her fish at various ports along the channel is about to run leisurely homewards with an ebb tide and a soft northeasterly breeze  so farewell fair lynmouth and ye stormspirits send us a propitious day and dismiss those fantastic clouds which are coquetting with your thrones crawling down one hillside and whirling and leaping up another in wreaths of snow and dun and amber pierced every minute by some long glittering upward arrow from the rising sun which gilds grey crags and downs a thousand feet above while underneath the gorges still sleep black and cold in shade  there they have heard us  the cap rises off the summerhouse hill that eight hundred feet of upright wall which seems ready to topple down into the nest of bemyrtled cottages at its foot and as we sweep out into the deeper water the last mistflake streams up from the foreland and vanishes in white threads into the stainless blue  look at the colours of that foreland cried claude  the simple monotone of pearly green broken only at intervals by bloodred stains where the turf has slipped and left the fresh rock bare and all glimmering softly through a delicate blue haze like the bloom on a halfripened plum  and look too how the grey pebble beach is already dancing and quivering in the mirage which steams up like the hot breath of a limekiln from the drying stones  talk of glazings and scumblings ye artists and bungle at them as you will what are they to natures own glazings deepening every instant there behind us  mock me not  i have walked up and down here with a humbled and broken spirit and had nearly forsworn the audacity of painting anything beyond a beech stem or a frond of fern  the little infinite in them would have baffled you as much as the only somewhat bigger infinite of just the hills on which they grow  confest  and so farewell to unpaintable lynmouth  farewell to the charming contrast of civilized english landscapegardening with its villas and its exotics and its evergreens thus strangely and yet harmoniously confronted with the chaos of the rocks and mountain streams  those grounds of sir william hs are a double paradise the wild eden of the past side by side with the cultivated eden of the future  how its alternations of art and savagery at once startle and relieve the sense as you pass suddenly out of wildernesses of piled boulders and torrentshattered trees and the roar of fern fringed waterfalls into trim walks and fragrant alleys green and the door of a summerhouse transports you at a step from richmond to the alps  happy he who possesses as the world calls it and happier still he whose taste could organize that fairy bower  so he magniloquently as was his wont and yet his declamations always flowed with such a graceful easea simple smiling earnestnessan unpractised melody of voice that what would have been rant from other lips from his showed only as the healthy enthusiasm of the passionate allseeing allloving artist  look yonder again said he gazing up at the huge boulderstrewn hillside above us  one wonders at that sight whether the fable of the giants be not true after alland that vale of rocks hanging five hundred feet in air with all its cragcastles and tottering battlements and colossal crumbling idols and great blocks which hang sloping caught in act to fall be not some enormous cyclopean temple left halfdisinterred  or is it a fragment of old chaos left unorganizedor perhaps the waste heap of the world where after the rest of england had been made some angel put up a notice for his fellows dry rubbish shot here  not so unscientific  it is the grandfather of hillsa fossil bone of some old continent which stood here ages before england was and the great earthangel who grinds up mountains into paint as you do bits of ochre for his continental sketches found in it the materials for a whole dark groundtone of coalmeasures and a few hundred miles of warm highlights which we call new red sandstone  what a seawall they are those exmoor hills  sheer upward from the sea a thousand feet rise the downs and as we slide and stagger lazily along before the dying breeze through the deep water which never leaves the cliff the eye ranges almost dizzy up some five hundred feet of rock dappled with every hue from the intense dark of the tideline through the warm green and brown rockshadows out of which the horizontal cracks of the strata loom black and the breeding gulls show like lingering snowflakes up to the middle cliff where delicate grey fades into pink pink into red red into glowing purple up to where the purple is streaked with glossy ivy wreaths and blackgreen yews up to where all the choir of colours vanishes abruptly on the midhill to give place to one yellowish grey sheet of upward down sweeping aloft smooth and unbroken except by a lonely stone or knot of clambering sheep and stopped by one great rounded waving line sharpcut against the brilliant blue  the sheep hang like white daisies upon the steep and a solitary falcon rides a speck in air yet far below the crest of that tall hill now he sinks to the cliff edge and hangs quivering supported like a kite by the pressure of his breast and long curved wings against the breeze  there he hangs the peregrinea true falcon gentle sharp notched longtaloned crookedwinged whose uncles and cousins ages since have struck at duck and pheasant and sat upon the wrists of kings  and now he is full proud of any mouse or clifflark like an old chingachgook last of the mohicans he lingers round the huntingfield of his fathers  so all things end   the old order changeth giving place to the new and god fulfils himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world   ay and the day may come said claude when the brows of that huge high vere shall be crowned with golden wheat and every rockledge on trentishoe like those of petra and the rhine support its gardenbed of artificial soil  and when i answered the shingly sides of that great chasm of headons mouth may be clothed with the white mulberry and the summer limestoneskiffs shall go back freighted with fabrics which vie with the finest woof of italy and lyons  you believe then in the late mrs whitby of lymington  seeing is believing claude  through laughter and failures and the stupidity of halfbarbarous clods she persevered in her silk growing and succeeded and i should like to put her book into the hands of every squire in devon cornwall and the south of ireland  or require them to pass an examination in it as one more among the many books which i intend in my ideal kingdom all landlords to read and digest before they are allowed to take possession of their estates  in the meantime what is that noble conical hill which has increased my wonder at the infinite variety of beauty which the spirit can produce by combinations so simple as a few grey stones and a sheet of turf  the hangman  an ominous name  what is its history  some sheepstealer they say clambering over a wall with his booty slung round his neck was literally hung by the poor brutes struggles and found days after on the mountainside a blackened corpse on one side of the wall with the sheep on the other and the ravensyou may fill up the picture for yourself  but see as we round the hangman what a change of scenethe squareblocked sandstone cliffs dip suddenly under dark slatebeds fantastically bent and broken by primeval earthquakes  wooded combes and craggy ridges of rich pastureland wander and slope towards a labyrinth of bushfringed coves black isolated tiderocks and landlocked harbours  there shines among the woods the castle of watermouth on its lovely little saltwater loch the safest harbour on the coast and there is combemartin milelong manstye which seven centuries of fruitless silvermining and of the right now deservedly lost of sending a talker to the national palaver have neither cleansed nor civilized  turn turn thy head away dear claude lest even at this distance some foul odour taint the summer airs and complete the misfortune already presaged by that pale sad face sickening in the burning calm  for this great sunroasted firebrick of the exmoor range is fairly burning up the breeze and we have nothing but the tide to drift us slowly down to ilfracombe  now we open rillage and now hillsborough two of the most picturesque of headlands see how their round foreheads of glistening grey shale sink down into two dark jagged moles running far out to seaward and tapering off each into a long black horizontal line vanishing at last beneath its lacefringe of restless hissing foam how grand the contrast of the lightness of those sealines with the solid mass which rests upon them  look too at the glaring lights and tartarean shadows of those chasms and caves which the tide never leaves or the foot of man explores and listen how at every rush of the long groundswell mysterious mutterings solemn sighs sudden thunders as of a pentup earthquake boom out of them across the glassy swell  look at those blasts of delicate vapour that shoot up from hidden rifts and hang a moment and vanish and those green columns of wave which rush masthigh up the perpendicular walls and then fall back and outward in a waterfall of foam lacing the black rocks with a thousand snowy streams  there they fall and leap and fall again  and so they did yesterday and the day before and so they did centuries ago when the danes swept past them battleworn and sad of heart for the loss of the magic raven flag from the fight at appledore to sit down and starve on the island of bradanrelice which men call flat holms  ay and even so they leapt and fell before a sail gleamed on the severn sea when the shark and the ichthyosaur paddled beneath the shade of tropic forestsnow scanty turf and golden gorse  and so they will leap and fall on on through the centuries and the ages  o dim abyss of time into which we peer shuddering what will be the end of thee and of this ceaseless coil and moan of waters  it is true that when thou shalt be no more then too there shall be no more sea and this ocean bed this great grave of fertility into which all earths wasted riches stream day and night from hill and town shall rise and become fruitful soil cornfield and meadowland and earth shall teem as thick with living men as beanfields with the summer bees what a consummation  at least there is one greater than sea or time  and the judge of all the earth will do right  but there is ilfracombe with its rockwalled harbour its little wood of masts within its white terraces rambling up the hills and its capstone seawalk the finest marine parade as cockneydom terms it in all england except that splendid hoe at plymouth lam goemagot gogmagogs leap as the old britains called it over which corineus threw that mighty giant  and there is the little isolated rockchapel where seven hundred years ago our westcountry forefathers used to go to pray st nicholas for deliverance from shipwrecka method lovingly regretted by some as a pious idea of the ages of faith  we however shall prefer the method of lighthouses and the worthy trinity board as actually more godly and faithful as well as more useful and probably so do the sailors themselves  but claude is by this time nearly sick of the roasting calm and the rolling groundswell and the smell of fish and is somewhat sleepy also between early rising and incoherent sermons wherefore if he takes good advice he will stay and recruit himself at ilfracombe before he proceeds further with his selfelected cicerone on the grand tour of north devon  believe me claude you will not stir from the place for a month at least  for be sure if you are sea sick or heartsick or pocketsick either there is no pleasanter or cheaper place of cure to indulge in a puff of a species now well nigh obsolete the puff honest and true than this same ilfracombe with its quiet nature and its quiet luxury its rock fairyland and its seawalks its downs and combes its kind people and if possible its still kinder climate which combines the soft warmth of south devon with the bracing freshness of the welsh mountains where winter has slipped out of the list of the seasons and mother earth makes up for her summers luxury by fasting not in sackcloth and ashes but in new silk and old sack and instead of standing three months chindeep in ice and christening great snowballs her friends and family as st francis of assisi did of old knows no severer asceticism than tepid showerbaths and a parasol of soft grey mist   iiimorte   i had been wandering over the centre of exmoor killing trout as i went through a country which owes its civilization and tillage to the spirit of one man who has found stagpreserving by no means incompatible with large agricultural improvements among a population who still evince an unpleasant partiality for cutting and carrying farmers crops by night without leave or licence and for housebreaking after the true classic method of athens by fairly digging holes through the house walls a little nook of primeval savagery fast reorganizing itself under the influences of these better days  i had been on dartmoor too but of that noble moorland range so much has been said and sung of late that i really am afraid it is becoming somewhat cockney and trite  far and wide i had wandered rod in hand becoming a boy again in the land of my boyhood till once more at ilfracombe opposite me sat claude mellot just beginning to bloom again into cheerfulness  we were on the point of starting for morte and so round to saunton court and the sands beyond it where a clovelly trawler which we had chartered for the occasion had promised to send a boat on shore and take us off provided the wind lay off the land  but indeed the sea was calm as glass the sky cloudless azure and the doubt was not whether we should be able to get on board through the surf but whether having got on board we should not lie till nightfall as idle   as a painted ship upon a painted ocean   and now behold us on our way up lovely combes with their green copses ridges of rock golden furze fruitladen orchards and slopes of emerald pasture pitched as steep as houseroofs where the red longhorns are feeding with their tails a yard above their heads and under us seen in birdseye view the groundplans of the little snug farms and homesteads of the damnonii dwellers in the valley as we westcountrymen were called of old  now we are leaving them far below us the blue hazy sea is showing far above the serrated ridge of the tors and their huge bank of sunny green  and before us is a desolate tableland of rushy pastures and mouldering banks festooned with the delicate network of the little ivyleaved campanula loveliest of british wildflowers fit with its hairlike stems and tiny bells of blue to wreathe the temples of titania alas we have passed out of the world into limbum patrum and the region of ineffectuality and incompleteness  the only cultivators here and through thousands of acres in the north of devon are the rook and mole  and yet the land is rich enoughthe fat deep crumbling of the shale and ironstone returning year by year into the mud from whence it hardened ages since  there are scores of farms of far worse land in midengland under a fourcourse shift yielding their load of wheat an acre  when will that land do as much  when will the spirit of smith of deanston and grey of dilston descend on north devon  when will some true captain of industry and theseus of the nineteenth century like the late mr warnes of trimmingham teach the people here to annihilate poorrates by growing flax upon some of the finest flax land and in the finest flax climate that we have in england  the shrewd cornishmen of launceston and bodmin have awakened long ago to the new gospel of fertility  when will north devon awake  when landlords and farmers said claude at last acknowledge their divine vocation and feel it a noble and heavenordained duty to produce food for the people of england when they learn that to grow rushes where they might grow corn ay to grow four quarters of wheat where they might grow five is to sin against gods blessings and against the english nation  no wonder that sluggards like these cry out for protectionthat those who cannot take care of the land feel that they themselves need artificial care  we will not talk politics claude  our modern expediency mongers have made them pro tempore an extinct science  let the dead bury their dead  the social questions are nowadays becoming far more important than the mere house of commons ones  there does seem here and there he said some sign of improvement i see the paring plough at work on one field and another  swiftly goes the age and slowly crawls improvement  the greater part of that land will be only broken up to be exhausted by corncrop after corncrop till it can bear no more and the very manure which is drawn home from it in the shape of a few turnips will be wasted by every rain of heaven and the straw probably used to mend bad places in the road with while the land returns to twenty years of worse sterility than ever on the ground that   veather did zo and gramfer did zo and why shouldnt jan do the zame      but here is morte below us  the little grey church on the windy shore which once belonged to william de tracy one of your friend thomas a beckets murderers  if you wish to vent your wrath against those who cut off your favourite saxon hero there is a tomb in the church which bears de tracys name over which rival dryasdusts contend fiercely with paperarrows  the one party asserting that he became a priest and died here in the wilderness the others that the tomb is of later date that he fled hence to italy under favour of a certain easygoing bishop of exeter and died penitent and duly shriven according to the attestations of a certain or uncertain bishop of cosenza  peace be with him and with the bishop  the flight to italy seems a very needless precaution to a man who owned this corner of the world a bailiff would have had even less chance here then than in connemara a hundred years ago  he certainly would have fed the crabs and rockcod in two hours after his arrival  nevertheless i believe the cosenza story is the safer one  what a chaos of rockridgesold starved mother earths bareworn ribs and joints peeping out through every field and down and on three sides of us the sullen thunder of the unseen surge  what a place for some gloompampered man to sit and misanthropize  morte says the devonshire proverb is the place on earth which heaven made last and the devil will take first  all the fitter for a misanthrope  but where are the trees  i have not seen one for the last four miles  nor will you for a few miles more  whatever will grow here and most things will they will not except at least hereafter the sea pine of the biscay shore  you would know why if you had ever felt a southwesterly gale here when the foamflakes are flying miles inland and you are fain to cling breathless to bank and bush if you want to get one look at those black fields of sharkstooth tide rocks champing and churning the great green rollers into snow  wild folk are these here gatherers of shellfish and laver and merciless to wrecked vessels which they consider as their own by immemorial usage or rather right divine  significant how an agricultural people is generally as cruel to wrecked seamen as a fishing one is merciful  i could tell you twenty stories of the baysmen down there to the westward risking themselves like very heroes to save strangers lives and beating off the labouring folk who swarmed down for plunder from the inland hills  knowledge you see breeds sympathy and love  but what a merciless coast  hardly a winter passes without a wreck or two  you see there lying about the timbers of more than one tall ship  you see too that black rock awash far out at sea apparently a submarine outlier of the north horn of this wide rockamphitheatre below us  that is the morte stone the deathrock as the normans christened it of old and it does not belie its name even now  see how even in this calm it hurls up its column of spray at every wave and then conceive being entrapped between it and the cliffs on some blinding whirling winters night when the land is shrouded thick in clouds and the roar of the breakers hardly precedes by a minute the crash of your bows against the rocks  i never think on principle of things so painful and yet so irrelievable  yet why does not your muchadmired trinity house erect a light there  so ask the sailors for it is indeed one of the gatewayjambs of the channel and the deep water and the line of coast tempt all craft to pass as close to it as possible  look at that sheet of yellow sand below us now banked to the inland with sandhills and sunny downs and ending abruptly at the foot of that sombre wall of slatehill which runs out like a huge pier into the sea some two miles off  that is woollacombe  but here on our right is a sight worth seeing every gully and creek there among the rocks is yellow but not with sand  those are shells the sweepings of the ocean bed for miles around piled there millions upon millions yards deep in every stage of destruction  there they lie grinding to dust and every gale brings in fresh myriads from the inexhaustible seaworld as if death could be never tired of devouring or god of making  the brain grows dizzy and tired as ones feet crunch over the endless variety of their forms  and then one recollects that every one of them has been a living thinga whole history of birth and growth and propagation and death  waste it cannot be or cruelty on the part of the maker  but why this infinite development of life apparently only to furnish out of it now and then a cartload of shellsand to these lazy farmers but after all there is not so much life in all those shells put together as in one little child  and it may die the hour that it is born  what we call life is but an appearance and a becoming the true life of existence belongs only to spirits  and whether or not we or the seashell there are at any given moment helping to make up part of some pretty little pattern in this great kaleidoscope called the material universe yet in the spirit all live to him and shall do so for ever  and thereon he rambled off into a long lecture on speciesspirits and individualspirits and personal spirits doubtless most important  but i what between the sun the luncheon and the metaphysic sank into soft slumbers from which i was only awakened by the carriage stopping according to our order on the top of saunton hill  we left the fly and wandered down towards the old gabled court nestling amid huge walnuts in its southward glen while before us spread a panorama half sea half land than which perhaps our england owns few lovelier  at our feet was a sea of sandfor the halfmile to the right smooth as a floor bounded by a broad band of curling waves which crept slowly shorewards with the advancing tide  right underneath us the sand was drifted for miles into fantastic hills which quivered in the heat the glaring yellow of its lights chequered by delicate pink shadows and sheets of greygreen bent  to the left were rich alluvial marshes covered with red cattle sleeping in the sun and laced with creeks and flowery dykes and here and there a scarlet line which gladdened claudes eye as being a bit of positive colour in the foreground and mine because they were draining tiles beyond again two broad tiderivers spotted with white and redbrown sails gleamed like avenues of silver past knots of gay dwellings and tall lighthouses and churchtowers and wandered each on its own road till they vanished among the wooded hills  on the eastern horizon the dark range of exmoor sank gradually into lower and more broken ridges which rolled away woodland beyond woodland till all outlines were lost in purple haze while far beyond the granite peaks of dartmoor hung like a delicate blue cloud and enticed the eye away into infinity  from hence as our eyes swept round the horizon the broken hills above the rivers mouth gradually rose into the tableland of the barren coalmeasures some ten miles offa long straight wall of cliffs which hounded the broad bay buried in deepest shadow except where the opening of some glen revealed far depths of sunlit wood  a faint perpendicular line of white houses midway along the range marked our destination and far to the westward the land ended sheer and suddenly at the cliffs of hartland the promontory of hercules as the old romans called it to reappear some ten miles out in the atlantic in the blue flat topped island of lundy so exactly similar in height and form to the opposite cape that it required no scientific imagination to supply the vast gap which the primeval currents had sawn out  there it all lay beneath us like a map its thousand hues toned down harmoniously into each other by the summer haze and the eye was not filled with seeing nor the spirit with the intoxicating sight of infinitely various life and form in perfectest repose  i was the first to break the silence  claude wellbeloved will you not sketch a little  no answer  not even rhapsodize call it lovely exquisite grand majestic there are plenty of such words in worldlings mouthsnot a cockney but would burst out with some enthusiastic commonplace at such a sightsurely one or other of them must be appropriate  silence profane and take me away from this  let us go down and hide our stupidities among those sandhills and so forget the whole what use standing here to be maddened by this tantalizing earth spirit who shows us such glorious things and will not tell us what they mean  so down we went upon the burrows among the sands which hid from us every object but their own chaotic curves and mounds  above a hundred skylarks made the air ring with carollings strange and gaudy plants flecked the waste round us and insects without number whirred over our heads or hung poised with their wings outspread on the tall stalks of marram grass  all at once a cloud hid the sun and a summer whirlwind presage of the thunderstorm swept past us carrying up with it a column of dry sand and rattling the dry bents over our heads  what a chill doleful sigh comes from those reeds said claude  i can conceive this desert beneath a driving winters sky instead of this burning azure one of the most desolate places on the earth  ay desolate enough i said as we walked down beyond the tide mark over the vast fields of ribbed and splashy sands when the dead shells are rolling and crawling up the beach in wreaths before the gale with a ghastly rattle as of the dry bones in the valley of vision and when not a flower shows on that sandcliff which is now one broad bed of yellow scarlet and azure  that is the first spot in england said claude except of course the meads of golden kingcups where i have seen wild flowers give a tone to the colouring of the whole landscape as they are said to do in the prairies of texas  and look how flowers and cliff are both glowing in a warm green haze like that of cuyps wonderful sandcliff picture in the dulwich gallerywonderful as i think and true let some critics revile it as much as they will  strange that you should have quoted that picture here its curious resemblance to this very place first awoke in me years ago a living interest in landscapepainting  but look there even in these grand summer days there is a sight before us sad enough  there are the ribs of some illfated ship a manofwar too as the story goes standing like black fangs halfburied in the sand  and off what are those two ravens rising stirring up with their obscene wings a sickly putrescent odour  a corpse  no it was not a corpse but the token of many corpses  a fragment of some ship its gay green paint and halfeffaced gilding contrasting mockingly with the long ugly feathered barnacleshells which clustered on it rotting into slime beneath the sun and torn and scattered by the greedy beaks of the ravens  in what tropic tornado or on what coralkey of the bahamas months ago to judge by those barnacles had that tall ship gone down  how long had that scrap of wreck gone wandering down the gulf stream from newfoundland into the midatlantic and hitherward on its homeless voyage toward the spitzbergen shore  and who were all those living men who went down to hades even many stalwart souls of heroes to give no sign until the sea shall render up her dead  and every one of them had a father and mothera wife perhaps and children waiting for himat least a whole human life childhood boyhood manhood in him  all those years of toil and education to get him so far on his lifevoyage and here is the end thereof  say rather the beginning thereof claude answered stepping into the boat  this wreck is but a torn scrap of the chrysaliscocoon we may meet the butterflies themselves hereafter        and now we are on board and alas some time before the breeze will be so  take care of that huge boom landsman claude swaying and sweeping backwards and forwards across the deck unless you wish to be knocked overboard  take care too of that loose ropes end unless you wish to have your eyes cut out  take my advice lie down here across the deck as others are doing  cover yourself with greatcoats like an irishman to keep yourself cool and let us meditate little on this strange thing and strange place which holds us now  look at those spars how they creak and groan with every heave of the long glassy swell  how those sails flap and thunder and rage with useless outcries and strugglesonly because they are idle  let the wind take them and they will be steady silent in an instanttheir deafening dissonant grumbling exchanged for the soft victorious song of the breeze through the rigging musical selfcontented as of bird on bough  so it is through life there is no true rest but labour  no true misery as carlyle says but in that of not being able to work  some may call it a pretty conceit  i call it a great worldwide law which reaches from earth to heaven  whatever the preacher may have thought it in a moment of despondency what is it but a blessing that sun and wind and rivers and ocean as he says and all things are full of labourman cannot utter it this sea which bears us would rot and poison did it not sweep in and out here twice a day in swift refreshing current nay more in the very water which laps against our bows troops of negro girls may have hunted the purblind shark in west indian harbours beneath glaring whitewalled towns with their rows of green jalousies and cocoa nuts and shaddock groves  for on those white sands there to the left year by year are washed up foreign canes cassia beans and tropic seeds and sometimes too the tropic ocean snails with their fragile shells of amethystine blue come floating in mysteriously in fleets from the far west out of the passing gulf stream where they have been sailing out their little life never touching shore or ground but buoyed each by his cluster of airbubbles pumped in at will under the skin of his tiny foot by some cunning machinery of valvessmall creatures truly but very wonderful to men who have learned to reverence not merely the size of things but the wisdom of their idea and raising strange longings and dreams about that submarine oceanworld which stretches teeming with richer life than this terrestrial one away away there westward down the path of the sun toward the future centre of the worlds destiny  wonderful oceanworld threefifths of our planet  can it be true that no rational beings are denizens there  science is severely silenthaving as yet seen no mermaids  our captain there forward is not silentif he has not seen them plenty of his friends have  the young man here has been just telling me that it was only last month one followed a west indiaman right across the atlantic  for says he there must be mermaids and such like  do you think heaven would have made all that water there only for the herrings and mackerel  i do not know tom  but i too suspect not and i do know that honest mens guesses are sometimes found by science to have been prophecies and that there is no smoke without fire and few universal legends without their nucleus of fact  after all those sealadies are too lovely a dream to part with in a hurry at the mere despotic fiat of stern old dame analysis divine and reverend as she is  why like keatss lamia      must all charms flee at the mere touch of cold philosophy   who will not even condescend to be awestruck at the new wonders which she herself reveals daily  perhaps too according to the duke of wellingtons great dictum that each man must be the best judge in his own profession sailors may know best whether mermaids exist or not  besides was it not here on croyde sands abreast of us this very last summer that a maidenby which beautiful old word west country people still call young girlswas followed up the shore by a mermaid who issued from the breakers greenhaired goldencombed and all and fleeing home took to her bed and died poor thing of sheer terror in the course of a few days persisting in her account of the monster  true the mermaid may have been an overgrown lundy island seal carried out of his usual haunts by springtides and a school of fish  be it so  lundy and its seals are wonderful enough in all reason to thinking men as it looms up there out of the atlantic with its two great square headlands not twenty miles from us in the white summer haze  we will go there some day and pick up a wild tale or two about it  but lo a black line creeps up the western horizon  tom gesticulating swears that he sees a billow break  true  there they come the great white horses that champ and chafe and toss in the spray  that longbecalmed trawler to seaward fills and heels over and begins to tug and leap impatiently at the weight of her heavy trawl  five minutes more and the breeze will be down upon us the young men whistle openly to woo it the old father thinks such a superstition somewhat beneath both his years and his religion but cannot help pursing up his lips into a sly wheeugh when he has got well forward out of sight       five long minutes there is a breath of air a soft distant murmur the white horses curve their necks and dive and vanish and rise again like snowy porpoises nearer and nearer and nearer  father and sons are struggling with that raving riotous drunken squaresail forward while we haul away upon the mainsheet  when will it come  it is dying backsliding past us  hope deferred maketh the heart sick  no louder and nearer swells the voice of many waters the countless laugh of ocean like the mirth of ten thousand girls before us behind us round us and the oily swell darkens into crisp velvetgreen till the air strikes us and heels us over and leaping plunging thrashing our bows into the seas we spring away closehauled upon the everfreshening breeze while claude is holding on by ropes and bulwarks and some whose sealegs have not yet forgot their craft are swinging like a pendulum as they pace the deck enjoying as the norse vikings would have called it the gallop of the flying seahorse and the shiver of her tawny wings  exquisite motion more maddening than the smooth floating stride of the racehorse or the crash of the thornhedges before the stalwart hunter or the swaying of the firboughs in the gale when we used to climb as schoolboys after the lofty hawks nest but not so maddening as the new motion of our agethe rush of the expresstrain when the live iron pants and leaps and roars through the long chalk cutting and white mounds gleam cold a moment against the sky and vanish and rocks and grass and bushes fleet by in dim blended lines and the long hedges revolve like the spokes of a gigantic wheel and far below meadows and streams and homesteads with all their lazy old world life open for an instant and then flee away while awe struck silent choked with the mingled sense of pride and helplessness we are swept on by that great pulse of englands life blood rushing down her iron veins and dimly out of the future looms the fulfilment of our primaeval mission to conquer and subdue the earth and space too and time and all thingseven hardest of all tasks yourselves my cunning brothers ever learning some fresh lesson except that hardest one of all that it is the spirit of god which giveth you understanding  yes great railroads and great railroad age who would exchange you with all your sins for any other time  for swiftly as rushes matter more swiftly rushes mind more swiftly still rushes the heavenly dawn up the eastern sky  the night is far spent the day is at hand  blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find watching  but come my poor claude i see you are too sick for such deep subjects so let us while away the time by picking the brains of this tall handsome boy at the helm who is humming a lovesong to himself sotto voce lest it should be overheard by the greyheaded father who is forward poring over his wesleyan hymnbook  he will have something to tell you he has a soul in him looking out of those wild dark eyes and delicate aquiline features of his  he is no spade drudge or bulletheaded saxon clod  he has in his veins the blood of danish rovers and passionate southern milesians who came hither from teffrobani the isle of summer as the old fenic myths inform us come and chat with him  you dare not stir  perhaps you are in the right  i shall go and fraternize and bring you reports       he has been at all events up the straits as the mediterranean voyage is called here and seen palermy and the sicilians  but for his imagination what seems to have struck it most was that it was a fine place for jack for a man could get mools there for a matter of threehalfpence aday  and was that all you got out of him asked claude sickly and sulkily  oh you must not forget the halo of glory and excitement which in a sailors eyes surrounds the delights of horseback  but he gave me besides a long glowing account of the catechism which they had there threequarters of a mile long  pope piuss catechism i suppose  so thought i at first but it appeared that all the dead of the city were arranged therein dried and dressed out in their finest clothes every sect and age as tom said by itself as natural as life we may hence opine that he means some catacombs or other  poor claude could not even get up a smile  but his sorrows were coming swiftly to an end  the rock clefts grew sharper and sharper before us  the soft masses of the lofty bank of wooded cliff rose higher and higher  the white houses of clovelly piled stair above stair up the rocks gleamed more and more brightly out of the green round bosoms of the forest  as we shut in headland after headland one tall conical rock after another darkened with its black pyramid the bright orb of the setting sun  soon we began to hear the soft murmur of the snowy surf line then the merry voices of the children along the shore and running straight for the clifffoot we shipped into the little pier from whence the redsailed herringboats were swarming forth like bees out of a hive full of gay handsome faces and all the busy bluejacketed life of seaport towns to their nights fishing in the bay   ivclovelly   a couple of days had passed and i was crawling up the paved stairs inaccessible to cart or carriage which are flatteringly denominated clovellystreet a landingnet full of shells in one hand and a couple of mackerel lines in the other behind me a sheer descent roof below roof at an angle of 45 degrees to the pier and bay 200 feet below and in front another hundred feet above a green amphitheatre of oak and ash and larch shutting out all but a narrow slip of sky across which the low soft formless mist was crawling opening every instant to show some gap of intense dark rainy blue and send down a hot vaporous gleam of sunshine upon the white cottages with their grey steaming roofs and bright green railings packed one above another upon the ledges of the cliff and on the tall treefuchsias and gaudy dahlias in the little scraps of courtyard calling the rich faint odour out of the verbenas and jessamines and alas out of the herringheads and tails also as they lay in the rivulet and lighting up the wings of the gorgeous butterflies almost unknown in our colder eastern climate which fluttered from woodland down to garden and from garden up to woodland and seemed to form the connecting link between that swarming hive of human industry and the deep wild woods in which it was embosomed  so up i was crawling to dine off gurnards of my own catchingexcellent fish despised by deluded cockneys who fancy that because its head is large and prickly therefore its flesh is not as firm and sweet and white as that of any cod who ever gobbled shellfishwhen down the stair front of me greasy as ice from the daily shower came slipping and staggering my friend claude armed with campstool and portfolio  where have you been wandering today i asked  have you yet been as far as the park which as i told you would supply such endless subjects for your pencil  not i  i have been roaming up and down this same new road above us and find there materials for a good weeks more work if i could afford it  indeed it was only today for the first time that i got as far as the lodge at the end of it and then was glad enough to turn back shuddering at the first glimpse of the flat dreary moorland beyondas adam may have turned back into eden after a peep out of the gates of paradise  he should have taken courage and gone a halfmile furtherto the furzegrown ruins of a great roman camp which gives its name to the place clovellyvallum clausum or vallis clausa as antiquarians derive it perhaps the hidden camp or glenperhaps something else  who cares  the old romans were there at least 10000 strong and some sentimental tribune or other of them had taste enough to perch his summerhouse out on a conical point of the hartland cliffs now tumbling into the sea tesselated pavement baths and all  and strange work no doubt went on in that lonely nook looking out over the atlantic swellnights and days fit for petroniuss own pen among a seraglio of dark celtic beauties  perhaps it could not be otherwise  an ugly state of thingsas heathen conquests always must have been yet even in it there was a use and meaning  but they are past like a dream those 10000 stalwart men who looked far and wide over the damnonian moors from a station which would be even in these days a firstrate military position  gone too are the old saxon franklins who succeeded  old wrengils or some such name whoever he was at last found some ones bill too hard for his brainpan and there he lies on the hill above in his barrow of wrinklebury  and gone too the gay norman squire who as tradition says kept his fair lady in the old watchtower on the highest point of the white cliffgallantry bower as they call it to this daynow a mere ring of turfcovered stones and a few low stunted oaks shorn by the atlantic blasts into the shape of two huge cannon which form a favourite landmark for the fisherman of the bay  gone they all are cymry and roman saxon and norman and upon the ruins of their accumulated labour we stand here  each of them had his useplanted a few more trees or cleared a few more tilled a fresh scrap of down organized a scrap more of chaos  who dare wish the tide of improvement which has been flowing for nineteen centuries swifter and swifter still as it goes on to stop just because it is not convenient to us just now to move on  it will not take another nineteen hundred years be sure to make even this lovely nook as superior to what it is now as it is now to the little knot of fishing huts where naked britons peeped out trembling at the iron tramp of each insolent legionary from the camp above  it will not take another nineteen hundred years to develope the capabilities of this placeto make it the finest fishery in england next to torbay the only safe harbour of refuge for west indiamen along sixty miles of ruthless coastand a commercial centre for a vast tract of half tilled land within which only requires means of conveyance to be as fertile and valuable as ninetenths of england  meanwhile claude ought to have seen the deerpark  the panorama from that old ruined bower of cliff and woodland down and sea is really unique in its way  so is the whole place in my eyes said claude  i have seen nothing in england to be compared to this little strip of paradise between two great waste worlds of sea and moor  lynmouth might be matched among the mountains of wales and ireland  the first three miles of the rheidol from the devils bridge towards aberystwith or the gorge of the wye down the opposite watershed of the same mountains from castle dufferin down to rhaiadyr are equal to it in magnificence of form and colour and superior in size  but i question whether anything ever charmed me more than did the return to the sounds of nature which greeted me today as i turned back from the dreary silent moorland turnpike into this new road terraced along the cliffs and woodsthose who first thought of cutting it must have had souls in them above the herdand listened to a glorious concert in four parts blending and supporting each other in exquisite harmony from the shrill treble of a thousand birds and the soft melancholy alto of the moaning woods downward through the rich tenor hum of innumerable insects who hung like sparks of fire beneath the glades of oak to the bass of the unseen surge below   whose deep and dreadful organpipe   far below me contrasted strangely with the rich soft inland character of the deep woods luxuriant ferns and gaudy flowers  it is that very contrast which makes the place so unique  one is accustomed to connect with the notion of the sea bare cliffs breezy downs stunted shrubs struggling for existence  and instead of them behold a forest wall 500 feet high of almost semitropic luxuriance  at one turn a deep glen with its sea of green woods filled up at the mouth with the bright azure sheet of oceanthen some long stretch of the road would be banked on one side with crumbling rocks festooned with heath and golden hawkweed and london pride like velvet cushions covered with pink lace and beds of white bramble blossom alive with butterflies while above my head and on my right the cool canopy of oak and birch leaves shrouded me so close that i could have fancied myself miles inland buried in some glen unknown to any wind of heaven but that everywhere between green sprays and grey stems gleamed that same boundless ocean blue seeming from the height at which i was to mount into the very sky it looked but a step out of the leafy covert into blank infinity and then as the road wound round some point ones eye could fall down down through the abyss of perpendicular wood tree below tree clinging to and clothing the cliff or rather no cliff but perpendicular sheet of deep wood sedge and broad crown ferns spreading their circular fansbut there is no describing them or painting them eitherand then to see how the midday sunbeams leapt past one down the abyss throwing out here a grey stem by one point of burnished silver there a hazel branch by a single leaf of glowing golden green shooting long bright arrows down through the dim hot hazy atmosphere of the wood till it rested at last upon the dappled beach of pink and grey pebbles and the dappled surge which wandered up and down among them and broke up into richer intricacy with its chequerwork of woodland shadows the restless net of snowy foam  you must be fresh from reading mr ruskins book claude to be able to give birth to such a piece of complex magniloquence as that last period of yours  why i saw all that and ten thousand things more and yet do you complain of me for having tried to put one out of all those thousand things into words  and what do you mean by sneering at mr ruskin are there not in his books more and finer passages of descriptive poetrywordpaintingcall them what you will than in any other prose book in the english language  not a doubt of it my dear claude but it will not do for every one to try mr ruskins tools  neither you nor i possess that almost roman severity that stern precision of conception and expression which enables him to revel in the most gorgeous language without ever letting it pall upon the readers taste by affectation or over lusciousness  his style is like the very hills along which you have been travelling whose woods enrich without enervating the grand simplicity of their forms  the comparison is just said claude  mr ruskins style like those very hills and like too the norman cathedrals of which he is so fond is rather magnified than concealed by the innumerable multiplicity of its ornamental chasing and colouring  and is not that i asked the very highest achievement of artistic style  doubtless  the severe and grand simplicity of which folks talk so much is great indeed but only the greatest as long as men are still ignorant of natures art of draping her forms with colour chiaroscuro ornament not at the expense of the original design but in order to perfect it by making it appeal to every faculty instead of those of form and size alone  still you will allow the beauty of a bare rock a down a church spire a sheet or line of horizontal watertheir necessity to the completion of a landscape  i recollect well having the value of a stern straight line in nature brought home to me when during a long ride in the new forest after my eye had become quite dulled and wearied with the monotonous softness of rolling lawns feathery heath and rounded oak and beech woods i suddenly caught sight of the sharp peaked roof of rhinefield lodge and its row of tall stiff poplarspires cutting the endless sea of curves  the relief to my eye was delicious  i really believe it heightened the pleasure with which i reined in my mare for a chat with old toomer the keeper and the noble bloodhound who eyed me from between his masters legs  i can well believe it  simple lines in a landscape are of the same value as the naked parts of a richlyclothed figure  they act both as contrasts and as indications of the original substratum of the figure but to say that severe simplicity is the highest ideal is mere pedantry and manicheism  oh everything is manicheism with you claude  and no wonder while the world is as full of it now as it was in the thirteenth century  but let that pass  this craving after socalled classic art whether it be manicheism or not is certainly a fighting against goda contempt of everything which he has taught us artists since the introduction of christianity  i abominate this setting up of sculpture above painting of the greeks above the italiansas if all eastern civilization all christian truth had taught art nothingas if there was not more real beauty in a french cathedral or a venetian palazzo than in a dozen parthenons and more soul in one rafaelle or titian either than in all the greek statues of the tribune or vatican  you have changed your creed i see and like all converts are somewhat fierce and fanatical  you used to believe in zeuxis and parrhasius in old times  yes as long as i believed in fuselis lectures but when i saw at pompeii the ancient paintings which still remain to us my faith in their powers received its first shock and when i reread in the lectures of fuseli and his school all their extravagant praises of the greek painters and separated their few facts fairly out from among the floods of rant on which they floated i came to the conclusion that the ancients knew as little of colour or chiaroscuro as they did of perspective and as little of spiritual expression as they did of landscapepainting  what do i care for the birds pecking at zeuxiss grapes or zeuxis himself trying to draw back parrhasiuss curtain  imitative art is the lowest trickery  there are twenty men in england now capable of the same sleight of hand and yet these are recorded as the very highest triumphs of ancient art by the only men who have handed down to us any record of it  it may be so or again it may not  but do not fancy claude that classic sculpture has finished its work on earth  you know that it has taught you what gothic art could never teachthe ideal of physical health and strength  believe that it exists and will exist to remind the puny towndweller of the existence of that ideal to say to the artisan every time he looks upon a statuesuch god intended you to be such you may be such your class will be in some future healthy state of civilization when sanitary reform and social science shall be accepted and carried out as primary duties of a government toward the nation  surely classic sculpture remains as a witness of the primaeval paradise a witness that man and woman were created at first healthy and strong and fair and innocent just as classic literature remains for a witness that the heathen of old were taught of god that we have something to learn of them summed up in that now obsolete word virtuetrue and wholesome manhood which we are likely to forget and are forgetting daily under the enervating shadow of popular superstitions 287  and till we have learnt that may greek books still form the basis of our liberal education and may greek statues or even english attempts to copy them fill public halls and private houses  this generation may not understand their divine and eternal significance but a future generation doubt it not will spell it out right well  claude and i went forth along the cliffs of a park which though not of the largest is certainly of the loveliest in englandperhaps unique from that abrupt contact of the richest inland scenery with the open sea which is its distinctive feature  as we wandered along the edge of the cliff beneath us on our left lay wooded valleys lawns spotted with deer stately timber trees oak and beech birch and alder growing as full and roundheaded as if they had been buried in some shropshire valley fifty miles inland instead of having the atlantic breezes all the winter long sweeping past a few hundred feet above their still seclusion  glens of forest wound away into the high inner land with silver burns sparkling here and there under their deep shadows while from the lawns beneath the ground sloped rapidly upwards towards us to stop short in a sheer wall of cliff over which the deer were leaning to crop the shoots of ivy where the slipping of a stone would have sent them 400 feet perpendicular into the sea  on our right from our very feet the sea spread out to the horizon a single falcon was wheeling about the ledges below a single cormorant was fishing in the breakers diving and rising again like some tiny waterbeetle      the murmuring surge that on the unnumbered pebbles idly chafed could not be heard so high   the only sound beside the rustle of the fern before the startled deer was the soft mysterious treble of the wind as it swept over the face of the cliff beneath us but the cool air was confined to the hill tops round beneath from within a short distance of the shore the sea was shrouded in soft summer haze  the far atlantic lay like an ocean of white wool out of which the hartland cliffs and the highest point of lundy just showed their black peaks  here and there the western sun caught one white bank of mist after another and tinged them with glowing gold while nearer us long silvery zigzag tide lines which we could have fancied the tracks of waterfairies wandered away under the smoky greybrown shadows of the fog and seemed to vanish hundreds of miles off into the void of space so completely was all notion of size or distance destroyed by the soft gradations of the mist  suddenly as we stood watching a breeze from the eastward dived into the basin of the bay swept the clouds out packed them together rolled them over each other and hurled them into the air miles high in one cordillera of snowy mountains sailing slowly out into the atlantic and behold instead of the chaos of mist the whole amphitheatre of cliffs with their gay green woods and spots of bright red marl and cold black ironstone and the gleaming white sands of braunton and the hills of exmoor bathed in sunshine so near and clear we almost fancied we could see the pink heatherhue upon them and the bay one vast rainbow ten miles of flamecolour and purple emerald and ultramarine flecked with a thousand spots of flying snow  no one knows what gigantic effects of colour even our temperate zone can show till they have been in devonshire and cornwall and last but not least in irelandthe emerald isle in truth  no stayathome knows the colour of the sea till he has seen the west of england and no one either stayathome or traveller i suspect knows what the colour of a green field can be till he has seen it among the magic smiles and tears of an irish summer shower in county down  down we wandered from our height through trim walks and alleys green where the arbutus and gumcistus fringed the cliffs and through the deep glades of the park towards the delicious little cove which bounds ita deep crack in the wooded hills an old mill half buried in rocks and flowers a stream tinkling on from one rock basin to another towards the beach a sandy lawn gay with seaside flowers over which wild boys and barefooted girls were driving their ponies with panniers full of sand and as they rattled back to the beach for a fresh load standing upright on the backs of their steeds with one foot in each pannier at full trot over rocks and stones where a landsman would find it difficult to walk on his own legs  enraptured with the place and people claude pulled out his sketch book and sat down  what extraordinary rocks said he at length  how different from those cyclopean blocks and walls along the exmoor cliffs are these rich purple and olive ironstone layers with their sharp serrated lines and polished slabs set up on edge snapped bent double twisted into serpentine curves every sheet of cliff scored with sharp parallel lines at some fresh fantastic angle  yes there must have been strange work here when all these strata were being pressed and squeezed together like a ream of wet paper between the rival granite pincers of dartmoor and lundy  they must have suffered enough then in a few years to give them a fair right to lie quiet till doomsday as they seem likely to do  but it is only old mother earth who has fallen asleep hereabouts  air and sea are just as live as ever  ay lovely and calm enough spread beneath us there the broad semicircle of the bay but to know what it can be it should be seen as i have seen it when in the roaring december morning we have been galloping along the cliffs wreckhuntingone morning i can remember well how we watched from the hartland cliffs a great barque which came drifting and rolling in before the western gale while we followed her up the coast parsons and sportsmen farmers and preventive men with the manbys mortar lumbering behind us in a cart through stone gaps and trackways from headland to headlandthe maddening excitement of expectation as she ran wildly towards the cliffs at our feet and then sheered off again inexplicablyher foremast and bowsprit i recollect were gone short off by the deck a few rags of sail fluttered from her main and mizen  but with all straining of eyes and glasses we could discern no sign of man on board  well i recollect the mingled disappointment and admiration of the preventive men as a fresh set of salvors appeared in view in the form of a boats crew of clovelly fishermen how we watched breathlessly the little black speck crawling and struggling up in the teeth of the gale under the shelter of the land till when the ship had rounded a point into smoother water she seized on her like some tiny spider on a huge unwieldy fly and then how one still smaller black speck showed aloft on the mainyard and anotherand then the desperate efforts to get the topsail set and how we saw it tear out of their hands again and again and again and almost fancied we could hear the thunder of its flappings above the roar of the gale and the mountains of surf which made the rocks ring beneath our feetand how we stood silent shuddering expecting every moment to see whirled into the sea from the plunging yards one of those same tiny black specks in each one of which was a living human soul with sad women praying for him at home  and then how they tried to get her head round to the wind and disappeared instantly in a cloud of white sprayand let her head fall back againand jammed it round again and disappeared againand at last let her drive helplessly up the bay while we kept pace with her along the cliffs and how at last when she had been mastered and fairly taken in tow and was within two miles of the pier and all hearts were merry with the hopes of a prize which would make them rich perhaps for years to comeonethird i suppose of the whole value of her cargohow she broke loose from them at the last moment and rushed frantically in upon those huge rocks below us leaping great banks of slate at the blow of each breaker tearing off masses of ironstone which lie there to this day to tell the tale till she drove up high and dry against the cliff and lay like an enormous stranded whale grinding and crashing herself to pieces against the walls of her adamantine cage  and well i recollect the sad records of the logbook which was left on board the deserted ship how she had been waterlogged for weeks and weeks buoyed up by her timber cargo the crew clinging in the tops and crawling down when they dared for putrid biscuitdust and drops of water till the water was washed overboard and gone and then notice after notice on this day such an one died on this day such an one was washed awaythe log kept up to the last even when there was only that to tell by the stern businesslike merchant skipper whoever he was and how at last when there was neither food nor water the strong mans heart seemed to have quailed or perhaps risen into a prayer jotted down in the logthe lord have mercy on usand then a blank of several pages and scribbled with a famineshaken hand remember thy creator in the days of thy youthand so the log and the ship were left to the rats which covered the deck when our men boarded her and well i remember the last act of that tragedy for a ship has really as sailors feel a personality almost a life and soul of her own and as long as her timbers hold together all is not over  you can hardly call her a corpse though the human beings who inhabited her and were her soul may have fled into the far eternities and so we felt that night as we came down along the woodland road with the northwest wind hurling dead branches and showers of crisp oakleaves about our heads till suddenly as we staggered out of the wood we came upon such a piece of chiaroscuro as would have baffled correggio or rembrandt himself  under a wall was a long tent of sails and spars filled with preventive men fishermen lloyds underwriters lying about in every variety of strange attitude and costume while candles stuck in bayonethandles in the wall poured out a wild glare over shaggy faces and glittering weapons and piles of timber and rusty iron cable that glowed redhot in the light and then streamed up the glen towards us through the salt misty air in long fans of light sending fiery bars over the brown transparent oak foliage and the sad beds of withered autumn flowers and glorifying the wild flakes of foam as they rushed across the light stream into troops of tiny silver angels that vanished into the night and hid themselves among the woods from the fierce spirit of the storm  and then just where the glare of the lights and watch fires was most brilliant there too the black shadows of the cliff had placed the point of intensest darkness lightening gradually upwards right and left between the two great jaws of the glen into a chaos of grey mist where the eye could discern no form of sea or cloud but a perpetual shifting and quivering as if the whole atmosphere was writhing with agony in the clutches of the wind  the ship was breaking up and we sat by her like hopeless physicians by a deathbedside to watch the last struggleand the effects of the deceased  i recollect our literally warping ourselves down to the beach holding on by rocks and posts  there was a saddened awe struck silence even upon the gentleman from lloyds with the pen behind his ear  a sudden turn of the clouds let in a wild gleam of moonshine upon the white leaping heads of the breakers and on the pyramid of the blackchurch rock which stands in summer in such calm grandeur gazing down on the smiling bay with the white sand of braunton and the red cliffs of portledge shining through its two vast arches and against a slab of rock on the right for years afterwards discoloured with her paint lay the ship rising slowly on every surge to drop again with a piteous crash as the wave fell back from the cliff and dragged the roaring pebbles back with it under the coming wall of foam  you have heard of ships at the last moment crying aloud like living things in agony  i heard it then as the stumps of her masts rocked and reeled in her and every plank and joint strained and screamed with the dreadful tension  a horrible imagea human being shrieking on the rack rose up before me at those strange semihuman cries and would not be put awayand i tried to turn and yet my eyes were riveted on the black mass which seemed vainly to implore the help of man against the stern ministers of the omnipotent  still she seemed to linger in the deathstruggle and we turned at last away when lo a wave huger than all before it rushed up the boulders towards uswe had just time to save ourselvesa dull thunderous groan as if a mountain had collapsed rose above the roar of the tempest and we all turned with an instinctive knowledge of what had happened just in time to see the huge mass melt away into the boiling white and vanish for evermore  and then the very raving of the wind seemed hushed with awe the very breakers plunged more silently towards the shore with something of a sullen compunction and as we stood and strained our eyes into the gloom one black plank after another crawled up out of the darkness upon the head of the coming surge and threw itself at our feet like the corpse of a drowning man too spent to struggle more  there is another subject for a picture for you my friend claude but your gayer fancy will prefer the scene just as you are sketching it now as still and bright as if this coast had never seen the bay darkened with the grey columns of the waterspouts stalking across the waves before the northern gale and the tiny herringboats fleeing from their nets right for the breakers hoping more mercy even from those iron walls of rock than from the pitiless howling waste of spray behind them and that merry beach beside the town covered with shrieking women and old men casting themselves on the pebbles in fruitless agonies of prayer as corpse after corpse swept up at the feet of wife and child till in one case alone a single dawn saw upwards of sixty widows and orphans weeping over those who had gone out the night before in the fulness of strength and courage hardly an old playmate of mine but is drowned and gone   their graves are scattered far and wide    by mount by stream and sea   one poor little fellows face starts out of the depths of memory as fresh as ever my especial pet and birdnesting companion as a boya little delicate precocious largebrained child who might have written books some day if he had been a gentlemans son  but when his fathers ship was wrecked they found him left alone of all the crew just as he had been lashed into the rigging by loving and dying hands but cold and stiff the little soul beaten out of him by the cruel waves before it had time to show what growth there might have been in it  we will talk no more of such things  it is thankless to be sad when all heaven and earth are keeping holiday under the smile of god  and now let us return  at four oclock tomorrow morning you know we are to start for lundy   vlundy   it was four oclock on an august morning  our little party had made the sleeping streets ring with jests and greetings as it collected on the pier  some dozen young men and women sons and daughters of the wealthier coasting captains and owners of fishingsmacks chaperoned by our old landlord whose delicate and gentlemanlike features and figure were strangely at variance with the history of his lifedaring smuggler daring manofwar sailor and then most daring and successful of coastguardmen  after years of fighting and shipwreck and creeping for kegs of brandy after having seen too sight not to be forgottenthe walcheren dykes and the walcheren fever through weary months of pestilence he had come back with a little fortune of prizemoney to be a village oracle loving and beloved as gentle and courteous as if he had never stato al inferno and looked death in the face  heaven bless thee shrewd loyal heart a gentleman of gods making not unrecognized either by many of mens making  the other chaperone was a lady of gods making too one who might have been a st theresa had she been born there and then but as it was had been fated to become only the wesleyan abbess of the town and like deborah a mother in israel  with her tall slim queenly figure massive forehead glittering eyes features beaming with tenderness and enthusiasm and yet overcast with a peculiar expression of selfconsciousness and restraint well known to those who have studied the physiognomies of saints she seemed to want only the dress of some monastic order to make her the ideal of a mediaeval abbess watching with a halfpitying halfcomplacent smile the gambols of a group of innocent young worldlings  i saw claude gazing at her full of admiration and surprise which latter was certainly not decreased when as soon as all had settled themselves comfortably on board and the cutter was slipping quietly away under the magnificent deerpark cliffs the lady abbess pulling out her wesleyan hymnbook gave out the morning hymn apparently as a matter of course  with hardly a demur one sweet voice after another arose then a man gained courage and chimed in with a full harmonious bass then a rich sad alto made itself heard as it wandered in and out between the voices of the men and women and at last a wild mellow tenor which we discovered after much searching to proceed from the most unlikelylooking lips of an old dry weatherbleared mummified chrysalis of a man who stood aft steering with his legs and showing no sign of life except when he slowly and solemnly filled his nose with snuff  what strange people have you brought me among asked claude  i have been wondering ever since i came here at the splendid faces and figures of men women and children which popped out upon me from every door in that human rabbitburrow above  i have been in raptures at the gracefulness the courtesy the intelligence of almost everyone i meet and now to crown all everyone among them seems to be a musician  really you are not far wrong and you will find them as remarkable morally as they are physically and intellectually  the simplicity and purity of the women here put one more in mind of the valleys of the tyrol than of an english village  and in proportion to their purity i suppose said claude is their freedom and affectionateness  exactly  it would do your naturalist heart good claude to see a young fellow just lauded from a foreign voyage rolling up the street which we have just descended and availing himself of the immemorial right belonging to such cases of kissing and being kissed by every woman whom he meets young and old  you will find yourself here among those who are too simpleminded and too full of selfrespect to be either servile or uncourteous  i have found out already that liberty fraternity and equality in such company as this are infinitely pleasanter as well as cheaper than the aristocratic seclusion of a cutter hired for our own behoof  true and now you will not go home and as most tourists do say that you know a place without knowing the people who live in itas if the human inhabitants of a range of scenery were not among its integral and most important parts  what are copley fieldings south down landscapes incomplete without a halfstarved seven shillings aweek labourer in the foreground  honestly are they not a text without a sermon a premise without a conclusion  is it not partly because the land is down and not well tilled arable that the labourer is what he is  and yet perhaps the very absence of human beings in his vast sheets of landscape when one considers that they are scraps of great overcrowded scientific england in the nineteenth century is in itself the bitterest of satires  but hush there is another hymn commencing not to be the last by many        we had landed and laughed and scrambled eaten and drunk seen all the sights of lundy and heard all the traditions  are they not written in mr bamfields ilfracombe guide  why has not some one already written a fireandbrimstone romance about them  moresco castle or the pirate knight of the atlantic wave  what a title or againthe seal fiend or the nemesis of the scuttled west indiamanif i had paper and lubricite enough and that delightful carelessness of any moral or purpose except that of fine writing and moneymaking which possesses some modern scribblersi could tales unfoldbut neither pirate legends nor tales of cheated insurance offices nor wrecks and murders will make us understand lundywhat it is considered in its idea as the new argot is  it may be defined as a lighthousebearing island  the whole three miles of granite tableland seals seabirds and human beings are mere accidents and appendagesthe pedestal and the ornaments of that great white tower in the centre whose sleepless fiery eye blinks all night long over the nightmists of the atlantic  if as a wise man has said the days will come when our degenerate posterity will fall down and worship rusty locomotives and fossil electrictelegraphs the relics of their ancestors science grown to them mythic and impossible as the easterislanders bow before the colossal statues left by a nobler and extinct race then surely there will be pilgrimages to lundy and prayers to that white granite tower with its unglazed lantern and rusting machinery to light itself up again and help poor human beings  really my dear brothers i am not in jest  you seem but too likely nowadays to arrive at some such catastrophesentimental philosophy for the enlightened few and fetishworship of which nominally christian forms are as possible as heathen ones for the massesat that you may only too probably arriveunless you repent and get back your souls        we had shot along the cliffs a redlegged chough or two and one of the real black english rat exterminated on the mainland by the grey hanoverian newcomer and weary with sightseeing and scrambling we sat down to meditate on a slab of granite which hung three hundred feet in air above the western main  this is even more strange and new to me said claude at length than anything i have yet seen in this lovely west  i now appreciate ruskins advice to oilpainters to go and study the coasts of devon and cornwall instead of lingering about the muddy seas and tame cliffs of the channel and the german ocean  how clear and brilliant said i everything shows through this atlantic atmosphere  the intensity of colouring may vie with that of the shores of the mediterranean  the very raininess of the climate by condensing the moisture into an everchanging phantasmagoria of clouds leaves the clear air and sunshine when we do get a glimpse of them all the more pure and transparent  the distinctive feature of the scene is in my eyes the daring juxtaposition of large simple masses of positive colour  there are none of the misty enamelled tones of lynmouth or the luscious richness of clovelly  the forms are so simple and severe that they would be absolutely meagre were it not for the rich colouring with which nature has so lovingly made up for the absence of all softness all picturesque outline  one does not regret or even feel the want of trees here while the eye ranges down from that dappled cloud world above over that sheet of purple heather those dells bedded with dark green fern of a depth and richness of hue which i never saw beforeover those bright grey granite rocks spangled with black glittering mica and golden lichens to rest at last on that sea below which streams past the island in a swift roaring torrent of tide  sea claude say ocean  this is real atlantic blue here beneath us  no more severn mud no more grassgreen baywater but real ocean sapphiredark deep intense homeric purple it spreads away away there before us without a break or islet to the shores of america  you are sitting on one of the last points of europe and therefore all things round you are stern and strange with a barbaric pomp such as befits the boundary of a world  ay the very form of the cliffs shows them to be the breakwaters of a continent  no more fantastic curves and bands of slate such as harmonize so well with the fairyland which we left this morning the cliffs with their horizontal rows of cubical blocks seem built up by cyclopean hands  yet how symbolic is the difference between them and that equally cyclopic masonry of the exmoor coast  there every fracture is fresh sharpedged crystalline the wornout useless hills are dropping to pieces with their own weight  here each cube is delicately rounded off at the edges every crack worn out into a sinuous furrow like the scars of an everlasting warfare with the winds and waves  does it not raise strange longings in you said claude to gaze out yonder over the infinite calm and then to remember that beyond it lies americathe new world the future world the great titan baby who will be teeming with new athens and londons with new bacons and shakspeares newtons and goethes when this old wornout island will bewhat  oh when i look out here like a bird from its cage a captive from his dungeon and remember what lies behind me to what i must return tomorrowthe overpeopled babylon of misery and misrule puffery and covetousnessand there before me great countries untilled uncivilized unchristianized crying aloud for man to come and be man indeed and replenish the earth and subdue it oh that i had wings as a dove then would i flee away and be at rest  here lead me away my body is growing as dizzy as my mind i feel coming over me that horrible longing of which i have heard to leap out into empty space  how the blank air whispers be free how the broad sea smiles and calls with its ten thousand waves be freeas i live if you do not take me away i shall throw myself over the cliff  i did take him away for i knew the sensation and its danger well it has nothing to do with physical giddiness  those who are cliff bred and who never were giddy for an instant in their lives have often felt themselves impelled to leap from masts and treetops and cliffs and nothing but the most violent effort of will could break the fascination  i cannot but think by the bye that many a puzzling suicide might be traced to this same emotion acting on a weak and morbid brain  we returned to the little landing cove  the redsailed cutter lay sleeping below usfloating double ship and shadow  shoals of innumerable mackerel broke up making acres of water foam and sparkle round their silvery sides with a soft roar call it a bull if you like it is the only expression for that mysterious sound while among them the black head of a huge seal was slowly and silently appearing and vanishing as he got his dinner in a quiet business like way among the unhappy wanderers  we put off in the boat and just halfway from the cutter claude gave a start and the women a scream as the enormous brute quietly raised his head and shoulders out of the water ten yards off with a fish kicking in his mouth and the water running off his nose to take a deliberate stare at us after the fashion of seals whose ruling passion is curiosity  the sound of a musical instrument the sight of a man bathinganything in short which their small wits cannot explain at first sight is enough to make them forget all their cunning and thrust their heads suicidally into any danger and even so it fared with the black man as the girls in their first terror declared him to be  some fellows gun went offof itself i should like to believebut the whole charge disappeared into his sleek round visage knocking the mackerel from between his teeth and he turned over a sevenfoot lump of lifeless blubber  wretch cried claude as we dragged the seal into the boat where he lay with his head and arms hanging helplessly over the bows like a seasick alderman on board a margate steamer  what excuse can he give for such a piece of wanton cruelty  i assure you his skin and oil are very valuable  pishwas he thinking of skin and oil when he pulled the trigger or merely obeying the fleshly lust of destructivenessthe puppet of two bumps on the back of his head  my dear claude man is the microcosm and as the highest animal the ideal type of the mammalia he like all true types comprises in himself the attributes of all lower species  therefore he must have a tigervein in him my dear claude as well as a beavervein and a spidervein and no more shame to him  you are a butterfly that good fellow a beast of prey both may have their own work to do in this age just as they had in the old ones and if you do not like that explanation all i can say is i can sympathise with you and with him too  homo sumhumani nihil a me alienum puto  trim the boat lads or the seal will swamp us and like samson slay more in his death than ever he slew in his life  we slipped on homeward  the cliffwall of lundy stood out blacker and blacker every moment against the gay western sky greens greys and purples dyeing together into one deep rich monotone for which our narrow colourvocabulary has no word and threw a long cold shadow towards us across the golden sea suddenly above its dark ridge a wild wreath of low rack caught the rays of the setting sun and flamed up like a volcano towards the dun and purple canopy of upper clouds  before us the blue sea and the blue landline were fading into mournful grey on which one huge west indiaman blazed out orange and scarlet her crowded canvas all aflame from the truck to the waters edgea few moments and she too had vanished into the grey twilight and a chill nightwind crisped the sea  it was a relief to hear the evening hymn rise rich and full from one voice and then another and another till the men chimed in one by one and the whole cutter from stem to stern breathed up its melody into the silent night  but the hymn soon flaggedthere was more mirth on board than could vent itself in old charles wesleys words and one began to hum a song tune and then another with a side glance at the expression of the lady abbesss face till at last when a fair wife took courage and burst out with full pipe into the sea the sea the ice was fairly broken and among jests and laughter one merry harmless song after another rang out many of them to claudes surprise fashionable london ones which sounded strangely enough out there on the wild western sea  at lastclaude friend i whispered you must sing your share tooand mine also for that matter  what shall i sing  anything you will from the sublime to the ridiculous  they will understand and appreciate it as well as yourself  recollect you are not among bulletheaded south saxon clods but among wits as keen and imaginations as rich as those of any scotch shepherd or manchester operative  and up rose his exquisite tenor  this was his first song but it was not allowed to be his last german ballads italian opera airs were all just as warmly and perhaps far more sincerely appreciated as they would have been by any london eveningparty and the singing went on hour after hour as we slipped slowly on upon the tide till it grew late and the sweet voices died away one by one and then the liberty equality and fraternity which had reigned so pleasantly throughout the day took a new form as the women huddled together to sleep in each others arms and the men and we clustered forwards while from every mouth fragrant incense steamed upwards into the air  man a cooking animal my dear doctor johnsonpooh man is a smoking animal there is his ergon his differential energy as the aristotelians sayhis true distinction from the ourangoutang  ponder it well  the men were leaning on the trawl capstan while our old landlord with halfadozen pipes within a foot of his face droned out some long seayarn about ostend and muds and snowstorms and revenue cruisers going down stern foremost kegs of brandy and french prisons which i shall not repeat for indeed the public has been surfeited with seastories of late from many sufficiently dull ones up to the genial wisdom of peter simple and the gorgeous word painting of tom cringles log  and now the subject is stalethe old war and the wonders thereof have died away into the past like the men who fought in it and trafalgar and the bellerophon are replaced by manchester and mary barton  we have solved the old seagoing problems pretty wellthanks to wise englishhearted captain marryat now gone to his rest just when his work was done and we must turn round and face a few landgoing problems not quite so easy of solution  so claude and i thought as we leant over the sloops bows listening neither to the ostend story forwards nor the fortystanza ballad aft which the old steersman was moaning on careless of listeners to keep himself awake at the helm  forty stanzas or so we did count from curiosity the first line of each of which ended infallibly with   says the commodoore   and the third with   says the female smuggler   and then gave up in despair and watched in a dreamy tired halfsad mood the everlasting sparkle of the water as our bows threw it gently off in sheets of flame and tender curving lines of creamy fire that ran along the glassy surface and seemed to awaken the sea for yards round into glittering life as countless diamonds and emeralds and topazes leaped and ran and dived round us while we slipped slowly by and then a speck of light would show far off in the blank darkness and another and another and slide slowly up to usshoals of medusae every one of them a heaving globe of flame and some unseen guillemot would give a startled squeak or a shearwater close above our heads suddenly stopped the yarn and raised a titter among the men by his ridiculously articulate and not overcomplimentary cry and then a foxs bark from the cliffs came wild and shrill although so faint and distant or the lazy gaff gave a sad uneasy creak and then a soft warm air laden with heather honey and fragrant odours of sedge and birch and oak came sighing from the land while all around us was the dense blank of the night except where now and then some lonely gleam through the southern clouds showed the clifftops on our rightit was all most unearthly dreamlike a strange phantasmagoria like some scene from the ancient marinerall the world shut out silent invisible and we floating along there alone like a fairy ship creeping through chaos and the unknown limbo  was it an evil thought that rose within me as i said to claudeis not this too like life  our only light the sparkles that rise up round us at every step and die behind us and all around and all before the great black unfathomable eternities  a few souls brought together as it were by chance for a short friendship and mutual dependence in this little ship of earth so soon to land her passengers and break up the company for ever  he smiled  there is a devils meaning to everything in nature and a gods meaning too  your friends the zoologists have surely taught you better than that  as i read natures parable tonight i find nothing in it but hope  what if there be darkness the sun will rise tomorrow  what if there seem a chaos  the great organic world is still living and growing and feeding unseen by us all the black night through and every phosphoric atom there below is a sign that even in the darkest night there is still the power of light ready to flash out wherever and however it is stirred  does the age seem to you dark  do you too feel as i do at times the awful sadness of that textthe time shall come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the lord and shall not see it  then remember that   the night is never so long but at last it ringeth for matin song   and even as it is around us here so it is in the world of men  the night is peopled not merely with phantoms and wizards superstitions and spirits of evil but under its shadow all sciences methods social energies are taking rest and growing and feeding unknown to themselves that they may awake into a new life and intermarry and beget children nobler than themselves when the dayspring from on high comes down  even now see the dawn is gilding the highest souls as it is those exmoor peaks afar and we are in the night only because we crawl below  what if we be unconscious of all the living energies which are fermenting round us now  have you not shown me in this last week every moorland pool every drop of the summer sea alive with beautiful organizations multiplying as fast as the thoughts of man  is not every leaf breathing still every sap vein drinking still though we may not see them  even so is the kingdom of god like seed sown in the ground and men rise and lie down and sleep and it groweth up they know not how  we both fell into a reverie  the story and the ballad were finished and not a sound broke the silence except the screaming of the sea fowl which led my thoughts wandering back to nights long past when we dragged the seine up to our chins in water through the short midsummer night and scrambled and rolled over on the beach in boyish glee after the skate and mullet with those now gone and as i thought and thought old voices seemed to call me old faces looked at me of playmates and those nearer than playmates now sleeping in the deep deep sea amid far coral islands and old figures seemed to glide out of the mysterious dark along the still sea floor as if the ocean were indeed giving up her dead  i shook myself turned away and tried to persuade myself that i was dreaming  perhaps i had been doing so  at least i remember very little more till i was roused by the rattling of the chaincable through the hawsehole opposite the pierhead  and now gentle readers farewell and farewell clovelly and all the loving hearts it holds and farewell too the soft still summer weather  claude and i are taking our last walk together along the deerpark cliffs  lundy is shrouded in the great grey fan of dappled haze which streams up from the westward dimming the sickly sun there is not

avantcourriers of groundswell  six hours more and the storm which has been sweeping over the still vexed bermoothes and bending the tall palms on west indian isles will be roaring through the oak
