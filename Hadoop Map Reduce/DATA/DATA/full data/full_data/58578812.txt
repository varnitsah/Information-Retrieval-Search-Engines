58578812	deep waters  by ww jacobs     the substitute  the night watchman had just returned to the office fire after leaving it to attend a ring at the wharf bell  he sat for some time puffing fiercely at his pipe and breathing heavily  boys he said at last  thats the third time this week and yet if i was to catch one and skin im alive i suppose i should get into trouble over it  even is own father and mother would make a fuss most like some people have boys and other people ave the trouble of em  our streets full of em and the way they carry on would make a monkeyouse ashamed of itself  the man next door to mes got seven of em and when i spoke to im friendly about it over a pint one night he put the blame on is wife  the worst boy i ever knew used to be officeboy in this ere office and i cant understand now why i wasnt ung for him  undersized little chap he was with a face the colour o bad piecrust and two little black eyes like shoebuttons  to see im with his little white cuffs and a standup collar and a little black bow and a little bowlerat was enough to make a cat laugh  i told im so one day and arter that we knew where we was  both of us  by rights he ought to ave left the office at sixjust my time for coming on  as it was he used to stay late purtending to work ard so as to get a rise  arter all the clerks ad gorn ome he used to sit perched up on a stool yards too igh for him with one eye on the ledger and the other looking through the winder at me  i remember once going off for arf a pint and when i come back i found im with a policeman two carmen and all the hands off of the maid marian standing on the edge of the jetty waiting for me to come up  he said that not finding me on the wharf e made sure that i must ave tumbled overboard as he felt certain that i wouldnt neglect my dooty while there was breath in my body but e was sorry to find e was mistook  he stood there talking like a little clergyman until one of the carmen knocked his at over is eyes and then he forgot imself for a bit  arter that i used to wait until he ad gorn afore i ad my arfpint  i didnt want my good name taken away and i had to be careful and manys the good arfpint i ad to refuse because that little imitation monkey was sitting in the office drawing faces on is blottingpaper  but sometimes it dont matter ow careful you are you make a mistake  there was a little steamer called the eastern monarch used to come up here in them days once a week  fat little tub she was with a crew o fattish old men and a skipper that i didnt like  hed been in the coasting trade all is life while ive knocked about all over the world but to hear im talk youd think he knew more about things than i did  eddication bill he ses one evening thats the thing  you cant argufy without it you only talk foolish like you are doing now  theres eddication and theres common sense i ses  some people as one and some people as the other  give me common sense  thats wot you want he ses nodding  and o course i ses looking at im theres some people asnt got either one or the other  the officeboy came out of the office afore he could think of an answer and the pair of em stood there talking to show off their cleverness till their tongues ached  i took up my broom and went on sweeping and they was so busy talking long words they didnt know the meaning of to each other that they was arf choked with dust afore they noticed it when they did notice it they left off using long words and the skipper tried to hurt my feelings with a few short ones e knew  its no good wasting your breath on im ses the boy  you might as well talk to a beerbarrel  he went off dusting imself down with his little pocketankercher and arter the skipper ad told me wot hed like to do only he was too sorry for me to do it e went back to the ship to put on a clean collar and went off for the evening  he always used to go off by hisself of a evening and i used to wonder ow he passed the time  then one night i found out  i had just come out of the bears head and stopped to look round afore going back to the wharf when i see a couple o people standing on the swingbridge saying goodbye to each other  one of em was a man and the other wasnt  evening capn i ses as he came towards me and gave a little start i didnt know you ad brought your missis up with you this trip  evening bill he ses very peaceful  wot a lovely evening  beeutiful i ses  so fresh ses the skipper sniffing in some of the air  makes you feel quite young agin i ses  he didnt say nothing to that except to look at me out of the corner of is eye and stepping on to the wharf had another look at the sky to admire it and then went aboard his ship  if he ad only stood me a pint and trusted me things might ha turned out different  quite by chance i happened to be in the bears head a week arterwards and quite by chance as i came out i saw the skipper saying goodbye on the bridge agin  he seemed to be put out about something and when i said wot a lovely evening it would be if only it wasnt raining ard he said something about knocking my ead off  and you keep your nose out o my bisness he ses very fierce  your bisness i ses  wot bisness  theres some people as might like to know that you leave the wharf to look arter itself while youre sitting in a pub swilling gallons and gallons o beer he ses in a nasty sort o way  live and let live thats my motter  i dont know wot youre talking about i ses but it dont matter anyways  ive got a clear conscience thats the main thing  im as open as the day and theres nothing about me that id mind anybody knowing  wot a pity it is everybody cant say the same  i didnt see im saying goodbye the next week or the week arter that either but the third week arter just calling in at the bears head i strolled on casuallike and got as far as the bottom of tower hill afore i remembered myself  turning the corner i amost fell over the skipper wot was right in the fair way shaking ands with his ladyfriend under the lamppost  both of em started and i couldnt make up my mind which gave me the most unpleasant look  peepbo i ses cheerfullike  he stood making a gobbling noise at me like a turkey  give me quite a start you did i ses  i didnt dream of you being there  get off he ses spluttering  get off afore i tear you limb from limb  ow dare you follow me about and come spying round corners at me wot dye mean by it  i stood there with my arms folded acrost my chest as calm as a cucumber  the other party stood there watching us and wot e could ave seen in her i cant think  she was dressed more like a man than a woman and it would have taken the good looks of twenty like her to ave made one barmaid  i stood looking at er like a man in a dream  well will you know me agin she ses in a nasty cracked sort of voice  i could pick you out of a million i sesif i wanted to  clear out ses the skipper  clear out  and thank your stars theres a lady present  dont take no notice of im captain pratt ses the lady  hes beneath you  you only encourage people like that by taking notice of em  goodbye  she held out her and and while the skipper was shaking it i began to walk back to the wharf  i adnt gorn far afore i heard im coming up behind me and next moment e was walking alongside and saying things to try and make me lose my temper  ah its a pity your pore missis cant ear you i ses  i expect she thinks you are stowed away in your bunk dreaming of er instead of saying things about a face as dont belong to you  you mind your bisness he ses shouting  and not so much about my missis  dye hear  wots it got to do with you  who asked you to shove your oar in  youre quite mistook i ses very calm  id no idea that there was anything on as shouldnt be  i was never more surprised in my life  if anybody ad told me i shouldnt ave believed em  i couldnt  knowing you and knowing ow respectable you ave always purtended to be and also and likewise that you aint no chicken  i thought e was going to ave a fit  he opped about waving his arms and stuttering and going on in such a silly way that i didnt like to be seen with im  twice he knocked my at off and arter telling him wot would appen if e did it agin i walked off and left him  even then e wasnt satisfied and arter coming on to the wharf and following me up and down like a little dog he got in front of me and told me some more things he ad thought of  if i catch you spying on me agin he ses youll wish youd never been born  you get aboard and ave a quiet sleep i ses  youre wandering in your mind  the lady you saw me with he ses looking at me very fierce is a friend o mine that i meet sometimes for the sake of her talk  talk i ses staring at im  talk  wot cant one woman talk enough for you  is your missis dumb or wot  you dont understand he ses cocking up is nose at me  shes a interleckshal woman full of eddication and information  when my missis talks she talks about the price o things and says she must ave more money  or else she talks about things ive done or sometimes things i avent done  its all one to her  theres no pleasure in that sort o talk  it dont help a man  i never eard of any talk as did i ses  i dont suppose you did he ses sneeringlike  now tonight fust of all we talked about the house of lords and whether it ought to be allowed and arter that she gave me quite a little lecture on insecks  it dont seem proper to me i ses  i ave spoke to my wife about em once or twice but i should no more think of talking about such things to a single lady  he began to jump about agin as if id bit im and he ad so much to say about my ed and blocks of wood that i pretty near lost my temper  i should ha lost it with some men but e was a very stiffbuilt chap and as hard as nails  beers your trouble he ses at last  fust of all you put it down and then it climbs up and soaks wot little brains youve got  wot you want is a kind friend to prevent you from getting it  i dont know wot it was but i ad a sort of sinking feeling inside as e spoke and next evening when i saw im walk to the end of the jetty with the officeboy and stand there talking to im with his and on his shoulder it came on worse than ever  and i put two and two together when the guvnor came up to me next day and arter talking about dooty and ow easy it was to get nightwatchmen mentioned in a offand sort of way that if i left the wharf at all between six and six i could stay away altogether  i didnt answer im a word  i might ha told im that there was plenty of people arter me ready to give me double the money but i knew he could never get anybody to do their dooty by the wharf like i ad done so i kept quiet  its the way i treat my missis nowadays and it pays in the old days i used to waste my breath answering er back  i wouldnt ha minded so much if it adnt ha been for that boy  he used to pass me as e went off of a evening with a little sly smile on is ugly little face and sometimes when i was standing at the gate hed give a sniff or two and say that he could smell beer and he supposed it came from the bears head  it was about three weeks arter the guvnor ad forgot imself and i was standing by the gate one evening when i saw a woman coming along carrying a big bag in her and  i adnt seen er afore and when she stopped in front of me and smiled i was on my guard at once  i dont smile at other people and i dont expect them to smile at me  at last she ses setting down er bag and giving me another smile i thought i was never going to get ere  i coughed and backed inside a little bit on to my own ground  i didnt want to ave that little beast of a officeboy spreading tales about me  ive come up to ave a little fling she ses smiling away harder than ever  my husband dont know im ere  he thinks im at ome  i think i went back pretty near three yards  i come up by train she ses nodding  yes i ses very severe and wot about going back by it  oh i shall go back by ship she ses  wot time do you expect the eastern monarch up  well i ses ardly knowing wot to make of er she ought to be up this tide but theres no reckoning on wot an old washtub with a engine like a sewingmachine inside er will do  oh indeed she ses leaving off smiling very sudden  oh indeed my husband might ave something to say about that  your usband i ses  captain pratt she ses drawing erself up  im mrs pratt  he left yesterday morning and ive come up ere by train to give im a little surprise  you might ha knocked me down with a feather and i stood there staring at her with my mouth open trying to think  take care i ses at last  take care as you dont give im too much of a surprise  wot do you mean she ses firing up  nothing i ses  nothing only ive known usbands in my time as didnt like being surprisedthats all  if you take my advice youll go straight back home agin  ill tell im wot you say she ses as soon as is ship comes in  thats a woman all over the moment they get into a temper they want to hurt somebody and i made up my mind at once that if anybody was going to be urt it wasnt me  and besides i thought it might be for the skippers goodin the long run  i broke it to her as gentle as i could  i didnt tell er much i just gave her a few ints  just enough to make her ask for more  and mind i ses i dont want to be brought into it  if you should appen to take a fancy into your ed to wait behind a pile of empties till the ship comes in and then slip out and foller your usband and give im the little surprise you spoke of its nothing to do with me  i understand she ses biting her lip  theres no need for im to know that ive been on the wharf at all  i gave er a smilei thought she deserved itbut she didnt smile back  she was rather a nicelooking woman in the ordinary way but i could easy see ow temper spoils a womans looks  she stood there giving little shivers and looking as if she wanted to bite somebody  ill go and hide now she ses  not yet i ses  youll ave to wait till that little blackbeetle in the office as gorn blackbeetle she ses staring  officeboy i ses  hed better not see you at all  spose you go off for a bit and come back when i whistle  afore she could answer the boy came out of the office ready to go ome he gave a little bit of a start when e saw me talking to a lady and then e nips down sudden about a couple o yards away and begins to do is bootlace up  it took im some time because he ad to undo it fust but e finished it at last and arter a quick look at mrs pratt and one at me that i could ha smacked his ed for e went off whistling and showing is little cuffs  i stepped out into the road and watched im out o sight  then i told mrs pratt to pick up er bag and foller me  as it appened there was a big pile of empties in the corner of the wareouse wall just opposite the eastern monarchs berth  it might ha been made for the job and arter i ad tucked her away behind and given er a box to sit on i picked up my broom and began to make up for lost time  she sat there as quiet as a cat watching a mouseole and i was going on with my work stopping every now and then to look and see whether the monarch was in sight when i appened to turn round and see the office boy standing on the edge of the wharf with his back to the empties looking down at the water  i nearly dropped my broom  ullo i ses going up to im  i thought you ad gorn ome  i was going he ses with a nasty oily little smile and then it struck me all of a sudden ow lonely it was for you all alone ere and i come back to keep you company  he winked at something acrost the river as e spoke and i stood there thinking my ardest wot was the best thing to be done  i couldnt get mrs pratt away while e was there besides which i felt quite sartain she wouldnt go  the only ope i ad was that hed get tired of spying on me and go away before he found out she was iding on the wharf  i walked off in a unconcerned waynot too farand with one eye on im and the other on where mrs pratt was iding went on with my work theres nothing like ard work when a man is worried and i was amost forgetting my troubles when i looked up and saw the monarch coming up the river  she turned to come into er berth with the skipper shouting away on the bridge and making as much fuss as if e was berthing a liner  i helped to make er fast and the skipper arter e had ad a good look round to see wot e could find fault with went below to clean imself  he was up agin in about ten minutes with a clean collar and a clean face and a blue necktie that looked as though it ad got yeller measles  good temper e was in too and arter pulling the officeboys ear gentle as e was passing he stopped for a moment to ave a word with im  bit late aint you he ses  ive been keeping a eye on the watchman ses the boy  he works better when e knows theres somebody watching im  look ere i ses  you take yourself off ive had about enough of you  you take your little face ome and ask your mother to wipe its nose  strickly speaking youve no right to be on the wharf at all at this time  ive as much right as other people he ses giving me a wicked look ive got more right than some people praps  he stooped down deliberate and picking up a bit o coke from the eap by the crane pitched it over at the empties  stop that i ses shouting at im  what for e ses shying another piece  why shouldnt i  cos i wont ave it i ses  dye hear  stop it  i rushed at im as he sent another piece over and for the next two or three minutes e was dodging me and chucking coke at the empties with the fool of a skipper standing by laughing and two or three of the crew leaning over the side and cheering im on  all right he ses at last dusting is hands together  ive finished  theres no need to make such a fuss over a bit of coke  youve wasted pretty near arf a underedweight i ses  ive a good mind to report you  dont do that watchman he ses in a pitiful voice  dont do that ere i tell you wot ill do  ill pick it all up agin  afore i could move and or foot he ad shifted a couple o cases out of is way and was in among the empties  i stood there dazedlike while two bits o coke came flying back past my ed then i eard a loud whistle and e came out agin with is eyes rolling and is mouth wide open  wots the matter ses the skipper staring at im  iiim sorry watchman ses that beast of a boy purtending e was ardly able to speak  id no idea  all right i ses very quick  wots the matter ses the skipper agin and as e spoke it came over me like a flash wot a false persition i was in and wot a nastytempered man e could be when e liked  why didnt you tell me youd got a ladyfriend there ses the boy shaking his ed at me  why i might ave hit er with a bit o coke and never forgiven myself  ladyfriend ses the skipper with a start  oh bill i am surprised  my throat was so dry i couldnt ardly speak  its my missis i ses at last  your missis ses the skipper  woes she iding behind there for  sheshes shy i ses  always was all er life  she cant bear other people  she likes to be alone with me  oh watchman ses the boy  i wonder where you expect to go to  missis my grandmother ses the skipper with a wink  im going to ave a peep  stand back i ses pushing im off  i dont spy on you and i dont want you to come spying on me  you get off  dye hear me  get off  we had a bit of a struggle till my foot slipped and while i was waving my arms and trying to get my balance back e made a dash for the empties next moment he was roaring like a mad bull that ad sat down in a sorsepan of boiling water and rushing back agin to kill me  i believe that if it adnt ha been for a couple o lightermen wot ad just come on to the jetty from their skiff and two of his own ands hed ha done it  crazy with passion e was and it was all the four of em could do to hold im  every now and then hed get a yard nearer to me and then theyd pull im back a couple o yards and beg of im to listen to reason and ear wot i ad to say  and as soon as i started and began to tell em about is ladyfriend he broke out worse than ever people acrost the river must ha wondered wot was appening  there was two lightermen two sailormen me and the skipper and mrs pratt all talking at once and nobody listening but the officeboy  and in the middle of it all the wicket was pushed open and the ed of the lady wot all the trouble was about peeped in and drew back agin  there you are i ses shouting my ardest  there she is  thats the lady i was telling you about  now then put em face to face and clear my character  dont let er escape  one o the lightermen let go o the skipper and went arter er and just as i was giving the other three a helping and e came back with er  mrs pratt caught er breath and as for the skipper e didnt know where to look as the saying is  i just saw the lady give im one quick look and then afore i could dream of wot was coming she rushes up to me and flings er long bony arms round my neck  why william she ses wots the matter  why didnt you meet me didnt you get my letter  or ave you ceased to care for me  let go i ses struggling  let go  dye ear  wot dye mean by it youve got old of the wrong one  oh william she ses arf strangling me  ow can you talk to me like that  wheres your art  i never knew a woman so strong  i dont suppose shed ever ad the chance of getting er arms round a mans neck afore and she hung on to me as if shed never let go  and all the time i was trying to explain things to them over er shoulder i could see they didnt believe a word i was saying  one o the lightermen said i was a wonder and the other said i was a fair coughdrop me  she got tired of it at last but by that time i was so done up i couldnt say a word  i just dropped on to a box and sat there getting my breath back while the skipper forgave is wife for er unjust suspicions of imbut told er not to do it aginand the officeboy was saying id surprised even im  the last i saw of the ladyfriend the two lightermen was helping er to walk to the gate and the two sailormen was follering er up behind carrying er pocketankercher and upberella
