making coffeeberries out of clay but he was an honest man and would not himself engage in the manufacture he was therefore only moderately wealthy his royalties from his really valuable invention bringing him hardly enough to pay his expenses of litigation with rogues guilty of infringement so i lacked many advantages enjoyed by the children of unscrupulous and dishonorable parents and had it not been for a noble and devoted mother who neglected all my brothers and sisters and personally supervised my education should have grown up in ignorance and been compelled to teach school to be the favorite child of a good woman is better than gold  when i was nineteen years of age my father had the misfortune to die he had always had perfect health and his death which occurred at the dinner table without a moments warning surprised no one more than himself he had that very morning been notified that a patent had been granted him for a device to burst open safes by hydraulic pressure without noise the commissioner of patents had pronounced it the most ingenious effective and generally meritorious invention that had ever been submitted to him and my father had naturally looked forward to an old age of prosperity and honor his sudden death was therefore a deep disappointment to him but my mother whose piety and resignation to the will of heaven were conspicuous virtues of her character was apparently less affected at the close of the meal when my poor fathers body had been removed from the floor she called us all into an adjoining room and addressed us as follows  my children the uncommon occurrence that you have just witnessed is one of the most disagreeable incidents in a good mans life and one in which i take little pleasure i assure you i beg you to believe that i had no hand in bringing it about of course she added after a pause during which her eyes were cast down in deep thought of course it is better that he is dead  she uttered this with so evident a sense of its obviousness as a selfevident truth that none of us had the courage to brave her surprise by asking an explanation my mothers air of surprise when any of us went wrong in any way was very terrible to us one day when in a fit of peevish temper i had taken the liberty to cut off the babys ear her simple words john you surprise me appeared to me so sharp a reproof that after a sleepless night i went to her in tears and throwing myself at her feet exclaimed mother forgive me for surprising you so now we allincluding the oneeared babyfelt that it would keep matters smoother to accept without question the statement that it was better somehow for our dear father to be dead my mother continued  i must tell you my children that in a case of sudden and mysterious death the law requires the coroner to come and cut the body into pieces and submit them to a number of men who having inspected them pronounce the person dead for this the coroner gets a large sum of money i wish to avoid that painful formality in this instance it is one which never had the approval ofof the remains johnhere my mother turned her angel face to meyou are an educated lad and very discreet you have now an opportunity to show your gratitude for all the sacrifices that your education has entailed upon the rest of us john go and remove the coroner  inexpressibly delighted by this proof of my mothers confidence and by the chance to distinguish myself by an act that squared with my natural disposition i knelt before her carried her hand to my lips and bathed it with tears of sensibility before five oclock that afternoon i had removed the coroner  i was immediately arrested and thrown into jail where i passed a most uncomfortable night being unable to sleep because of the profanity of my fellowprisoners two clergymen whose theological training had given them a fertility of impious ideas and a command of blasphemous language altogether unparalleled but along toward morning the jailer who sleeping in an adjoining room had been equally disturbed entered the cell and with a fearful oath warned the reverend gentlemen that if he heard any more swearing their sacred calling would not prevent him from turning them into the street after that they moderated their objectionable conversation substituting an accordion and i slept the peaceful and refreshing sleep of youth and innocence  the next morning i was taken before the superior judge sitting as a committing magistrate and put upon my preliminary examination i pleaded not guilty adding that the man whom i had murdered was a notorious democrat my good mother was a republican and from early childhood i had been carefully instructed by her in the principles of honest government and the necessity of suppressing factional opposition the judge elected by a republican ballotbox with a sliding bottom was visibly impressed by the cogency of my plea and offered me a cigarette  may it please your honor began the district attorney i do not deem it necessary to submit any evidence in this case under the law of the land you sit here as a committing magistrate it is therefore your duty to commit testimony and argument alike would imply a doubt that your honor means to perform your sworn duty that is my case  my counsel a brother of the deceased coroner rose and said may it please the court my learned friend on the other side has so well and eloquently stated the law governing in this case that it only remains for me to inquire to what extent it has been already complied with it is true your honor is a committing magistrate and as such it is your duty to commitwhat that is a matter which the law has wisely and justly left to your own discretion and wisely you have discharged already every obligation that the law imposes since i have known your honor you have done nothing but commit you have committed embracery theft arson perjury adultery murderevery crime in the calendar and every excess known to the sensual and depraved including my learned friend the district attorney you have done your whole duty as a committing magistrate and as there is no evidence against this worthy young man my client i move that he be discharged  an impressive silence ensued the judge arose put on the black cap and in a voice trembling with emotion sentenced me to life and liberty then turning to my counsel he said coldly but significantly  i will see you later  the next morning the lawyer who had so conscientiously defended me against a charge of murdering his own brotherwith whom he had a quarrel about some landhad disappeared and his fate is to this day unknown  in the meantime my poor fathers body had been secretly buried at midnight in the back yard of his late residence with his late boots on and the contents of his late stomach unanalyzed he was opposed to display said my dear mother as she finished tamping down the earth above him and assisted the children to litter the place with straw his instincts were all domestic and he loved a quiet life  my mothers application for letters of administration stated that she had good reason to believe that the deceased was dead for he had not come home to his meals for several days but the judge of the crowbait courtas she ever afterward contemptuously called itdecided that the proof of death was insufficient and put the estate into the hands of the public administrator who was his soninlaw it was found that the liabilities were exactly balanced by the assets there was left only the patent for the device for bursting open safes without noise by hydraulic pressure and this had passed into the ownership of the probate judge and the public administratoras my dear mother preferred to spell it thus within a few brief months a worthy and respectable family was reduced from prosperity to crime necessity compelled us to go to work  in the selection of occupations we were governed by a variety of considerations such as personal fitness inclination and so forth my mother opened a select private school for instruction in the art of changing the spots upon leopardskin rugs my eldest brother george henry who had a turn for music became a bugler in a neighboring asylum for deaf mutes my sister mary maria took orders for professor pumpernickels essence of latchkeys for flavoring mineral springs and i set up as an adjuster and gilder of crossbeams for gibbets the other children too young for labor continued to steal small articles exposed in front of shops as they had been taught  in our intervals of leisure we decoyed travelers into our house and buried the bodies in a cellar  in one part of this cellar we kept wines liquors and provisions from the rapidity of their disappearance we acquired the superstitious belief that the spirits of the persons buried there came at dead of night and held a festival it was at least certain that frequently of a morning we would discover fragments of pickled meats canned goods and such débris littering the place although it had been securely locked and barred against human intrusion it was proposed to remove the provisions and store them elsewhere but our dear mother always generous and hospitable said it was better to endure the loss than risk exposure if the ghosts were denied this trifling gratification they might set on foot an investigation which would overthrow our scheme of the division of labor by diverting the energies of the whole family into the single industry pursued by mewe might all decorate the crossbeams of gibbets we accepted her decision with filial submission due to our reverence for her wordly wisdom and the purity of her character  one night while we were all in the cellarnone dared to enter it aloneengaged in bestowing upon the mayor of an adjoining town the solemn offices of christian burial my mother and the younger children holding a candle each while george henry and i labored with a spade and pick my sister mary maria uttered a shriek and covered her eyes with her hands we were all dreadfully startled and the mayors obsequies were instantly suspended while with pale faces and in trembling tones we begged her to say what had alarmed her the younger children were so agitated that they held their candles unsteadily and the waving shadows of our figures danced with uncouth and grotesque movements on the walls and flung themselves into the most uncanny attitudes the face of the dead man now gleaming ghastly in the light and now extinguished by some floating shadow appeared at each emergence to have taken on a new and more forbidding expression a maligner menace frightened even more than ourselves by the girls scream rats raced in multitudes about the place squeaking shrilly or starred the black opacity of some distant corner with steadfast eyes mere points of green light matching the faint phosphorescence of decay that filled the halfdug grave and seemed the visible manifestation of that faint odor of mortality which tainted the unwholesome air the children now sobbed and clung about the limbs of their elders dropping their candles and we were near being left in total darkness except for that sinister light which slowly welled upward from the disturbed earth and overflowed the edges of the grave like a fountain  meanwhile my sister crouching in the earth that had been thrown out of the excavation had removed her hands from her face and was staring with expanded eyes into an obscure space between two wine casks  there it isthere it is she shrieked pointing god in heaven cant you see it  and there indeed it wasa human figure dimly discernible in the glooma figure that wavered from side to side as if about to fall clutching at the winecasks for support had stepped unsteadily forward and for one moment stood revealed in the light of our remaining candles then it surged heavily and fell prone upon the earth in that moment we had all recognized the figure the face and bearing of our fatherdead these ten months and buried by our own handsour father indubitably risen and ghastly drunk  on the incidents of our precipitate flight from that horrible placeon the extinction of all human sentiment in that tumultuous mad scramble up the damp and mouldy stairsslipping falling pulling one another down and clambering over one anothers backthe lights extinguished babes trampled beneath the feet of their strong brothers and hurled backward to death by a mothers armon all this i do not dare to dwell my mother my eldest brother and sister and i escaped the others remained below to perish of their wounds or of their terrorsome perhaps by flame for within an hour we four hastily gathering together what money and jewels we had and what clothing we could carry fired the dwelling and fled by its light into the hills we did not even pause to collect the insurance and my dear mother said on her deathbed years afterward in a distant land that this was the only sin of omission that lay upon her conscience her confessor a holy man assured her that under the circumstances heaven would pardon the neglect  about ten years after our removal from the scenes of my childhood i then a prosperous forger returned in disguise to the spot with a view to obtaining if possible some treasure belonging to us which had been buried in the cellar i may say that i was unsuccessful the discovery of many human bones in the ruins had set the authorities digging for more they had found the treasure and had kept it for their honesty the house had not been rebuilt the whole suburb was in fact a desolation so many unearthly sights and sounds had been reported thereabout that nobody would live there as there was none to question nor molest i resolved to gratify my filial piety by gazing once more upon the face of my beloved father if indeed our eyes had deceived us and he was still in his grave i remembered too that he had always worn an enormous diamond ring and never having seen it nor heard of it since his death i had reason to think he might have been buried in it procuring a spade i soon located the grave in what had been the backyard and began digging when i had got down about four feet the whole bottom fell out of the grave and i was precipitated into a large drain falling through a long hole in its crumbling arch there was no body nor any vestige of one  unable to get out of the excavation i crept through the drain and having with some difficulty removed a mass of charred rubbish and blackened masonry that choked it emerged into what had been that fateful cellar  all was clear my father whatever had caused him to be taken bad at his meal and i think my sainted mother could have thrown some light upon that matter had indubitably been buried alive the grave having been accidentally dug above the forgotten drain and down almost to the crown of its arch and no coffin having been used his struggles on reviving had broken the rotten masonry and he had fallen through escaping finally into the cellar feeling that he was not welcome in his own house yet having no other he had lived in subterranean seclusion a witness to our thrift and a pensioner on our providence it was he who had eaten our food it was he who had drunk our winehe was no better than a thief in a moment of intoxication and feeling no doubt that need of companionship which is the one sympathetic link between a drunken man and his race he had left his place of concealment at a strangely inopportune time entailing the most deplorable consequences upon those nearest and dearest to hima blunder that had almost the dignity of crime     jupiter doke brigadiergeneral   from the secretary of war to the hon jupiter doke hardpan

cleaning them out   from majorgeneral blount wardorg to the secretary of war  louisville kentucky november 20 1861  the name and services of brigadiergeneral doke are unfamiliar to me but i shall be pleased to have the advantage of his skill the route from covington to distilleryville via opossum corners and horsecave i have been compelled to abandon to the enemy whose guerilla warfare made it possible to keep it open without detaching too many troops from the front the brigade at distilleryville is supplied by steamboats up the little buttermilk   from the secretary of war to brigadiergeneral jupiter doke hardpan illinois  washington november 26 1861  i deeply regret that your commission had been forwarded by mail before the receipt of your letter of acceptance so we must dispense with the formality of official notification to you by a committee the president is highly gratified by the noble and patriotic sentiments of your letter and directs that you proceed at once to your command at distilleryville kentucky and there report by letter to majorgeneral wardorg at louisville for orders it is important that the strictest secrecy be observed regarding your movements until you have passed covington as it is desired to hold the enemy in front of distilleryville until you are within three days of him then if your approach is known it will operate as a demonstration against his right and cause him to strengthen it with his left now at memphis tennessee which it is desirable to capture first go by way of bluegrass opossum corners and horsecave all officers are expected to be in full uniform when en route to the front   from brigadiergeneral jupiter doke to the secretary of war  covington kentucky december 7 1861  i arrived yesterday at this point and have given my proxy to joel briller esq my wifes cousin and a staunch republican who will worthily represent posey county in field and forum he points with pride to a stainless record in the halls of legislation which have often echoed to his soulstirring eloquence on questions which lie at the very foundation of popular government he has been called the patrick henry of hardpan where he has done yeomans service in the cause of civil and religious liberty mr briller left for distilleryville last evening and the standard bearer of the democratic host confronting that stronghold of freedom will find him a lion in his path i have been asked to remain here and deliver some addresses to the people in a local contest involving issues of paramount importance that duty being performed i shall in person enter the arena of armed debate and move in the direction of the heaviest firing burning my ships behind me i forward by this mail to his excellency the president a request for the appointment of my son jabez leonidas doke as postmaster at hardpan i would take it sir as a great favor if you would give the application a strong oral indorsement as the appointment is in the line of reform be

from brigadiergeneral jupiter doke to major general blount wardorg  distilleryville kentucky january 12 1862  i arrived on the tented field yesterday by steamboat the recent storms having inundated the landscape covering i understand the greater part of a congressional district i am pained to find that joel briller esq a prominent citizen of posey county illinois and a farseeing statesman who held my proxy and who a month ago should have been thundering at the gates of disunion has not been heard from and has doubtless been sacrificed upon the altar of his country in him the american people lose a bulwark of freedom i would respectfully move that you designate a committee to draw up resolutions of respect to his memory and that the office holders and men under your command wear the usual badge of mourning for thirty days i shall at once place myself at the head of affairs here and am now ready to entertain any suggestions which you may make looking to the better enforcement of the laws in this commonwealth the militant democrats on the other side of the river appear to be contemplating extreme measures they have two large cannons facing this way and yesterday morning i am told some of them came down to the waters edge and remained in session for some time making infamous allegations   from the diary of brigadiergeneral jupiter doke at distilleryville kentucky  january 12 1862on my arrival yesterday at the henry clay hotel named in honor of the late farseeing statesman i was waited on by a delegation consisting of the three colonels intrusted with the command of the regiments of my brigade it was an occasion that will be memorable in the political annals of america forwarded copies of the speeches to the posey maverick to be spread upon the record of the ages the gentlemen composing the delegation unanimously reaffirmed their devotion to the principles of national unity and the republican party was gratified to recognize in them men of political prominence and untarnished escutcheons at the subsequent banquet sentiments of lofty patriotism were expressed wrote to mr wardorg at louisville for instructions  january 13 1862leased a prominent residence the former incumbent being absent in arms against his country for the term of one year and wrote at once for mrs brigadiergeneral doke and the vital issuesexcepting jabez leonidas in the camp of treason opposite here there are supposed to be three thousand misguided men laying the ax at the root of the tree of liberty they have a clear majority many of our men having returned without leave to their constituents we could probably not poll more than two thousand votes have advised my heads of regiments to make a canvass of those remaining all bolters to be read out of the phalanx  january 14 1862wrote to the president asking for the contract to supply this command with firearms and regalia through my brotherinlaw prominently identified with the manufacturing interests of the country club of cannon soldiers arrived at jayhawk three miles back from here on their way to join us in battle array marched my whole brigade to jayhawk to escort them into town but their chairman mistaking us for the opposing party opened fire on the head of the procession and by the extraordinary noise of the cannon balls i had no conception of it so frightened my horse that i was unseated without a contest the meeting adjourned in disorder and returning to camp i found that a deputation of the enemy had crossed the river in our absence and made a division of the loaves and fishes wrote to the president applying for the gubernatorial chair of the territory of idaho   from editorial article in the posey illinois maverick january 20 1862  brigadiergeneral dokes thrilling account in another column of the battle of distilleryville will make the heart of every loyal illinoisian leap with exultation the brilliant exploit marks an era in military history and as general doke says lays broad and deep the foundations of american prowess in arms as none of the troops engaged except the gallant authorchieftain a host in himself hails from posey county he justly considered that a list of the fallen would only occupy our valuable space to the exclusion of more important matter but his account of the strategic ruse by which he apparently abandoned his camp and so inveigled a perfidious enemy into it for the purpose of murdering the sick the unfortunate countertempus at jayhawk the subsequent dash upon a trapped enemy flushed with a supposed success driving their terrified legions across an impassable river which precluded pursuitall these moving accidents by flood and field are related with a pen of fire and have all the terrible interest of romance  verily truth is stranger than fiction and the pen is mightier than the sword when by the graphic power of the art preservative of all arts we are brought face to face with such glorious events as these the mavericks enterprise in securing for its thousands of readers the services of so distinguished a contributor as the great captain who made the history as well as wrote it seems a matter of almost secondary importance for president in 1864 subject to the decision of the republican national convention brigadiergeneral jupiter doke of illinois   from majorgeneral blount wardorg to brigadiergeneral jupiter doke  louisville january 22 1862  your letter apprising me of your arrival at distilleryville was delayed in transmission having only just been received open through the courtesy of the confederate department commander under a flag of truce he begs me to assure you that he would consider it an act of cruelty to trouble you and i think it would be maintain however a threatening attitude but at the least pressure retire your position is simply an outpost which it is not intended to hold   from majorgeneral blount wardorg to the secretary of war  louisville january 23 1862  i have certain information that the enemy has concentrated twenty thousand troops of all arms on the little buttermilk according to your assignment general doke is in command of the small brigade of raw troops opposing them it is no part of my plan to contest the enemys advance at that point but i cannot hold myself responsible for any reverses to the brigade mentioned under its present commander i think him a fool   from the secretary of war to majorgeneral blount wardorg  washington february 1 1862  the president has great faith in general doke if your estimate of him is correct however he would seem to be singularly well placed where he now is as your plans appear to contemplate a considerable sacrifice for whatever advantages you expect to gain   from brigadiergeneral jupiter doke to majorgeneral blount wardorg  distilleryville february 1 1862  tomorrow i shall remove my headquarters to jayhawk in order to point the way whenever my brigade retires from distilleryville as foreshadowed by your letter of the 22d ult i have appointed a committee on retreat the minutes of whose first meeting i transmit to you you will perceive that the committee having been duly organized by the election of a chairman and secretary a resolution prepared by myself was adopted to the effect that in case treason again raises her hideous head on this side of the river every man of the brigade is to mount a mule the procession to move promptly in the direction of louisville and the loyal north in preparation for such an emergency i have for some time been collecting mules from the resident democracy and have on hand 2300 in a field at jayhawk eternal vigilance is the price of liberty   from majorgeneral gibeon j buxter csa to the confederate secretary of war  bung station kentucky february 4 1862  on the night of the 2d inst our entire force consisting of 25000 men and thirtytwo field pieces under command of majorgeneral simmons b flood crossed by a ford to the north side of little buttermilk river at a point three miles above distilleryville and moved obliquely down and away from the stream to strike the covington turnpike at jayhawk the object being as you know to capture covington destroy cincinnati and occupy the ohio valley for some months there had been in our front only a small brigade of undisciplined troops apparently without a commander who were useful to us for by not disturbing them we could create an impression of our weakness but the movement on jayhawk having isolated them i was about to detach an alabama regiment to bring them in my division being the leading one when an earthshaking rumble was felt and heard and suddenly the headofcolumn was struck by one of the terrible tornadoes for which this region is famous and utterly annihilated the tornado i believe passed along the entire length of the road back to the ford dispersing or destroying our entire army but of this i cannot be sure for i was lifted from the earth insensible and blown back to the south side of the river continuous firing all night on the north side and the reports of such of our men as have recrossed at the ford convince me that the yankee brigade has exterminated the disabled survivors our loss has been uncommonly heavy of my own division of 15000 infantry the casualtieskilled wounded captured and missingare 14994 of general dolliver billows division 11200 strong i can find but two officers and a nigger cook of the artillery 800 men none has reported on this side of the river general flood is dead i have assumed command of the expeditionary force but owing to the heavy losses have deemed it advisable to contract my line of supplies as rapidly as possible i shall push southward tomorrow morning early the purposes of the campaign have been as yet but partly accomplished   from majorgeneral dolliver billows csa to the confederate secretary of war  buhac kentucky february 5 1862   but during the 2d they had unknown to us been reinforced by fifty thousand cavalry and being apprised of our movement by a spy this vast body was drawn up in the darkness at jayhawk and as the head of our column reached that point at about 11 pm fell upon it with astonishing fury destroying the division of general buxter in an instant general baumschanks brigade of artillery which was in the rear may have escapedi did not wait to

joram turmore became a widower have never been popularly understood i know them naturally for i am joram turmore and my wife the late elizabeth mary turmore is by no means ignorant of them but although she doubtless relates them yet they remain a secret for not a soul has ever believed her  when i married elizabeth mary johnin she was very wealthy otherwise i could hardly have afforded to marry for i had not a cent and heaven had not put into my heart any intention to earn one i held the professorship of cats in the university of graymaulkin and scholastic pursuits had unfitted me for the heat and burden of business or labor moreover i could not forget that i was a turmorea member of a family whose motto from the time of william of normandy has been laborare est errare the only known infraction of the sacred family tradition occurred when sir aldebaran turmore de petersturmore an illustrious master burglar of the seventeenth century personally assisted at a difficult operation undertaken by some of his workmen that blot upon our escutcheon cannot be contemplated without the most poignant mortification  my incumbency of the chair of cats in the graymaulkin university had not of course been marked by any instance of mean industry there had never at any one time been more than two students of the noble science and by merely repeating the manuscript lectures of my predecessor which i had found among his effects he died at sea on his way to malta i could sufficiently sate their famine for knowledge without really earning even the distinction which served in place of salary  naturally under the straitened circumstances i regarded elizabeth mary as a kind of special providence she unwisely refused to share her fortune with me but for that i cared nothing for although by the laws of that country as is well known a wife has control of her separate property during her life it passes to the husband at her death nor can she dispose of it otherwise by will the mortality among wives is considerable but not excessive  having married elizabeth mary and as it were ennobled her by making her a turmore i felt that the manner of her death ought in some sense to match her social distinction if i should remove her by any of the ordinary marital methods i should incur a just reproach as one destitute of a proper family pride yet i could not hit upon a suitable plan  in this emergency i decided to consult the turmore archives a priceless collection of documents comprising the records of the family from the time of its founder in the seventh century of our era i knew that among these sacred muniments i should find detailed accounts of all the principal murders committed by my sainted ancestors for forty generations from that mass of papers i could hardly fail to derive the most valuable suggestions  the collection contained also most interesting relics there were patents of nobility granted to my forefathers for daring and ingenious removals of pretenders to thrones or occupants of them stars crosses and other decorations attesting services of the most secret and unmentionable character miscellaneous gifts from the worlds greatest conspirators representing an intrinsic money value beyond computation there were robes jewels swords of honor and every kind of testimonials of esteem a kings skull fashioned into a wine cup the title deeds to vast estates long alienated by confiscation sale or abandonment an illuminated breviary that had belonged to sir aldebaran turmore de petersturmore of accursed memory embalmed ears of several of the familys most renowned enemies the small intestine of a certain unworthy italian statesman inimical to turmores which twisted into a jumping rope had served the youth of six kindred generationsmementoes and souvenirs precious beyond the appraisals of imagination but by the sacred mandates of tradition and sentiment forever inalienable by sale or gift  as the head of the family i was custodian of all these priceless heirlooms and for their safe keeping had constructed in the basement of my dwelling a strongroom of massive masonry whose solid stone walls and single iron door could defy alike the earthquakes shock the tireless assaults of time and cupiditys unholy hand  to this thesaurus of the soul redolent of sentiment and tenderness and rich in suggestions of crime i now repaired for hints upon assassination to my unspeakable astonishment and grief i found it empty every shelf every chest every coffer had been rifled of that unique and incomparable collection not a vestige remained yet i proved that until i had myself unlocked the massive metal door not a bolt nor bar had been disturbed the seals upon the lock had been intact  i passed the night in alternate lamentation and research equally fruitless the mystery was impenetrable to conjecture the pain invincible to balm but never once throughout that dreadful night did my firm spirit relinquish its high design against elizabeth mary and daybreak found me more resolute than before to harvest the fruits of my marriage my great loss seemed but to bring me into nearer spiritual relations with my dead ancestors and to lay upon me a new and more inevitable obedience to the suasion that spoke in every globule of my blood  my plan of action was soon formed and procuring a stout cord i entered my wifes bedroom finding her as i expected in a sound sleep before she was awake i had her bound fast hand and foot she was greatly surprised and pained but heedless of her remonstrances delivered in a high key i carried her into the now rifled strongroom which i had never suffered her to enter and of whose treasures i had not apprised her seating her still bound in an angle of the wall i passed the next two days and nights in conveying bricks and mortar to the spot and on the morning of the third day had her securely walled in from floor to ceiling all this time i gave no further heed to her pleas for mercy than on her assurance of nonresistance which i am bound to say she honorably observed to grant her the freedom of her limbs the space allowed her was about four feet by six as i inserted the last bricks of the top course in contact with the ceiling of the strongroom she bade me farewell with what i deemed the composure of despair and i rested from my work feeling that i had faithfully observed the traditions of an ancient and illustrious family my only bitter reflection so far as my own conduct was concerned came of the consciousness that in the performance of my design i had labored but this no living soul would ever know  after a nights rest i went to the judge of the court of successions and inheritances and made a true and sworn relation of all that i had doneexcept that i ascribed to a servant the manual labor of building the wall his honor appointed a court commissioner who made a careful examination of the work and upon his report elizabeth mary turmore was at the end of a week formally pronounced dead by due process of law i was put into possession of her estate and although this was not by hundreds of thousands of dollars as valuable as my lost treasures it raised me from poverty to affluence and brought me the respect of the great and good  some six months after these events strange rumors reached me that the ghost of my deceased wife had been seen in several places about the country but always at a considerable distance from graymaulkin these rumors which i was unable to trace to any authentic source differed widely in many particulars but were alike in ascribing to the apparition a certain high degree of apparent worldly prosperity combined with an audacity most uncommon in ghosts not only was the spirit attired in most costly raiment but it walked at noonday and even drove i was inexpressibly annoyed by these reports and thinking there might be something more than superstition in the popular belief that only the spirits of the unburied dead still walk the earth i took some workmen equipped with picks and crowbars into the now long unentered strongroom and ordered them to demolish the brick wall that i had built about the partner of my joys i was resolved to give the body of elizabeth mary such burial as i thought her immortal part might be willing to accept as an equivalent to the privilege of ranging at will among the haunts of the living  in a few minutes we had broken down the wall and thrusting a lamp through the breach i looked in nothing not a bone not a lock of hair not a shred of clothingthe narrow space which upon my affidavit had been legally declared to hold all that was mortal of the late mrs turmore was absolutely empty this amazing disclosure coming upon a mind already overwrought with too much of mystery and excitement was more than i could bear i shrieked aloud and fell in a fit for months afterward i lay between life and death fevered and delirious nor did i recover until my physician had had the providence to take a case of valuable jewels from my safe and leave the country  the next summer i had occasion to visit my wine cellar in one corner of which i had built the now long disused strongroom in moving a cask of madeira i struck it with considerable force against the partition wall and was surprised to observe that it displaced two large square stones forming a part of the wall  applying my hands to these i easily pushed them out entirely and looking through saw that they had fallen into the niche in which i had immured my lamented wife facing the opening which their fall left and at a distance of four feet was the brickwork which my own hands had made for that unfortunate gentlewomans restraint at this significant revelation i began a search of the wine cellar behind a row of casks i found four historically interesting but intrinsically valueless objects  first the mildewed remains of a ducal robe of state florentine of the eleventh century second an illuminated vellum breviary with the name of sir aldebaran turmore de petersturmore inscribed in colors on the title page third a human skull fashioned into a drinking cup and deeply stained with wine fourth the iron cross of a knight commander of the imperial austrian order of assassins by poison  that was allnot an object having commercial value no papersnothing but this was enough to clear up the mystery of the strongroom my wife had early divined the existence and purpose of that apartment and with the skill amounting to genius had effected an entrance by loosening the two stones in the wall  through that opening she had at several times abstracted the entire collection which doubtless she had succeeded in converting into coin of the realm when with an unconscious justice which deprives me of all satisfaction in the memory i decided to build her into the wall by some malign fatality i selected that part of it in which were these movable stones and doubtless before i had fairly finished my bricklaying she had removed them and slipping through into the wine cellar replaced them as they were originally laid from the cellar she had easily escaped unobserved to enjoy her infamous gains in distant parts i have endeavored to procure a warrant but the lord high baron of the court of indictment and conviction reminds me that she is legally dead and says my only course is to go before the master in cadavery and move for a writ of disinterment and constructive revival so it looks as if i must suffer without redress this great wrong at the hands of a woman devoid alike of principle and shame     the city of the gone away   i was born of poor because honest parents and until i was twentythree years old never knew the possibilities of happiness latent in another persons coin at that time providence threw me into a deep sleep and revealed to me in a dream the folly of labor behold said a vision of a holy hermit the poverty and squalor of your lot and listen to the teachings of nature you rise in the morning from your pallet of straw and go forth to your daily labor in the fields the flowers nod their heads in friendly salutation as you pass the lark greets you with a burst of song the early sun sheds his temperate beams upon you and from the dewy grass you inhale an atmosphere cool and grateful to your lungs all nature seems to salute you with the joy of a generous servant welcoming a faithful master you are in harmony with her gentlest mood and your soul sings within you you begin your daily task at the plow hopeful that the noonday will fulfill the promise of the morn maturing the charms of the landscape and confirming its benediction upon your spirit you follow the plow until fatigue invokes repose and seating yourself upon the earth at the end of your furrow you expect to enjoy in fulness the delights of which you did but taste  alas the sun has climbed into a brazen sky and his beams are become a torrent the flowers have closed their petals confining their perfume and denying their colors to the eye coolness no longer exhales from the grass the dew has vanished and the dry surface of the fields repeats the fierce heat of the sky no longer the birds of heaven salute you with melody but the jay harshly upbraids you from the edge of the copse unhappy man all the gentle and healing ministrations of nature are denied you in punishment of your sin you have broken the first commandment of the natural decalogue you have labored  awakening from my dream i collected my few belongings bade adieu to my erring parents and departed out of that land pausing at the grave of my grandfather who had been a priest to take an oath that never again heaven helping me would i earn an honest penny  how long i traveled i know not but i came at last to a great city by the sea where i set up as a physician the name of that place i do not now remember for such were my activity and renown in my new profession that the aldermen moved by pressure of public opinion altered it and thenceforth the place was known as the city of the gone away it is needless to say that i had no knowledge of medicine but by securing the service of an eminent forger i obtained a diploma purporting to have been granted by the royal quackery of charlatanic empiricism at hoodos which framed in immortelles and suspended by a bit of crêpe to a willow in front of my office attracted the ailing in great numbers in connection with my dispensary i conducted one of the largest undertaking establishments ever known and as soon as my means permitted purchased a wide tract of land and made it into a cemetery i owned also some very profitable marble works on one side of the gateway to the cemetery and on the other an extensive flower garden my mourners emporium was patronized by the beauty fashion and sorrow of the city in short i was in a very prosperous way of business and within a year was able to send for my parents and establish my old father very comfortably as a receiver of stolen goodsan act which i confess was saved from the reproach of filial gratitude only by my exaction of all the profits  but the vicissitudes of fortune are avoidable only by practice of the sternest indigence human foresight cannot provide against the envy of the gods and the tireless machinations of fate the widening circle of prosperity grows weaker as it spreads until the antagonistic forces which it has pushed back are made powerful by compression to resist and finally overwhelm so great grew the renown of my skill in medicine that patients were brought to me from all the four quarters of the globe burdensome invalids whose tardiness in dying was a perpetual grief to their friends wealthy testators whose legatees were desirous to come by their own superfluous children of penitent parents and dependent parents of frugal children wives of husbands ambitious to remarry and husbands of wives without standing in the courts of divorcethese and all conceivable classes of the surplus population were conducted to my dispensary in the city of the gone away they came in incalculable multitudes  government agents brought me caravans of orphans paupers lunatics and all who had become a public charge my skill in curing orphanism and pauperism was particularly acknowledged by a grateful parliament  naturally all this promoted the public prosperity for although i got the greater part of the money that strangers expended in the city the rest went into the channels of trade and i was myself a liberal investor purchaser and employer and a patron of the arts and sciences the city of the gone away grew so rapidly that in a few years it had inclosed my cemetery despite its own constant growth in that fact lay the lion that rent me  the aldermen declared my cemetery a public evil and decided to take it from me remove the bodies to another place and make a park of it i was to be paid for it and could easily bribe the appraisers to fix a high price but for a reason which will appear the decision gave me little joy it was in vain that i protested against the sacrilege of disturbing the holy dead although this was a powerful appeal for in that land the dead are held in religious veneration temples are built in their honor and a separate priesthood maintained at the public expense whose only duty is performance of memorial services of the most solemn and touching kind on four days in the year there is a festival of the good as it is called when all the people lay by their work or business and headed by the priests march in procession through the cemeteries adorning the graves and praying in the temples however bad a mans life may be it is believed that when dead he enters into a state of eternal and inexpressible happiness to signify a doubt of this is an offense punishable by death to deny burial to the dead or to exhume a buried body except under sanction of law by special dispensation and with solemn ceremony is a crime having no stated penalty because no one has ever had the hardihood to commit it  all these considerations were in my favor yet so well assured were the people and their civic officers that my cemetery was injurious to the public health that it was condemned and appraised and with terror in my heart i received three times its value and began to settle up my affairs with all speed  a week later was the day appointed for the formal inauguration of the ceremony of removing the bodies the day was fine and the entire population of the city and surrounding country was present at the imposing religious rites these were directed by the mortuary priesthood in full canonicals there was propitiatory sacrifice in the temples of the once followed by a processional pageant of great splendor ending at the cemetery the great mayor in his robe of state led the procession he was armed with a golden spade and followed by one hundred male and female singers clad all in white and chanting the hymn to the gone away behind these came the minor priesthood of the temples all the civic authorities habited in their official apparel each carrying a living pig as an offering to the gods of the dead of the many divisions of the line the last was formed by the populace with uncovered heads sifting dust into their hair in token of humility in front of the mortuary chapel in the midst of the necropolis the supreme priest stood in gorgeous vestments supported on each hand by a line of bishops and other high dignitaries of his prelacy all frowning with the utmost austerity as the great mayor paused in the presence the minor clergy the civic authorities the choir and populace closed in and encompassed the spot the great mayor laying his golden spade at the feet of the supreme priest knelt in silence  why comest thou here presumptuous mortal said the supreme priest in clear deliberate tones is it thy unhallowed purpose with this implement to uncover the mysteries of death and break the repose of the good  the great mayor still kneeling drew from his robe a document with portentous seals behold o ineffable thy servant having warrant of his people entreateth at thy holy hands the custody of the good to the end and purpose that they lie in fitter earth by consecration duly prepared against their coming  with that he placed in the sacerdotal hands the order of the council of aldermen decreeing the removal merely touching the parchment the supreme priest passed it to the head necropolitan at his side and raising his hands relaxed the severity of his countenance and exclaimed the gods comply  down the line of prelates on either side his gesture look and words were successively repeated the great mayor rose to his feet the choir began a solemn chant and opportunely a funeral car drawn by ten white horses with black plumes rolled in at the gate and made its way through the parting crowd to the grave selected for the occasionthat of a high official whom i had treated for chronic incumbency the great mayor touched the grave with his golden spade which he then presented to the supreme priest and two stalwart diggers with iron ones set vigorously to work  at that moment i was observed to leave the cemetery and the country for a report of the rest of the proceedings i am indebted to my sainted father who related it in a letter to me written in jail the night before he had the irreparable misfortune to take the kink out of a rope  as the workmen proceeded with their excavation four bishops stationed themselves at the corners of the grave and in the profound silence of the multitude broken otherwise only by the harsh grinding sound of spades repeated continuously one after another the solemn invocations and responses from the ritual of the disturbed imploring the blessed brother to forgive but the blessed brother was not there full fathom two they mined for him in vain then gave it up the priests were visibly disconcerted the populace was aghast for that grave was indubitably vacant  after a brief consultation with the supreme priest the great mayor ordered the workmen to open another grave the ritual was omitted this time until the coffin should be uncovered there was no coffin no body   the cemetery was now a scene of the wildest confusion and dismay the people shouted and ran hither and thither gesticulating clamoring all talking at once none listening some ran for spades fireshovels hoes sticks anything some brought carpenters adzes even chisels from the marble works and with these inadequate aids set to work upon the first graves they came to others fell upon the mounds with their bare hands scraping away the earth as eagerly as dogs digging for marmots before nightfall the surface of the greater part of the cemetery had been upturned every grave had been explored to the bottom and thousands of men were tearing away at the interspaces with as furious a frenzy as exhaustion would permit as night came on torches were lighted and in the sinister glare these frantic mortals looking like a legion of fiends performing some unholy rite pursued their disappointing work until they had devastated the entire area but not a body did they findnot even a coffin  the explanation is exceedingly simple an important part of my income had been derived from the sale of cadavres to medical colleges which never before had been so well supplied and which in added recognition of my services to science had all bestowed upon me diplomas degrees and fellowships without number but their demand for cadavres was unequal to my supply by even the most prodigal extravagances they could not consume the onehalf of the products of my skill as a physician as to the rest i had owned and operated the most extensive and thoroughly appointed soapworks in all the country the excellence of my toilet homoline was attested by certificates from scores of the saintliest theologians and i had one in autograph from badelina fatti the most famous living soaprano     the majors tale   in the days of the civil war practical joking had not i think fallen into that disrepute which characterizes it now that doubtless was owing to our extreme youthmen were much younger than now and evermore your very young man has a boisterous spirit running easily to horseplay you cannot think how young the men were in the early sixties why the average age of the entire federal army was not more than twentyfive i doubt if it was more than twentythree but not having the statistics on that point if there are any i want to be moderate we will say twentyfive it is true a man of twentyfive was in that heroic time a good deal more of a man than one of that age is now you could see that by looking at him his face had nothing of that unripeness so conspicuous in his successor i never see a young fellow now without observing how disagreeably young he really is but during the war we did not think of a mans age at all unless he happened to be pretty well along in life in that case one could not help it for the unloveliness of age assailed the human countenance then much earlier than now the result i suppose of hard serviceperhaps to some extent of hard drink for bless my soul we did shed the blood of the grape and the grain abundantly during the war i remember thinking general grant who could not have been more than forty a pretty well preserved old chap considering his habits as to men of middle agesay from fifty to sixtywhy they all looked fit to personate the last of the hittites or the madagascarene methuselah in a museum depend upon it my friends men of that time were greatly younger than men are today but looked much older the change is quite remarkable  i said that practical joking had not then gone out of fashion it had not at least in the army though possibly in the more serious life of the civilian it had no place except in the form of tarring and feathering an occasional copperhead you all know i suppose what a copperhead was so i will go directly at my story without introductory remark as is my way  it was a few days before the battle of nashville the enemy had driven us up out of northern georgia and alabama at nashville we had turned at bay and fortified while old pap thomas our commander hurried down reinforcements and supplies from louisville meantime hood the confederate commander had partly invested us and lay close enough to have tossed shells into the heart of the town as a rule he abstainedhe was afraid of killing the families of his own soldiers i suppose a great many of whom had lived there i sometimes wondered what were the feelings of those fellows gazing over our heads at their own dwellings where their wives and children or their aged parents were perhaps suffering for the necessaries of life and certainly so their reasoning would run cowering under the tyranny and power of the barbarous yankees  to begin then at the beginning i was serving at that time on the staff of a division commander whose name i shall not disclose for i am relating facts and the person upon whom they bear hardest may have surviving relatives who would not care to have him traced our headquarters were in a large dwelling which stood just behind our line of works this had been hastily abandoned by the civilian occupants who had left everything pretty much as it washad no place to store it probably and trusted that heaven would preserve it from federal cupidity and confederate artillery with regard to the latter we were as solicitous as they  rummaging about in some of the chambers and closets one evening some of us found an abundant supply of ladygeargowns shawls bonnets hats petticoats and the lord knows what i could not at that time have named the half of it the sight of all this pretty plunder inspired one of us with what he was pleased to call an idea which when submitted to the other scamps and scapegraces of the staff met with instant and enthusiastic approval we proceeded at once to act upon it for the undoing of one of our comrades  our selected victim was an aide lieutenant haberton so to call him he was a good soldieras gallant a chap as ever wore spurs but he had an intolerable weakness he was a ladykiller and like most of his class even in those days eager that all should know it he never tired of relating his amatory exploits and i need not say how dismal that kind of narrative is to all but the narrator it would be dismal even if sprightly and vivacious for all men are rivals in womans favor and to relate your successes to another man is to rouse in him a dumb resentment tempered by disbelief you will not convince him that you tell the tale for his entertainment he will hear nothing in it but an expression of your own vanity moreover as most men whether rakes or not are willing to be thought rakes he is very likely to resent a stupid and unjust inference which he suspects you to have drawn from his reticence in the matter of his own adventuresnamely that he has had none if on the other hand he has had no scruple in the matter and his reticence is due to lack of opportunity to talk or of nimbleness in taking advantage of it why then he will be surly because you have the floor when he wants it himself there are in short no circumstances under which a man even from the best of motives or no motive at all can relate his feats of love without distinctly lowering himself in the esteem of his male auditor and herein lies a just punishment for such as kiss and tell in my younger days i was myself not entirely out of favor with the ladies and have a memory stored with much concerning them which doubtless i might put into acceptable narrative had i not undertaken another tale and if it were not my practice to relate one thing at a time going straight away to the end without digression  lieutenant haberton was it must be confessed a singularly handsome man with engaging manners he was i suppose judging from the imperfect viewpoint of my sex what women call fascinating now the qualities which make a man attractive to ladies entail a double disadvantage first they are of a sort readily discerned by other men and by none more readily than by those who lack them their possessor being feared by all these is habitually slandered by them in selfdefense to all the ladies in whose welfare they deem themselves entitled to a voice and interest they hint at the vices and general unworth of the ladies man in no uncertain terms and to their wives relate without shame the most monstrous falsehoods about him nor are they restrained by the consideration that he is their friend the qualities which have engaged their own admiration make it necessary to warn away those to whom the allurement would be a peril so the man of charming personality while loved by all the ladies who know him well yet not too well must endure with such fortitude as he may the consciousness that those others who know him only by reputation consider him a shameless reprobate a vicious and unworthy mana type and example of moral depravity to name the second disadvantage entailed by his charms he commonly is  in order to get forward with our busy story and in my judgment a story once begun should not suffer impedition it is necessary to explain that a young fellow attached to our headquarters as an orderly was notably effeminate in face and figure he was not more than seventeen and had a perfectly smooth face and large lustrous eyes which must have been the envy of many a beautiful woman in those days and how beautiful the women of those days were and how gracious those of the south showed in their demeanor toward us yankees something of hauteur but for my part i found it less insupportable than the studious indifference with which ones attentions are received by the ladies of this new generation whom i certainly think destitute of sentiment and sensibility  this young orderly whose name was arman we persuadedby what arguments i am not bound to sayto clothe himself in female attire and personate a lady when we had him arrayed to our satisfactionand a charming girl he lookedhe was conducted to a sofa in the office of the adjutantgeneral that officer was in the secret as indeed were all excepting haberton and the general within the awful dignity hedging the latter lay possibilities of disapproval which we were unwilling to confront  when all was ready i went to haberton and said lieutenant there is a young woman in the adjutantgenerals office she is the daughter of the insurgent gentleman who owns this house and has i think called to see about its present occupancy we none of us know just how to talk to her but we think perhaps you would say about the right thingat least you will say things in the right way would you mind coming down  the lieutenant would not mind he made a hasty toilet and joined me as we were going along a passage toward the presence we encountered a formidable obstaclethe general  i say broadwood he said addressing me in the familiar manner which meant that he was in excellent humor theres a lady in lawsons office looks like a devilish fine girlcame on some errand of mercy or justice no doubt have the goodness to conduct her to my quarters i wont saddle you youngsters with all the business of this division he added facetiously  this was awkward something had to be done  general i said i did not think the ladys business of sufficient importance to bother you with it she is one of the sanitary commissions nurses and merely wants to see about some supplies for the smallpox hospital where she is on duty ill send her in at once  you need not mind said the general moving on i dare say lawson will attend to the matter  ah the gallant general how little i thought as i looked after his retreating figure and laughed at the success of my ruse that within the week he would be dead on the field of honor nor was he the only one of our little military household above whom gloomed the shadow of the death angel and who might almost have heard the beating of his wings on that bleak december morning a few days later when from an hour before dawn until ten oclock we sat on horseback on those icy hills waiting for general smith to open the battle miles away to the right there were eight of us at the close of the fighting there were three there is now one bear with him yet a little while oh thrifty generation he is but one of the horrors of war strayed from his era into yours he is only the harmless skeleton at your feast and peacedance responding to your laughter and your footing it featly with rattling fingers and bobbing skullalbeit upon suitable occasion with a partner of his choosing he might do his little dance with the best of you  as we entered the adjutantgenerals office we observed that the entire staff was there the adjutantgeneral himself was exceedingly busy at his desk the commissary of subsistence played cards with the surgeon in a bay window the rest were in several parts of the room reading or conversing in low tones on a sofa in a half lighted nook of the room at some distance from any of the groups sat the lady closely veiled her eyes modestly fixed upon her toes  madam i said advancing with haberton this officer will be pleased to serve you if it is in his power i trust that it is  with a bow i retired to the farther corner of the room and took part in a conversation going on there though i had not the faintest notion what it was about and my remarks had no relevancy to anything under the heavens a close observer would have noticed that we were all intently watching haberton and only making believe to do anything else  he was worth watching too the fellow was simply an édition de luxe of turveydrop on deportment as the lady slowly unfolded her tale of grievances against our lawless soldiery and mentioned certain instances of wanton disregard of property rightsamong them as to the imminent peril of bursting our sides we partly overheard the looting of her own wardrobethe look of sympathetic agony in habertons handsome face was the very flower and fruit of histrionic art his deferential and assenting nods at her several statements were so exquisitely performed that one could not help regretting their unsubstantial nature and the impossibility of preserving them under glass for instruction and delight of posterity and all the time the wretch was drawing his chair nearer and nearer once or twice he looked about to see if we were observing but we were in appearance blankly oblivious to all but one another and our several diversions the low hum of our conversation the gentle taptap of the cards as they fell in play and the furious scratching of the adjutantgenerals pen as he turned off countless pages of words without sense were the only sounds heard nothere was another at long intervals the distant boom of a heavy gun followed by the approaching rush of the shot the enemy was amusing himself  on these occasions the lady was perhaps not the only member of that company who was startled but she was startled more than the others sometimes rising from the sofa and standing with clasped hands the authentic portrait of terror and irresolution it was no more than natural that haberton should at these times reseat her with infinite tenderness assuring her of her safety and regretting her peril in the same breath it was perhaps right that he should finally possess himself of her gloved hand and a seat beside her on the sofa but it certainly was highly improper for him to be in the very act of possessing himself of both hands whenboom whiz bang  we all sprang to our feet a shell had crashed into the house and exploded in the room above us bushels of plaster fell among us that modest and murmurous young lady sprang erect  jumping jeerusalem she cried  haberton who had also risen stood as one petrifiedas a statue of himself erected on the site of his assassination he neither spoke nor moved nor once took his eyes off the face of orderly arman who was now flinging his girlgear right and left exposing his charms in the most shameless way while out upon the night and away over the lighted camps into the black spaces between the hostile lines rolled the billows of our inexhaustible laughter ah what a merry life it was in the old heroic days when men had not forgotten how to laugh  haberton slowly came to himself he looked about the room less blankly then by degrees fashioned his visage into the sickliest grin that ever libeled all smiling he shook his head and looked knowing  you cant fool me he said     curried cow   my aunt patience who tilled a small farm in the state of michigan had a favorite cow this creature was not a good cow nor a profitable one for instead of devoting a part of her leisure to secretion of milk and production of veal she concentrated all her faculties on the study of kicking she would kick all day and get up in the middle of the night to kick she would kick at anythinghens pigs posts loose stones birds in the air and fish leaping out of the water to this impartial and catholicminded beef all were equalall similarly undeserving like old timotheus who raised a mortal to the skies was my aunt patiences cow though in the words of a later poet than dryden she did it more harder and more frequently it was pleasing to see her open a passage for herself through a populous barnyard she would flash out right and left first with one hindleg and then with the other and would sometimes under favoring conditions have a considerable number of domestic animals in the air at once  her kicks too were as admirable in quality as inexhaustible in quantity they were incomparably superior to those of the untutored kine that had not made the art a life studymere amateurs that kicked by ear as they say in music i saw her once standing in the road professedly fast asleep and mechanically munching her cud with a sort of sunday morning lassitude as one munches ones cud in a dream snouting about at her side blissfully unconscious of impending danger and wrapped up in thoughts of his sweetheart was a gigantic black hoga hog of about the size and general appearance of a yearling rhinoceros suddenly while i lookedwithout a visible movement on the part of the cowwith never a perceptible tremor of her frame nor a lapse in the placid regularity of her chewingthat hog had gone away from therehad utterly taken his leave but away toward the pale horizon a minute black speck was traversing the empyrean with the speed of a meteor and in a moment had disappeared without audible report beyond the distant hills it may have been that hog  currying cows is not i think a common practice even in michigan but as this one had never needed milking of course she had to be subjected to some equivalent form of persecution and irritating her skin with a currycomb was thought as disagreeable an attention as a thoughtful affection could devise at least she thought it so though i suspect her mistress really meant it for the good creatures temporal advantage anyhow my aunt always made it a condition to the employment of a farmservant that he should curry the cow every morning but after just enough trials to convince himself that it was not a sudden spasm nor a mere local disturbance the man would always give notice of an intention to quit by pounding the beast halfdead with some foreign body and then limping home to his couch i dont know how many men the creature removed from my aunts employ in this way but judging from the number of lame persons in that part of the country i should say a good many though some of the lameness may have been taken at secondhand from the original sufferers by their descendants and some may have come by contagion  i think my aunts was a faulty system of agriculture it is true her farm labor cost her nothing for the laborers all left her service before any salary had accrued but as the cows fame spread abroad through the several states and territories it became increasingly difficult to obtain hands and after all the favorite was imperfectly curried it was currently remarked that the cow had kicked the farm to piecesa rude metaphor implying that the land was not properly cultivated nor the buildings and fences kept in adequate repair  it was useless to remonstrate with my aunt she would concede everything amending nothing her late husband had attempted to reform the abuse in this manner and had had the argument all his own way until he had remonstrated himself into an early grave and the funeral was delayed all day until a fresh undertaker could be procured the one originally engaged having confidingly undertaken to curry the cow at the request of the widow  since that time my aunt patience had not been in the matrimonial market the love of that cow had usurped in her heart the place of a more natural and profitable affection but when she saw her seeds unsown her harvests ungarnered her fences overtopped with rank brambles and her meadows gorgeous with the towering canada thistle she thought it best to take a partner  when it transpired that my aunt patience intended wedlock there was intense popular excitement every adult single male became at once a marrying man the criminal statistics of badger county show that in that single year more marriages occurred than in any decade before or since but none of them was my aunts men married their cooks their laundresses their deceased wives mothers their enemies sistersmarried whomsoever would wed and any man who by fair means or courtship could not obtain a wife went before a justice of the peace and made an affidavit that he had some wives in indiana such was the fear of being married alive by my aunt patience  now where my aunts affection was concerned she was as the reader will have already surmised a rather determined woman and the extraordinary marrying epidemic having left but one eligible male in all that county she had set her heart upon that one eligible male then she went and carted him to her home he turned out to be a long methodist parson named huggins  aside from his unconscionable length the rev berosus huggins was not so bad a fellow and was nobodys fool he was i suppose the most illfavored mortal however in the whole northern half of americathin angular cadaverous of visage and solemn out of all reason he commonly wore a lowcrowned black hat set so far down upon his head as partly to eclipse his eyes and wholly obscure the ample glory of his ears the only other visible article of his attire except a brace of wrinkled cowskin boots by which the word polish would have been considered the meaningless fragment of a lost language was a tightfitting black frockcoat preternaturally long in the waist the skirts of which fell about his heels sopping up the dew this he always wore snugly buttoned from the throat downward in this attire he cut a tolerably spectral figure his aspect was so conspicuously unnatural and inhuman that whenever he went into a cornfield the predatory crows would temporarily forsake their business to settle upon him in swarms fighting for the best seats upon his person by way of testifying their contempt for the weak inventions of the husbandman  the day after the wedding my aunt patience summoned the rev berosus to the council chamber and uttered her mind to the following intent  now huggy dear ill tell you what there is to do about the place first you must repair all the fences clearing out the weeds and repressing the brambles with a strong hand then you will have to exterminate the canadian thistles mend the wagon rig up a plow or two and get things into shipshape generally this will keep you out of mischief for the better part of two years of course you will have to give up preaching for the present as soon as you haveo i forgot poor phoebe she  mrs huggins interrupted her solemn spouse i shall hope to be the means under providence of effecting all needful reforms in the husbandry of this farm but the sister you mention i trust she is not of the worlds peoplehave i the pleasure of knowing her the name indeed sounds familiar but  not know phoebe cried my aunt with unfeigned astonishment i thought everybody in badger knew phoebe why you will have to scratch her legs every blessed morning of your natural life  i assure you madam rejoined the rev berosus with dignity it would yield me a hallowed pleasure to minister to the spiritual needs of sister phoebe to the extent of my feeble and unworthy ability but really i fear the merely secular ministration of which you speak must be entrusted to abler and i would respectfully suggest female hands   whyyy youuu ooold foooool replied my aunt spreading her eyes with unbounded amazement phoebe is a cow  in that case said the husband with unruffled composure it will of course devolve upon me to see that her carnal welfare is properly attended to and i shall be happy to bestow upon her legs such time as i may without sin snatch from my strife with satan and the canadian thistles  with that the rev mr huggins crowded his hat upon his shoulders pronounced a brief benediction upon his bride and betook himself to the barnyard  now it is necessary to explain that he had known from the first who phoebe was and was familiar from hearsay with all her sinful traits moreover he had already done himself the honor of making her a visit remaining in the vicinity of her person just out of range for more than an hour and permitting her to survey him at her leisure from every point of the compass in short he and phoebe had mutually reconnoitered and prepared for action  amongst the articles of comfort and luxury which went to make up the good parsons dot and which his wife had already caused to be conveyed to his new home was a patent castiron pump about seven feet high this had been deposited near the barnyard preparatory to being set up on the planks above the barnyard well mr huggins now sought out this invention and conveying it to its destination put it into position screwing it firmly to the planks he next divested himself of his long gaberdine and his hat buttoning the former loosely about the pump which it almost concealed and hanging the latter upon the summit of the structure the handle of the pump when depressed curved outwardly between the coatskirts singularly like a tail but with this inconspicuous exception any unprejudiced observer would have pronounced the thing mr huggins looking uncommonly well  the preliminaries completed the good man carefully closed the gate of the barnyard knowing that as soon as phoebe who was campaigning in the kitchen garden should note the precaution she would come and jump in to frustrate it which eventually she did her master meanwhile had laid himself coatless and hatless along the outside of the close board fence where he put in the time pleasantly catching his death of cold and peering through a knothole  at first and for some time the animal pretended not to see the figure on the platform indeed she had turned her back upon it directly she arrived affecting a light sleep finding that this stratagem did not achieve the success that she had expected she abandoned it and stood for several minutes irresolute munching her cud in a halfhearted way but obviously thinking very hard then she began nosing along the ground as if wholly absorbed in a search for something that she had lost tacking about hither and thither but all the time drawing nearer to the object of her wicked intention arrived within speaking distance she stood for a little while confronting the fraudful figure then put out her nose toward it as if to be caressed trying to create the impression that fondling and dalliance were more to her than wealth power and the plaudits of the populacethat she had been accustomed to them all her sweet young life and could not get on without them then she approached a little nearer as if to shake hands all the while maintaining the most amiable expression of countenance and executing all manner of seductive nods and winks and smiles suddenly she wheeled about and with the rapidity of lightning dealt out a terrible kicka kick of inconceivable force and fury comparable to nothing in nature but a stroke of paralysis out of a clear sky  the effect was magical cows kick not backward but sidewise the impact which was intended to project the counterfeit theologian into the middle of the succeeding conference week reacted upon the animal herself and it and the pain together set her spinning like a top such was the velocity of her revolution that she looked like a dim circular cow surrounded by a continuous ring like that of the planet saturnthe white tuft at the extremity of her sweeping tail presently as the sustaining centrifugal force lessened and failed she began to sway and wabble from side to side and finally toppling over on her side rolled convulsively on her back and lay motionless with all her feet in the air honestly believing that the world had somehow got atop of her and she was supporting it at a great sacrifice of personal comfort then she fainted  how long she lay unconscious she knew not but at last she unclosed her eyes and catching sight of the open door of her stall more sweet than all the landscape smiling near she struggled up stood wavering upon three legs rubbed her eyes and was visibly bewildered as to the points of the compass observing the iron clergyman standing fast by its faith she threw it a look of grieved reproach and hobbled heartbroken into her humble habitation a subjugated cow  for several weeks phoebes right hind leg was swollen to a monstrous growth but by a season of judicious nursing she was brought round all right as her sympathetic and puzzled mistress phrased it or made whole as the reticent man of god preferred to say she was now as tractable and inoffensive in her daily walk and conversation huggins as a little child her new master used to take her ailing leg trustfully into his lap and for that matter might have taken it into his mouth if he had so desired her entire character appeared to be radically changedso altered that one day my aunt patience who fondly as she loved her had never before so much as ventured to touch the hem of her garment as it were went confidently up to her to soothe her with a pan of turnips gad how thinly she spread out that good old lady upon the face of an adjacent stone wall you could not have done it so evenly with a trowel     a revolt of the gods   my father was a deodorizer of dead dogs my mother kept the only shop for the sale of catsmeat in my native city they did not live happily the difference in social rank was a chasm which could not be bridged by the vows of marriage it was indeed an illassorted and most unlucky alliance and as might have been foreseen it ended in disaster one morning after the customary squabbles at breakfast my father rose from the table quivering and pale with wrath and proceeding to the parsonage thrashed the clergyman who had performed the marriage ceremony the act was generally condemned and public feeling ran so high against the offender that people would permit dead dogs to lie on their property until the fragrance was deafening rather than employ him and the municipal authorities suffered one bloated old mastiff to utter itself from a public square in so clamorous an exhalation that passing strangers supposed themselves to be in the vicinity of a sawmill my father was indeed unpopular during these dark days the familys sole dependence was on my mothers emporium for catsmeat  the business was profitable in that city which was the oldest in the world the cat was an object of veneration its worship was the religion of the country the multiplication and addition of cats were a perpetual instruction in arithmetic naturally any inattention to the wants of a cat was punished with great severity in this world and the next so my good mother numbered her patrons by the hundred still with an unproductive husband and seventeen children she had some difficulty in making both ends catsmeat and at last the necessity of increasing the discrepancy between the cost price and the selling price of her carnal wares drove her to an expedient which proved eminently disastrous she conceived the unlucky notion of retaliating by refusing to sell catsmeat until the boycott was taken off her husband  on the day when she put this resolution into practice the shop was thronged with excited customers and others extended in turbulent and restless masses up four streets out of sight inside there was nothing but cursing crowding shouting and menace intimidation was freely resorted toseveral of my younger brothers and sisters being threatened with cutting up for the catsbut my mother was as firm as a rock and the day was a black one for sardasa the ancient and sacred city that was the scene of these events the lockout was vigorously maintained and seven hundred and fifty thousand cats went to bed hungry  the next morning the city was found to have been placarded during the night with a proclamation of the federated union of old maids this ancient and powerful order averred through its supreme executive head that the boycotting of my father and the retaliatory lockout of my mother were seriously imperiling the interests of religion the proclamation went on to state that if arbitration were not adopted by noon that day all the old maids of the federation would strikeand strike they did  the next act of this unhappy drama was an insurrection of cats these sacred animals seeing themselves doomed to starvation held a massmeeting and marched in procession through the streets swearing and spitting like fiends this revolt of the gods produced such consternation that many pious persons died of fright and all business was suspended to bury them and pass terrifying resolutions  matters were now about as bad as it seemed possible for them to be meetings among representatives of the hostile interests were held but no understanding was arrived at that would hold every agreement was broken as soon as made and each element of the discord was frantically appealing to the people a new horror was in store  it will be remembered that my father was a deodorizer of dead dogs but was unable to practice his useful and humble profession because no one would employ him the dead dogs in consequence reeked rascally then they struck from every vacant lot and public dumping ground from every hedge and ditch and gutter and cistern every crystal rill and the clabbered waters of all the canals and estuariesfrom all the places in short which from time immemorial have been preëmpted by dead dogs and consecrated to the uses of them and their heirs and successors foreverthey trooped innumerous a ghastly crew their procession was a mile in length midway of the town it met the procession of cats in full song the cats instantly exalted their backs and magnified their tails the dead dogs uncovered their teeth as in life and erected such of their bristles as still adhered to the skin  the carnage that ensued was too awful for relation the light of the sun was obscured by flying fur and the battle was waged in the darkness blindly and regardless the swearing of the cats was audible miles away while the fragrance of the dead dogs desolated seven provinces  how the battle might have resulted it is impossible to say but when it was at its fiercest the federated union of old maids came running down a side street and sprang into the thickest of the fray a moment later my mother herself bore down upon the warring hosts brandishing a cleaver and laid about her with great freedom and impartiality my father joined the fight the municipal authorities engaged and the general public converging on the battlefield from all points of the compass consumed itself in the center as it pressed in from the circumference last of all the dead held a meeting in the cemetery and resolving on a general strike began to destroy vaults tombs monuments headstones willows angels and young sheep in marbleeverything they could lay their hands on by nightfall the living and the dead were alike exterminated and where the ancient and sacred city of sardasa had stood nothing remained but an excavation filled with dead bodies and building materials shreds of cat and blue patches of decayed dog the place is now a vast pool of stagnant water in the center of a desert  the stirring events of those few days constituted my industrial education and so well have i improved my advantages that i am now chief of misrule to the dukes of disorder an organization numbering thirteen million american workingmen     the baptism of dobsho   it was a wicked thing to do certainly i have often regretted it since and if the opportunity of doing so again were presented i should hesitate a long time before embracing it but i was young then and cherished a species of humor which i have since abjured still when i remember the character of the people who were burlesquing and bringing into disrepute the letter and spirit of our holy religion i feel a certain satisfaction in having contributed one feeble effort toward making them ridiculous in consideration of the little good i may have done in that way i beg the reader to judge my conceded error as leniently as possible this is the story  some years ago the town of harding in illinois experienced a revival of religion as the people called it it would have been more accurate and less profane to term it a revival of rampageanism for the craze originated in and was disseminated by the sect which i will call the rampagean communion and most of the leaping and howling was done in that interest amongst those who yielded to the influence was my friend thomas dobsho tom had been a pretty bad sinner in a small way but he went into this new thing heart and soul at one of the meetings he made a public confession of more sins than he ever was or ever could have been guilty of stopping just short of statutory crimes and even hinting significantly that he could tell a good deal more if he were pressed he wanted to join the absurd communion the very evening of his conversion he wanted to join two or three communions in fact he was so carried away with his zeal that some of the brethren gave me a hint to take him home he and i occupied adjoining apartments in the elephant hotel  toms fervor as it happened came near defeating its own purpose instead of taking him at once into the fold without reference or character which was their usual way the brethren remembered against him his awful confessions and put him on probation but after a few weeks during which he conducted himself like a decent lunatic it was decided to baptise him along with a dozen other pretty hard cases who had been converted more recently this sacrilegious ceremony i persuaded myself it was my duty to prevent though i think now i erred as to the means adopted it was to take place on a sunday and on the preceding saturday i called on the head revivalist the rev mr swin and craved an interview  i come said i with simulated reluctance and embarrassment in behalf of my friend brother dobsho to make a very delicate and unusual request you are i think going to baptise him tomorrow and i trust it will be to him the beginning of a new and better life but i dont know if you are aware that his family are all plungers and that he is himself tainted with the wicked heresy of that sect so it is he is as one might say in secular metaphor on the fence between their grievous error and the pure faith of your church it would be most melancholy if he should get down on the wrong side although i confess with shame i have not myself embraced the truth i hope i am not too blind to see where it lies  the calamity that you apprehend said the reverend lout after solemn reflection would indeed seriously affect our friends interest and endanger his soul i had not expected brother dobsho so soon to give up the good fight  i think sir i replied reflectively there is no fear of that if the matter is skilfully managed he is heartily with youmight i venture to say with uson every point but one he favors immersion he has been so vile a sinner that he foolishly fears the more simple rite of your church will not make him wet enough would you believe it his uninstructed scruples on the point are so gross and materialistic that he actually suggested soaping himself as a preparatory ceremony i believe however if instead of sprinkling my friend you would pour a generous basinful of water on his headbut now that i think of it in your enlightening presence i see that such a proceeding is quite out of the question i fear we must let matters take the usual course trusting to our later efforts to prevent the backsliding which may result  the parson rose and paced the floor a moment then suggested that hed better see brother dobsho and labor to remove his error i told him i thought not i was sure it would not be best argument would only confirm him in his prejudices so it was settled that the subject should not be broached in that quarter it would have been bad for me if it had been  when i reflect now upon the guile of that conversation the falsehood of my representations and the wickedness of my motive i am almost ashamed to proceed with my narrative had the minister been other than an arrant humbug i hope i should never have suffered myself to make him the dupe of a scheme so sacrilegious in itself and prosecuted with so sinful a disregard of honor  the memorable sabbath dawned bright and beautiful about nine oclock the cracked old bell rigged up on struts before the meetinghouse began to clamor its call to service and nearly the whole population of harding took its way to the performance i had taken the precaution to set my watch fifteen minutes fast tom was nervously preparing himself for the ordeal he fidgeted himself into his best suit an hour before the time carried his hat about the room in the most aimless and demented way and consulted his watch a hundred times i was to accompany him to church and i spent the time fussing about the room doing the most extraordinary things in the most exasperating mannerin short keeping up toms feverish excitement by every wicked device i could think of within a half hour of the real time for service i suddenly yelled out  o i say tom pardon me but that head of yours is just frightful please do let me brush it up a bit  seizing him by the shoulders i thrust him into a chair with his face to the wall laid hold of his comb and brush got behind him and went to work he was trembling like a child and knew no more what i was doing than if he had been brained now toms head was a curiosity his hair which was remarkably thick was like wire being cut rather short it stood out all over his scalp like the spines on a porcupine it had been a favorite complaint of toms that he never could do anything to that head i found no difficultyi did something to it though i blush to think what it was i did something which i feared he might discover if he looked in the mirror so i carelessly pulled out my watch sprung it open gave a start and shouted  by jove thomaspardon the oathbut were late your watch is all wrong look at mine heres your hat old fellow come along theres not a moment to lose  clapping his hat on his head i pulled him out of the house with actual violence in five minutes more we were in the meetinghouse with ever so much time to spare  the services that day i am told were specially interesting and impressive but i had a good deal else on my mindwas preoccupied absent inattentive they might have varied from the usual profane exhibition in any respect and to any extent and i should not have observed it the first thing i clearly perceived was a rank of converts kneeling before the altar tom at the left of the line then the rev mr swin approached him thoughtfully dipping his fingers into a small earthern bowl of water as if he had just finished dining i was much affected i could see nothing distinctly for my tears my handkerchief was at my facemost of it inside i was observed to sob spasmodically and i am abashed to think how many sincere persons mistakenly followed my example  with some solemn words the purport of which i did not quite make out except that they sounded like swearing the minister stood before thomas gave me a glance of intelligence and then with an innocent expression of face the recollection of which to this day fills me with remorse spilled as if by accident the entire contents of the bowl on the head of my poor friendthat head into the hair of which i had sifted a prodigal profusion of seidlitzpowders  i confess it the effect was magicalanyone who was present would tell you that toms pow simmeredit seethedit foamed yeastily and slavered like a mad dog it steamed and hissed with angry spurts and flashes in a second it had grown bigger than a small snowbank and whiter it surged and boiled and walloped and overflowed and sputteredsent off feathery flakes like down from a shot swan the froth poured creaming over his face and got into his eyes it was the most sinful shampooing of the season  i cannot relate the commotion this produced nor would i if i could as to tom he sprang to his feet and staggered out of the house groping his way between the pews sputtering strangled profanity and gasping like a stranded fish the other candidates for baptism rose also shaking their pates as if to say no you dont my hearty and left the house in a body amidst unbroken silence the minister reascended the pulpit with the empty bowl in his hand and was first to speak  brethren and sisters said he with calm deliberate evenness of tone i have held forth in this tabernacle for many more years than i have got fingers and toes and during that time i have known not guile nor anger nor any uncharitableness as to henry barber who put up this job on me i judge him not lest i be judged let him take that and sin no moreand he flung the earthern bowl with so true an aim that it was shattered against my skull the rebuke was not undeserved i confess and i trust i have profited by it     the race at left bower   its all very well fer you britishers to go assin about the country tryin to strike the trail o the mines youve salted down yer loose carpital in said colonel jackhigh setting his empty glass on the counter and wiping his lips with his coat sleeve but wen it comes to hoss racin wy ive got a cayuse ken lay over all the thurrerbreds yer little mantelornyment of a island ever panned outbet yer britches i have talk about yer durby winnerswy this pisen little beast o minell take the bit in her teeth and show em the way to the horizon like she was takin her mornin stroll and they was tryin to keep an eye on her to see she didnt do herself an injurythats wat she would and she haint never run a race with anything spryern an injun in all her life shes a green amatoor she is  oh very well said the englishman with a quiet smile it is easy enough to settle the matter my animal is in tolerably good condition and if yours is in town we can have the race tomorrow for any stake you like up to a hundred dollars  thats jest the figger said the colonel dot it down barkeep but its like slarterin the innocents he added halfremorsefully as he turned to leave its bettin on a dead sure thingthats what it is if my cayuse knew wat i was about shed go and break a laig to make the race a fair one  so it was arranged that the race was to come off at three oclock the next day on the mesa some distance from town as soon as the news got abroad the whole population of left bower and vicinity knocked off work and assembled in the various bars to discuss it the englishman and his horse were general favorites and aside from the unpopularity of the colonel nobody had ever seen his cayuse still the element of patriotism came in making the betting very nearly even  a racecourse was marked off on the mesa and at the appointed hour every one was there except the colonel it was arranged that each man should ride his own horse and the englishman who had acquired something of the freeandeasy bearing that distinguishes the mining sharp was already atop of his magnificent animal with one leg thrown carelessly across the pommel of his mexican saddle as he puffed his cigar with calm confidence in the result of the race he was conscious too that he possessed the secret sympathy of all even of those who had felt it their duty to bet against him the judge watch in hand was growing impatient when the colonel appeared about a halfmile away and bore down upon the crowd everyone was eager to inspect his mount and such a mount as it proved to be was never before seen even in left bower  you have seen perfect skeletons of horses often enough no doubt but this animal was not even a perfect skeleton there were bones missing here and there which you would not have believed the beast could have spared little the colonel had called her she was not an inch less than eighteen hands high and long out of all reasonable proportion she was so hollow in the back that she seemed to have been bent in a machine she had neither tail nor mane and her neck as long as a man stuck straight up into the air supporting a head without ears her eyes had an expression in them of downright insanity and the muscles of her face were afflicted with periodical convulsions that drew back the corners of the mouth and wrinkled the upper lip so as to produce a ghastly grin every two or three seconds in color she was claybank with great blotches of white as if she had been pelted with small bags of flour the crookedness of her legs was beyond all comparison and as to her gait it was that of a blind camel walking diagonally across innumerable deep ditches altogether she looked like the crude result of natures first experiment in equifaction  as this libel on all horses shambled up to the starting post there was a general shout the sympathies of the crowd changed in the twinkling of an eye everyone wanted to bet on her and the englishman himself was only restrained from doing so by a sense of honor it was growing late however and the judge insisted on starting them they got off very well together and seeing the mare was unconscionably slow the englishman soon pulled his animal in and permitted the ugly thing to pass him so as to enjoy a back view of her that sealed his fate the course had been marked off in a circle of two miles in circumference and some twenty feet wide the limits plainly defined by little furrows before the animals had gone a half mile both had been permitted to settle down into a comfortable walk in which they continued threefourths of the way round the ring then the englishman thought it time to whip up and canter in  but he didnt as he came up alongside the lightning express as the crowd had begun to call her that creature turned her head diagonally backward and let fall a smile the encroaching beast stopped as if he had been shot his rider plied whip and forced him again forward upon the track of the equine hag but with the same result  the englishman was now alarmed he struggled manfully with rein and whip and shout amidst the tremendous cheering and inextinguishable laughter of the crowd to force his animal past now on this side now on that but it would not do prompted by the fiend in the concavity of her back the unthinkable quadruped dropped her grins right and left with such seasonable accuracy that again and again the competing beast was struck all of a heap just at the moment of seeming success and finally when by a tremendous spurt his rider endeavored to thrust him by within half a dozen lengths of the winning post the incarnate nightmare turned squarely about and fixed upon him a portentous staredelivering at the same time a grimace of such prodigious ghastliness that the poor thoroughbred with an almost human scream of terror wheeled about and tore away to the rear with the speed of the wind leaving the colonel an easy winner in twenty minutes and ten seconds     the failure of hope  wandel   from mr jabez hope in chicago to mr pike wandel of new orleans december 2 1877  i will not bore you my dear fellow with a narrative of my journey from new orleans to this polar region it is cold in chicago believe me and the southron who comes here as i did without a relay of noses and ears will have reason to regret his mistaken economy in arranging his outfit  to business lake michigan is frozen stiff fancy o child of a torrid clime a sheet of anybodys ice three hundred miles long forty broad and six feet thick it sounds like a lie pikey dear but your partner in the firm of hope  wandel wholesale boots and shoes new orleans is never known to fib my plan is to collar that ice wind up the present business and send on the money at once ill put up a warehouse as big as the capitol at washington store it full and ship to your orders as the southern market may require i can send it in planks for skating floors in statuettes for the mantel in shavings for juleps or in solution for ice cream and general purposes it is a big thing  i inclose a thin slip as a sample did you ever see such charming ice   from mr pike wandel of new orleans to mr jabez hope in chicago december 24 1877  your letter was so abominably defaced by blotting and blurring that it was entirely illegible it must have come all the way by water by the aid of chemicals and photography however i have made it out but you forgot to inclose the sample of ice  i have sold off everything at an alarming sacrifice i am sorry to say and inclose draft for net amount shall begin to spar for orders at once i trust everything to youbut i say has anybody tried to grow ice in this vicinity there is lake ponchartrain you know   from mr jabez hope in chicago to mr pike wandel of new orleans february 27 1878  wannie dear it would do you good to see our new warehouse for the ice though made of boards and run up rather hastily it is as pretty as a picture and cost a deal of money though i pay no ground rent it is about as big as the capitol at washington do you think it ought to have a steeple i have it nearly filledfifty men cutting and storing day and nightawful cold work by the way the ice which when i wrote you last was ten feet thick is now thinner but dont you worry there is plenty  our warehouse is eight or ten miles out of town so i am not much bothered by visitors which is a relief such a giggling sniggering lot you never saw  it seems almost too absurdly incredible wannie but do you know i believe this ice of ours gains in coldness as the warm weather comes on i do indeed and you may mention the fact in the advertisements   from mr pike wandel of new orleans to mr jabez hope in chicago march 7 1878  all goes well i get hundreds of orders we shall do a roaring trade as the new orleans and chicago semperfrigid ice company but you have not told me whether the ice is fresh or salt if it is fresh it wont do for cooking and if it is salt it will spoil the mint juleps  is it as cold in the middle as the outside cuts are   from mr jebez hope from chicago to mr pike wandel of new orleans april 3 1878  navigation on the lakes is now open and ships are thick as ducks im afloat en route for buffalo with the assets of the new orleans and chicago semperfrigid ice company in my vest pocket we are busted out my poor pikeywe are to fortune and to fame unknown arrange a meeting of the creditors and dont attend  last night a schooner from milwaukee was smashed into matchwood on an enormous mass of floating icethe first berg ever seen in these waters it is described by the survivors as being about as big as the capital at washington onehalf of that iceberg belongs to you pikey  the melancholy fact is i built our warehouse on an unfavorable site about a mile out from the shore on the ice you understand and when the thaw cameo my god wannie it was the saddest thing you ever saw in all your life you will be so glad to know i was not in it at the time  what a ridiculous question you ask me my poor partner you dont seem to know very much about the ice business     perry chumlys eclipse   the spectroscope is a singularly beautiful and delicate instrument consisting essentially of a prism of glass which decomposing the light of any heavenly body to which the instrument is directed presents a spectrum or long bar of color crossing this are narrow dark and bright lines produced by the gases of metals in combustion whereby the celestial orbs light is generated from these dark and bright lines therefore we ascertain all that is worth knowing about the composition of the sun and stars  now ben had made some striking discoveries in spectroscopic analysis at his private garden observatory and had also an instrument of superior power and capacity invented or at least much improved by himself and this instrument it was that he and i were arranging for an examination of the comet then flaming in the heavens william sat by apparently uninterested finally we had our arrangements for an observation completed and ben said now turn her on  that reminds me said william of a little story about perry chumly who  for the sake of science william i interrupted laying a hand on his arm i must beg you not to relate it the comet will in a few minutes be behind the roof of yonder lodging house we really have no time for the story  no said ben time presses and anyhow ive heard it before  this perry chumly resumed william believed himself a born astronomer and always kept a bit of smoked glass he was particularly great on solar eclipses i have known him to sit up all night looking out for one  ben had now got the spectroscope trained skyward to suit him and in order to exclude all irrelevant light had let down the windowblind on the tube of it the spectrum of the comet came out beautifullya long bar of color crossed with a lovely ruling of thin dark and bright lines the sight of which elicited from us an exclamation of satisfaction  one day continued william from his seat at another window some one told perry chumly there would be an eclipse of the sun that afternoon at three oclock now perry had recently read a story about some men who in exploring a deep cañon in the mountains had looked up from the bottom and seen the stars shining at midday it occurred to him that this knowledge might be so utilized as to give him a fine view of the eclipse and enable him at the same time to see what the stars would appear to think about it  this said ben pointing to one of the dark lines in the cometic spectrum this is produced by the vapor of carbon in the nucleus of the heavenly visitant you will observe that it differs but slightly from the lines that come of volatilized iron examined with this magnifying glassadjusting that instrument to his eyeit will probably showby jove he ejaculated after a nearer view it isnt carbon at all it is meat  of course proceeded william of course perry chumly did not have any cañon so what did the fellow do but let himself down with his arms and legs to the bottom of an old well about thirty feet deep and with the cold water up to his middle and the frogs pollywogs and aquatic lizards quarreling for the cosy corners of his pockets there he stood waiting for the sun to appear in the field of his instrument and be eclipsed  ben you are joking i remarked with some asperity you are taking liberties with science benjamin it cant be meat you know  i tell you it is though was his excited reply it is just meat i tell you and this other line which at first i took for sodium is bonebone sir or im an asteroid i never saw the like that comet must be densely peopled with butchers and horseknackers  when perry chumly had waited a long time william went on to say looking up and expecting every minute to see the sun it began to get into his mind somehow that the bright circular opening above his headthe mouth of the wellwas the sun and that the black disk of the moon was all that was needed to complete the expected phenomenon the notion soon took complete obsession of his brain so that he forgot where he was and imagined himself standing on the surface of the earth  i was now scrutinizing the cometic spectrum very closely being particularly attracted by a thin faint line which i thought ben had overlooked  oh that is nothing he explained thats a mere local fault arising from conditions peculiar to the medium through which the light is transmittedthe atmosphere of this neighborhood it is whisky this other line though shows the faintest imaginable trace of soap and these uncertain wavering ones are caused by some effluvium not in the comet itself but in the region beyond it i am compelled to pronounce it tobacco smoke i will now tilt the instrument so as to get the spectrum of the celestial wanderers tail ah there we have it splendid  now this old well said william was near a road along which was traveling a big and particularly hideous nigger  see here thomas exclaimed ben removing the magnifying glass from his eye and looking me earnestly in the face if i were to tell you that the coma of this eccentric heavenly body is really hair as its name implies would you believe it  no ben i certainly should not  well i wont argue the matter there are the linesthey speak for themselves but now that i look again you are not entirely wrong there is a considerable admixture of jute moss and i think tallow it certainly is most remarkable sir isaac newton  that big nigger drawled william felt thirsty and seeing the mouth of the well thought there was perhaps a bucket in it so he ventured to creep forward on his hands and knees and look in over the edge  suddenly our spectrum vanished and a very singular one of a quite different appearance presented itself in the same place it was a dim spectrum crossed by a single broad bar of pale yellow  ah said ben our waif of the upper deep is obscured by a cloud let us see what the misty veil is made of  he took a look at the spectrum with his magnifying glass started back and muttered brown linen by thunder  you can imagine the rapture of perry chumly pursued the indefatigable william when he saw as he supposed the moons black disk encroaching upon the body of the luminary that had so long riveted his gaze but when that obscuring satellite had thrust herself so far forward that the eclipse became almost annular and he saw her staring down upon a darkened world with glittering white eyes and a double row of flashing teeth it is perhaps not surprising that he vented a scream of terror fainted and collapsed among his frogs as for the big nigger almost equally terrified by this shriek from the abyss he executed a precipitate movement which only the breaking of his neck prevented from being a double backsomersault and lay dead in the weeds with his tongue out and his face the color of a cometic spectrum we laid them in the same grave poor fellows and on many a still summer evening afterward i strayed to the lonely little churchyard to listen to the smothered requiem chanted by the frogs that we had neglected to remove from the pockets of the lamented astronomer  and now added william taking his heels from the window as you can not immediately resume your spectroscopic observations on that redhaired chambermaid in the dormerwindow who pulled down the blind when i made a mouth at her i move that we adjourn     a providential intimation   mr algernon jarvis of san francisco got up cross the world of mr jarvis had gone wrong with him overnight as ones world is likely to do when one sits up till morning with jovial friends to watch it and he was prone to resentment no sooner therefore had he got himself into a neat fashionable suit of clothing than he selected his morning walkingstick and sallied out upon the town with a vague general determination to attack something his first victim would naturally have been his breakfast but singularly enough he fell upon this with so feeble an energy that he was himself beatento the grieved astonishment of the worthy rôtisseur who had to record his hitherto puissant patrons maiden defeat three or four cups of café noir were the only captives that graced mr jarvis gastric chariotwheels that morning  he lit a long cigar and sauntered moodily down the street so occupied with schemes of universal retaliation that his feet had it all their own way in consequence of which their owner soon found himself in the billiardroom of the occidental hotel nobody was there but mr jarvis was a privileged person so going to the markers desk he took out a little box of ivory balls spilled them carelessly over a table and languidly assailed them with a long stick  presently by the merest chance he executed a marvelous stroke waiting till the astonished balls had resumed their composure he gathered them up replacing them in their former position he tried the stroke again and naturally did not make it again he placed the balls and again he badly failed with a vexed and humilated air he once more put the indocile globes into position leaned over the table and was upon the point of striking when there sounded a solemn voice from behind  bet you two bits you dont make it  mr jarvis erected himself he turned about and looked at the speaker whom he found to be a strangerone that most persons would prefer should remain a stranger mr jarvis made no reply in the first place he was a man of aristocratic taste to whom a wager of two bits was simply vulgar secondly the man who had proffered it evidently had not the money still it is annoying to have ones skill questioned by ones social inferiors particularly when one has doubts of it oneself and is otherwise illtempered so mr jarvis stood his cue against the table laid off his fashionable morningcoat resumed his stick spread his fine figure upon the table with his back to the ceiling and took deliberate aim  at this point mr jarvis drops out of this history and is seen no more forever persons of the class to which he adds lustre are sacred from the pen of the humorist they are ridiculous but not amusing so now we will dismiss this uninteresting young aristocrat retaining merely his outer shell the fashionable morningcoat which mr stenner the gentleman who had offered the wager has quietly thrown across his arm and is conveying away for his own advantage  an hour later mr stenner sat in his humble lodgings at north beach with the pilfered garment upon his knees he had already taken the opinion of an eminent pawnbroker on its value and it only remained to search the pockets mr stenners notions concerning gentlemens coats were not so clear as they might have been broadly stated they were that these garments abounded in secret pockets crowded with a wealth of bank notes interspersed with gold coins he was therefore disappointed when his careful quest was rewarded with only a delicately perfumed handkerchief upon which he could not hope to obtain a loan of more than ten cents a pair of gloves too small for use and a bit of paper that was not a cheque a second look at this however inspired hope it was about the size of a flounder ruled in wide lines and bore in conspicuous characters the words western union telegraph company immediately below this interesting legend was much other printed matter the purport of which was that the company did not hold itself responsible for the verbal accuracy of the following message and did not consider itself either morally or legally bound to forward or deliver it nor in short to render any kind of service for the money paid by the sender  unfamiliar with telegraphy mr stenner naturally supposed that a message subject to these hard conditions must be one of not only grave importance but questionable character so he determined to decipher it at that time and place in the course of the day he succeeded in so doing it ran as follows omitting the date and the names of persons and places which were of course quite illegible  buy sally meeker  had the full force of this remarkable adjuration burst upon mr stenner all at once it might have carried him away which would not have been so bad a thing for san francisco but as the meaning had to percolate slowly through a dense dyke of ignorance it produced no other immediate effect than the exclamation well ill be bust  in the mouths of some persons this form of expression means a great deal on the stenner tongue it signified the hopeless nature of the stenner mental confusion  it must be confessedby persons outside a certain limited and sordid circlethat the message lacks amplification and elaboration in its terse bald diction there is a ghastly suggestion of traffic in human flesh for which in california there is no market since the abolition of slavery and the importation of thoroughbred beeves if woman suffrage had been established all would have been clear mr stenner would at once have understood the kind of purchase advised for in political transactions he had very often changed hands himself but it was all a muddle and resolving to dismiss the matter from his thoughts he went to bed thinking of nothing else for many hours his excited imagination would do nothing but purchase slightly damaged sally meekers by the bale and retail them to itself at an enormous profit  next day it flashed upon his memory who sally meeker wasa racing mare at this entirely obvious solution of the problem he was overcome with amazement at his own sagacity rushing into the street he purchased not sally meeker but a sporting paperand in it found the notice of a race which was to come off the following week and sure enough there it was  budd doble enters gg clipper bob scotty enters bg lightnin staley tupper enters ss upandust sim salper enters bm sally meeker  it was clear now the sender of the dispatch was in the know sally meeker was to win and her owner who did not know it had offered her for sale at that supreme moment mr stenner would willingly have been a rich man in fact he resolved to be he at once betook him to vallejo where he had lived until invited away by some influential citizens of the place there he immediately sought out an industrious friend who had an amiable weakness for draw poker and in whom mr stenner regularly encouraged that passion by going up against him every payday and despoiling him of his hard earnings he did so this time to the sum of one hundred dollars  no sooner had he raked in his last pool and refused his friends appeal for a trifling loan wherewith to pay for breakfast than he bought a check on the bank of california enclosed it in a letter containing merely the words bi saly meker and dispatched it by mail to the only clergyman in san francisco whose name he knew mr stenner had a vague notion that all kinds of business requiring strict honesty and fidelity might be profitably intrusted to the clergy otherwise what was the use of religion i hope i shall not be accused of disrespect to the cloth in thus bluntly setting forth mr stenners estimate of the parsons inasmuch as i do not share it  this business off his mind mr stenner unbent in a weeks revelry at the end of which he worked his passage down to san francisco to secure his winnings on the race and take charge of his peerless mare it will be observed that his notions concerning races were somewhat confused his experience of them had hitherto been confined to that branch of the business requiring not technical knowledge but manual dexterity in short he had done no more than pick the pockets of the spectators arrived at san francisco he was hastening to the dwelling of his clerical agent when he met an acquaintance to whom he put the triumphant question how about sally meeker  sally meeker sally meeker was the reply oh you mean the hoss why shes gone up the flume broke her neck the first heat but ole sim salper is never agoin to fret hisself to a shadder about it he struck it pizen in the mine she was named ater and the stocks gone up from nothin out o sight you couldnt tech that stock with a tenfoot pole  which was a blow to mr stenner he saw his error the message in the coat had evidently been sent to a broker and referred to the stock of the sally meeker mine and he stenner was a ruined man  suddenly a great monstrous misbegotten and unmentionable oath rolled from mr stenners tongue like a cannon shot hurled along an uneven floor might it not be that the rev mr boltright had also misunderstood the message and had bought not the mare but the stock the thought was electrical mr stenner ranhe flew he tarried not at walls and the smaller sort of houses but went through or over them in five minutes he stood before the good clergymanand in one more had asked in a hoarse whisper if he had bought any sally meeker  my good friend was the bland replymy fellow traveler to the bar of god it would better comport with your spiritual needs to inquire what you should do to be saved but since you ask me i will confess that having received what i am compelled to regard as a providential intimation accompanied with the secular means of obedience i did put up a small margin and purchase largely of the stock you mention the venture i am constrained to state was not wholly unprofitable  unprofitable the good man had made a square twentyfive thousand dollars on that small margin to concludehe has it yet     mr swiddlers flipflap   jerome bowles said the gentleman called swiddler was to be hanged on friday the ninth of november at five oclock in the afternoon this was to occur at the town of flatbroke where he was then in prison jerome was my friend and naturally i differed with the jury that had convicted him as to the degree of guilt implied by the conceded fact that he had shot an indian without direct provocation ever since his trial i had been endeavoring to influence the governor of the state to grant a pardon but public sentiment was against me a fact which i attributed partly to the innate pigheadness of the people and partly to the recent establishment of churches and schools which had corrupted the primitive notions of a frontier community but i labored hard and unremittingly by all manner of direct and indirect means during the whole period in which jerome lay under sentence of death and on the very morning of the day set for the execution the governor sent for me and saying he did not purpose being worried by my importunities all winter handed me the document which he had so often refused  armed with the precious paper i flew to the telegraph office to send a dispatch to the sheriff at flatbroke i found the operator locking the door of the office and putting up the shutters i pleaded in vain he said he was going to see the hanging and really had no time to send my message i must explain that flatbroke was fifteen miles away i was then at swan creek the state capital  the operator being inexorable i ran to the railroad station to see how soon there would be a train for flatbroke the station man with cool and polite malice informed me that all the employees of the road had been given a holiday to see jerome bowles hanged and had already gone by an early train that there would be no other train till the next day  i was now furious but the station man quietly turned me out locking the gates dashing to the nearest livery stable i ordered a horse why prolong the record of my disappointment not a horse could i get in that town all had been engaged weeks before to take people to the hanging so everybody said at least though i now know there was a rascally conspiracy to defeat the ends of mercy for the story of the pardon had got abroad  it was now ten oclock i had only seven hours in which to do my fifteen miles afoot but i was an excellent walker and thoroughly angry there was no doubt of my ability to make the distance with an hour to spare the railway offered the best chance it ran straight as a string across a level treeless prairie whereas the highway made a wide detour by way of another town  i took to the track like a modoc on the war path before i had gone a halfmile i was overtaken by that jim peasley as he was called in swan creek an incurable practical joker loved and shunned by all who knew him he asked me as he came up if i were going to the show thinking it was best to dissemble i told him i was but said nothing of my intention to stop the performance i thought it would be a lesson to that jim to let him walk fifteen miles for nothing for it was clear that he was going too still i wished he would go on ahead or drop behind but he could not very well do the former and would not do the latter so we trudged on together it was a cloudy day and very sultry for that time of the year the railway stretched away before us between its double row of telegraph poles in rigid sameness terminating in a point at the horizon on either hand the disheartening monotony of the prairie was unbroken  i thought little of these things however for my mental exaltation was proof against the depressing influence of the scene i was about to save the life of my friendto restore a crack shot to society indeed i scarcely thought of that jim whose heels were grinding the hard gravel close behind me except when he saw fit occasionally to propound the sententious and i thought derisive query tired of course i was but i would have died rather than confess it  we had gone in this way about half the distance probably in much less than half the seven hours and i was getting my second wind when that jim again broke the silence  used to bounce in a circus didnt you  this was quite true in a season of pecuniary depression i had once put my legs into my stomachhad turned my athletic accomplishments to financial advantage it was not a pleasant topic and i said nothing that jim persisted  wouldnt like to do a feller a somersault now eh  the mocking tongue of this jeer was intolerable the fellow evidently considered me done up so taking a short run i clapped my hands to my thighs and executed as pretty a flipflap as ever was made without a springboard at the moment i came erect with my head still spinning i felt that jim crowd past me giving me a twirl that almost sent me off the track a moment later he had dashed ahead at a tremendous pace laughing derisively over his shoulder as if he had done a remarkably clever thing to gain the lead  i was on the heels of him in less than ten minutes though i must confess the fellow could walk amazingly in half an hour i had run past him and at the end of the hour such was my slashing gait he was a mere black dot in my rear and appeared to be sitting on one of the rails thoroughly used up  relieved of mr peasley i naturally began thinking of my poor friend in the flatbroke jail and it occurred to me that something might happen to hasten the execution i knew the feeling of the country against him and that many would be there from a distance who would naturally wish to get home before nightfall nor could i help admitting to myself that five oclock was an unreasonably late hour for a hanging tortured with these fears i unconsciously increased my pace with every step until it was almost a run i stripped off my coat and flung it away opened my collar and unbuttoned my waistcoat and at last puffing and steaming like a locomotive engine i burst into a thin crowd of idlers on the outskirts of the town and flourished the pardon crazily above my head yelling cut him downcut him down  then as every one stared in blank amazement and nobody said anything i found time to look about me marveling at the oddly familiar appearance of the town as i looked the houses streets and everything seemed to undergo a sudden and mysterious transposition with reference to the points of the compass as if swinging round on a pivot and like one awakened from a dream i found myself among accustomed scenes to be plain about it i was back again in swan creek as right as a trivet  it was all the work of that jim peasley the designing rascal had provoked me to throw a confusing somersault then bumped against me turning me half round and started on the back track thereby inciting me to hook it in the same direction the cloudy day the two lines of telegraph poles one on each side of the track the entire sameness of the landscape to the right and leftthese had all conspired to prevent my observing that i had put about  when the excursion train returned from flatbroke that evening the passengers were told a little story at my expense it was just what they needed to cheer them up a bit after what they had seen for that flipflap of mine had broken the neck of jerome bowles seven miles away     the little story   dramatis personÆa supernumerary editor a probationary contributor  scenethe expounder office  probationary contributoreditor in  supernumerary editordead  pcthe gods favor me produces roll of manuscript here is a little story which i will read to you  seo o  pcreads it was the last night of the yeara naughty noxious offensive night in the principal street of san francisco  seconfound san francisco  pcit had to be somewhere reads  in the principal street of san francisco stood a small female orphan marking time like a volunteer her little bare feet imprinted cold kisses on the pavingstones as she put them down and drew them up alternately the chilling rain was having a good time with her scalp and toyed soppily with her hairher own hair the nightwind shrewdly searched her tattered garments as if it had suspected her of smuggling she saw crowds of determinedlooking persons grimly ruining themselves in toys and confectionery for the dear ones at home and she wished she was in a position to ruin a littlejust a little then as the happy throng sped by her with loads of things to make the children sick she leaned against an iron lamppost in front of a bakeshop and turned on the wicked envy she thought poor thing she would like to be a cakefor this little girl was very hungry indeed then she tried again and thought she would like to be a tart with smashed fruit inside then she would be warmed over every day and nobody would eat her for the child was cold as well as hungry finally she tried quite hard and thought she could be very well content as an oven for then she would be kept always hot and bakers would put all manner of good things into her with a long shovel  seive read that somewhere  pcvery likely this little story has never been rejected by any paper to which i have offered it it gets better too every time i write it when it first appeared in veracity the editor said it cost him a hundred subscribers just mark the improvement reads  the hours glided byexcept a few that froze to the pavementuntil midnight the streets were now deserted and the almanac having predicted a new moon about this time the lamps had been conscientiously extinguished suddenly a great globe of sound fell from an adjacent churchtower and exploded on the night with a deep metallic boom then all the clocks and bells began ringingin the new yearpounding and banging and yelling and finishing off all the nervous invalids left over from the preceding sunday the little orphan started from her dream leaving a small patch of skin on the frosted lamppost clasped her thin blue hands and looked upward with mad disquietude  sein the monitor it was with covetous eyes  pci know it hadnt read byron then clever dog byron reads  presently a cranberry tart dropped at her feet apparently from the clouds  sehow about those angels  pcthe editor of good will cut em out he said san francisco was no place for them and i dont believe  sethere there never mind go on with the little story  pcreads as she stooped to take up the tart a veal sandwich came whizzing down and cuffed one of her ears next a wheaten loaf made her dodge nimbly and then a broad ham fell flatfooted at her toes a sack of flour burst in the middle of the street a side of bacon impaled itself on an iron hitchingpost pretty soon a chain of sausages fell in a circle around her flattening out as if a roadroller had passed over them then there was a lullnothing came down but dried fish cold puddings and flannel underclothing but presently her wishes began to take effect again and a quarter of beef descended with terrific momentum upon the top of the little orphans head  sehow did the editor of the reasonable virtues like that quarter of beef  pcoh he swallowed it like a little man and stuck in a few dressed pigs of his own ive left them out because i dont want outsiders altering the little story reads  one would have thought that ought to suffice but not so bedding shoes firkins of butter mighty cheeses ropes of onions quantities of loose jam kegs of oysters titanic fowls crates of crockery and glassware assorted housekeeping things cooking ranges and tons of coal poured down in broad cataracts from a bounteous heaven piling themselves above that infant to a depth of twenty feet the weather was more than two hours in clearing up and as late as halfpast three a ponderous hogshead of sugar struck at the corner of clay and kearney streets with an impact that shook the peninsula like an earthquake and stopped every clock in town  at daybreak the good merchants arrived upon the scene with shovels and wheelbarrows and before the sun of the new year was an hour old they had provided for all of these provisionshad stowed them away in their cellars and nicely arranged them on their shelves ready for sale to the deserving poor  seand the little girlwhat became of her  pcyou musnt get ahead of the little story reads  when they had got down to the wicked little orphan who had not been content with her lot some one brought a broom and she was carefully swept and smoothed out then they lifted her tenderly and carried her to the coroner that functionary was standing in the door of his office and with a deprecatory wave of his hand he said to the man who was bearing her  there go away my good fellow there was a man here three times yesterday trying to sell me just such a map     the parenticide club     my favorite murder   having murdered my mother under circumstances of singular atrocity i was arrested and put upon my trial which lasted seven years in charging the jury the judge of the court of acquittal remarked that it was one of the most ghastly crimes that he had ever been called upon to explain away  at this my attorney rose and said  may it please your honor crimes are ghastly or agreeable only by comparison if you were familiar with the details of my clients previous murder of his uncle you would discern in his later offense if offense it may be called something in the nature of tender forbearance and filial consideration for the feelings of the victim the appalling ferocity of the former assassination was indeed inconsistent with any hypothesis but that of guilt and had it not been for the fact that the honorable judge before whom he was tried was the president of a life insurance company that took risks on hanging and in which my client held a policy it is hard to see how he could decently have been acquitted if your honor would like to hear about it for instruction and guidance of your honors mind this unfortunate man my client will consent to give himself the pain of relating it under oath  the district attorney said your honor i object such a statement would be in the nature of evidence and the testimony in this case is closed the prisoners statement should have been introduced three years ago in the spring of 1881  in a statutory sense said the judge you are right and in the court of objections and technicalities you would get a ruling in your favor but not in a court of acquittal the objection is overruled  i except said the district attorney  you cannot do that the judge said i must remind you that in order to take an exception you must first get this case transferred for a time to the court of exceptions on a formal motion duly supported by affidavits a motion to that effect by your predecessor in office was denied by me during the first year of this trial mr clerk swear the prisoner  the customary oath having been administered i made the following statement which impressed the judge with so strong a sense of the comparative triviality of the offense for which i was on trial that he made no further search for mitigating circumstances but simply instructed the jury to acquit and i left the court without a stain upon my reputation  i was born in 1856 in kalamakee mich of honest and reputable parents one of whom heaven has mercifully spared to comfort me in my later years in 1867 the family came to california and settled near nigger head where my father opened a road agency and prospered beyond the dreams of avarice he was a reticent saturnine man then though his increasing years have now somewhat relaxed the austerity of his disposition and i believe that nothing but his memory of the sad event for which i am now on trial prevents him from manifesting a genuine hilarity  four years after we had set up the road agency an itinerant preacher came along and having no other way to pay for the nights lodging that we gave him favored us with an exhortation of such power that praise god we were all converted to religion my father at once sent for his brother the hon william ridley of stockton and on his arrival turned over the agency to him charging him nothing for the franchise nor plantthe latter consisting of a winchester rifle a sawedoff shotgun and an assortment of masks made out of flour sacks the family then moved to ghost rock and opened a dance house it was called the saints rest hurdygurdy and the proceedings each night began with prayer it was there that my now sainted mother by her grace in the dance acquired the sobriquet of the bucking walrus  in the fall of 75 i had occasion to visit coyote on the road to mahala and took the stage at ghost rock there were four other passengers about three miles beyond nigger head persons whom i identified as my uncle william and his two sons held up the stage finding nothing in the express box they went through the passengers i acted a most honorable part in the affair placing myself in line with the others holding up my hands and permitting myself to be deprived of forty dollars and a gold watch from my behavior no one could have suspected that i knew the gentlemen who gave the entertainment a few days later when i went to nigger head and asked for the return of my money and watch my uncle and cousins swore they knew nothing of the matter and they affected a belief that my father and i had done the job ourselves in dishonest violation of commercial good faith uncle william even threatened to retaliate by starting an opposition dance house at ghost rock as the saints rest had become rather unpopular i saw that this would assuredly ruin it and prove a paying enterprise so i told my uncle that i was willing to overlook the past if he would take me into the scheme and keep the partnership a secret from my father this fair offer he rejected and i then perceived that it would be better and more satisfactory if he were dead  my plans to that end were soon perfected and communicating them to my dear parents i had the gratification of receiving their approval my father said he was proud of me and my mother promised that although her religion forbade her to assist in taking human life i should have the advantage of her prayers for my success as a preliminary measure looking to my security in case of detection i made an application for membership in that powerful order the knights of murder and in due course was received as a member of the ghost rock commandery on the day that my probation ended i was for the first time permitted to inspect the records of the order and learn who belonged to itall the rites of initiation having been conducted in masks fancy my delight when in looking over the roll of membership i found the third name to be that of my uncle who indeed was junior vicechancellor of the order here was an opportunity exceeding my wildest dreamsto murder i could add insubordination and treachery it was what my good mother would have called a special providence  at about this time something occurred which caused my cup of joy already full to overflow on all sides a circular cataract of bliss three men strangers in that locality were arrested for the stage robbery in which i had lost my money and watch they were brought to trial and despite my efforts to clear them and fasten the guilt upon three of the most respectable and worthy citizens of ghost rock convicted on the clearest proof the murder would now be as wanton and reasonless as i could wish  one morning i shouldered my winchester rifle and going over to my uncles house near nigger head asked my aunt mary his wife if he were at home adding that i had come to kill him my aunt replied with her peculiar smile that so many gentleman called on that errand and were afterward carried away without having performed it that i must excuse her for doubting my good faith in the matter she said i did not look as if i would kill anybody so as a proof of good faith i leveled my rifle and wounded a chinaman who happened to be passing the house she said she knew whole families that could do a thing of that kind but bill ridley was a horse of another color she said however that i would find him over on the other side of the creek in the sheep lot and she added that she hoped the best man would win  my aunt mary was one of the most fairminded women that i have ever met  i found my uncle down on his knees engaged in skinning a sheep seeing that he had neither gun nor pistol handy i had not the heart to shoot him so i approached him greeted him pleasantly and struck him a powerful blow on the head with the butt of my rifle i have a very good delivery and uncle william lay down on his side then rolled over on his back spread out his fingers and shivered before he could recover the use of his limbs i seized the knife that he had been using and cut his hamstrings you know doubtless that when you sever the tendo achillis the patient has no further use of his leg it is just the same as if he had no leg well i parted them both and when he revived he was at my service as soon as he comprehended the situation he said  samuel you have got the drop on me and can afford to be generous i have only one thing to ask of you and that is that you carry me to the house and finish me in the bosom of my family  i told him i thought that a pretty reasonable request and i would do so if he would let me put him into a wheat sack he would be easier to carry that way and if we were seen by the neighbors en route it would cause less remark he agreed to that and going to the barn i got a sack this however did not fit him it was too short and much wider than he so i bent his legs forced his knees up against his breast and got him into it that way tying the sack above his head he was a heavy man and i had all that i could do to get him on my back but i staggered along for some distance until i came to a swing that some of the children had suspended to the branch of an oak here i laid him down and sat upon him to rest and the sight of the rope gave me a happy inspiration in twenty minutes my uncle still in the sack swung free to the sport of the wind  i had taken down the rope tied one end tightly about the mouth of the bag thrown the other across the limb and hauled him up about five feet from the ground fastening the other end of the rope also about the mouth of the sack i had the satisfaction to see my uncle converted into a large fine pendulum i must add that he was not himself entirely aware of the nature of the change that he had undergone in his relation to the exterior world though in justice to a good mans memory i ought to say that i do not think he would in any case have wasted much of my time in vain remonstrance  uncle william had a ram that was famous in all that region as a fighter it was in a state of chronic constitutional indignation some deep disappointment in early life had soured its disposition and it had declared war upon the whole world to say that it would butt anything accessible is but faintly to express the nature and scope of its military activity the universe was its antagonist its methods that of a projectile it fought like the angels and devils in midair cleaving the atmosphere like a bird describing a parabolic curve and descending upon its victim at just the exact angle of incidence to make the most of its velocity and weight its momentum calculated in foottons was something incredible it had been seen to destroy a four year old bull by a single impact upon that animals gnarly forehead no stone wall had ever been known to resist its downward swoop there were no trees tough enough to stay it it would splinter them into matchwood and defile their leafy honors in the dust this irascible and implacable brutethis incarnate thunderboltthis monster of the upper deep i had seen reposing in the shade of an adjacent tree dreaming dreams of conquest and glory it was with a view to summoning it forth to the field of honor that i suspended its master in the manner described  having completed my preparations i imparted to the avuncular pendulum a gentle oscillation and retiring to cover behind a contiguous rock lifted up my voice in a long rasping cry whose diminishing final note was drowned in a noise like that of a swearing cat which emanated from the sack instantly that formidable sheep was upon its feet and had taken in the military situation at a glance in a few moments it had approached stamping to within fifty yards of the swinging foeman who now retreating and anon advancing seemed to invite the fray suddenly i saw the beasts head drop earthward as if depressed by the weight of its enormous horns then a dim white wavy streak of sheep prolonged itself from that spot in a generally horizontal direction to within about four yards of a point immediately beneath the enemy there it struck sharply upward and before it had faded from my gaze at the place whence it had set out i heard a horrid thump and a piercing scream and my poor uncle shot forward with a slack rope higher than the limb to which he was attached here the rope tautened with a jerk arresting his flight and back he swung in a breathless curve to the other end of his arc the ram had fallen a heap of indistinguishable legs wool and horns but pulling itself together and dodging as its antagonist swept downward it retired at random alternately shaking its head and stamping its forefeet when it had backed about the same distance as that from which it had delivered the assault it paused again bowed its head as if in prayer for victory and again shot forward dimly visible as beforea prolonging white streak with monstrous undulations ending with a sharp ascension its course this time was at a right angle to its former one and its impatience so great that it struck the enemy before he had nearly reached the lowest point of his arc in consequence he went flying round and round in a horizontal circle whose radius was about equal to half the length of the rope which i forgot to say was nearly twenty feet long his shrieks crescendo in approach and diminuendo in recession made the rapidity of his revolution more obvious to the ear than to the eye he had evidently not yet been struck in a vital spot his posture in the sack and the distance from the ground at which he hung compelled the ram to operate upon his lower extremities and the end of his back like a plant that has struck its root into some poisonous mineral my poor uncle was dying slowly upward  after delivering its second blow the ram had not again retired the fever of battle burned hot in its heart its brain was intoxicated with the wine of strife like a pugilist who in his rage forgets his skill and fights ineffectively at halfarms length the angry beast endeavored to reach its fleeting foe by awkward vertical leaps as he passed overhead sometimes indeed succeeding in striking him feebly but more frequently overthrown by its own misguided eagerness but as the impetus was exhausted and the mans circles narrowed in scope and diminished in speed bringing him nearer to the ground these tactics produced better results eliciting a superior quality of screams which i greatly enjoyed  suddenly as if the bugles had sung truce the ram suspended hostilities and walked away thoughtfully wrinkling and smoothing its great aquiline nose and occasionally cropping a bunch of grass and slowly munching it it seemed to have tired of wars alarms and resolved to beat the sword into a plowshare and cultivate the arts of peace steadily it held its course away from the field of fame until it had gained a distance of nearly a quarter of a mile there it stopped and stood with its rear to the foe chewing its cud and apparently half asleep i observed however an occasional slight turn of its head as if its apathy were more affected than real  meantime uncle williams shrieks had abated with his motion and nothing was heard from him but long low moans and at long intervals my name uttered in pleading tones exceedingly grateful to my ear evidently the man had not the faintest notion of what was being done to him and was inexpressibly terrified when death comes cloaked in mystery he is terrible indeed little by little my uncles oscillations diminished and finally he hung motionless i went to him and was about to give him the coup de grâce when i heard and felt a succession of smart shocks which shook the ground like a series of light earthquakes and turning in the direction of the ram saw a long cloud of dust approaching me with inconceivable rapidity and alarming effect at a distance of some thirty yards away it stopped short and from the near end of it rose into the air what i at first thought a great white bird its ascent was so smooth and easy and regular that i could not realize its extraordinary celerity and was lost in admiration of its grace to this day the impression remains that it was a slow deliberate movement the ramfor it was that animalbeing upborne by some power other than its own impetus and supported through the successive stages of its flight with infinite tenderness and care my eyes followed its progress through the air with unspeakable pleasure all the greater by contrast with my former terror of its approach by land onward and upward the noble animal sailed its head bent down almost between its knees its forefeet thrown back its hinder legs trailing to rear like the legs of a soaring heron  at a height of forty or fifty feet as fond recollection presents it to view it attained its zenith and appeared to remain an instant stationary then tilting suddenly forward without altering the relative position of its parts it shot downward on a steeper and steeper course with augmenting velocity passed immediately above me with a noise like the rush of a cannon shot and struck my poor uncle almost squarely on the top of the head so frightful was the impact that not only the mans neck was broken but the rope too and the body of the deceased forced against the earth was crushed to pulp beneath the awful front of that meteoric sheep the concussion stopped all the clocks between lone hand and dutch dans and professor davidson a distinguished authority in matters seismic who happened to be in the vicinity promptly explained that the vibrations were from north to southwest  altogether i cannot help thinking that in point of artistic atrocity my murder of uncle william has seldom been excelled     oil of dog   my name is boffer bings i was born of honest parents in one of the humbler walks of life my father being a manufacturer of dogoil and my mother having a small studio in the shadow of the village church where she disposed of unwelcome babes in my boyhood i was trained to habits of industry i not only assisted my father in procuring dogs for his vats but was frequently employed by my mother to carry away the debris of her work in the studio in performance of this duty i sometimes had need of all my natural intelligence for all the law officers of the vicinity were opposed to my mothers business they were not elected on an opposition ticket and the matter had never been made a political issue it just happened so my fathers business of making dogoil was naturally less unpopular though the owners of missing dogs sometimes regarded him with suspicion which was reflected to some extent upon me my father had as silent partners all the physicians of the town who seldom wrote a prescription which did not contain what they were pleased to designate as ol can it is really the most valuable medicine ever discovered but most persons are unwilling to make personal sacrifices for the afflicted and it was evident that many of the fattest dogs in town had been forbidden to play with mea fact which pained my young sensibilities and at one time came near driving me to become a pirate  looking back upon those days i cannot but regret at times that by indirectly bringing my beloved parents to their death i was the author of misfortunes profoundly affecting my future  one evening while passing my fathers oil factory with the body of a foundling from my mothers studio i saw a constable who seemed to be closely watching my movements young as i was i had learned that a constables acts of whatever apparent character are prompted by the most reprehensible motives and i avoided him by dodging into the oilery by a side door which happened to stand ajar i locked it at once and was alone with my dead my father had retired for the night the only light in the place came from the furnace which glowed a deep rich crimson under one of the vats casting ruddy reflections on the walls within the cauldron the oil still rolled in indolent ebullition occasionally pushing to the surface a piece of dog seating myself to wait for the constable to go away i held the naked body of the foundling in my lap and tenderly stroked its short silken hair ah how beautiful it was even at that early age i was passionately fond of children and as i looked upon this cherub i could almost find it in my heart to wish that the small red wound upon its breastthe work of my dear motherhad not been mortal  it had been my custom to throw the babes into the river which nature had thoughtfully provided for the purpose but that night i did not dare to leave the oilery for fear of the constable after all i said to myself it cannot greatly matter if i put it into this cauldron my father will never know the bones from those of a puppy and the few deaths which may result from administering another kind of oil for the incomparable ol can are not important in a population which increases so rapidly in short i took the first step in crime and brought myself untold sorrow by casting the babe into the cauldron  the next day somewhat to my surprise my father rubbing his hands with satisfaction informed me and my mother that he had obtained the finest quality of oil that was ever seen that the physicians to whom he had shown samples had so pronounced it he added that he had no knowledge as to how the result was obtained the dogs had been treated in all respects as usual and were of an ordinary breed i deemed it my duty to explainwhich i did though palsied would have been my tongue if i could have foreseen the consequences bewailing their previous ignorance of the advantages of combining their industries my parents at once took measures to repair the error my mother removed her studio to a wing of the factory building and my duties in connection with the business ceased i was no longer required to dispose of the bodies of the small superfluous and there was no need of alluring dogs to their doom for my father discarded them altogether though they still had an honorable place in the name of the oil so suddenly thrown into idleness i might naturally have been expected to become vicious and dissolute but i did not the holy influence of my dear mother was ever about me to protect me from the temptations which beset youth and my father was a deacon in a church alas that through my fault these estimable persons should have come to so bad an end  finding a double profit in her business my mother now devoted herself to it with a new assiduity she removed not only superfluous and unwelcome babes to order but went out into the highways and byways gathering in children of a larger growth and even such adults as she could entice to the oilery my father too enamored of the superior quality of oil produced purveyed for his vats with diligence and zeal the conversion of their neighbors into dogoil became in short the one passion of their livesan absorbing and overwhelming greed took possession of their souls and served them in place of a hope in heavenby which also they were inspired  so enterprising had they now become that a public meeting was held and resolutions passed severely censuring them it was intimated by the chairman that any further raids upon the population would be met in a spirit of hostility my poor parents left the meeting brokenhearted desperate and i believe not altogether sane anyhow i deemed it prudent not to enter the oilery with them that night but slept outside in a stable  at about midnight some mysterious impulse caused me to rise and peer through a window into the furnaceroom where i knew my father now slept the fires were burning as brightly as if the following days harvest had been expected to be abundant one of the large cauldrons was slowly walloping with a mysterious appearance of selfrestraint as if it bided its time to put forth its full energy my father was not in bed he had risen in his nightclothes and was preparing a noose in a strong cord from the looks which he cast at the door of my mothers bedroom i knew too well the purpose that he had in mind speechless and motionless with terror i could do nothing in prevention or warning suddenly the door of my mothers apartment was opened noiselessly and the two confronted each other both apparently surprised the lady also was in her night clothes and she held in her right hand the tool of her trade a long narrowbladed dagger  she too had been unable to deny herself the last profit which the unfriendly action of the citizens and my absence had left her for one instant they looked into each others blazing eyes and then sprang together with indescribable fury round and round the room they struggled the man cursing the woman shrieking both fighting like demonsshe to strike him with the dagger he to strangle her with his great bare hands i know not how long i had the unhappiness to observe this disagreeable instance of domestic infelicity but at last after a more than usually vigorous struggle the combatants suddenly moved apart  my fathers breast and my mothers weapon showed evidences of contact for another instant they glared at each other in the most unamiable way then my poor wounded father feeling the hand of death upon him leaped forward unmindful of resistance grasped my dear mother in his arms dragged her to the side of the boiling cauldron collected all his failing energies and sprang in with her in a moment both had disappeared and were adding their oil to that of the committee of citizens who had called the day before with an invitation to the public meeting  convinced that these unhappy events closed to me every avenue to an honorable career in that town i removed to the famous city of otumwee where these memoirs are written with a heart full of remorse for a heedless act entailing so dismal a commercial disaster     an imperfect conflagration   early one june morning in 1872 i murdered my fatheran act which made a deep impression on me at the time this was before my marriage while i was living with my parents in wisconsin my father and i were in the library of our home dividing the proceeds of a burglary which we had committed that night these consisted of household goods mostly and the task of equitable division was difficult we got on very well with the napkins towels and such things and the silverware was parted pretty nearly equally but you can see for yourself that when you try to divide a single musicbox by two without a remainder you will have trouble it was that musicbox which brought disaster and disgrace upon our family if we had left it my poor father might now be alive  it was a most exquisite and beautiful piece of workmanshipinlaid with costly woods and carven very curiously it would not only play a great variety of tunes but would whistle like a quail bark like a dog crow every morning at daylight whether it was wound up or not and break the ten commandments it was this last mentioned accomplishment that won my fathers heart and caused him to commit the only dishonorable act of his life though possibly he would have committed more if he had been spared he tried to conceal that musicbox from me and declared upon his honor that he had not taken it though i knew very well that so far as he was concerned the burglary had been undertaken chiefly for the purpose of obtaining it  my father had the musicbox hidden under his cloak we had worn cloaks by way of disguise he had solemnly assured me that he did not take it i knew that he did and knew something of which he was evidently ignorant namely that the box would crow at daylight and betray him if i could prolong the division of profits till that time all occurred as i wished as the gaslight began to pale in the library and the shape of the windows was seen dimly behind the curtains a long cockadoodledoo came from beneath the old gentlemans cloak followed by a few bars of an aria from tannhauser ending with a loud click a small handaxe which we had used to break into the unlucky house lay between us on the table i picked it up the old man seeing that further concealment was useless took the box from under his cloak and set it on the table cut it in two if you prefer that plan said he i tried to save it from destruction  he was a passionate lover of music and could himself play the concertina with expression and feeling  i said i do not question the purity of your motive it would be presumptuous in me to sit in judgment on my father but business is business and with this axe i am going to effect a dissolution of our partnership unless you will consent in all future burglaries to wear a bellpunch  no he said after some reflection no i could not do that it would look like a confession of dishonesty people would say that you distrusted me  i could not help admiring his spirit and sensitiveness for a moment i was proud of him and disposed to overlook his fault but a glance at the richly jeweled musicbox decided me and as i said i removed the old man from this vale of tears having done so i was a trifle uneasy not only was he my fatherthe author of my beingbut the body would be certainly discovered it was now broad daylight and my mother was likely to enter the library at any moment under the circumstances i thought it expedient to remove her also which i did then i paid off all the servants and discharged them  that afternoon i went to the chief of police told him what i had done and asked his advice it would be very painful to me if the facts became publicly known my conduct would be generally condemned the newspapers would bring it up against me if ever i should run for office the chief saw the force of these considerations he was himself an assassin of wide experience after consulting with the presiding judge of the court of variable jurisdiction he advised me to conceal the bodies in one of the bookcases get a heavy insurance on the house and burn it down this i proceeded to do  in the library was a bookcase which my father had recently purchased of some cranky inventor and had not filled it was in shape and size something like the oldfashioned wardrobes which one sees in bedrooms without closets but opened all the way down like a womans nightdress it had glass doors i had recently laid out my parents and they were now rigid enough to stand erect so i stood them in this bookcase from which i had removed the shelves i locked them in and tacked some curtains over the glass doors the inspector from the insurance office passed a halfdozen times before the case without suspicion  that night after getting my policy i set fire to the house and started through the woods to town two miles away where i managed to be found about the time the excitement was at its height with cries of apprehension for the fate of my parents i joined the rush and arrived at the fire some two hours after i had kindled it the whole town was there as i dashed up the house was entirely consumed but in one end of the level bed of glowing embers bolt upright and uninjured was that bookcase the curtains had burned away exposing the glassdoors through which the fierce red light illuminated the interior there stood my dear father in his habit as he lived and at his side the partner of his joys and sorrows not a hair of them was singed their clothing was intact on their heads and throats the injuries which in the accomplishment of my designs i had been compelled to inflict were conspicuous as in the presence of a miracle the people were silent awe and terror had stilled every tongue i was myself greatly affected   some three years later when the events herein related had nearly faded from my memory i went to new york to assist in passing some counterfeit united states bonds carelessly looking into a furniture store one day i saw the exact counterpart of that bookcase i bought it for a trifle from a reformed inventor the dealer explained he said it was fireproof the pores of the wood being filled with alum under hydraulic pressure and the glass made of asbestos i dont suppose it is really fireproofyou can have it at the price of an ordinary bookcase  no i said if you cannot warrant it fireproof i wont take itand i bade him good morning  i would not have had it at any price it revived memories that were exceedingly disagreeable     the hypnotist   by those of my friends who happen to know that i sometimes amuse myself with hypnotism mind reading and kindred phenomena i am frequently asked if i have a clear conception of the nature of whatever principle underlies them to this question i always reply that i neither have nor desire to have i am no investigator with an ear at the keyhole of natures workshop trying with vulgar curiosity to steal the secrets of her trade the interests of science are as little to me as mine seem to have been to science  doubtless the phenomena in question are simple enough and in no way transcend our powers of comprehension if only we could find the clew but for my part i prefer not to find it for i am of a singularly romantic disposition deriving more gratification from mystery than from knowledge it was commonly remarked of me when i was a child that my big blue eyes appeared to have been made rather to look into than look out ofsuch was their dreamful beauty and in my frequent periods of abstraction their indifference to what was going on in those peculiarities they resembled i venture to think the soul which lies behind them always more intent upon some lovely conception which it has created in its own image than concerned about the laws of nature and the material frame of things all this irrelevant and egotistic as it may seem is related by way of accounting for the meagreness of the light that i am able to throw upon a subject that has engaged so much of my attention and concerning which there is so keen and general a curiosity with my powers and opportunities another person might doubtless have an explanation for much of what i present simply as narrative  my first knowledge that i possessed unusual powers came to me in my fourteenth year when at school happening one day to have forgotten to bring my noonday luncheon i gazed longingly at that of a small girl who was preparing to eat hers looking up her eyes met mine and she seemed unable to withdraw them after a moment of hesitancy she came forward in an absent kind of way and without a word surrendered her little basket with its tempting contents and walked away inexpressibly pleased i relieved my hunger and destroyed the basket after that i had not the trouble to bring a luncheon for myself that little girl was my daily purveyor and not infrequently in satisfying my simple need from her frugal store i combined pleasure and profit by constraining her attendance at the feast and making misleading proffer of the viands which eventually i consumed to the last fragment the girl was always persuaded that she had eaten all herself and later in the day her tearful complaints of hunger surprised the teacher entertained the pupils earned for her the sobriquet of greedygut and filled me with a peace past understanding  a disagreeable feature of this otherwise satisfactory condition of things was the necessary secrecy the transfer of the luncheon for example had to be made at some distance from the madding crowd in a wood and i blush to think of the many other unworthy subterfuges entailed by the situation as i was and am naturally of a frank and open disposition these became more and more irksome and but for the reluctance of my parents to renounce the obvious advantages of the new régime i would gladly have reverted to the old the plan that i finally adopted to free myself from the consequences of my own powers excited a wide and keen interest at the time and that part of it which consisted in the death of the girl was severely condemned but it is hardly pertinent to the scope of this narrative  for some years afterward i had little opportunity to practice hypnotism such small essays as i made at it were commonly barren of other recognition than solitary confinement on a breadandwater diet sometimes indeed they elicited nothing better than the catoninetails it was when i was about to leave the scene of these small disappointments that my one really important feat was performed  i had been called into the wardens office and given a suit of civilians clothing a trifling sum of money and a great deal of advice which i am bound to confess was of a much better quality than the clothing as i was passing out of the gate into the light of freedom i suddenly turned and looking the warden gravely in the eye soon had him in control  you are an ostrich i said  at the postmortem examination the stomach was found to contain a great quantity of indigestible articles mostly of wood or metal stuck fast in the oesophagus and constituting according to the coroners jury the immediate cause of death one doorknob  i was by nature a good and affectionate son but as i took my way into the great world from which i had been so long secluded i could not help remembering that all my misfortunes had flowed like a stream from the niggard economy of my parents in the matter of school luncheons and i knew of no reason to think they had reformed  on the road between succotash hill and south asphyxia is a little open field which once contained a shanty known as pete gilstraps place where that gentleman used to murder travelers for a living the death of mr gilstrap and the diversion of nearly all the travel to another road occurred so nearly at the same time that no one has ever been able to say which was cause and which effect anyhow the field was now a desolation and the place had long been burned it was while going afoot to south asphyxia the home of my childhood that i found both my parents on their way to the hill they had hitched their team and were eating luncheon under an oak tree in the center of the field the sight of the luncheon called up painful memories of my school days and roused the sleeping lion in my breast approaching the guilty couple who at once recognized me i ventured to suggest that i share their hospitality  of this cheer my son said the author of my being with characteristic pomposity which age had not withered there is sufficient for but two i am not i hope insensible to the hungerlight in your eyes but  my father has never completed that sentence what he mistook for hungerlight was simply the earnest gaze of the hypnotist in a few seconds he was at my service a few more sufficed for the lady and the dictates of a just resentment could be carried into effect my former father i said i presume that it is known to you that you and this lady are no longer what you were  i have observed a certain subtle change was the rather dubious reply of the old gentleman it is perhaps attributable to age  it is more than that i explained it goes to characterto species you and the lady here are in truth two broncoswild stallions both and unfriendly  why john exclaimed my dear mother you dont mean to say that i am  madam i replied solemnly fixing my eyes again upon hers you are   scarcely had the words fallen from my lips when she dropped upon her hands and knees and backing up to the old man squealed like a demon and delivered a vicious kick upon his shin an instant later he was himself down on allfours headed away from her and flinging his feet at her simultaneously and successively with equal earnestness but inferior agility because of her hampering bodygear she plied her own their flying legs crossed and mingled in the most bewildering way their feet sometimes meeting squarely in midair their bodies thrust forward falling flat upon the ground and for a moment helpless on recovering themselves they would resume the combat uttering their frenzy in the nameless sounds of the furious brutes which they believed themselves to bethe whole region rang with their clamor round and round they wheeled the blows of their feet falling like lightnings from the mountain cloud they plunged and reared backward upon their knees struck savagely at each other with awkward descending blows of both fists at once and dropped again upon their hands as if unable to maintain the upright position of the body grass and pebbles were torn from the soil by hands and feet clothing hair faces inexpressibly defiled with dust and blood wild inarticulate screams of rage attested the delivery of the blows groans grunts and gasps their receipt nothing more truly military was ever seen at gettysburg or waterloo the valor of my dear parents in the hour of danger can never cease to be to me a source of pride and gratification at the end of it all two battered tattered bloody and fragmentary vestiges of mortality attested the solemn fact that the author of the strife was an orphan  arrested for provoking a breach of the peace i was and have ever since been tried in the court of technicalities and continuances whence after fifteen years of proceedings my attorney is moving heaven and earth to get the case taken to the court of remandment for new trials  such are a few of my principal experiments in the mysterious force or agency known as hypnotic suggestion whether or not it could be employed by a bad man for an unworthy purpose i am unable to say     the fourth estate     mr masthead journalist   while i was in kansas i purchased a weekly newspaperthe claybank thundergust of reform this paper had never paid its expenses it had ruined four consecutive publishers but my brotherinlaw mr jefferson scandril of weedhaven was going to run for the legislature and i naturally desired his defeat so it became necessary to have an organ in claybank to assist in his political extinction when the establishment came into my hands the editor was a fellow who had opinions and him i at once discharged with an admonition i had some difficulty in procuring a successor every man in the county applied for the place i could not appoint one without having to fight a majority of the others and was eventually compelled to write to a friend at warm springs in the adjoining state of missouri to send me an editor from abroad whose instalment at the helm of manifest destiny could have no local significance  the man he sent me was a frowsy seedy fellow named mastheadnot larger apparently than a boy of sixteen years though it was difficult to say from the outside how much of him was editor and how much castoff clothing for in the matter of apparel he had acted upon his favorite professional maxim and sunk the individual his attireeminently eclectic and in a sense internationalquite overcame him at all points however as my friend had assured me he was a graduate of one of the largest institutions in his native state i took him in and bought a pen for him my instructions to him were brief and simple  mr masthead said i it is the policy of the thundergust first last and all the time in this world and the next to resent the intrusion of mr jefferson scandril into politics  the first thing the little rascal did was to write a withering leader denouncing mr scandril as a demagogue the degradation of whose political opinions was only equaled by the disgustfulness of the family connections of which those opinions were the spawn  i hastened to point out to mr masthead that it had never been the policy of the thundergust to attack the family relations of an offensive candidate although this was not strictly true  i am very sorry he replied running his head up out of his clothes till it towered as much as six inches above the table at which he sat no offense i hope  oh none in the world said i as carelessly as i could manage it only i dont think it a legitimatethat is an effective method of attack  mr johnson said hei was passing as johnson at that time i remembermr johnson i think it is an effective method personally i might perhaps prefer another line of argument in this particular case and personally perhaps you might but in our profession personal considerations must be blown to the winds of the horizon we must sink the individual in opposing the election of your relative sir you have set the seal of your heavy displeasure upon the sin of nepotism and for this i respect you nepotism must be got under but in the display of roman virtues sir we must go the whole hog when in the interest of public moralitymr masthead was now gesticulating earnestly with the sleeves of his coatvirginius stabbed his daughter was he influenced by personal considerations when curtius leaped into the yawning gulf did he not sink the individual  i admitted that he did but feeling in a contentious mood prolonged the discussion by leisurely loading and capping a revolver but prescient of my argument mr masthead avoided refutation by hastily adjourning the debate i sent him a note that evening fillingin a few of the details of the policy that i had before sketched in outline amongst other things i submitted that it would be better for us to exalt mr scandrils opponent than to degrade himself to this mr masthead reluctantly assentedsinking the individual he reproachfully explained in the dependent employeethe powerless bondsman the next issue of the thundergust contained under the heading invigorating zephyrs the following editorial article  last week we declared our unalterable opposition to the candidacy of mr jefferson scandril and gave reasons for the faith that is in us for the first time in its history this paper made a clear thoughtful and adequate avowal and exposition of eternal principle abandoning for the present the stand we then took let us trace the antecedents of mr scandrils opponent up to their source it has been urged against mr broskin that he spent some years of his life in the lunatic asylum at warm springs in the adjoining commonwealth of missouri this cuckoo cryraised though it is by dogs of political darknesswe shall not stoop to controvert for it is accidentally true but next week we shall show as by the stroke of an enchanters wand that this great statesmans detractors would probably not derive any benefits from a residence in the same institution their mental aberration being rottenly incurable  i thought this rather strong and not quite to the point but masthead said it was a fact that our candidate who was very little known in claybank had served a term in the warm springs asylum and the issue must be boldly metthat evasion and denial were but forms of prostration beneath the iron wheels of truth as he said this he seemed to inflate and expand so as almost to fill his clothes and the fire of his eye somehow burned into me an impressionsince effacedthat a just cause is not imperiled by a trifling concession to fact so leaving the matter quite in my editors hands i went away to keep some important engagements the paragraph having involved me in several duels with the friends of mr broskin i thought it rather hard that i should have to defend my new editors policy against the supporters of my own candidate particularly as i was clearly in the right and they knew nothing whatever about the matter in dispute not one of them having ever before so much as heard of the now famous warm springs asylum but i would not shirk even the humblest journalistic duty i fought these fellows and acquitted myself as became a man of letters and a politician the hurts i got were some time healing and in the interval every prominent member of my party who came to claybank to speak to the people regarded it as a simple duty to call first at my house make a tender inquiry as to the progress of my recovery and leave a challenge my physician forbade me to read a line of anything the consequence was that masthead had it all his own way with the paper in looking over the old files now i find that he devoted his entire talent and all the space of the paper including what had been the advertising columns to confessing that our candidate had been an inmate of a lunatic asylum and contemptuously asking the opposing party what they were going to do about it  all this time mr broskin made no sign but when the challenges became intolerable i indignantly instructed mr masthead to whip round to the other side and support my brotherinlaw masthead sank the individual and duly announced with his accustomed frankness our change of policy then mr broskin came down to claybankto thank me he was a fine respectablelooking gentleman and impressed me very favorably but masthead was in when he called and the effect upon him was different he shrank into a mere heap of old clothes turned white and chattered his teeth noting this extraordinary behavior i at once sought an explanation  mr broskin said i with a meaning glance at the trembling editor from certain indications i am led to fear that owing to some mistake we may have been doing you an injustice may i ask you if you were really ever in the lunatic asylum at warm springs missouri  for three years he replied quietly i was the physician in charge of that institution your sonturning to masthead who was flying all sorts of colorswas if i mistake not one of my patients i learn that a few weeks ago a friend of yours named norton secured the young mans release upon your promise to take care of him yourself in future i hope that home associations have improved the poor fellow its very sad  it was indeed norton was the name of the man to whom i had written for an editor and who had sent me one norton was ever an obliging fellow     why i am not editing the stinger   j munniglut

mean about me i dont think there has been any wilful desertion you may engage an editor for say fifty years with the privilege of keeping him regularly if at the end of that time i should break my neck hastening back  psi hope that poor fellow muskier will make a fair profit in the gunsmithing line jump him for an ad     corrupting the press   when joel bird was up for governor of missouri sam henly was editing the berrywood bugle and no sooner was the nomination made by the state convention than he came out hot against the party he was an able writer was sam and the lies he invented about our candidate were shocking that however we endured very well but presently sam turned squarely about and began telling the truth this was a little too much the county committee held a hasty meeting and decided that it must be stopped so i henry barber was sent for to make arrangements to that end i knew something of sam had purchased him several times and i estimated his present value at about one thousand dollars this seemed to the committee a reasonable figure and on my mentioning it to sam he said he thought that about the fair thing it should never be said that the bugle was a hard paper to deal with there was however some delay in raising the money the candidates for the local offices had not disposed of their autumn hogs yet and were in financial straits some of them contributed a pig each one gave twenty bushels of corn another a flock of chickens and the man who aspired to the distinction of county judge paid his assessment with a wagon these things had to be converted into cash at a ruinous sacrifice and in the meantime sam kept pouring an incessant stream of hot shot into our political camp nothing i could say would make him stay his hand he invariably replied that it was no bargain until he had the money the committeemen were furious it required all my eloquence to prevent their declaring the contract null and void but at last a new clean one thousanddollar note was passed over to me which in hot haste i transferred to sam at his residence  that evening there was a meeting of the committee all seemed in high spirits again except hooker of jayhawk this old wretch sat back and shook his head during the entire session and just before adjournment said as he took his hat to go that prapstwas orl right and on the squar maybe thar warnt any shenannigan but he war dubersomeyes he war dubersome the old curmudgeon repeated this until i was exasperated beyond restraint  mr hooker said i ive known sam henly ever since he was so high and there isnt an honester man in old missouri sam henlys word is as good as his note whats more if any gentleman thinks he would enjoy a firstclass funeral and if he will supply the sable accessories ill supply the corpse and he can take it home with him from this meeting  at this point mr hooker was troubled with leaving  having got this business off my conscience i slept late next day when i stepped into the street i saw at once that something was up there were knots of people gathered at the corners some reading eagerly that mornings issue of the bugle some gesticulating and others stalking moodily about muttering curses not loud but deep suddenly i heard an excited clamora confused roar of many lungs and the trampling of innumerable feet in this babel of noises i could distinguish the words kill him wam his hide and so forth and looking up the street i saw what seemed to be the whole male population racing down it i am very excitable and though i did not know whose hide was to be warmed nor why anyone was to be killed i shot off in front of the howling masses shouting kill him and warm his hide as loudly as the loudest all the time looking out for the victim down the street we flew like a storm then i turned a corner thinking the scoundrel must have gone up that street then bolted through a public square over a bridge under an arch finally back into the main street yelling like a panther and resolved to slaughter the first human being i should overtake the crowd followed my lead turning as i turned shrieking as i shrieked andall at once it came to me that i was the man whose hide was to be warmed  it is needless to dwell upon the sensation this discovery gave me happily i was within a few yards of the committeerooms and into these i dashed closing and bolting the doors behind me and mounting the stairs like a flash the committee was in solemn session sitting in a nice even row on the front benches each man with his elbows on his knees and his chin resting in the palms of his handsthinking at each mans feet lay a neglected copy of the bugle every member fixed his eyes on me but no one stirred none uttered a sound there was something awful in this preternatural silence made more impressive by the hoarse murmur of the crowd outside breaking down the door i could endure it no longer but strode forward and snatched up the paper lying at the feet of the chairman at the head of the editorial columns in letters half an inch long were the following amazing headlines  dastardly outrage corruption rampant in our midst the vampires foiled henry barber at his old game the rat gnaws a file the democratic hordes attempt to ride roughshod over a free people base endeavor to bribe the editor of this paper with a twentydollar note the money given to the orphan asylum  i read no farther but stood stockstill in the center of the floor and fell into a reverie twenty dollars somehow it seemed a mere trifle nine hundred and eighty dollars i did not know there was so much money in the world twentyno eightyone thousand dollars there were big black figures floating all over the floor incessant cataracts of them poured down the walls stopped and shied off as i looked at them and began to go it again when i lowered my eyes occasionally the figures 20 would take shape somewhere about the floor and then the figures 980 would slide up and overlay them then like the lean kine of pharaohs dream they would all march away and devour the fat naughts of the number 1000 and dancing like gnats in the air were myriads of little caduceuslike phantoms thus i could not at all make it out but began to comprehend my position directly old hooker without moving from his seat began to drown the noise of countless feet on the stairs by elevating his thin falsetto  praps mr cheerman its orl on the squar we know mr henly cant tell a lie but im powerful dubersome that thars a balyance dyue this yer committee from the gent who hez the floif he aint done gone laid it yout fo sable acacfo fyirstclass funerals  i felt at that moment as if i should like to play the leading character in a firstclass funeral myself i felt that every man in my position ought to have a nice comfortable coffin with a silver doorplate a footwarmer and baywindows for his ears how do you suppose you would have felt  my leap from the window of that committee room my speed in streaking it for the adjacent forest my selfdenial in ever afterward resisting the impulse to return to berrywood and look after my political and material interests therethese i have always considered things to be justly proud of and i hope i am proud of them     the bubble reputation  how another mans was sought and pricked   it was a stormy night in the autumn of 1930 the hour was about eleven san francisco lay in darkness for the laborers at the gas works had struck and destroyed the companys property because a newspaper to which a cousin of the manager was a subscriber had censured the course of a potato merchant related by marriage to a member of the knights of leisure electric lights had not at that period been reinvented the sky was filled with great masses of black cloud which driven rapidly across the starfields by winds unfelt on the earth and momentarily altering their fantastic forms seemed instinct with a life and activity of their own and endowed with awful powers of evil to the exercise of which they might at any time set their malignant will  an observer standing at this time at the corner of paradise avenue and great white throne walk in sorrel hill cemetery would have seen a human figure moving among the graves toward the superintendents residence dimly and fitfully visible in the intervals of thinner gloom this figure had a most uncanny and disquieting aspect a long black cloak shrouded it from neck to heel upon its head was a slouch hat pulled down across the forehead and almost concealing the face which was further hidden by a halfmask only the beard being occasionally visible as the head was lifted partly above the collar of the cloak the man wore upon his feet jackboots whose wide funnelshaped legs had settled down in many a fold and crease about his ankles as could be seen whenever accident parted the bottom of the cloak his arms were concealed but sometimes he stretched out the right to steady himself by a headstone as he crept stealthily but blindly over the uneven ground at such times a close scrutiny of the hand would have disclosed in the palm the hilt of a poniard the blade of which lay along the wrist hidden in the sleeve in short the mans garb his movements the houreverything proclaimed him a reporter  but what did he there  on the morning of that day the editor of the daily malefactor had touched the button of a bell numbered 216 and in response to the summons mr longbo spittleworth reporter had been shot into the room out of an inclined tube  i understand said the editor that you are 216am i right  that said the reporter catching his breath and adjusting his clothing both somewhat disordered by the celerity of his flight through the tubethat is my number  information has reached us continued the editor that the superintendent of the sorrel hill cemeteryone inhumio whose very name suggests inhumanityis guilty of the grossest outrages in the administration of the great trust confided to his hands by the sovereign people  the cemetery is private property faintly suggested 216  it is alleged continued the great man disdaining to notice the interruption that in violation of popular rights he refuses to permit his accounts to be inspected by representatives of the press  under the law you know he is responsible to the directors of the cemetery company the reporter ventured to interject  they say pursued the editor heedless that the inmates are in many cases badly lodged and insufficiently clad and that in consequence they are usually cold it is asserted that they are never fedexcept to the worms statements have been made to the effect that males and females are permitted to occupy the same quarters to the incalculable detriment of public morality many clandestine villainies are alleged of this fiend in human shape and it is desirable that his underground methods be unearthed in the malefactor if he resists we will drag his family skeleton from the privacy of his domestic closet there is money in it for the paper fame for youare you ambitious 216  i ambitious  go then cried the editor rising and waving his hand imperiouslygo and seek the bubble reputation  the bubble shall be sought the young man replied and leaping into a manhole in the floor disappeared a moment later the editor who after dismissing his subordinate had stood motionless as if lost in thought sprang suddenly to the manhole and shouted down it hello 216  aye aye sir came up a faint and far reply  about that bubble reputationyou understand i suppose that the reputation which you are to seek is that of the other man  in the execution of his duty in the hope of his employers approval in the costume of his profession mr longbo spittleworth otherwise known as 216 has already occupied a place in the minds eye of the intelligent reader alas for poor mr inhumio  a few days after these events that fearless independent and enterprising guardian and guide of the public

shipwreckollection   as i left the house she said i was a cruel old thing and not a bit nice and she hoped i never never would come back so i shipped as mate on the mudlark bound from london to wherever the captain might think it expedient to sail it had not been thought advisable to hamper captain abersouth with orders for when he could not have his own way it had been observed he would contrive in some ingenious way to make the voyage unprofitable the owners of the mudlark had grown wise in their generation and now let him do pretty much as he pleased carrying such cargoes as he fancied to ports where the nicest women were on the voyage of which i write he had taken no cargo at all he said it would only make the mudlark heavy and slow to hear this mariner talk one would have supposed he did not know very much about commerce  we had a few passengersnot nearly so many as we had laid in basins and stewards for for before coming off to the ship most of those who had bought tickets would inquire whither she was bound and when not informed would go back to their hotels and send a bandit on board to remove their baggage but there were enough left to be rather troublesome they cultivated the rolling gait peculiar to sailors when drunk and the upper deck was hardly wide enough for them to go from the forecastle to the binnacle to set their watches by the ships compass they were always petitioning captain abersouth to let the big anchor go just to hear it plunge in the water threatening in case of refusal to write to the newspapers a favorite amusement with them was to sit in the lee of the bulwarks relating their experiences in former voyagesvoyages distinguished in every instance by two remarkable features the frequency of unprecedented hurricanes and the entire immunity of the narrator from seasickness it was very interesting to see them sitting in a row telling these things each man with a basin between his legs  one day there arose a great storm the sea walked over the ship as if it had never seen a ship before and meant to enjoy it all it could the mudlark labored very muchfar more indeed than the crew did for these innocents had discovered in possession of one of their number a pair of leatherseated trousers and would do nothing but sit and play cards for them in a month from leaving port each sailor had owned them a dozen times they were so worn by being pushed over to the winner that there was little but the seat remaining and that immortal part the captain finally kicked overboardnot maliciously nor in an unfriendly spirit but because he had a habit of kicking the seats of trousers  the storm increased in violence until it succeeded in so straining the mudlark that she took in water like a teetotaler then it appeared to get relief directly this may be said in justice to a storm at sea when it has broken off your masts pulled out your rudder carried away your boats and made a nice hole in some inaccessible part of your hull it will often go away in search of a fresh ship leaving you to take such measures for your comfort as you may think fit in our case the captain thought fit to sit on the taffrail reading a threevolume novel  seeing he had got about half way through the second volume at which point the lovers would naturally be involved in the most hopeless and heartrending difficulties i thought he would be in a particularly cheerful humor so i approached him and informed him the ship was going down  well said he closing the book but keeping his forefinger between the pages to mark his place she never would be good for much after such a shakingup as this but i sayi wish you would just send the bosn ford there to break up that prayermeeting the mudlark isnt a seamens chapel i suppose  but i replied impatiently cant something be done to lighten the ship  well he drawled reflectively seeing she hasnt any masts left to cut away nor any cargo tostay you might throw over some of the heaviest of the passengers if you think it would do any good  it was a happy thoughtthe intuition of genius walking rapidly forward to the focsle which being highest out of water was crowded with passengers i seized a stout old gentleman by the nape of the neck pushed him up to the rail and chucked him over he did not touch the water he fell on the apex of a cone of sharks which sprang up from the sea to meet him their noses gathered to a point their tails just clearing the surface i think it unlikely that the old gentleman knew what disposition had been made of him next i hurled over a woman and flung a fat baby to the wild winds the former was sharked out of sight the same as the old man the latter divided amongst the gulls  i am relating these things exactly as they occurred it would be very easy to make a fine story out of all this materialto tell how that while i was engaged in lightening the ship i was touched by the selfsacrificing spirit of a beautiful young woman who to save the life of her lover pushed her aged mother forward to where i was operating imploring me to take the old lady but spare o spare her dear henry i might go on to set forth how that i not only did take the old lady as requested but immediately seized dear henry and sent him flying as far as i could to leeward having first broken his back across the rail and pulled a doublefistful of his curly hair out i might proceed to state that feeling appeased i then stole the long boat and taking the beautiful maiden pulled away from the illfated ship to the church of st massaker fiji where we were united by a knot which i afterward untied with my teeth by eating her but in truth nothing of all this occurred and i can not afford to be the first writer to tell a lie just to interest the reader what really did occur is this as i stood on the quarterdeck heaving over the passengers one after another captain abersouth having finished his novel walked aft and quietly hove me over  the sensations of a drowning man have been so often related that i shall only briefly explain that memory at once displayed her treasures all the scenes of my eventful life crowded though without confusion or fighting into my mind i saw my whole career spread out before me like a map of central africa since the discovery of the gorilla there were the cradle in which i had lain as a child stupefied with soothing syrups the perambulator seated in which and propelled from behind i overthrew the schoolmaster and in which my infantile spine received its curvature the nurserymaid surrendering her lips alternately to me and the gardener the old home of my youth with the ivy and the mortgage on it my eldest brother who by will succeeded to the family debts my sister who ran away with the count von pretzel coachman to a most respectable new york family my mother standing in the attitude of a saint pressing with both hands her prayerbook against the patent palpitators from madame fahertinis my venerable father sitting in his chimney corner his silvered head bowed upon his breast his withered hands crossed patiently in his lap waiting with christian resignation for death and drunk as a lordall this and much more came before my minds eye and there was no charge for admission to the show then there was a ringing sound in my ears my senses swam better than i could and as i sank down down through fathomless depths the amber light falling through the water above my head failed and darkened into blackness suddenly my feet struck something firmit was the bottom thank heaven i was saved     the captain of the camel   this ship was named the camel in some ways she was an extraordinary vessel she measured six hundred tons but when she had taken in enough ballast to keep her from upsetting like a shot duck and was provisioned for a three months voyage it was necessary to be mighty fastidious in the choice of freight and passengers for illustration as she was about to leave port a boat came alongside with two passengers a man and his wife they had booked the day before but had remained ashore to get one more decent meal before committing themselves to the briny cheap as the man called the ships fare the woman came aboard and the man was preparing to follow when the captain leaned over the side and saw him  well said the captain what do you want  what do i want said the man laying hold of the ladder im agoing to embark in this here shipthats what i want  not with all that fat on you roared the captain you dont weigh an ounce less than eighteen stone and ive got to have in my anchor yet you wouldnt have me leave the anchor i suppose  the man said he did not care about the anchorhe was just as god had made him he looked as if his cook had had something to do with it and sink or swim he purposed embarking in that ship a good deal of wrangling ensued but one of the sailors finally threw the man a cork lifepreserver and the captain said that would lighten him and he might come abroad  this was captain abersouth formerly of the mudlarkas good a seaman as ever sat on the taffrail reading a three volume novel nothing could equal this mans passion for literature for every voyage he laid in so many bales of novels that there was no stowage for the cargo there were novels in the hold and novels betweendecks and novels in the saloon and in the passengers beds  the camel had been designed and built by her owner an architect in the city and she looked about as much like a ship as noahs ark did she had bay windows and a veranda a cornice and doors at the waterline these doors had knockers and servants bells there had been a futile attempt at an area the passenger saloon was on the upper deck and had a tile roof to this humplike structure the ship owed her name her designer had erected several churchesthat of st ignotus is still used as a brewery in hotbath meadowsand possessed of the ecclesiastic idea had given the camel a transept but finding this impeded her passage through the water he had it removed this weakened the vessel amidships the mainmast was something like a steeple it had a weathercock from this spire the eye commanded one of the finest views in england  such was the camel when i joined her in 1864 for a voyage of discovery to the south pole the expedition was under the auspices of the royal society for the promotion of fair play at a meeting of this excellent association it had been resolved that the partiality of science for the north pole was an invidious distinction between two objects equally meritorious that nature had marked her disapproval of it in the case of sir john franklin and many of his imitators that it served them very well right that this enterprise should be undertaken as a protest against the spirit of undue bias and finally that no part of the responsibility or expense should devolve upon the society in its corporate character but any individual member might contribute to the fund if he were fool enough it is only common justice to say that none of them was the camel merely parted her cable one day while i happened to be on boarddrifted out of the harbor southward followed by the execrations of all who knew her and could not get back in two months she had crossed the equator and the heat began to grow insupportable  suddenly we were becalmed there had been a fine breeze up to three oclock in the afternoon and the ship had made as much as two knots an hour when without a word of warning the sails began to belly the wrong way owing to the impetus that the ship had acquired and then as this expired they hung as limp and lifeless as the skirts of a clawhammer coat the camel not only stood stock still but moved a little backward toward england old ben the boatswain said that hed never knowed but one deader calm and that he explained was when preacher jack the reformed sailor had got excited in a sermon in a seamans chapel and shouted that the archangel michael would chuck the dragon into the brig and give him a taste of the ropesend damn his eyes  we lay in this woful state for the better part of a year when growing impatient the crew deputed me to look up the captain and see if something could not be done about it i found him in a remote cobwebby corner betweendecks with a book in his hand on one side of him the cords newly cut were three bales of ouida on the other a mountain of miss me braddon towered above his head he had finished ouida and was tackling miss braddon he was greatly changed  captain abersouth said i rising on tiptoe so as to overlook the lower slopes of mrs braddon will you be good enough to tell me how long this thing is going on  cant say im sure he replied without pulling his eyes off the page theyll probably make up about the middle of the book in the meantime old pondronummus will foul his tophamper and take out his papers for looney haven and young monshure de boojower will come in for a million then if the proud and fair angelica doesnt luff and come into his wake after pizening that sea lawyer thundermuzzle i dont know nothing about the deeps and shallers of the human heart  i could not take so hopeful a view of the situation and went on deck feeling very much discouraged i had no sooner got my head out than i observed that the ship was moving at a high rate of speed  we had on board a bullock and a dutchman the bullock was chained by the neck to the foremast but the dutchman was allowed a good deal of liberty being shut up at night only there was bad blood between the twoa feud of long standing having its origin in the dutchmans appetite for milk and the bullocks sense of personal dignity the particular cause of offense it would be tedious to relate taking advantage of his enemys afternoon siesta the dutchman had now managed to sneak by him and had gone out on the bowsprit to fish when the animal waked and saw the other creature enjoying himself he straddled his chain leveled his horns got his hind feet against the mast and laid a course for the offender the chain was strong the mast firm and the ship as byron says walked the water like a thing of course  after that we kept the dutchman right where he was night and day the old camel making better speed than she had ever done in the most favorable gale we held due south  we had now been a long time without sufficient food particularly meat we could spare neither the bullock nor the dutchman and the ships carpenter that traditional first aid to the famished was a mere bag of bones the fish would neither bite nor be bitten most of the runningtackle of the ship had been used for macaroni soup all the leather work our shoes included had been devoured in omelettes with oakum and tar we had made fairly supportable salad after a brief experimental career as tripe the sails had departed this life forever only two courses remained from which to choose we could eat one another as is the etiquette of the sea or partake of captain abersouths novels dreadful alternativebut a choice and it is seldom i think that starving sailormen are offered a shipload of the best popular authors readyroasted by the critics  we ate that fiction the works that the captain had thrown aside lasted six months for most of them were by the bestselling authors and were pretty tough after they were goneof course some had to be given to the bullock and the dutchmanwe stood by the captain taking the other books from his hands as he finished them sometimes when we were apparently at our last gasp he would skip a whole page of moralizing or a bit of description and always as soon as he clearly foresaw the dénoûementwhich he generally did at about the middle of the second volumethe work was handed over to us without a word of repining  the effect of this diet was not unpleasant but remarkable physically it sustained us mentally it exalted us morally it made us but a trifle worse than we were we talked as no human beings ever talked before our wit was polished but without point as in a stage broadsword combat every cut has its parry so in our conversation every remark suggested the reply and this necessitated a certain rejoinder the sequence once interrupted the whole was bosh when the thread was broken the beads were seen to be waxen and hollow  we made love to one another and plotted darkly in the deepest obscurity of the hold each set of conspirators had its proper listener at the hatch these leaning too far over would bump their heads together and fight occasionally there was confusion amongst them two or more would assert a right to overhear the same plot i remember at one time the cook the carpenter the second assistantsurgeon and an able seaman contended with handspikes for the honor of betraying my confidence once there were three masked murderers of the second watch bending at the same instant over the sleeping form of a cabinboy who had been heard to mutter a week previously that he had gold gold the accumulation of eightyyes eightyyears piracy on the high seas while sitting as mp for the borough of zaccheuscumdown and attending church regularly i saw the captain of the foretop surrounded by suitors for his hand while he was himself fingering the edge of a packingcase and singing an amorous ditty to a ladylove shaving at a mirror  our diction consisted in about equal parts of classical allusion quotation from the stable simper from the scullery cant from the clubs and the technical slang of heraldry we boasted much of ancestry and admired the whiteness of our hands whenever the skin was visible through a fault in the grease and tar next to love the vegetable kingdom murder arson adultery and ritual we talked most of art the wooden figurehead of the camel representing a guinea nigger detecting a bad smell and the monochrome picture of two backbroken dolphins on the stern acquired a new importance the dutchman had destroyed the nose of the one by kicking his toes against it and the other was nearly obliterated by the slops of the cook but each had its daily pilgrimage and each constantly developed occult beauties of design and subtle excellences of execution on the whole we were greatly altered and if the supply of contemporary fiction had been equal to the demand the camel i fear would not have been strong enough to contain the moral and æsthetic forces fired by the maceration of the brains of authors in the gastric juices of sailors  having now got the ships literature off his mind into ours the captain went on deck for the first time since leaving port we were still steering the same course and taking his first observation of the sun the captain discovered that we were in latitude 83° south the heat was insufferable the air was like the breath of a furnace within a furnace the sea steamed like a boiling cauldron and in the vapor our bodies were temptingly parboiledour ultimate meal was preparing warped by the sun the ship held both ends high out of the water the deck of the forecastle was an inclined plane on which the bullock labored at a disadvantage but the bowsprit was now vertical and the dutchmans tenure precarious a thermometer hung against the mainmast and we grouped ourselves about it as the captain went up to examine the register  one hundred and ninety degrees fahrenheit he muttered in evident astonishment impossible turning sharply about he ran his eyes over us and inquired in a peremptory tone whos been in command while i was runnin my eye over that book  well captain i replied as respectfully as i knew how the fourth day out i had the unhappiness to be drawn into a dispute about a game of cards with your first and second officers in the absence of those excellent seamen sir i thought it my duty to assume control of the ship  killed em hey  sir they committed suicide by questioning the efficacy of four kings and an ace  well you lubber what have you to say in defense of this extraordinary weather  sir it is no fault of mine we are farvery far south and it is now the middle of july the weather is uncomfortable i admit but considering the latitude and season it is not i protest unseasonable  latitude and season he shrieked livid with ragelatitude and season why you junkrigged flatbottomed meadow lugger dont you know any better than that didnt yer little baby brother ever tell ye that southern latitudes is colder than northern and that july is the middle o winter here go below you son of a scullion or ill break your bones  oh very well i replied im not going to stay on deck and listen to such low language as that i warn you have it your own way  the words had no sooner left my lips than a piercing cold wind caused me to cast my eye upon the thermometer in the new régime of science the mercury was descending rapidly but in a moment the instrument was obscured by a blinding fall of snow towering icebergs rose from the water on every side hanging their jagged masses hundreds of feet above the masthead and shutting us completely in the ship twisted and writhed her decks bulged upward and every timber groaned and cracked like the report of a pistol the camel was frozen fast the jerk of her sudden stopping snapped the bullocks chain and sent both that animal and the dutchman over the bows to accomplish their warfare on the ice  elbowing my way forward to go below as i had threatened i saw the crew tumble to the deck on either hand like tenpins they were frozen stiff passing the captain i asked him sneeringly how he liked the weather under the new régime he replied with a vacant stare the chill had penetrated to the brain and affected his mind he murmured  in this delightful spot happy in the worlds esteem and surrounded by all that makes existence dear they passed the remainder of their lives the end  his jaw dropped the captain of the camel was dead     the man overboard   i  the good ship nuppleduck was drifting rapidly upon a sunken coral reef which seemed to extend a reasonless number of leagues to the right and left without a break and i was reading macaulays naseby fight to the man at the wheel everything was in fact going on as nicely as heart could wish when captain abersouth standing on the companionstair poked his head above deck and asked where we were pausing in my reading i informed him that we had got as far as the disastrous repulse of prince ruperts cavalry adding that if he would have the goodness to hold his jaw we should be making it awkward for the wounded in about three minutes and he might bear a hand at the pockets of the slain just then the ship struck heavily and went down  calling another ship i stepped aboard and gave directions to be taken to no 900 tottenham court road where i had an aunt then walking aft to the man at the wheel asked him if he would like to hear me read naseby fight he thought he would he would like to hear that and then i might pass on to something elsekinglakes crimean war the proceedings at the trial of warren hastings or some such trifle just to wile away the time till eight bells  all this time heavy clouds had been gathering along the horizon directly in front of the ship and a deputation of passengers now came to the man at the wheel to demand that she be put about or she would run into them which the spokesman explained would be unusual i thought at the time that it certainly was not the regular thing to do but as i was myself only a passenger did not deem it expedient to take a part in the heated discussion that ensued and after all it did not seem likely that the weather in those clouds would be much worse than that in tottenham court road where i had an aunt  it was finally decided to refer the matter to arbitration and after many names had been submitted and rejected by both sides it was agreed that the captain of the ship should act as arbitrator if his consent could be obtained and i was delegated to conduct the negotiations to that end with considerable difficulty i persuaded him to accept the responsibility  he was a feebleminded sort of fellow named troutbeck who was always in a funk lest he should make enemies never reflecting that most men would a little rather be his enemies than not he had once been the ships cook but had cooked so poisonously ill that he had been forcibly transferred from galley to quarterdeck by the dyspeptic survivors of his culinary career  the little captain went aft with me to listen to arguments of the dissatisfied passengers and the obstinate steersman as to whether we should take our chances in the clouds or tail off and run for the opposite horizon but on approaching the wheel we found both helmsman and passengers in a condition of profound astonishment rolling their eyes about towards every point of the compass and shaking their heads in hopeless perplexity it was rather remarkable certainly the bank of cloud which had worried the landsmen was now directly astern and the ship was cutting along lively in her own wake toward the point from which she had come and straight away from tottenham court road everybody declared it was a miracle the chaplain was piped up for prayers and the man at the wheel was as truly penitent as if he had been detected robbing an empty poorbox  the explanation was simple enough and dawned upon me the moment i saw how matters stood during the dispute between the helmsman and the deputation the former had renounced his wheel to gesticulate and i thinking no harm had amused myself during a rather tedious debate by revolving the thing this way and that and had unconsciously put the ship about by a coincidence not unusual in low latitudes the wind had effected a corresponding transposition at the same time and was now bowling us as merrily back toward the place where i had embarked as it had previously wafted us in the direction of tottenham court road where i had an aunt i must here so far anticipate as to explain that some years later these various incidentsparticularly the reading of naseby fightled to the adoption in our mercantile marine of a rule which i believe is still extant to the effect that one must not speak to the man at the wheel unless the man at the wheel speaks first   ii  it is only by inadvertence that i have omitted the information that the vessel in which i was now a pervading influence was the bonnyclabber troutbeck master of malvern heights  the bonnyclabbers reactionary course had now brought her to the spot at which i had taken passage passengers and crew fatigued by their somewhat awkward attempts to manifest their gratitude for our miraculous deliverance from the cloudbank were snoring peacefully in unconsidered attitudes about the deck when the lookout man perched on the supreme extremity of the mainmast consuming a cold sausage began an apparently preconcerted series of extraordinary and unimaginable noises he coughed sneezed and barked simultaneouslybleated in one breath and cackled in the nextsputteringly shrieked and chatteringly squealed with a bass of suffocated roars there were desolutory vocal explosions tapering off in long wails half smothered in unintelligible smalltalk he whistled wheezed and trumpeted began to sharp thought better of it and flatted neighed like a horse and then thundered like a drum through it all he continued making incomprehensible signals with one hand while clutching his throat with the other presently he gave it up and silently descended to the deck  by this time we were all attention and no sooner had he set foot amongst us than he was assailed with a tempest of questions which had they been visible would have resembled a flight of pigeons he made no replynot even by a look but passed through our enclosing mass with a grim defiant step a face deathly white and a set of the jaw as of one repressing an ambitious dinner or ignoring a venomous toothache for the poor man was choking  passing down the companionway the patient sought the surgeons cabin with the ships company at his heels the surgeon was fast asleep the larklike performance at the masthead having been inaudible in that lower region while some of us were holding a whiskybottle to the medical nose in order to apprise the medical intelligence of the demand upon it the patient seated himself in statuesque silence by this time his pallor which was but the mark of a determined mind had given place to a fervent crimson which visibly deepened into a pronounced purple and was ultimately superseded by a clouded blue shot through with opalescent gleams and smitten with variable streaks of black the face was swollen and shapeless the neck puffy the eyes protruded like pegs of a hatstand  pretty soon the doctor was got awake and after making a careful examination of his patient remarking that it was a lovely case of stopupagus oesophagi took a tool and set to work producing with no difficulty a cold sausage of the size figure and general bearing of a somewhat selfimportant banana the operation had been performed amid breathless silence but the moment it was concluded the patient whose neck and head had visibly collapsed sprang to his feet and shouted  man overboard  that is what he had been trying to say  there was a confused rush to the upper deck and everybody flung something over the ships sidea lifebelt a chickencoop a coil of rope a spar an old sail a pocket handkerchief an iron crowbarany movable article which it was thought might be useful to a drowning man who had followed the vessel during the hour that had elapsed since the initial alarm at the masthead in a few moments the ship was pretty nearly dismantled of everything that could be easily renounced and some excitable passenger having cut away the boats there was nothing more that we could do though the chaplain explained that if the illfated gentleman in the wet did not turn up after a while it was his intention to stand at the stern and read the burial service of the church of england  presently it occurred to some ingenious person to inquire who had gone overboard and all hands being mustered and the roll called to our great chagrin every man answered to his name passengers and all captain troutbeck however held that in a matter of so great importance a simple rollcall was insufficient and with an assertion of authority that was encouraging insisted that every person on board be separately sworn the result was the same nobody was missing and the captain begging pardon for having doubted our veracity retired to his cabin to avoid further responsibility but expressed a hope that for the purpose of having everything properly recorded in the logbook we would apprise him of any further action that we might think it advisable to take i smiled as i remembered that in the interest of the unknown gentleman whose peril we had overestimated i had flung the logbook over the ships side  soon afterward i felt suddenly inspired with one of those great ideas that come to most men only once or twice in a lifetime and to the ordinary story teller never hastily reconvening the ships company i mounted the capstan and thus addressed them  shipmates there has been a mistake in the fervor of an illconsidered compassion we have made pretty free with certain movable property of an eminent firm of shipowners of malvern heights for this we shall undoubtedly be called to account if we are ever so fortunate as to drop anchor in tottenham court road where i have an aunt it would add strength to our defence if we could show to the satisfaction of a jury of our peers that in heeding the sacred promptings of humanity we had acted with some small degree of common sense if for example we could make it appear that there really was a man overboard who might have been comforted and sustained by the material consolation that we so lavishly dispensed in the form of buoyant articles belonging to others the british heart would find in that fact a mitigating circumstance pleading eloquently in our favor gentlemen and ships officers i venture to propose that we do now throw a man overboard  the effect was electrical the motion was carried by acclamation and there was a unanimous rush for the now wretched mariner whose false alarm at the masthead was the cause of our embarrassment but on second thoughts it was decided to substitute captain troutbeck as less generally useful and more undeviatingly in error the sailor had made one mistake of considerable magnitude but the captains entire existence was a mistake altogether he was fetched up from his cabin and chucked over  at 900 tottenham road court lived an aunt of minea good old lady who had brought me up by hand and taught me many wholesome lessons in morality which in my later life have proved of extreme value foremost among these i may mention her solemn and oftrepeated injunction never to tell a lie without a definite and specific reason for doing so many years experience in the violation of this principle enables me to speak with authority as to its general soundness i have therefore much pleasure in making a slight correction in the preceding chapter of this tolerably true history it was there affirmed that i threw the bonnyclabbers logbook into the sea the statement is entirely false and i can discover no reason for having made it that will for a moment weigh against those i now have for the preservation of that logbook  the progress of the story has developed new necessities and i now find it convenient to quote from that book passages which it could not have contained if cast into the sea at the time stated for if thrown upon the resources of my imagination i might find the temptation to exaggerate too strong to be resisted  it is needless to worry the reader with those entries in the book referring to events already related our record will begin on the day of the captains consignment to the deep after which era i made the entries myself  june 22ndnot much doing in the way of gales but heavy swells left over from some previous blow latitude and longitude not notably different from last observation ship laboring a trifle owing to lack of tophamper everything of that kind having been cut away in consequence of captain troutbeck having accidently fallen overboard while fishing from the

concluding sentences of this record as it now lies before me the handwriting is not very legible they were penned under circumstances singularly unfavorable mr martin stood behind me with his eyes fixed on the page and in order to secure a better view had twisted the machinery of the engine he called his hand into the hair of my head depressing that globe to such an extent that my nose was flattened against the surface of the table and i had no small difficulty in discerning the lines through my eyebrows i was not accustomed to writing in that position it had not been taught in the only school that i ever attended i therefore felt justified in bringing the record to a somewhat abrupt close and immediately went on deck with mr martin he preceding me up the companionstairs on foot i following not on horseback but on my own the connection between us being maintained without important alteration  arriving on deck i thought it advisable in the interest of peace and quietness to pursue him in the same manner to the side of the ship where i parted from him forever with many expressions of regret which might have been heard at a considerable distance  of the subsequent fate of the bonnyclabber i can only say that the logbook from which i have quoted was found some years later in the stomach of a whale along with some shreds of clothing a few buttons and several decayed lifebelts it contained only one new entry in a straggling handwriting as if it had been penned in the dark  july2th foundered svivors rescude by wale wether stuffy no nues from capting trowtbeck sammle martin cheef ofcer  let us now take a retrospective glance at the situation the ship nuppleduck abersouth master had it will be remembered gone down with all on board except me i had escaped on the ship bonnyclabber troutbeck which i had quitted owing to a misunderstanding with the chief officer and was now unattached that is how matters stood when rising on an unusually high wave and casting my eye in the direction of tottenham court roadthat is backward along the course pursued by the bonnyclabber and toward the spot at which the nuppleduck had been swallowed upi saw a quantity of what appeared to be wreckage it turned out to be some of the stuff that we had thrown overboard under a misapprehension the several articles had been compiled and so to speak carefully edited they were in fact lashed together forming a raft on a stool in the center of itnot apparently navigating it but rather with the subdued and dignified bearing of a passenger sat captain abersouth of the nuppleduck reading a novel  our meeting was not cordial he remembered me as a man of literary taste superior to his own and harbored resentment and although he made no opposition to my taking passage with him i could see that his acquiescence was due rather to his muscular inferiority than to the circumstance that i was damp and taking cold merely acknowledging his presence with a nod as i climbed abroad i seated myself and inquired if he would care to hear the concluding stanzas of naseby fight  no he replied looking up from his novel no claude reginald gump writer of sea stories ive done with you when you sank the nuppleduck some days ago you probably thought that you had made an end of me that was clever of you but i came to the surface and followed the other shipthe one on which you escaped it was i that the sailor saw from the masthead i saw him see me it was for me that all that stuff was hove overboard goodi made it into this raft it was i think the next day that i passed the floating body of a man whom i recognized as my old friend billy troutbeckhe used to be a cook on a manowar it gives me pleasure to be the means of saving your life but i eschew you the moment that we reach port our paths part you remember that in the very first sentence of this story you began to drive my ship the nuppleduck on to a reef of coral  i was compelled to confess that this was true and he continued his inhospitable reproaches  before you had written half a column you sent her to the bottom with me and the crew but youyou escaped  that is true i replied i cannot deny that the facts are correctly stated  and in a story before that you took me and my mates of the ship camel into the heart of the south polar sea and left us frozen dead in the ice like flies in amber but you did not leave yourself thereyou escaped  really captain i said your memory is singularly accurate considering the many hardships that you have had to undergo many a man would have gone mad  and a long time before that captain abersouth resumed after a pause more apparently to con his memory than to enjoy my good opinion of it you lost me at sealook here i didnt read anything but george eliot at that time but im told that you lost me at sea in the mudlark have i been misinformed  i could not say he had been misinformed  you yourself escaped on that occasion i think  it was true being usually the hero of my own stories i commonly do manage to live through one in order to figure to advantage in the next it is from artistic necessity no reader would take much interest in a hero who was dead before the beginning of the tale i endeavored to explain this to captain abersouth he shook his head  no said he its cowardly thats the way i look at it  suddenly an effulgent idea began to dawn upon me and i let it have its way until my mind was perfectly luminous then i rose from my seat and frowning down into the upturned face of my accuser spoke in severe and rasping accents thus  captain abersouth in the various perils you and i have encountered together in the classical literature of the period if i have always escaped and you have always perished if i lost you at sea in the mudlark froze you into the ice at the south pole in the camel and drowned you in the nuppleduck pray be good enough to tell me whom i have the honor to address  it was a blow to the poor man no one was ever so disconcerted flinging aside his novel he put up his hands and began to scratch his head and think it was beautiful to see him think but it seemed to distress him and pointing significantly over the side of the raft i suggested as delicately as possible that it was time to act he rose to his feet and fixing upon me a look of reproach which i shall remember as long as i can cast himself into the deep as to mei escaped     a cargo of cat   on the 16th day of june 1874 the ship mary jane sailed from malta heavily laden with cat this cargo gave us a good deal of trouble it was not in bales but had been dumped into the hold loose captain doble who had once commanded a ship that carried coals said he had found that plan the best when the hold was full of cat the hatch was battened down and we felt good unfortunately the mate thinking the cats would be thirsty introduced a hose into one of the hatches and pumped in a considerable quantity of water and the cats of the lower levels were all drowned  you have seen a dead cat in a pond you remember its circumference at the waist water multiplies the magnitude of a dead cat by ten on the first day out it was observed that the ship was much strained she was three feet wider than usual and as much as ten feet shorter the convexity of her deck was visibly augmented fore and aft but she turned up at both ends her rudder was clean out of water and she would answer the helm only when running directly against a strong breeze the rudder when perverted to one side would rub against the wind and slew her around and then she wouldnt steer any more owing to the curvature of the keel the masts came together at the top and a sailor who had gone up the foremast got bewildered came down the mizzenmast looked out over the stern at the receding shores of malta and shouted land ho the ships fastenings were all giving way the water on each side was lashed into foam by the tempest of flying bolts that she shed at every pulsation of the cargo she was quietly wrecking herself without assistance from wind or wave by the sheer internal energy of feline expansion  i went to the skipper about it he was in his favorite position sitting on the deck supporting his back against the binnacle making a v of his legs and smoking  captain doble i said respectfully touching my hat which was really not worthy of respect this floating palace is afflicted with curvature of the spine and is likewise greatly swollen  without raising his eyes he courteously acknowledged my presence by knocking the ashes from his pipe  permit me captain i said with simple dignity to repeat that this ship is much swollen  if that is true said the gallant mariner reaching for his tobacco pouch i think it would be as well to swab her down with liniment theres a bottle of it in my cabin better suggest it to the mate  but captain there is no time for empirical treatment some of the planks at the water line have started  the skipper rose and looked out over the stern toward the land he fixed his eyes on the foaming wake he gazed into the water to starboard and to port then he said  my friend the whole darned thing has started  sadly and silently i turned from that obdurate man and walked forward suddenly there was a burst of thunder sound the hatch that had held down the cargo was flung whirling into space and sailed in the air like a blown leaf pushing upward through the hatchway was a smooth square column of cat grandly and impressively it grewslowly serenely majestically it rose toward the welkin the relaxing keel parting the mastheads to give it a fair chance i have stood at naples and seen vesuvius painting the town redfrom catania have marked afar upon the flanks of Ætna the lavas awful pursuit of the astonished rooster and the despairing pig the fiery flow from kilaueas crater thrusting itself into the forests and licking the entire country clean is as familiar to me as my mothertongue i have seen glaciers a thousand years old and quite bald heading for a valley full of tourists at the rate of an inch a month i have seen a saturated solution of mining camp going down a mountain river to make a sociable call on the valley farmers i have stood behind a tree on the battlefield and seen a compact square mile of armed men moving with irresistible momentum to the rear whenever anything grand in magnitude or motion is billed to appear i commonly manage to beat my way into the show and in reporting it i am a man of unscrupulous veracity but i have seldom observed anything like that solid gray column of maltese cat  it is unnecessary to explain i suppose that each individual grimalkin in the outfit with that readiness of resource which distinguishes the species had grappled with tooth and nail as many others as it could hook on to this preserved the formation it made the column so stiff that when the ship rolled and the mary jane was a devil to roll it swayed from side to side like a mast and the mate said if it grew much taller he would have to order it cut away or it would capsize us  some of the sailors went to work at the pumps but these discharged nothing but fur captain doble raised his eyes from his toes and shouted let go the anchor but being assured that nobody was touching it apologized and resumed his revery the chaplain said if there were no objections he would like to offer up a prayer and a gambler from chicago producing a pack of cards proposed to throw round for the first jack the parsons plan was adopted and as he uttered the final amen the cats struck up a hymn  all the living ones were now above deck and every mothers son of them sang each had a pretty fair voice but no ear nearly all their notes in the upper register were more or less cracked and disobedient the remarkable thing about the voices was their range in that crowd were cats of seventeen octaves and the average could not have been less than twelve    number of cats as per invoice 127000   estimated number dead swellers   6000                                              total songsters 121000   average number octaves per cat      12                                              total octaves 1452000  it was a great concert it lasted three days and nights or counting each night as seven days twentyfour days altogether and we could not go below for provisions at the end of that time the cook came ford shaking up some beans in a hat and holding a large knife  shipmates said he we have done all that mortals can do let us now draw lots  we were blindfolded in turn and drew but just as the cook was forcing the fatal black bean upon the fattest man the concert closed with a suddenness that waked the man on the lookout a moment later every grimalkin relaxed his hold on his neighbors the column lost its cohesion and with 121000 dull sickening thuds that beat as one the whole business fell to the deck then with a wild farewell wail that feline host sprang spitting into the sea and struck out southward for the african shore  the southern extension of italy as every schoolboy knows resembles in shape an enormous boot we had drifted within sight of it the cats in the fabric had spied it and their alert imaginations were instantly affected with a lively sense of the size weight and probable momentum of its flung bootjack     on with the dance a review     i  the prude in letters and life   it is deserving of remark and censure that american literature is become shockingly moral there is not a doubt of it our writers if accused would make explicit confession that morality is their only faultmorality in the strict and specific sense far be it from me to disparage and belittle this decent tendency to ignore the largest side of human nature and liveliest element of literary interest it has an eminence of its own if it is not great art it is at least great follya superior sort of folly to which none of the masters of letters has ever attained not shakspeare nor cervantes nor goethe nor molière norno not even rabelaisever achieved that shining pinnacle of propriety to which the latterday american has aspired by turning his back upon natures broad and fruitful levels and his eyes upon the passionate altitudes where throned upon congenial ice miss nancy sits to censure letters putting the muses into petticoats and affixing a figleaf upon truth ours

tother school there is latitude for gratification of individual taste but it occurs that a literature rather accurately reflects all the virtues and other vices of its period and country and its tendencies are but the matchings of thought with action hence we may reasonably expect to findand indubitably shall findcertain wellmarked correspondences between the literary faults which it pleases our writers to commit and the social crimes which it pleases the adversary to see their readers commit within the current lustrum the prudery which had already for some seasons been achieving a

things periodicity is the ultimate law and largest explanation of the universeto do it over again the one insatiable ambition of all that is everything vibrates through vibration alone do the senses discern it we are not provided with means of cognizance of what is absolutely at rest impressions come in waves recurrence recurrence and again recurrencethat is the sole phenomenon with what fealty we submit us to the law which compels the rhythm and regularity to our movementthat makes us divide up passing time into brief equal intervals marking them off by some method of physical notation so that our senses may apprehend them in all we do we unconsciously mark time like a clock the leader of an orchestra with his bâton only more perfectly than the smith with his hammer or the woman with her needle because his hand is better assisted by his ear less embarrassed with impedimenta the pedestrian impelling his legs and the idler twiddling his thumbs are endeavoring each in his unconscious way to beat time to some inaudible music and the graceless lout sitting crosslegged in a horsecar manages the affair with his toe  the more intently we labor the more intensely do we become absorbed in labors dumb song until with body and mind engaged in the ecstacy of repetition we resent an interruption of our work as we do a false note in music and are mightily enamored of ourselves afterward for the power of application which was simply inability to desist in this rhythm of toil is to be found the charm of industry toil has in itself no spell to conjure with but its recurrences of molecular action cerebral and muscular are as delightful as rhyme  such of our pleasures as require movements equally rhythmic with those entailed by labor are almost equally agreeable with the added advantage of being useless dancing which is not only rhythmic movement pure and simple undebased with any element of utility but is capable of performance under conditions positively baneful is for these reasons the most engaging of them all and if it were but onehalf as wicked as the prudes have endeavored by method of naughty suggestion to make it would lack of absolute bliss nothing but the other half  this ever active and unabatable something within us which compels us always to be marking time we may call for want of a better name the instinct of rhythm it is the æsthetic principle of our nature translated into words it has given us poetry into sound music into motion dancing perhaps even painting may be referred to it space being the correlative of time and color the correlative of tone we are fond of arranging our minute intervals of time into groups we find certain of these groups highly agreeable while others are no end unpleasant in the former there is a singular regularity to be observed which led hardheaded old leibnitz to the theory that our delight in music arises from an inherent affection for mathematics yet musicians have hitherto obtained but indifferent recognition for feats of calculation nor have the singing and playing of renowned mathematicians been unanimously commended by good judges  music so intensifies and excites the instinct of rhythm that a strong volition is required to repress its physical expression the universality of this is well illustrated by the legend found in some shape in many countries and languages of the boy with the fiddle who compels king cook peasant clown and all that kind of people to follow him through the land and in the myth of the pied piper of hamelin we discern abundant reason to think the instinct of rhythm an attribute of rats soldiers march so much livelier with music than without that it has been found a tolerably good substitute for the hope of plunder when the footfalls are audible as on the deck of a steamer walking has an added pleasure and even the pirate with gentle consideration for the universal instinct suffers his vanquished foeman to walk the plank  dancing is simply marking time with the body as an accompaniment to music though the samewithout the musicis done with only the head and forefinger in a new england meetinghouse at psalm time the peculiar dance named in honor of st vitus is executed with or without music at the option of the musician but the body is a clumsy piece of machinery requiring some attention and observation to keep it accurately in

the length of lines in songs and poems is determined by the inhalation and exhalation of the lungs and this really goes near to the root of the matter albeit we might derive therefrom the unsupported inference that a poet fat and scant of breath would write in lines of a foot each while the more ablebodied bard with the capacious lungs of a pearldiver would deliver himself all across his page with the spacious volubility of a drumming decasyllabon  while the heart working with alternate contraction and dilatation sends the blood intermittently through the brain and the outer world apprises us of its existence only by successive impulses it must result that our sense of things will be rhythmic the brain being alternately stimulated and relaxed we must thinkas we feelin waves apprehending nothing continuously and incapable of a consciousness that is not divisible into units of perception of which we make mental record and physical sign that is why we dance that is why we can may must

are found along the nile to those then who see in the dance a civilizing art it can not be wholly unprofitable to glance at this polite accomplishment as it existed among the ancient egyptians and was by them transmittedwith various modifications but preserving its essentials of identityto other nations and other times and here we have first to note that as in all the nations of antiquity the dance in egypt was principally a religious ceremony the pious old boys that builded the pyramids executed their jigs as an act of worship diodorus siculus informs us that osiris in his proselyting travels among the peoples surrounding egyptfor osiris was what we would call a circuit preacherwas accompanied by dancers male and dancers female from the sculptures on some of the oldest tombs of thebes it is seen that the dances there depicted did not greatly differ from those in present favor in the same region although it seems a fair inference from the higher culture and refinement of the elder period that they were distinguished by graces correspondingly superior that dances having the character of religious rites were not always free from an element that we would term indelicacy but which their performers and witnesses probably considered the commendable exuberance of zeal and devotion is manifest from the following passage of herodotus in which reference is made to the festival of bubastis    men and women come sailing all together vast numbers in each boat   many of the women with castanets which they strike while some of   the men pipe during the whole period of the voyage the remainder of   the voyagers male and female sing the while and make a clapping   with their hands when they arrive opposite to any town on the banks   of the stream they approach the shore and while some of the women   continue to play and sing others call aloud to the females of the   place and load them with abuse a certain number dancing and others   standing up uncovering themselves proceeding in this way all along   the river course they reach bubastis where they celebrate the feast   with abundant sacrifice  of the mysteries of isis and osiris in which dancing played an important part the character of the ceremonies is matter of dim conjecture but from the hints that have come down to us like significant shrugs and whispers from a discreet past which could say a good deal more if it had a mind to i hasten to infer that they were no better than they should have been  naturally the dances for amusement of others were regulated in movement and gesture to suit the taste of patrons for the refined decency and moderation for the wicked a soupçon of the other kind of excellence in the latter case the buffoon an invariable adjunct committed a thousand extravagances and was a dear delightful naughty ancient egyptian buffoon these dances were performed by both men and women sometimes together more frequently in separate parties the men seem to have confined themselves mostly to exercises requiring strength of leg and arm the figures on the tombs represent men in lively and vigorous postures some in attitude preliminary to leaping others in the air this feature of agility would be a novelty in the oriental dances of today the indolent male spectator being satisfied with a slow voluptuous movement congenial to his disposition when on the contrary the performance of our prehistoric friends was governed and determined by ideas of grace there were not infrequently from six to eight musical instruments the harp guitar doublepipe lyre and tambourine of the period being most popular and these commonly accompanied by a clapping of hands to mark the time  as with the greeks dancers were had in at dinner to make merry for although the upperclass egyptian was forbidden to practice the art either as an accomplishment or for the satisfaction of his emotional nature it was not considered indecorous to hire professionals to perform before him and his female and young the she dancer usually habited herself in a loose flowing robe falling to the ankles and bound at the waist while about the hips was fastened a narrow ornate girdle this costumein point of opacity imperfectly superior to a gentle breezeis not always discernible in the sculptures but it is charitably believed that the pellucid garment being merely painted over the figures has been ravished away by the hand of timethe wretch  one of the dances was a succession of pleasing attitudes the hands and arms rendering important assistancethe body bending backward and forward and swaying laterally the figurante sometimes halfkneeling and in that position gracefully posturing and again balanced on one foot the arms and hands waving slowly in time to the music in another dance the pirouette and other figures dear to the baldheaded beaux of the modern playhouse were practiced in the familiar way four thousand years ago the senses of the young ancient egyptianwild heady ladwere kicked into confusion by the darkskinned belle of the ballet while senility with dimmed eyes rubbed its dry hands in feverish approval at the selfsame feat dear dear but it was a bad world four thousand years ago  sometimes they danced in pairs men with men and women with women indifferently the latter arrangement seeming to us preferable by reason of the womens conspicuously superior grace and almost equal agility for it is in evidence on the tombs that tumblers and acrobats were commonly of the softer sex some of the attitudes were similar to those which drew from socrates the ungallant remark that women were capable of learning anything which you will that they should know the figures in this pas de deux appear frequently to have terminated in what children with their customary coarseness of speech are pleased to call wringing the dishcloutclasping the hands throwing the arms above the head and turning rapidly each as on a pivot without loosing the hands of the other and resting again in position  sometimes with no other music than the percussion of hands a man would execute a pas seul which it is to be presumed he enjoyed again with a riper and better sense of musical methods the performer accompanied himself or as in this case it usually was herself on the doublepipes the guitar or the tambourine while the familiar handclapping was done by attendants a step not unlike that of the abominable clog dance of the variety stage and music hall of the present day consisted in striking the heel of first one foot and then the other the hands and arms being employed to diminish the monotony of the movement for amusement and instruction of the vulgar buffoons in herds of ten or more in fested the streets hopping and posing to the sound of a drum  as illustrating the versatility of the dance its wide capacities of adaptation to human emotional needs i may mention here the procession of women to the tomb of a friend or relative punishing the tambourine or dara booka drum and bearing branches of palm or other symbolic vegetables these sprightly mourners passed through the streets with songs and dances which under the circumstances can hardly have failed eminently to gratify the person so fortunate as to have his memory honored by so delicate and appropriate observance     iv  a reef in the gabardine   the early jew danced ritually and socially some of his dances and the customs connected therewith were of his own devising others he picked up in egypt the latter no doubt being more firmly fixed in his memory by the necessity of practicing themalbeit behind the back of moseswhile he had them still fresh in his mind for he would naturally resort to every human and inhuman device to wile away the dragging decades consumed in tracing the labyrinthine sinuosities of his course in the wilderness when a man has assurance that he will not be permitted to arrive at the point for which he set out perceiving that every step forward is a step wasted he will pretty certainly use his feet to a better purpose than walking clearly at a time when all the chosen people were wandering jews they would dance all they knew how we know that they danced in worship of the golden calf and that previously miriam the prophetess sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances and ever so many generations before laban complained to jacob that jacob had stolen away instead of letting him send him off with songs and mirth and music on the tabret and harp a method of speeding the parting guest which would naturally include dancing although the same is not of explicit record  the religious ceremonies of the jews had not at all times the restraint and delicacy which it is to be wished the lord had exacted for we read of king david himself dancing before the ark in a condition so nearly nude as greatly to scandalize the daughter of saul by the way this incident has been always a stock argument for the extinction and decent interment of the unhappy anti dancer conceding the necessity of his extinction i am yet indisposed to attach much weight to the davidian precedent for it does not appear that he was acting under divine command directly or indirectly imparted and whenever he followed the hest of his own sweet will david had a notable knack at going wrong perhaps the best value of the incident consists in the evidence it supplies that dancing was not forbiddensave possibly by divine injunctionto the higher classes of jews for unless we are to suppose the dancing of david to have been the mere clumsy capering of a loutish mood a theory which our respect for royalty even when divested of its imposing externals forbids us to entertain we are bound to assume previous instruction and practice in the art we have moreover the roman example of the daughter of herodias whose dancing before herod was so admirably performed that she was suitably rewarded with a testimonial of her step fathers esteem to these examples many more might be added showing by cumulative evidence that among the ancient people whose religion was good enough for us to adopt and improve dancing was a polite and proper accomplishment although not always decorously executed on seasonable occasion     v  enter a troupe of ancients dancing   the nearly oldest authentic human records now decipherable are the cuneiform inscriptions from the archives of assurbanipal translated by the late george smith of the british museum and in them we find abundant reference to the dance but must content ourselves with a single one        the kings of arabia who against my agreement     sinned whom in the midst of battle alive i had captured     in hand to make that bitrichiti  heavy burdens i     caused them to carry and i caused them to take     building its brick work             with dancing and     music          with joy and shouting from the found     ation to its roof i built   a mesopotamian king who had the genius to conceive the dazzling idea of communicating with the readers of this distant generation by taking impressions of carpet tacks on cubes of unbaked clay is surely entitled to a certain veneration and when he associates dancing with such commendable actions as making porters of his royal captives it is not becoming in us meaner mortals to set up a contrary opinion indeed nothing can be more certain than that the art of dancing was not regarded by the ancients generally in the light of a frivolous accomplishment nor its practice a thing wherewith to shoo away a tedious hour in their minds it evidently had a certain dignity and elevation so much so that they associated it with their ideas tolerably correct ones on the whole of art harmony beauty truth and religion with them dancing bore a relation to walking and the ordinary movements of the limbs similar to that which poetry bears to prose and as our own emersonhimself something of an ancientdefines poetry as the piety of the intellect so homer would doubtless have defined dancing as the devotion of the body if he had had the unspeakable advantage of a training in the emerson school of epigram such a view of it is natural to the unsophisticated pagan mind and to all minds of clean wholesome and simple understanding it is only the intellect that has been subjected to the strain of overwrought religious enthusiasm of the more sombre sort that can discern a lurking devil in the dance or anything but an exhilarating and altogether delightful outward manifestation of an inner sense of harmony joy and well being under the stress of morbid feeling or the overstrain of religious excitement coarsely organized natures see or create something gross and prurient in things intrinsically sweet and pure and it happens that when the dance has fallen to their shaping and direction as in religious rites then it has received its most objectionable development and perversion but the grossness of dances devised by the secular mind for purposes of æsthetic pleasure is all in the censorious critic who deserves the same kind of rebuke administered by dr johnson to boswell who asked the doctor if he considered a certain nude statue immodest no sir but your question is  it would be an unfortunate thing indeed if the prurient prudes of the meeting houses were permitted to make the laws by which society should be governed the same unhappy psychological condition which makes the dance an unclean thing in their jaundiced eyes renders it impossible for them to enjoy art or literature when the subject is natural the treatment free and joyous the ingenuity that can discover an indelicate provocative in the waltz will have no difficulty in snouting out all manner of uncleanliness in shakspeare chaucer boccacionay even in the new testament it would detect an unpleasant suggestiveness in the medicean venus and two in the dancing faun to all such the ordinary functions of life are impure the natural man and woman things to blush at all the economies of nature full of shocking improprieties  in the primitive church dancing was a religious rite no less than it was under the older dispensation among the jews on the eve of sacred festivals the young people were accustomed to assemble sometimes before the church door sometimes in the choir or nave of the church and dance and sing hymns in honor of the saint whose festival it was easter sunday especially was so celebrated and rituals of a comparatively modern date contain the order in which it is appointed that the dances are to be performed and the words of the hymns to the music of which the youthful devotees flung up their pious heels but i digress  in platos time the greeks held that dancing awakened and preserved in the soulas i do not doubt that it doesthe sentiment of harmony and proportion and in accordance with this idea simonides with a happy knack at epigram defined dances as poems in dumb show  in his republic plato classifies the grecian dances as domestic designed for relaxation and amusement military to promote strength and activity in battle and religious to accompany the sacred songs at pious festivals to the last class belongs the dance which theseus is said to have instituted on his return from crete after having abated the minotaur nuisance at the head of a noble band of youth this public spirited reformer of abuses himself executed his dance theseus as a dancingmaster does not much fire the imagination it is true but the incident has its value and purpose in this dissertation theseus called his dance geranos or the crane because its figures resembled those described by that fowl aflight and plutarch fancied he discovered in it a meaning which one does not so readily discover in plutarchs explanation  it is certain that in the time of anacreona the greeks loved the dance that poet with frequent repetition felicitates himself that age has not deprived him of his skill in it in ode liii he declares that in the dance he renews his youth      when i behold the festive train     of dancing youth im young again      and let me while the wild and young     trip the mazy dance along     fling my heap of years away     and be as wild as young as they                                    moore   footnote a it may be noted here that the popular conception of this poet as a frivolous sensualist is unsustained by evidence and repudiated by all having knowledge of the matter although love and wine were his constant themes there is good ground for the belief that he wrote of them with greater abandon than he indulged in thema not uncommon practice of the poetfolk by the way and one to which those who sing of deeds of arms are perhaps especially addicted the great age which anacreon attained points to a temperate life and he more than once denounces intoxication with as great zeal as a modern reformer who has eschewed the flagon for the trencher according to anacreon drunkenness is the vice of barbarians though for the matter of that it is difficult to say what achievable vice is not in ode lxii he sings      fill me boy as deep a draught     as eer was filled as eer was quaffed     but let the water amply flow     to cool the grapes intemperate glow                                             for though the bowls the grave of sadness     neer let it be the birth of madness     no banish from our board to night     the revelries of rude delight     to scythians leave these wild excesses     ours be the joy that soothes and blesses     and while the temperate bowl we wreathe     in concert let our voices breathe     beguiling every hour along     with harmony of soul and song  maximus of tyre speaking of

epaminondas that he had an extraordinary talent for music and dancing epaminondas accomplishing his jig must be accepted as a pleasing and instructive figure in the history of the dance  lucian says that a dancer must have some skill as an actor and some acquaintance with mythologythe reason being that the dances at the festivals of the gods partook of the character of pantomime and represented the most picturesque events and passages in the popular religion religious knowledge is happily no longer regarded as a necessary qualification for the dance and in point of fact no thing is commonly more foreign to the minds of those who excel in it  it is related of aristides the just that he danced at an entertainment given by dionysius the tyrant and plato who was also a guest probably confronted him in the set  the dance of the wine press described by longinus was originally modest and proper but seems to have become in the process of timeand probably by the stealthy participation of disguised prudesa kind of can can  in the high noon of human civilizationin the time of pericles at athensdancing seems to have been regarded as a civilizing and refining amusement in which the

but i prefer to consider his ungracious dictum in de ami citia i think nemo sobrius saltatno sober man dancesas merely the spiteful and envious fling of a man who could not himself dance and am disposed to congratulate the golden youth of the eternal city on the absence of the solemn consequential and egotistic orator from their festivals and merry makings whence his shining talents would have been so many several justifications for his forcible extrusion no doubt his eminence procured him many invitations to balls of the period and some of these he probably felt constrained to accept but it is highly unlikely that he was often solicited to dance he probably wiled away the tedious hours of inaction by instructing the fibrous virgins and gouty bucks in the principles of juris prudence cicero as a wall flower is an interesting object and turning to another branch of our subject in this picturesque attitude we leave him left talking     vi  cairo revisited   having glanced briefly and as through a glass darkly at the dance as it existed in the earliest times of which we have knowledge in the country whence through devious and partly obliterated channels we derived much of our civilization let us hastily survey some of its modern methods in the same regionsupplying thereby some small means of comparison to the reader who may care to note the changes undergone and the features preserved  we find the most notable if not the only purely egyptian dancer of our time in the alme or ghowazee the former name is derived from the original calling of this classthat of reciting poetry to the inmates of the harem the latter they acquired by dancing at the festivals of the ghors or memlooks reasonably modest at first the dancing of the alme became in the course of time so conspicuously indelicate that great numbers of the softer sex persuaded themselves to its acquirement and practice and a certain viceregal prude once contracted the powers of the whole cairo contingent of awalim into the pent up utica of the town of esuch some five hundred miles removed from the viceregal dissenting eye for a brief season the order was enforced then the sprightly sinners danced out of bounds and their successors can now be found by the foreign student of egyptian morals without the fatigue and expense of a long journey up the nile  the professional dress of the alme consists of a short embroidered jacket fitting closely to the arms and back but frankly unreserved in front long loose trousers of silk sufficiently opaque somewhat to soften the severity of the lower limbs a cashmere shawl bound about the waist and a light turban of muslin embroidered with gold the long black hair starred with small coins falls abundantly over the shoulders the eyelids are sabled with kohl and such other paints oils varnishes and dyestuffs are used as the fair onewho is a trifle dark by the waymay have proved for herself or accepted on the superior judgment of her european sisters altogether the girls outer and visible aspect is not unattractive to the eye of the traveler however faulty to the eye of the travelers wife when about to dance the alme puts on a lighter and more diaphanous dress eschews her slippers and with a slow and measured step advances to the centre of the roomher lithe figure undulating with a grace peculiarly serpentile the music is that of a reed pipe or a tambourinea number of attendants assisting with castanets perhaps the argument of her dance will be a lovepassage with an imaginary young arab the coyness of a first meeting by chance her gradual warming into passion their separation followed by her tears and dejection the hope of meeting soon again and finally the intoxication of being held once more in his armsall are delineated with a fidelity and detail surprising to whatever of judgment the masculine spectator may have the good fortune to retain  one of the prime favorites is the wasp dance allied to the tarantella although less pleasing in motive than that described the wasp dance gives opportunity for movements of even superior significanceor as one may say suggestures the girl stands in a pensive posture her hands demurely clasped in front her head poised a little on one side suddenly a wasp is heard to approach and by her gestures is seen to have stung her on the breast she then darts hither and thither in pursuit of that audacious insect assuming all manner of provoking attitudes until finally the wasp having been caught and miserably exterminated the girl resumes her innocent smile and modest pose     vii  japan wear and bombay ducks   throughout asia dancing is marked by certain characteristics which do not greatly differ save in degree among the various peoples who practice it with few exceptions it is confined to the superior sex and these ladies i am sorry to confess have not derived as great moral advantage from the monopoly as an advocate of dancing would prefer to record  dancingthe rhythmical movement of the limbs and body to musicis as i have endeavored to point out instinctive hardly a people savage or refined but has certain forms of it when from any cause the men abstain from its execution it has commonly not the character of grace and agility as its dominant feature but is distinguished by soft voluptuous movements suggestive posturing and all the wiles by which the performer knows she can best please the other sex the most forthright and effective means to that commendable end being evocation of mans baser nature the japanese men are antidancers from necessity of costume if nothing else and the effect is much the same as elsewhere under the same conditions the women dance the men gloat and the gods grieve  there are two kinds of dances in japan the one not only lewd butto speak with accurate adjustment of word to factbeastly in the other grace is the dominating element and decency as cold as a snow storm of the former class the chon nookee is the most popular it is however less a dance than an exhibition and its patrons are the wicked the dissolute and the european it is commonly given at some entertainment to which respectable women have not the condescension to be invitedsuch as a dinner party of some wealthy gentlemans gentlemen friends the dinnerserved on the floorhaving been impatiently tucked away and the candies cakes hot saki and other necessary addenda of a japanese dinner brought in the chon nookee is demanded and with a modest demeanor worn as becomingly as if it were their every day habit the performers glide in seating themselves coyly on the floor in two rows each dancing girl is appareled in such captivating bravery as her purse can buy or her charms exact the folds of her varicolored gowns crossing her bosom makes combinations of rich warm hues which it were folly not to admire and peril to admire too much the faces of these girls are in many instances exceedingly pretty but with that naturaland be it humbly submitted not very creditabletendency of the sex to revision and correction of natures handiwork they plaster them with pigments dear to the sign painter and temper the red glory of their lips with a bronze preparation which the flattered brass founder would no doubt deem kissable utterly the music is made by beating a drum and twanging a kind of guitar the musician chanting the while to an exceedingly simple air words which in deference to the possible prejudices of those readers who may be on terms of familarity with the japanese language i have deemed it proper to omitwith an apology to the prudes for the absence of an appendix in which they might be given without offense i had it in mind to insert the music here but am told by credible authority that in japan music is moral or immoral without reference to the words that may be sung with it so i omitwith reluctancethe score as well as the words  the chanting having proceeded for a few minutes the girls take up the song and enter spiritedly into the dance one challenges another and at a certain stage of the lively song with the sharp cry hoi makes a motion with her hand failure on the part of the other instantaneously and exactly to copy this gesture entails the forfeiture of a garment which is at once frankly removed cold and mechanical at the outset the music grows spirited as the girls grow nude and the dancers themselves become strangely excited as they warm to the work taking the while generous potations of saki to assist their enthusiasm  let it not be supposed that in all this there is anything of passion it is with these women nothing more that the mere mental exaltation produced by music exercise and drink with the spectators i have heard it fares somewhat otherwise  when modestys last rag has been discarded the girls as if suddenly abashed at their own audacity fly like startled fawns from the room leaving their patrons to make a settlement with conscience and arrange the terms upon which that monitor will consent to the performance of the rest of the dance for the dance properor improperis now about to begin if the first part seemed somewhat tropical comparison with what follows will acquit it of that demerit the combinations of the dance are infinitely varied and so long as willing witnesses remainwhich in simple justice to manly fortitude it should be added is a good whileso long will the chon nookee present a new and unexpected phase but it is thought expedient that no more of them be presented here and if the reader has done me the honor to have enough of it we will pass to the consideration of another class of dances  of this class those most in favor are the fan and umbrella dances performed usually by young girls trained almost from infancy the japanese are passionately fond of these beautiful exhibitions of grace and no manner of festivity is satisfactorily celebrated without them the musicians all girls commonly six or eight in number play on the guitar a small ivory wand being used instead of the fingers to strike the strings the dancer a girl of some thirteen years is elaborately habited as a page confined by the closely folded robe as by fetters the feet and legs are not much used the feet indeed never leaving the floor time is marked by undulations of the body waving the arms and deft manipulation of the fan the supple figure bends and sways like a reed in the wind advances and recedes one movement succeeding another by transitions singularly graceful the arms describing innumerable curves and the fan so skilfully handled as to seem instinct with a life and liberty of its own nothing more pure more devoid of evil suggestion can be imagined it is a sad fact that the poor children trained to the execution of this harmless and pleasing dance are destined in their riper years to give their charms and graces to the service of the devil in the chon nookee the umbrella dance is similar to the one just described the main difference being the use of a small gaily colored umbrella in place of the fan  crossing from japan to china the prude will find a condition of things which for iron severity of morals is perhaps unparalleledno dancing whatever by either profligate or virtuous women to whatever original cause we may attribute this peculiarity it seems eternal for the women of the upper classes have an ineradicable habit of so mutilating their feet that even the polite and comparatively harmless accomplishment of walking is beyond their power those of the lower orders have not sense enough to dance and that men should dance alone is a proposition of such free and forthright idiocy as to be but obscurely conceivable to any understanding not having the gift of maniacal inspiration or the normal advantage of original incapacity altogether we may rightly consider china the heaven appointed habitat of people who dislike the dance  in siam what little is known of dancing is confined to the people of laos the women are meek eyed spiritless creatures crushed under the heavy domination of the stronger sex naturally their music and dancing are of a plaintive almost doleful character not without a certain cloying sweetness however the dancing is as graceful as the pudgy little bodies of the women are capable of achievinga little more pleasing than the capering of a butchers block but not quite so much so as that of a wash tub its greatest merit is the steely rigor of its decorum the dancers however like ourselves are a shade less appallingly proper off the floor than on it  in no part of the world probably is the condition of women more consummately deplorable than in india and in consequence nowhere than in the dances of that country is manifested a more simple unconsciousness or frank disregard of decency as by nature and according to the light that is in him the hindu is indolent and licentious so in accurately matching degree are the dancing girls innocent of morality and uninfected with shame it would be difficult more keenly to insult a respectable hindu woman than to accuse her of having danced while the man who should affect the society of the females justly so charged would incur the lasting detestation of his race the dancing girls are of two orders of infamythose who serve in the temples and are hence called devo dasi slaves of the gods and the nautch girls who dance in a secular sort for hire frequently a mother will make a vow to dedicate her unborn babe if it have the obedience to be a girl to the service of some particular god in this way and by the daughters born to themselves are the ranks of the devo dasi recruited the sons of these miserable creatures are taught to play upon musical instruments for their mothers and sisters to dance by as the ordinary hindu woman is careless about the exposure of her charms so these dancers take intelligent and mischievous advantage of the social situation by immodestly concealing their own the devo dasi actually go to the length of wearing clothes each temple has a band of eight or ten of these girls who celebrate their saltatory rites morning and evening advancing at the head of the religious procession they move themselves in an easy and graceful manner with gradual transition to a more sensuous and voluptuous motion suiting their action to the religious frame of mind of the devout until their wellrounded limbs and lithe figures express a degree of piety consonant with the purpose of the particular occasion they attend all public ceremonies and festivals executing their audacious dances impartially for gods and men  the nautch girls are purchased in infancy and as carefully trained in their wordly way as the devo dasi for the diviner function being about equally depraved all the large cities contain full sets of these girls with attendant musicians ready for hire at festivals of any kind and by leaving orders parties are served at their residences with fidelity and dispatch commonly they dance two at a time but frequently some wealthy gentleman will secure the services of a hundred or more to assist him through the day without resorting to questionable expedients of timekilling their dances require strict attention from the circumstance that their feetlike those of the immortal equestrienne of banbury crossare hung with small bells which must be made to sound in concert with the notes of the musicians in attitude and gesture they are almost as bad as their pious sisters of the temples the endeavor is to express the passions of love hope jealousy despair etc and they eke out this mimicry with chanted songs in every way worthy of the movements of which they are the explanatory notes these are the only women in hindustan whom it is thought worth while to teach to read and write if they would but make as noble use of their intellectual as they do of their physical education they might perhaps produce books as moral as the dance of death  in persia and asia minor the dances and dancers are nearly alike in both countries the georgian and circassian slaves who have been taught the art of pleasing are bought by the wealthy for their amusement and that of their wives and concubines some of the performances are pure in motive and modest in execution but most of them are interesting otherwise the beautiful young circassian slave clad in loose robes of diaphanous texture takes position castanets in hand on a square rug and to the music of a kind of violin goes through the figures of her dance her whiteness giving her an added indelicacy which the european spectator misses in the capering of her berry brown sisters in sin of other climes  the dance of the georgian is more spirited her dress is a brief skirt reaching barely to the knees and a low cut chemise in her night black hair is wreathed a bright red scarf or string of pearls the music at first low and slow increases by degrees in rapidity and volume then falls away almost to silence again swells and quickens and so alternates the motions of the dancers willowy and obedient figure accurately according now seeming to swim languidly and anon her little feet having their will of her and fluttering in midair like a couple of birds she is an engaging creature her ways are ways of pleasantness but whether all her paths are peace depends somewhat it is reasonable to conjecture upon the circumspection of her daily walk and conversation when relegated to the custody of her masters wives  in some parts of persia the dancing of boys appareled as women is held in high favor but exactly what wholesome human sentiment it addresses i am not prepared to say     viii  in the bottom of the crucible   from the rapid and imperfect review of certain characteristic oriental dances in the chapters immediately precedingor rather from the studies some of whose minor results those chapters embodyi make deduction of a few significant facts to which facts of contrary significance seem exceptional in the first place it is to be noted that in countries where woman is conspicuously degraded the dance is correspondingly depraved by the dance i mean of course those characteristic and typical performances which have permanent place in the social life of the people amongst all nations the dance exists in certain loose and unrecognized forms which are the outgrowth of the momentcreatures of caprice posing and pranking their brief and inglorious season to be superseded by some newer favorite born of some newer accident or fancy a fair type of these ephemeral dancesthe comets of the saltatory systemin so far as they can have a type is the now familiar cancan of the jardin mabillea dance the captivating naughtiness of which has given it wide currency in our generation the successors to whose aged rakes and broken bawds it will fail to please and would probably make unhappy dances of this character neither national universal nor enduring have little value to the student of anything but anatomy and lingerie by study of a thousand the product of as many years it might be possible to trace the thread upon which such beads are strungindeed it is pretty obvious without research but considered singly they have nothing of profit to the investigator who will do well to contemplate without reflection or perform without question as the bent of his mind may be observant or experimental  dancing then is indelicate where the women are depraved and to this it must be added that the women are depraved where the men are indolent we need not trouble ourselves to consider too curiously as to cause and effect whether in countries where man is too lazy to be manly woman practices deferential adjustment of her virtues to the loose exactions of his tolerance or whether for ladies of indifferent modesty their lords will not make exertionthese are questions for the ethnologer it concerns our purpose only to note that the male who sits crosslegged on a rug and permits his female to do the dancing for both gets a quality distinctly inferior to that enjoyed by his more energetic brother willing himself to take a leg at the game doubtless the lazy fellow prefers the loose gamboling of nude girls to the decent grace and moderation of a better art but this i submit is an error of taste resulting from imperfect instruction  and here we are confronted with the ever recurrent question is dancing immoral the reader who has done me the honor attentively to consider the brief descriptions of certain dances hereinbefore presented will it is believed be now prepared to answer that some sorts of dancing indubitably area bright and shining example of the type being the exploit wherein women alone perform and men alone admire but one of the arguments by which it is sought to prove dancing immoral in itselfnamely that it provokes evil passionswe are now able to analyze with the necessary discrimination assigning to it its just weight and tracing its real bearing on the question dances like those described with i hope a certain delicacy and reticence are undoubtedly disturbing to the spectator they have in that circumstance their raison dêtre as to that then there can be no two opinions but observe the male oriental voluptuary does not himself dance why partly no doubt because of his immortal indolence but mainly i venture to think because he wishes to enjoy his reprehensible emotion and this can not coexist with muscular activity if the readerthrough either immunity from improper emotion or unfamiliarity with muscular activityentertains a doubt of this his family physician will be happy to remove it nothing is more certain than that the dancing girls of oriental countries themselves feel nothing of what they have the skill to simulate and the ballet dancer of our own stage is icily unconcerned while kicking together the smouldering embers in the heart of the wigged and corseted old beau below her and playing the duses delight with the disobedient imagination of the he prude posted in the nooks and shadows thoughtfully provided for him stendahl frankly informs us i have had much experience with the danseuses of the  theatre at valence i am convinced that they are for the most part very chaste it is because their occupation is too fatiguing  the same author by the way says elsewhere    i would wish if i were legislator that they should adopt in france   as in germany the custom of soirées dansantes four times a month   the young girls go with their mothers to a ball beginning at seven   oclock ending at midnight and requiring for all expense a violin   and some glasses of water in an adjacent room the mothers perhaps   a little jealous of the happy education of their daughters play at   cards in a third the fathers find the newspapers and talk politics   between midnight and one oclock all the family are reunited and   have regained the paternal roof the young girls learn to know the   young men the fatuity and the indiscretion that follows it become   quickly odious in a word they learn how to choose a husband some   young girls have unfortunate love affairs but the number of   deceived husbands and unhappy households mauvaises ménages   diminishes in immense proportion  for an iron education in cold virtue there is no school like the position of sitting master to the wall flowers at a church sociable but it is humbly conjectured that even the austere morality of a bald headed prude might receive an added iciness if he would but attend one of these simple dancing bouts disguised as a sweet young girl     ix  counsel for the defense   nearly all the great writers of antiquity and of the medieval period who have mentioned dancing at all have done so in terms of unmistakable favor of modern famous authors they only have condemned it from whose work or from what is known of their personal character we may justly infer an equal aversion to pretty much everything in the way of pleasure that a christian needs not die in order to enjoy english literaturei use the word in its noble sense to exclude all manner of preaching whether clerical or layis full of the dance the sound of merry makers footing it featly to the music runs like an undertone through all the variations of its theme and fills all its pauses  in the millers tale chaucer mentions dancing among the accomplishments of the parish clerk along with blood letting and the drawing of legal documents      a merry child he was so god me save     wel coud he leten blood and clippe and shave     and make a chartre of land and a quitance     in twenty maners could he trip and dance     after the scole of oxenforde tho     and with his legges casten to and froa   footnote a on this passage tyrwhit makes the following judicious comment the school of oxford seems to have been in much the same estimation for its dancing as that of stratford for its frenchalluding of course to what is said in the prologue of the french spoken by the prioress    and french she spoke full fayre and fetisly   after the scole of stratford atte bowe   for french of paris was to hire unknowe   milton the greatest of the puritansintellectual ancestry of the modern degenerate prudeshad a wholesome love of the dance and nowhere is his pen so joyous as in its description in the well known passage from comus which should it occur to my memory while delivering a funeral oration i am sure i could not forbear to quote albeit this our present argument is but little furthered by its context      meanwhile welcome joy and feast     midnight shout and revelry     tipsy dance and jollity     braid your locks with rosy twine     dropping odors dropping wine     rigor now is gone to bed

was not himself a good dancerand as to that point my memory is unstored with instance or authorityit will at least be conceded that he was an admirable reporter with his heart in the business somewhat to lessen the force of the objection that he puts the foregoing lines into a not very respectable mouth on a not altogether reputable occasion i append the following passage from the same poem supposed to be spoken by the good spirit who had brought a lady and her two brothers through many perils restoring them to their parents      noble lord and lady bright     i have brought ye new delight     here behold so goodly grown     three fair branches of your own     heaven hath timely tried their youth     their faith their patience and their truth     and sent them here through hard assays     with a crown of deathless praise     to triumph in victorious dance     oer sensual folly and intemperance  the lines on dancinglines which themselves dancein lallegro are too familiar i dare not permit myself the enjoyment of quotation  lord herbert of cherbury one of the most finished gentlemen of his time otherwise laments in his autobiography that he had never learned to dance because that accomplishment doth fashion the body and gives one a good presence and address in all companies since it disposeth the limbs to a kind of souplesse as the french call it and agility insomuch as they seem to have the use of their legs arms and bodies more than many others who standing stiff and stark in their postures seem as if they were taken in their joints or had not the perfect use of their members altogether a very grave objection to dancing in the opinion of those who discountenance it and i take great credit for candor in presenting his lordships indictment  in the following pertinent passage from lemontey i do not remember the opinion he quotes from locke but his own is sufficiently to the point    the dance is for young women what the chase is for young men a   protecting school of wisdoma preservative of the growing passions   the celebrated locke who made virtue the sole end of education   expressly recommends teaching children to dance as early as they are   able to learn dancing carries within itself an eminently cooling   quality and all over the world the tempests of the heart await to   break forth the repose of the limbs  in the traveller goldsmith says      alike all ages dames of ancient days     have led their children through the mirthful maze     and the gay grandsire skilled in gestic lore     has frisked beneath the burden of

of all the animals from the agile fawn to the unwieldly behemoth are dances taught them by nature  i am not here making an argument for dancing i only assert its goodness confessing its abuse we do not argue the wholesomeness of sunshine and cold water we assert it admitting that sunstroke is mischievous and that copious potations of freezing water will founder a superheated horse and urge the hot blood to the head of an imprudent man similarly prepared killing him as is right we do not build syllogisms to prove that grains and fruits of the earth are of gods best bounty to man we allow that bad whisky maywith difficultybe distilled from rye to spoil the topers nose and that hydrocyanic acid can be got out of the bloomy peach it were folly to prove that science and invention are our very good friends yet the sapper who has had the misfortune to be blown to rags by the mine he was preparing for his enemy will not deny that gunpowder has aptitudes of mischief and from the point of view of a nigger ordered upon the safetyvalve of a racing steamboat the vapor of water is a thing accurst shall we condemn music because the lute makes lascivious pleasing or poetry because some amorous bard tells in warm rhyme the story of the passions and swinburne has had the goodness to make vice offensive with his hymns in its praise or sculpture because from the guiltless marble may be wrought a drunken silenus or a lechering satyrpainting because the untamed fancies of a painter sometimes break tether and run riot on his canvas because the orator may provoke the wild passions of the mob shall there be no more public speakingno further acting because the actor may be pleased to saw the air or the actress display her ultimate inch of leg shall we upset the pulpit because poor dear mr tilton had a prettier wife than poor dear mr beecher the bench had its jeffrey yet it is necessary that we have the deliveries of judgment between ourselves and the litigious the medical profession has nursed poisoners enough to have baned all the rats of christendom but the resolute patient must still have his prescriptionif he die for it shall we disband our armies because in the hand of an ambitious madman a fieldmarshals baton may brain a helpless stateour navies because in ships pirates have sailed the seas over let us not commit the vulgarity of condemning the dance because of its possibilities of perversion by the vicious and the profligate let us not utter us in hot bosh and baking nonsense but cleave to reason and the sweet sense of things  dancing never made a good girl bad nor turned a wholesome young man to evil ways opportunity simpers the tedious virgin past the wallflower of her youth opportunity cackles the blasé beau who has outlasted his legs and gone deaconing in a church  opportunity indeed there is opportunity in church and schoolroom in social intercourse there is opportunity in libraries artgalleries picnics streetcars bibleclasses and at

argus and briareus rolled into one he has a hundred heads to plan his poachings a hundred eyes to spy the land a hundred hands to set his snares and springes in the country where young girls are habitually unattended in the street where the function of chaperon is commonly and it should be added intelligently performed by some capable young male where the young women receive evening calls from young men concerning whose presence in the parlor mamma in the nursery and papa at the officepoor overworked papagive themselves precious little troublethis prate of ballroom opportunity is singularly and engagingly idiotic the worthy people who hold such language may justly boast themselves superior to reason and impregnable to light the only effective reply to these creatures would be a cuffing the well meant objections of another class merit the refutation of distinct characterization it is the old talk of devotees about sin of topers concerning water temperance men of gin and albeit it is neither wise nor witty it is becoming in us at whom they rail to deal mercifully with them in some otherwise estimable souls one of these harmless brain cracks may be a right lovable trait of character  issues of a social import as great as a raid against dancing have been raised ere now will the coming man smoke will the coming man drink wine these tremendous and imperative problems only recently agitated some of the thoughtful minds in our midst by degrees they lost their preeminence they were seen to be in process of solution without social cataclysm they have in a manner been referred for disposal to the coming man himself that is to say they have been dropped and are today as dead as julius cæsar the present hour has in its turn produced its own awful problem will the coming woman waltz  as a question of mere fact the answer is patent she will dancing will be good for her she will like it so she is going to waltz but the question may rather be putto borrow phraseology current among her critics had she oughterfrom a moral point of view now from a moral point then let us seek from analogy some light on the question of what from its actual practical bearings may be dignified by the name conundrum  ought a man not to smokefrom a moral point of view the economical viewpoint the viewpoint of convenience and all the rest of them are not now in question the simple question is is it immoral to smoke and againstill from the moral point of view is it immoral to drink wine is it immoral to play at cardsto visit theaters in boston you go to some                           harmless museum   where folks who like plays may religiously see em  finally thenand always from the same elevated viewpoint is it immoral to waltz  the suggestions here started will not be further pursued in this place it is quite pertinent now to note that we do smoke because we like it and do drink wine because we like it and do waltz because we like it and have the added consciousness that it is a duty i am sorry for a fellowcreaturemalewho knows not the comfort of a cigar sorry and concerned for him who is innocent of the knowledge of good and evil that

ancestors i would give value to behold the execution of a coranto and inspect the steps of a cinquepace having assurance that the performances assuming these names were veritably identical with their memorable originals we possess the means of verifying somewhat as to the nature of the minuet but after what fashion did our revered grandfather do his rigadoon and his gavot what manner of thing was that pirouet in the deft execution of which he felt an honest exultation and what were the steps of his contra or country and cossack dances what tune was thatthe devil amongst the fiddlersfor which he clamored to inspire his feats of leg  in our fathers time we read    i wore my blue coat and brass buttons very high in the neck short   in the waist and sleeves nankeen trousers and white silk stockings   and a white waistcoat i performed all the steps accurately and with   great agility  which it appears gained the attention of the company and it well might for the year was 1830 and the mode of performing the cotillion of the period was undergoing the metamorphosis of which the perfect development has been familiar to ourselves in its next stage the male celebrant is represented to us as hopping about with a face expressive of intense solemnity dancing as if a quadrillemark the newer wordwere not a thing to be laughed at but a severe trial to the feelings there is a smack of ancient history about this too it lurks in the word hopping in the perfected development of this dance as known to ourselves no stress of caricature would describe the movement as a hopping but our grandfather not only hopped he did more he sprang from the floor and quivered in midair he crossed his feet twice and even three times before alighting and our budding grandmother beheld and experienced flutterings of the bosom at his manly achievements some memory of these feats survived in the performances of the male balletdancersa breed now happily extinct a fine old ladyshe lives

costumes manners and practices there was imported from germany a dance called waltz which as i conceive was the first of our round dances it was welcomed by most persons who could dance and by some superior souls who could not among the latter the late lord byronwhose participation in the dance was barred by an unhappy physical disabilityaddressed the newcomer in characteristic verse some of the lines in this ingenious noblemans apostrophe are not altogether intelligible when applied to any dance that we know by the name of waltz for example    pleased round the chalky floor how well they

to contemporary waltzers but the description involves no poetic license our dear grandmothers giddy giddy girls did their waltz that way let me quote    the lady takes the gentleman round the neck

takes him round the waist  at another point the lady may lean gently on his shoulder their arms as it appears entwining this description is by an eyewitness whose observation is taken not at the rather debauched court of the prince regent but at the simple republican assemblies of new york the observer is the gentle irving writing in 1807 occasional noteworthy experiences they must have
