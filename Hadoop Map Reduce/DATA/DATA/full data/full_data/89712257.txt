89712257	secrets of the woods  wood folk series book three  by william j long   1901                  to chgeegeelokhsis little                friend chgeegee whose                coming makes the winter glad     preface  this little book is but another chapter in the shy wild life of the fields and woods of which ways of wood folk and wilderness ways were the beginning it is given gladly in answer to the call for more from those who have read the previous volumes and whose letters are full of the spirit of kindness and appreciation  many questions have come of late with these same letters chief of which is this how shall one discover such things for himself how shall we too read the secrets of the wood folk there is no space here to answer to describe the long training even if one could explain perfectly what is more or less unconscious i would only suggest that perhaps the real reason why we see so little in the woods is the way we go through themtalking laughing rustling smashing twigs disturbing the peace of the solitudes by what must seem strange and uncouth noises to the little wild creatures they on the other hand slip with noiseless feet through their native coverts shy silent listening more concerned to hear than to be heard loving the silence hating noise and fearing it as they fear and hate their natural enemies  we would not feel comfortable if a big barbarian came into our quiet home broke the door down whacked his warclub on the furniture and whooped his battle yell we could hardly be natural under the circumstances our true dispositions would hide themselves we might even vacate the house bodily just so wood folk only as you copy their ways can you expect to share their life and their secrets and it is astonishing how little the shyest of them fears you if you but keep silence and avoid all excitement even of feeling for they understand your feeling quite as much as your action  a dog knows when you are afraid of him when you are hostile when friendly so does a bear lose your nerve and the horse you are riding goes to pieces instantly bubble over with suppressed excitement and the deer yonder stepping daintily down the bank to your canoe in the water grasses will stamp and snort and bound away without ever knowing what startled him but be quiet friendly peacepossessed in the same place and the deer even after discovering you will draw near and show his curiosity in twenty pretty ways ere he trots away looking back over his shoulder for your last message then be generousshow him the flash of a lookingglass the flutter of a bright handkerchief a tin whistle or any other little kickshaw that the remembrance of a boys pocket may suggestand the chances are that he will come back again finding curiosity so richly rewarded  that is another point to remember all the wood folk are more curious about you than you are about them sit down quietly in the woods anywhere and your coming will occasion the same stir that a stranger makes in a new england hill town control your curiosity and soon their curiosity gets beyond control they must come to find out who you are and what you are doing then you have the advantage for while their curiosity is being satisfied they forget fear and show you many curious bits of their life that you will never discover otherwise  as to the source of these sketches it is the same as that of the others years of quiet observation in the woods and fields and some old notebooks which hold the records of summer and winter camps in the great wilderness  my kind publishers announced some time ago a table of contents which included chapters on jay and fishhawk panther and musquash and a certain savage old bull moose that once took up his abode too near my camp for comfort my only excuse for their nonappearance is that my little book was full before their turn came they will find their place i trust in another volume presently  stamford conn june 1901 wm j long

fraid one as simmo calls him always makes two appearances when you squeak to bring him out first after much peeking he runs out of his tunnel sits up once on his hind legs rubs his eyes with his paws looks up for the owl and behind him for the fox and straight ahead at the tent where the man lives then he dives back headlong into his tunnel with a rustle of leaves and a frightened whistle as if kupkawis the little owl had seen him that is to reassure himself in a moment he comes back softly to see what kind of crumbs you have given him  no wonder tookhees is so timid for there is no place in earth or air or water outside his own little doorway under the mossy stone where he is safe above him the owls watch by night and the hawks by day around him not a prowler of the wilderness from mooween the bear down through a score of gradations to kagax the bloodthirsty little weasel but will sniff under every old log in the hope of finding a wood mouse and if he takes a swim as he is fond of doing not a big trout in the river but leaves his eddy to rush at the tiny ripple holding bravely across the current so with all these enemies waiting to catch him the moment he ventures out tookhees must needs make one or two false starts in order to find out where the coast is clear  that is why he always dodges back after his first appearance why he gives you two or three swift glimpses of himself now here now there before coming out into the light he knows his enemies are so hungry so afraid he will get away or that somebody else will catch him that they jump for him the moment he shows a whisker so eager are they for his flesh and so sure after missing him that the swoop of wings or the snap of red jaws has scared him into permanent hiding that they pass on to other trails and when a prowler watching from behind a stump sees tookhees flash out of sight and hears his startled squeak he thinks naturally that the keen little eyes have seen the tail which he forgot to curl close enough and so sneaks away as if ashamed of himself not even the fox whose patience is without end has learned the wisdom of waiting for tookhees second appearance and that is the salvation of the little fraid one  from all these enemies tookhees has one refuge the little arched nest beyond the pretty doorway under the mossy stone most of his enemies can dig to be sure but his tunnel winds about in such a way that they never can tell from the looks of his doorway where it leads to and there are no snakes in the wilderness to follow and find out occasionally i have seen where mooween the bear has turned the stone over and clawed the earth beneath but there is generally a tough root in the way and mooween concludes that he is taking too much trouble for so small a mouthful and shuffles off to the log where the red ants live  on his journeys through the woods tookhees never forgets the dangerous possibilities his progress is a series of jerks and whisks and jumps and hidings he leaves his doorway after much watching and shoots like a minnow across the moss to an upturned root there he sits up and listens rubbing his whiskers nervously then he glides along the root for a couple of feet drops to the ground and disappears he is hiding there under a dead leaf a moment of stillness and he jumps like a jackinabox now he is sitting on the leaf that covered him rubbing his whiskers again looking back over his trail as if he heard footsteps behind him then another nervous dash a squeak which proclaims at once his escape and his arrival and he vanishes under the old mossgrown log where his fellows live a whole colony of them  all these things and many more i discovered the first season that i began to study the wild things that lived within sight of my tent i had been making long excursions after bear and beaver following on wildgoose chases after old whitehead the eagle and kakagos the wild woods raven that always escaped me only to find that within the warm circle of my campfire little wild folk were hiding whose lives were more unknown and quite as interesting as the greater creatures i had been following  one day as i returned quietly to camp i saw simmo quite lost in watching something near my tent he stood beside a great birch tree one hand resting against the bark that he would claim next winter for his new canoe the other hand still grasped his axe which he had picked up a moment before to quicken the tempo of the bean kettles song his dark face peered behind the tree with a kind of childlike intensity written all over it  i stole nearer without his hearing me but i could see nothing the woods were all still killooleet was dozing by his nest the chickadees had vanished knowing that it was not meal time and meeko the red squirrel had been made to jump from the fir top to the ground so often that now he kept sullenly to his own hemlock across the island nursing his sore feet and scolding like a fury whenever i approached still simmo watched as if a bear were approaching his bait till i whispered quiee simmo what is it  nodwar kchee toquis i see little fraid one he said unconsciously dropping into his own dialect which is the softest speech in the world so soft that wild things are not disturbed when they hear it thinking it only a louder sough of the pines or a softer tunking of ripples on the rockso bah cosh see he washum face in yo lil cup and when i tiptoed to his side there was tookhees sitting on the rim of my drinking cup in which i had left a new leader to soak for the evenings fishing scrubbing his face diligently like a boy who is watched from behind to see that he slights not his ears or his neck  remembering my own boyhood on cold mornings i looked behind him to see if he also were under compulsion but there was no other mouse in sight he would scoop up a double handful of water in his paws rub it rapidly up over nose and eyes and then behind his ears on the spots that wake you up quickest when you are sleepy then another scoop of water and another vigorous rub ending behind his ears as before  simmo was full of wonder for an indian notices few things in the woods beside those that pertain to his trapping and hunting and to see a mouse wash his face was as incomprehensible to him as to see me read a book but all wood mice are very cleanly they have none of the strong odors of our house mice afterwards while getting acquainted i saw him wash many times in the plate of water that i kept filled near his den but he never washed more than his face and the sensitive spot behind his ears sometimes however when i have seen him swimming in the lake or river i have wondered whether he were going on a journey or just bathing for the love of it as he washed his face in my cup  i left the cup where it was and spread a feast for the little guest cracker crumbs and a bit of candle end in the morning they were gone the signs of several mice telling plainly who had been called in from the wilderness byways that was the introduction of man to beast soon they came regularly i had only to scatter crumbs and squeak a few times like a mouse when little streaks and flashes would appear on the moss or among the faded gold tapestries of old birch leaves and the little wild things would come to my table their eyes shining like jet their tiny paws lifted to rub their whiskers or to shield themselves from the fear under which they lived continually  they were not all alikequite the contrary one the same who had washed in my cup was gray and old and wise from much dodging of enemies his left ear was split from a fight or an owls claw probably that just missed him as he dodged under a root he was at once the shyest and boldest of the lot for a day or two he came with marvelous stealth making use of every dead leaf and root tangle to hide his approach and shooting across the open spaces so quickly that one knew not what had happenedjust a dun streak which ended in nothing and the brown leaf gave no sign of what it sheltered but once assured of his ground he came boldly this great mancreature with his face close to the table perfectly still but for his eyes with a hand that moved gently if it moved at all was not to be fearedthat tookhees felt instinctively and this strange fire with hungry odors and the white tent and the comings and goings of men who were masters of the woods kept fox and lynx and owl far awaythat he learned after a day or two only the mink who crept in at night to steal the mans fish was to be feared so tookhees presently gave up his nocturnal habits and came out boldly into the sunlight ordinarily the little creatures come out in the dusk when their quick movements are hidden among the shadows that creep and quiver but with fear gone they are only too glad to run about in the daylight especially when good things to eat are calling them  besides the veteran there was a little mothermouse whose tiny gray jacket was still big enough to cover a wonderful mother love as i afterwards found out she never ate at my table but carried her fare away into hiding not to feed her little onesthey were too small as yetbut thinking in some dumb way behind the bright little eyes that they needed her and that her life must be spared with greater precaution for their sakes she would steal timidly to my table always appearing from under a gray shred of bark on a fallen birch log following the same path first to a mossy stone then to a dark hole under a root then to a low brake and along the underside of a billet of wood to the mouse table there she would stuff both cheeks hurriedly till they bulged as if she had toothache and steal away by the same path disappearing at last under the shred of gray bark  for a long time it puzzled me to find her nest which i knew could not be far away it was not in the birch log where she disappearedthat was hollow the whole lengthnor was it anywhere beneath it some distance away was a large stone half covered by the green moss which reached up from every side the most careful search here had failed to discover any trace of tookhees doorway so one day when the wind blew half a gale and i was going out on the lake alone i picked up this stone to put in the bow of my canoe that was to steady the little craft by bringing her nose down to grip the water then the secret was out and there it was in a little dome of dried grass among some spruce roots under the stone  the mother was away foraging but a faint sibilant squeaking within the dome told me that the little ones were there and hungry as usual as i watched there was a swift movement in a tunnel among the roots and the mothermouse came rushing back she paused a moment lifting her forepaws against a root to sniff what danger threatened then she saw my face bending over the openinget tu brute and she darted into the nest in a moment she was out again and disappeared into her tunnel running swiftly with her little ones hanging to her sides by a grip that could not be shakenall but one a delicate pink creature that one could hide in a thimble and that snuggled down in the darkest corner of my hand confidently  it was ten minutes before the little mother came back looking anxiously for the lost baby when she found him safe in his own nest with the mans face still watching she was half reassured but when she threw herself down and the little one began to drink she grew fearful again and ran away into the tunnel the little one clinging to her side this time securely  i put the stone back and gathered the moss carefully about it in a few days mother mouse was again at my table i stole away to the stone put my ear close to it and heard with immense satisfaction tiny squeaks which told me that the house was again occupied then i watched to find the path by which mother mouse came to her own when her cheeks were full she disappeared under the shred of bark by her usual route that led into the hollow center of the birch log which she followed to the end where she paused a moment eyes ears and nostrils busy then she jumped to a tangle of roots and dead leaves beneath which was a tunnel that led deep down under the moss straight to her nest beneath the stone  besides these older mice there were five or six smaller ones all shy save one who from the first showed not the slightest fear but came straight to my hand ate his crumbs and went up my sleeve and proceeded to make himself a warm nest there by nibbling wool from my flannel shirt  in strong contrast to this little fellow was another who knew too well what fear meant he belonged to another tribe that had not yet grown accustomed to mans ways i learned too late how careful one must be in handling the little creatures that live continually in the land where fear reigns  a little way behind my tent was a great fallen log mouldy and mossgrown with twinflowers shaking their bells along its length under which lived a whole colony of wood mice they ate the crumbs that i placed by the log but they could never be tolled to my table whether because they had no spliteared old veteran to spy out the mans ways or because my own colony drove them away i could never find out one day i saw tookhees dive under the big log as i approached and having nothing more important to do i placed one big crumb near his entrance stretched out in the moss hid my hand in a dead brake near the tempting morsel and squeaked the call in a moment tookhees nose and eyes appeared in his doorway his whiskers twitching nervously as he smelled the candle grease but he was suspicious of the big object or perhaps he smelled the man too and was afraid for after much dodging in and out he disappeared altogether  i was wondering how long his hunger would battle with his caution when i saw the moss near my bait stir from beneath a little waving of the moss blossoms and tookhees nose and eyes appeared out of the ground for an instant sniffing in all directions his little scheme was evident enough now he was tunneling for the morsel that he dared not take openly i watched with breathless interest as a faint quiver nearer my bait showed where he was pushing his works then the moss stirred cautiously close beside his objective a hole opened the morsel tumbled in and tookhees was gone with his prize  i placed more crumbs from my pocket in the same place and presently three or four mice were nibbling them one sat up close by the dead brake holding a bit of bread in his forepaws like a squirrel the brake stirred suddenly before he could jump my hand closed over him and slipping the other hand beneath him i held him up to my face to watch him between my fingers he made no movement to escape but only trembled violently his legs seemed too weak to support his weight now he lay down his eyes closed one convulsive twitch and he was deaddead of fright in a hand which had not harmed him  it was at this colony whose members were all strangers to me that i learned in a peculiar way of the visiting habits of wood mice and at the same time another lesson that i shall not soon forget for several days i had been trying every legitimate way in vain to catch a big trout a monster of his kind that lived in an eddy behind a rock up at the inlet trout were scarce in that lake and in summer the big fish are always lazy and hard to catch i was trout hungry most of the time for the fish that i caught were small and few and far between several times however when casting from the shore at the inlet for small fish i had seen swirls in a great eddy near the farther shore which told me plainly of big fish beneath and one day when a huge trout rolled half his length out of water behind my fly small fry lost all their interest and i promised myself the joy of feeling my rod bend and tingle beneath the rush of that big trout if it took all summer  flies were no use i offered him a bookful every variety of shape and color at dawn and dusk without tempting him i tried grubs which bass like and a frogs leg which no pickerel can resist and little frogs such as big trout hunt among the lily pads in the twilightall without pleasing him and then waterbeetles and a red squirrels tailtip which makes the best hackle in the world and kicking grasshoppers and a silver spoon with a wicked gang of hooks which i detest and which i am thankful to remember the trout detested also they lay there in their big cool eddy lazily taking what food the stream brought down to them giving no heed to frauds of any kind  then i caught a redfin in the stream above hooked it securely laid it on a big chip coiled my line upon it and set it floating down stream the line uncoiling gently behind it as it went when it reached the eddy i raised my rod tip the line straightened the redfin plunged overboard and a twopound trout thinking no doubt that the little fellow had been hiding under the chip rose for him and took him in that was the only one i caught his struggle disturbed the pool and the other trout gave no heed to more redfins  then one morning at daybreak as i sat on a big rock pondering new baits and devices a stir on an alder bush across the stream caught my eye tookhees the wood mouse was there running over the bush evidently for the black catkins which still clung to the tips as i watched him he fell or jumped from his branch into the quiet water below and after circling about for a moment headed bravely across the current i could just see his nose as he swam a rippling wedge against the black water with a widening letter v trailing out behind him the current swept him downward he touched the edge of the big eddy there was a swirl a mighty plunge beneath and tookhees was gone leaving no trace but a swift circle of ripples that were swallowed up in the rings and dimples behind the rocki had found what bait the big trout wanted  hurrying back to camp i loaded a cartridge lightly with a pinch of dust shot spread some crumbs near the big log behind my tent squeaked the call a few times and sat down to wait these mice are strangers to me i told conscience who was protesting a little and the woods are full of them and i want that trout  in a moment there was a rustle in the mossy doorway and tookhees appeared he darted across the open seized a crumb in his mouth sat up on his hind legs took the crumb in his paws and began to eat i had raised the gun thinking he would dodge back a few times before giving me a shot his boldness surprised me but i did not recognize him still my eye followed along the barrels and over the sight to where tookhees sat eating his crumb my finger was pressing the triggero you big butcher said conscience think how little he is and what a big roar your gun will make arent you ashamed  but i want the trout i protested  catch him then without killing this little harmless thing said conscience sternly  but he is a stranger to me i never  he is eating your bread and salt said conscience that settled it but even as i looked at him over the gun sight tookhees finished his crumb came to my foot ran along my leg into my lap and looked into my face expectantly the grizzled coat and the split ear showed the welcome guest at my table for a week past he was visiting the stranger colony as wood mice are fond of doing and persuading them by his example that they might trust me as he did more ashamed than if i had been caught potting quail i threw away the hateful shell that had almost slain my friend and went back to camp  there i made a mouse of a bit of muskrat fur with a piece of my leather shoestring sewed on for a tail it served the purpose perfectly for within the hour i was gloating over the size and beauty of the big trout as he stretched his length on the rock beside me but i lost the fraud at the next cast leaving it with a foot of my leader in the mouth of a second trout that rolled up at it the instant it touched his eddy behind the rock  after that the wood mice were safe so far as i was concerned not a trout though he were big as a salmon would ever taste them unless they chose to go swimming of their own accord and i kept their table better supplied than before i saw much of their visiting back and forth and have understood better what those tunnels mean that one finds in the spring when the last snows are melting in a corner of the woods where the drifts lay you will often find a score of tunnels coming in from all directions to a central chamber they speak of tookhees sociable nature of his long visits with his fellows undisturbed by swoop or snap when the packed snow above has swept the summer fear away and made him safe from hawk and owl and fox and wildcat and when no open water tempts him to go swimming where skooktum the big trout lies waiting mouse hungry under his eddy   the weeks passed all too quickly as wilderness weeks do and the sad task of breaking camp lay just before us but one thing troubled methe little tookhees who knew no fear but tried to make a nest in the sleeve of my flannel shirt his simple confidence touched me more than the curious ways of all the other mice every day he came and took his crumbs not from the common table but from my hand evidently enjoying its warmth while he ate and always getting the choicest morsels but i knew that he would be the first one caught by the owl after i left for it is fear only that saves the wild things occasionally one finds animals of various kinds in which the instinct of fear is lackinga frog a young partridge a moose calfand wonders what golden age that knew no fear or what glorious vision of isaiah in which lion and lamb lie down together is here set forth i have even seen a young black duck whose natural disposition is wild as the wilderness itself that had profited nothing by his mothers alarms and her constant lessons in hiding but came bobbing up to my canoe among the sedges of a wilderness lake while his brethren crouched invisible in their coverts of bending rushes and his mother flapped wildly off splashing and quacking and trailing a wing to draw me away from the little ones  such an one is generally abandoned by its mother or else is the first to fall in the battle with the strong before she gives him up as hopeless little tookhees evidently belonged to this class so before leaving i undertook the task of teaching him fear which had evidently been too much for nature and his own mother i pinched him a few times hooting like an owl as i did soa startling process which sent the other mice diving like brown streaks to cover then i waved a branch over him like a hawks wing at the same time flipping him end over end shaking him up terribly then again when he appeared with a new light dawning in his eyes the light of fear i would set a stick to wiggling like a creeping fox among the ferns and switch him sharply with a hemlock tip it was a hard lesson but he learned it after a few days and before i finished the teaching not a mouse would come to my table no matter how persuasively i squeaked they would dart about in the twilight as of yore but the first whish of my stick sent them all back to cover on the instant  that was their stern yet practical preparation for the robber horde that would soon be prowling over my camping ground then a stealthy movement among the ferns or the sweep of a shadow among the twilight shadows would mean a very different thing from wriggling stick and waving hemlock tip snap and swoop and teeth and clawsjump for your life and find out afterwards that is the rule for a wise wood mouse so i said goodby and left them to take care of themselves in the wilderness     a wilderness byway  one day in the wilderness as my canoe was sweeping down a beautiful stretch of river i noticed a little path leading through the water grass at right angles to the streams course swinging my canoe up to it i found what seemed to be a landing place for the wood folk on their river journeyings the sedges which stood thickly all about were here bent inward making a shiny green channel from the river  on the muddy shore were many tracks of mink and muskrat and otter here a big moose had stood drinking and there a beaver had cut the grass and made a little mud pie in the middle of which was a bit of musk scenting the whole neighborhood it was done last night for the marks of his fore paws still showed plainly where he had patted his pie smooth ere he went away  but the spot was more than a landing place a path went up the bank into the woods as faint as the green waterway among the sedges tall ferns bent over to hide it rank grasses that had been softly brushed aside tried their best to look natural the alders waved their branches thickly saying there is no way here but there it was a path for the wood folk and when i followed it into the shade and silence of the woods the first mossy log that lay across it was worn smooth by the passage of many little feet  as i came back simmos canoe glided into sight and i waved him to shore the light birch swung up beside mine a deep waterdimple just under the curl of its bow and a musical ripple like the gurgle of water by a mossy stonethat was the only sound  what means this path simmo  his keen eyes took in everything at a glance the wavy waterway the tracks the faint path to the alders there was a look of surprise in his face that i had blundered onto a discovery which he had looked for many times in vain his traps on his back  das a portash he said simply  a portage but who made a portage here  well musquash he probly makeum first den beaver den hotter den everybody in hurry he makeum you see river make big bend here portash go cross save time jus same indian portash  that was the first of a dozen such paths that i have since found cutting across the bends of wilderness riversthe wood folks way of saving time on a journey i left simmo to go on down the river while i followed the little byway curiously there is nothing more fascinating in the woods than to go on the track of the wild things and see what they have been doing  but alas mine were not the first human feet that had taken the journey halfway across at a point where the path ran over a little brook i found a deadfall set squarely in the way of unwary feet it was different from any i had ever seen and was made like this drawing omitted  that tiny stick trigger the trappers call it with its end resting in air three inches above the bed log just the right height so that a beaver or an otter would naturally put his foot on it in crossing looks innocent enough but if you look sharply you will see that if it were pressed down ever so little it would instantly release the bent stick that holds the falllog and bring the deadly thing down with crushing force across the back of any animal beneath  such are the pitfalls that lie athwart the way of keeonekh the otter when he goes acourting and uses musquashs portage to shorten his journey  at the other end of the portage i waited for simmo to come round the bend and took him back to see the work denouncing the heartless carelessness of the trapper who had gone away in the spring and left an unsprung deadfall as a menace to the wild things at the first glance he pronounced it an otter trap then the fear and wonder swept into his face and the questions into mine  das noel wabys trap nobody else makeum tukpeel stick like dat he said at last  then i understood noel waby had gone up river trapping in the spring and had never come back nor any word to tell how death met him  i stooped down to examine the trap with greater interest on the underside of the falllog i found some long hairs still clinging in the crevices of the rough bark they belonged to the outer waterproof coat with which keeonekh keeps his fur dry one otter at least had been caught here and the trap reset but some sense of danger some old scent of blood or subtle warning clung to the spot and no other creature had crossed the bed log though hundreds must have passed that way since the old indian reset his trap and strode away with the dead otter across his shoulders  what was it in the air what sense of fear brooded here and whispered in the alder leaves and tinkled in the brook simmo grew uneasy and hurried away he was like the wood folk but i sat down on a great log that the spring floods had driven in through the alders to feel the meaning of the place if possible and to have the vast sweet solitude all to myself for a little while  a faint stir on my left and another then up the path twisting and gliding came keeonekh the first otter that i had ever seen in the wilderness where the sun flickered in through the alder leaves it glinted brightly on the shiny puter hairs of his rough coat as he went his nose worked constantly going far ahead of his bright little eyes to tell him what was in the path  i was sitting very still some distance to one side and he did not see me near old noels deadfall he paused an instant with raised head in the curious snakelike attitude that all the weasels take when watching then he glided round the end of the trap and disappeared down the portage  when he was gone i stole out to examine his tracks then i noticed for the first time that the old path near the deadfall was getting mossgrown a faint new path began to show among the alders some warning was there in the trap and with cunning instinct all the wood dwellers turned aside giving a wide berth to what they felt was dangerous but could not understand the new path joined the old again beyond the brook and followed it straight to the river  again i examined the deadfall carefully but of course i found nothing that is a matter of instinct not of eyes and ears and it is past finding out then i went away for good after driving a ring of stout stakes all about the trap to keep heedless little feet out of it but i left it unsprung just as it was a rude tribute of remembrance to keeonekh and the lost indian     keeonekh the fisherman  wherever you find keeonekh the otter you find three other things wildness beauty and running water that no winter can freeze there is also good fishing but that will profit you little for after keeonekh has harried a pool it is useless to cast your fly or minnow there the largest fish has disappearedyou will find his bones and a fin or two on the ice or the nearest bankand the little fish are still in hiding after their fright  conversely wherever you find the three elements mentioned you will also find keeonekh if your eyes know how to read the signs aright even in places near the towns where no otter has been seen for generations they are still to be found leading their shy wild life so familiar with every sight and sound of danger that no eye of the many that pass by ever sees them no animal has been more persistently trapped and hunted for the valuable fur that he bears but keeonekh is hard to catch and quick to learn when a family have all been caught or driven away from a favorite stream another otter speedily finds the spot in some of his winter wanderings after better fishing and knowing well from the signs that others of his race have paid the sad penalty for heedlessness he settles down there with greater watchfulness and enjoys his fishermans luck  in the spring he brings a mate to share his rich living soon a family of young otters go afishing in the best pools and explore the stream for miles up and down but so shy and wild and quick to hide are they that the trout fishermen who follow the river and the ice fishermen who set their tiltups in the pond below and the children who gather cowslips in the spring have no suspicion that the original proprietors of the stream are still on the spot jealously watching and resenting every intrusion  occasionally the wood choppers cross an unknown trail in the snow a heavy trail with long sliding downhill plunges which look as if a log had been dragged along but they too go their way wondering a bit at the queer things that live in the woods but not understanding the plain records that the queer things leave behind them did they but follow far enough they would find the end of the trail in open water and on the ice beyond the signs of keeonekhs fishing  i remember one otter family whose den i found when a boy on a stream between two ponds within three miles of the town house yet the oldest hunter could barely remember the time when the last otter had been caught or seen in the county  i was sitting very still in the bushes on the bank one day in spring watching for a wood duck wood duck lived there but the cover was so thick that i could never surprise them they always heard me coming and were off giving me only vanishing glimpses among the trees or else quietly hiding until i went by so the only way to see thema beautiful sight they werewas to sit still in hiding for hours if need be until they came gliding by all unconscious of the watcher  as i waited a large animal came swiftly up stream just his head visible with a long tail trailing behind he was swimming powerfully steadily straight as a string but as i noted with wonder he made no ripple whatever sliding through the water as if greased from nose to tail just above me he dived and i did not see him again though i watched up and down stream breathlessly for him to reappear  i had never seen such an animal before but i knew somehow that it was an otter and i drew back into better hiding with the hope of seeing the rare creature again presently another otter appeared coming up stream and disappearing in exactly the same way as the first but though i stayed all the afternoon i saw nothing more  after that i haunted the spot every time i could get away creeping down to the river bank and lying in hiding hours long at a stretch for i knew now that the otters lived there and they gave me many glimpses of a life i had never seen before  soon i found their den it was in a bank opposite my hiding place and the entrance was among the roots of a great tree under water where no one could have possibly found it if the otters had not themselves shown the way in their approach they always dived while yet well out in the stream and so entered their door unseen when they came out they were quite as careful always swimming some distance under water before coming to the surface it was several days before my eye could trace surely the faint undulation of the water above them and so follow their course to their doorway had not the water been shallow i should never have found it for they are the most wonderful of swimmers making no ripple on the surface and not half the disturbance below it that a fish of the same weight makes  those were among the happiest watching hours that i have ever spent in the woods the game was so large so utterly unexpected and i had the wonderful discovery all to myself not one of the half dozen boys and men who occasionally when the fever seized them trapped muskrat in the big meadow a mile below or the rare mink that hunted frogs in the brook had any suspicion that such splendid fur was to be had for the hunting  sometimes a whole afternoon would go slowly by filled with the sounds and sweet smells of the woods and not a ripple would break the dimples of the stream before me but when one late afternoon just as the pines across the stream began to darken against the western light a string of silver bubbles shot across the stream and a big otter rose to the surface with a pickerel in his mouth all the watching that had not well repaid itself was swept out of the reckoning he came swiftly towards me put his fore paws against the bank gave a wriggling jumpand there he was not twenty feet away holding the pickerel down with his fore paws his back arched like a frightened cat and a tiny stream of water trickling down from the tip of his heavy pointed tail as he ate his fish with immense relish  years afterward hundreds of miles away on the dungarvon in the heart of the wilderness every detail of the scene came back to me again i was standing on snowshoes looking out over the frozen river when keeonekh appeared in an open pool with a trout in his mouth he broke his way with a clattering tinkle of winter bells through the thin edge of ice put his paws against the heavy snow ice threw himself out with the same wriggling jump and ate with his back archedjust as i had seen him years before  this curious way of eating is i think characteristic of all otters certainly of those that i have been fortunate enough to see why they do it is more than i know but it must be uncomfortable for every mouthfulfull of fish bones tooto slide uphill to ones stomach perhaps it is mere habit which shows in the arched backs of all the weasel family perhaps it is to frighten any enemy that may approach unawares while keeonekh is eating just as an owl when feeding on the ground bristles up all his feathers so as to look as big as possible  but my first otter was too keenscented to remain long so near a concealed enemy suddenly he stopped eating and turned his head in my direction i could see his nostrils twitching as the wind gave him its message then he left his fish glided into the stream as noiselessly as the brook entered it below him and disappeared without leaving a single wavelet to show where he had gone down  when the young otters appeared there was one of the most interesting lessons to be seen in the woods though keeonekh loves the water and lives in it more than half the time his little ones are afraid of it as so many kittens if left to themselves they would undoubtedly go off for a hunting life following the old family instinct for fishing is an acquired habit of the otters and so the fishing instinct cannot yet be transmitted to the little ones that will take many generations meanwhile the little keeonekhs must be taught to swim  one day the motherotter appeared on the bank among the roots of the great tree under which was their secret doorway that was surprising for up to this time both otters had always approached it from the river and were never seen on the bank near their den she appeared to be digging but was immensely cautious about it looking listening sniffing continually i had never gone near the place for fear of frightening them away and it was months afterward when the den was deserted before i examined it to understand just what she was doing then i found that she had made another doorway from her den leading out to the bank she had selected the spot with wonderful cunninga hollow under a great root that would never be noticedand she dug from inside carrying the earth down to the river bottom so that there should be nothing about the tree to indicate the haunt of an animal  long afterwards when i had grown better acquainted with keeonekhs ways from much watching i understood the meaning of all this she was simply making a safe way out and in for the little ones who were afraid of the water had she taken or driven them out of her own entrance under the river they might easily have drowned ere they reached the surface  when the entrance was all ready she disappeared but i have no doubt she was just inside watching to be sure the coast was clear slowly her head and neck appeared till they showed clear of the black roots she turned her nose up streamnothing in the wind eyes and ears searched belownothing harmful there then she came out and after her toddled two little otters full of wonder at the big bright world full of fear at the river  there was no play at first only wonder and investigation caution was born in them they put their little feet down as if treading on eggs and they sniffed every bush before going behind it and the old mother noted their cunning with satisfaction while her own nose and ears watched far away  the outing was all too short some uneasiness was in the air down stream suddenly she rose from where she was lying and the little ones as if commanded tumbled back into the den in a moment she had glided after them and the bank was deserted it was fully ten minutes before my untrained cars caught faint sounds which were not of the woods coming up stream and longer than that before two men with fish poles appeared making their slow way to the pond above they passed almost over the den and disappeared all unconscious of beast or man that wished them elsewhere resenting their noisy passage through the solitudes but the otters did not come out again though i watched till nearly dark  it was a week before i saw them again and some good teaching had evidently been done in the meantime for all fear of the river was gone they toddled out as before at the same hour in the afternoon and went straight to the bank there the mother lay down and the little ones as if enjoying the frolic clambered up to her back whereupon she slid into the stream and swam slowly about with the little keeonekhs clinging to her desperately as if humptydumpty had been played on them before and might be repeated any moment  i understood their air of anxious expectation a moment later when mother otter dived like a flash from under them leaving them to make their own way in the water they began to swim naturally enough but the fear of the new element was still upon them the moment old mother otter appeared they made for her whimpering but she dived again and again or moved slowly away and so kept them swimming after a little they seemed to tire and lose courage her eyes saw it quicker than mine and she glided between them both little ones turned in at the same instant and found a resting place on her back so she brought them carefully to land again and in a few moments they were all rolling about in the dry leaves like so many puppies  i must confess here that besides the boys wonder in watching the wild things another interest brought me to the river bank and kept me studying keeonekhs ways father otter was a big fellowenormous he seemed to me thinking of my mink skinsand occasionally when his rich coat glinted in the sunshine i was thinking what a famous cap it would make for the winter woods or for coasting on moonshiny nights more often i was thinking what famous things a boy could buy for the fourteen dollars at least which his pelt would bring in the open market  the first saturday after i saw him i prepared a board ten times bigger than a minkstretcher and tapered one end to a round point and split it and made a wedge and smoothed it all down and hid it awayto stretch the big otters skin upon when i should catch him  when november came and fur was prime i carried down a halfbushel basket of heads and stuff from the fish market and piled them up temptingly on the bank above a little water path in a lonely spot by the river at the lower end of the path where it came out of the water i set a trap my biggest one with a famous grip for skunks and woodchucks but the fish rotted away as did also another basketful in another place whatever was eaten went to the crows and mink keeonekh disdained it  then i set the trap in some water to kill the smell of it on a game path among some swamp alders at a bend of the river where nobody ever came and where i had found keeonekhs tracks the next night he walked into it but the trap that was sure grip for woodchucks was a plaything for keeonekhs strength he wrenched his foot out of it leaving me only a few glistening hairswhich was all i ever caught of him  years afterward when i found old noels trap on keeonekhs portage i asked simmo why no bait had been used  no good useum bait he said keeonekh likeum fresh fish an catchum self all he want and that is true except in starvation times when even the pools are frozen or the fish die from one of their mysterious epidemics keeonekh turns up his nose at any bait if a bit of castor is put in a split stick he will turn aside like all the furbearers to see what this strange smell is but if you would toll him with a bait you must fasten a fish in the water in such a way that it seems alive as the current wiggles it else keeonekh will never think it worthy of his catching  the den in the river bank was never disturbed and the following year another litter was raised there with characteristic cunninga cunning which grows keener and keener in the neighborhood of civilizationthe motherotter filled up the land entrance among the roots with earth and driftweed using only the doorway under water until it was time for the cubs to come out into the world again  of all the creatures of the wilderness keeonekh is the most richly gifted and his ways could we but search them out would furnish a most interesting chapter every journey he takes whether by land or water is full of unknown traits and tricks but unfortunately no one ever sees him doing things and most of his ways are yet to be found out you see a head holding swiftly across a wilderness lake or coming to meet your canoe on the streams then as you follow eagerly a swirl and he is gone when he comes up again he will watch you so much more keenly than you can possibly watch him that you learn little about him except how shy he is even the trappers who make a business of catching him and with whom i have often talked know almost nothing of keeonekh except where to set their traps for him living and how to care for his skin when he is dead once i saw him fishing in a curious way it was winter on a wilderness stream flowing into the dugarvon there had been a fall of dry snow that still lay deep and powdery over all the woods too light to settle or crust at every step one had to lift a shovelful of the stuff on the point of his snowshoe and i was tired out following some caribou that wandered like plover in the rain  just below me was a deep open pool surrounded by double fringes of ice early in the winter while the stream was higher the white ice had formed thickly on the river wherever the current was not too swift for freezing then the stream fell and a shelf of new black ice formed at the waters level eighteen inches or more below the first ice some of which still clung to the banks reaching out in places two or three feet and forming dark caverns with the ice below both shelves dipped towards the water forming a gentle incline all about the edges of the open places  a string of silver bubbles shooting across the black pool at my feet roused me out of a drowsy weariness there it was again a rippling wave across the pool which rose to the surface a moment later in a hundred bubbles tinkling like tiny bells as they broke in the keen air two or three times i saw it with growing wonder then something stirred under the shelf of ice across the pool an otter slid into the water the rippling wave shot across again the bubbles broke at the surface and i knew that he was sitting under the white ice below me not twenty feet away  a whole family of otters three or four of them were fishing there at my feet in utter unconsciousness the discovery took my breath away every little while the bubbles would shoot across from my side and watching sharply i would see keeonekh slide out upon the lower shelf of ice on the other side and crouch there in the gloom with back humped against the ice above him eating his catch the fish they caught were all small evidently for after a few minutes he would throw himself flat on the ice slide down the incline into the water making no splash or disturbance as he entered and the string of bubbles would shoot across to my side again  for a full hour i watched them breathlessly marveling at their skill a small fish is nimble game to follow and catch in his own element but at every slide keeonekh did it sometimes the rippling wave would shoot all over the pool and the bubbles break in a wild tangle as the fish darted and doubled below with the otter after him but it always ended the same way keeonekh would slide out upon the ice shelf and hump his back and begin to eat almost before the last bubble had tinkled behind him  curiously enough the rule of the salmon fishermen prevailed here in the wilderness no two rods shall whip the same pool at the same time i would see an otter lying ready on the ice evidently waiting for the chase to end then as another otter slid out beside him with his fish in he would go like a flash and take his turn for a while the pool was a lively place the bubbles had no rest then the plunges grew fewer and fewer and the otters all disappeared into the ice caverns  what became of them i could not make out and i was too chilled to watch longer above and below the pool the stream was frozen for a distance then there was more open water and more fishing whether they followed along the bank under cover of the ice to other pools or simply slept where they were till hungry again i never found out certainly they had taken up their abode in an ideal spot and would not leave it willingly the open pools gave excellent fishing and the upper ice shelf protected them perfectly from all enemies  once a week later i left the caribou and came back to the spot to watch awhile but the place was deserted the black water gurgled and dimpled across the pool and slipped away silently under the lower edge of ice undisturbed by strings of silver bubbles the ice caverns were all dark and silent the mink had stolen the fish heads and there was no trace anywhere to show that it was keeonekhs banquet hall  the swimming power of an otter which was so evident there in the winter pool is one of the most remarkable things in nature all other animals and birds and even the best modeled of modern boats leave more or less wake behind them when moving through the water but keeonekh leaves no more trail than a fish this is partly because he keeps his body well submerged when swimming partly because of the strong deep even stroke that drives him forward sometimes i have wondered if the outer hairs of his coatthe waterproof covering that keeps his fur dry no matter how long he swimsare not better oiled than in other animals which might account for the lack of ripple i have seen him go down suddenly and leave absolutely no break in the surface to show where he was when sliding also plunging down a twentyfoot clay bank he enters the water with an astonishing lack of noise or disturbance of any kind  in swimming at the surface he seems to use all four feet like other animals but below the surface when chasing fish he uses only the forepaws the hind legs then stretch straight out behind and are used with the heavy tail for a great rudder by this means he turns and doubles like a flash following surely the swift dartings of frightened trout and beating them by sheer speed and nimbleness  when fishing a pool he always hunts outward from the center driving the fish towards the bank keeping himself within their circlings and so having the immense advantage of the shorter line in heading off his game the fish are seized as they crouch against the bank for protection or try to dart out past him large fish are frequently caught from behind as they lie resting in their springholes so swift and noiseless is his approach that they are seized before they become aware of danger  this swimming power of keeonekh is all the more astonishing when one remembers that he is distinctively a land animal with none of the special endowments of the seal who is his only rival as a fisherman nature undoubtedly intended him to get his living as the other members of his large family do by hunting in the woods and endowed him accordingly he is a strong runner a good climber a patient tireless hunter and his nose is keen as a brier with a little practice he could again get his living by hunting as his ancestors did if squirrels and rats and rabbits were too nimble at first there are plenty of musquash to be caught and he need not stop at a fawn or a sheep for he is enormously strong and the grip of his jaws is not to be loosened  in severe winters when fish are scarce or his pools frozen over he takes to the woods boldly and shows himself a master at hunting craft but he likes fish and likes the water and for many generations now has been simply a fisherman with many of the quiet lovable traits that belong to fishermen in general  that is one thing to give you instant sympathy for keeonekhhe is so different so far above all other members of his tribe he is very gentle by nature with no trace of the fishers ferocity or the weasels bloodthirstiness he tames easily and makes the most docile and affectionate pet of all the wood folk he never kills for the sake of killing but lives peaceably so far as he can with all creatures and he stops fishing when he has caught his dinner he is also most cleanly in his habits with no suggestion whatever of the evil odors that cling to the mink and defile the whole neighborhood of a skunk one cannot help wondering whether just going fishing has not wrought all this wonder in keeonekhs disposition if so t is a pity that all his tribe do not turn fishermen  his one enemy among the wood folk so far as i have observed is the beaver as the latter is also a peaceable animal it is difficult to account for the hostility i have heard or read somewhere that keeonekh is fond of young beaver and hunts them occasionally to vary his diet of fish but i have never found any evidence in the wilderness to show this instead i think it is simply a matter of the beavers dam and pond that causes the trouble  when the dam is built the beavers often dig a channel around either end to carry off the surplus water and so prevent their handiwork being washed away in a freshet then the beavers guard their preserve jealously driving away the wood folk that dare to cross their dam or enter their ponds especially the musquash who is apt to burrow and cause them no end of trouble but keeonekh secure in his strength holds straight through the pond minding his own business and even taking a fish or two in the deep places near the dam he delights also in running water especially in winter when lakes and streams are mostly frozen and in his journeyings he makes use of the open channels that guard the beavers work but the moment the beavers hear a splashing there or note a disturbance in the pond where keeonekh is chasing fish down they come full of wrath and there is generally a desperate fight before the affair is settled  once on a little pond i saw a fierce battle going on out in the middle and paddled hastily to find out about it two beavers and a big otter were locked in a death struggle diving plunging throwing themselves out of water and snapping at each others throats  as my canoe halted the otter gripped one of his antagonists and went under with him there was a terrible commotion below the surface for a few moments when it ended the beaver rolled up dead and keeonekh shot up under the second beaver to repeat the attack they gripped on the instant but the second beaver an enormous fellow refused to go under where he would be at a disadvantage in my eagerness i let the canoe drift almost upon them driving them wildly apart before the common danger the otter held on his way up the lake the beaver turned towards the shore where i noticed for the first time a couple of beaver houses  in this case there was no chance for intrusion on keeonekhs part he had probably been attacked when going peaceably about his business through the lake  it is barely possible however that there was an old grievance on the beavers part which they sought to square when they caught keeonekh on the lake when beavers build their houses on the lake shore without the necessity for making a dam they generally build a tunnel slanting up from the lakes bed to their den or house on the bank now keeonekh fishes under the ice in winter more than is generally supposed as he must breathe after every chase he must needs know all the airholes and dens in the whole lake no matter how much he turns and doubles in the chase after a trout he never loses his sense of direction never forgets where the breathing places are when his fish is seized he makes a bee line under the ice for the nearest place where he can breathe and eat sometimes this lands him out of breath in the beavers tunnel and the beaver must sit upstairs in his own house nursing his wrath while keeonekh eats fish in his hallway for there is not room for both at once in the tunnel and a fight there or under the ice is out of the question as the beaver eats only barkthe white inner layer of popple bark is his chief daintyhe cannot understand and cannot tolerate this barbarian who eats raw fish and leaves the bones and fins and the smell of slime in his doorway the beaver is exemplary in his neatness detesting all smells and filth and this may possibly account for some of his enmity and his savage attacks upon keeonekh when he catches him in a good place  not the least interesting of keeonekhs queer ways is his habit of sliding down hill which makes a bond of sympathy and brings him close to the boyhood memories of those who know him  i remember one pair of otters that i watched for the better part of a sunny afternoon sliding down a clay bank with endless delight the slide had been made with much care evidently on the steep side of a little promontory that jutted into the river it was very steep about twenty feet high and had been made perfectly smooth by much sliding and wettingdown an otter would appear at the top of the bank throw himself forward on his belly and shoot downward like a flash diving deep under water and reappearing some distance out from the foot of the slide and all this with marvelous stillness as if the very woods had ears and were listening to betray the shy creatures at their fun for it was fun pure and simple and fun with no end of tingle and excitement in it especially when one tried to catch the other and shot into the water at his very heels  this slide was in perfect condition and the otters were careful not to roughen it they never scrambled up over it but went round the point and climbed from the other side or else went up parallel to the slide some distance away where the ascent was easier and where there was no danger of rolling stones or sticks upon the coasting ground to spoil its smoothness  in winter the snow makes better coasting than the clay moreover it soon grows hard and icy from the freezing of the water left by the otters body and after a few days the slide is as smooth as glass then coasting is perfect and every otter old and young has his favorite slide and spends part of every pleasant day enjoying the fun  when traveling through the woods in deep snow keeonekh makes use of his sliding habit to help him along especially on down grades he runs a little way and throws himself forward on his belly sliding through the snow for several feet before he runs again so his progress is a series of slides much as one hurries along in slippery weather  i have spoken of the silver bubbles that first drew my attention to the fishing otters one day in the wilderness from the few rare opportunities that i have had to watch them i think that the bubbles are seen only after keeonekh slides swiftly into the stream the air clings to the hairs of his rough outer coat and is brushed from them as he passes through the water one who watches him thus shooting down the long slide bellybump into the black winter pool with a string of silver bubbles breaking and tinkling above him is apt to know the hunters change of heart from the touch of nature which makes us all kin thereafter he eschews trappingat least you will not find his numberthree trap at the foot of keeonekhs slide any more to turn the shy creatures happiness into tragedyand he sends a hearty goodluck after his fellowfisherman whether he meet him on the wilderness lakes or in the quiet places on the home streams where nobody ever comes     koskomenos the outcast  koskomenos the kingfisher is a kind of outcast among the birds i think they regard him as a half reptile who has not yet climbed high enough in the bird scale to deserve recognition so they let him severely alone even the goshawk hesitates before taking a swoop at him not knowing quite whether the gaudy creature is dangerous or only uncanny i saw a great hawk once drop like a bolt upon a kingfisher that hung on quivering wings rattling softly before his hole in the bank but the robber lost his nerve at the instant when he should have dropped his claws to strike he swerved aside and shot upward in a great slant to a dead spruce top where he stood watching intently till the dark beak of a brooding kingfisher reached out of the hole to receive the fish that her mate had brought her whereupon koskomenos swept away to his watchtower above the minnow pool and the hawk set his wings toward the outlet where a brood of young sheldrakes were taking their first lessons in the open water  no wonder the birds look askance at kingfisher his head is ridiculously large his feet ridiculously small he is a poem of grace in the air but he creeps like a lizard or waddles so that a duck would be ashamed of him in the rare moments when he is afoot his mouth is big enough to take in a minnow whole his tongue so small that he has no voice but only a harsh klrrrrikikik like a watchmans rattle he builds no nest but rather a den in the bank in which he lives most filthily half the day yet the other half he is a clean beautiful creature with never a suggestion of earth but only of the blue heavens above and the colorsteeped water below in his bright garments water will not wet him though he plunge a dozen times out of sight beneath the surface his clatter is harsh noisy diabolical yet his plunge into the stream with its flash of color its silver spray and its tinkle of smitten water is the most musical thing in the wilderness  as a fisherman he has no equal his fishy expressionless eye is yet the keenest that sweeps the water and his swoop puts even the fishhawk to shame for its certainty and its lightning quickness  besides all these contradictions he is solitary unknown inapproachable he has no youth no play no joy except to eat he associates with nobody not even with his own kind and when he catches a fish and beats its head against a limb till it is dead and sits with head backtilted swallowing his prey with a clattering chuckle deep down in his throat he affects you as a parrot does that swears diabolically under his breath as he scratches his head and that you would gladly shy a stone at if the owners back were turned for a sufficient moment  it is this unknown this uncanny mixture of bird and reptile that has made the kingfisher an object of superstition among all savage peoples the legends about him are legion his crested head is prized by savages above all others as a charm or fetish and even among civilized peoples his dried body may still sometimes be seen hanging to a pole in the hope that his bill will point out the quarter from which the next wind will blow  but koskomenos has another side though the world as yet has found out little about it one day in the wilderness i cheered him quite involuntarily it was late afternoon the fishing was over and i sat in my canoe watching by a grassy point to see what would happen next across the stream was a clay bank near the top of which a hole as wide as a teacup showed where a pair of kingfishers had dug their long tunnel there is nothing for them to stand on there how did they begin that hole i wondered lazily and how can they ever raise a brood with an open door like that for mink and weasel to enter here were two new problems to add to the many unsolved ones which meet you at every turn on the woodland byways  a movement under the shore stopped my wondering and the long lithe form of a hunting mink shot swiftly up stream under the hole he stopped raised himself with his fore paws against the bank twisting his head from side to side and sniffing nervously something good up there he thought and began to climb but the bank was sheer and soft he slipped back half a dozen times without rising two feet then he went down stream to a point where some roots gave him a foothold and ran lightly up till under the dark eaves that threw their shadowy roots over the clay bank there he crept cautiously along till his nose found the nest and slipped down till his fore paws rested on the threshold a long hungry sniff of the rank fishy odor that pours out of a kingfishers den a keen look all around to be sure the old birds were not returning and he vanished like a shadow  there is one brood of kingfishers the less i thought with my glasses focused on the hole but scarcely was the thought formed when a fierce rumbling clatter sounded in the bank the mink shot out a streak of red showing plainly across his brown face after him came a kingfisher clattering out a storm of invective and aiding his progress by vicious jabs at his rear he had made a miscalculation that time the old mother bird was at home waiting for him and drove her powerful beak at his evil eye the moment it appeared at the inner end of the tunnel that took the longing for young kingfisher all out of cheokhes he plunged headlong down the bank the bird swooping after him with a rattling alarm that brought another kingfisher in a twinkling the mink dived but it was useless to attempt escape in that way the keen eyes above followed his flight perfectly when he came to the surface twenty feet away both birds were over him and dropped like plummets on his head so they drove him down stream and out of sight  years afterward i solved the second problem suggested by the kingfishers den when i had the good fortune one day to watch a pair beginning their tunneling all who have ever watched the bird have no doubt noticed his wonderful ability to stop short in swift flight and hold himself poised in midair for an indefinite time while watching the movements of a minnow beneath they make use of this ability in beginning their nest on a bank so steep as to afford no foothold  as i watched the pair referred to first one then the other would hover before the point selected as a hummingbird balances for a moment at the door of a trumpet flower to be sure that no one is watching ere he goes in then drive his beak with rapid plunges into the bank sending down a continuous shower of clay to the river below when tired he rested on a watchstub while his mate made a batteringram of herself and kept up the work in a remarkably short time they had a foothold and proceeded to dig themselves in out of sight  kingfishers tunnel is so narrow that he cannot turn around in it his straight strong bill loosens the earth his tiny feet throw it out behind i would see a shower of dirt and perchance the tail of koskomenos for a brief instant then a period of waiting and another shower this kept up till the tunnel was bored perhaps two feet when they undoubtedly made a sharp turn as is their custom after that they brought most of the earth out in their beaks while one worked the other watched or fished at the minnow pool so that there was steady progress as long as i observed them  for years i had regarded koskomenos as the birds and the rest of the world regard him as a noisy halfdiabolical creature between bird and lizard whom one must pass by with suspicion but that affair with the mink changed my feelings a bit koskomenos mate might lay her eggs like a reptile but she could defend them like any bird hero so i took to watching more carefully which is the only way to get acquainted  the first thing i noticed about the birdsan observation confirmed later on many waterswas that each pair of kingfishers have their own particular pools over which they exercise unquestioned lordship there may be a dozen pairs of birds on a single stream but so far as i have been able to observe each family has a certain stretch of water on which no other kingfishers are allowed to fish they may pass up and down freely but they never stop at the minnow pools they are caught watching near them they are promptly driven out by the rightful owners  the same thing is true on the lake shores whether there is some secret understanding and partition among them or whether which is more likely their right consists in discovery or first arrival there is no means of knowing  a curious thing in this connection is that while a kingfisher will allow none of his kind to poach on his preserves he lives at peace with the brood of sheldrakes that occupy the same stretch of river and the sheldrake eats a dozen fish to his one the same thing is noticeable among the sheldrakes also namely that each pair or rather each mother and her brood have their own piece of lake or river on which no others are allowed to fish the male sheldrakes meanwhile are far away fishing on their own waters  i had not half settled this matter of the division of trout streams when another observation came which was utterly unexpected koskomenos half reptile though he seem not only recognizes riparian rights but he is also capable of friendshipand that too for a moody prowler of the wilderness whom no one else cares anything about here is the proof  i was out in my canoe alone looking for a loons nest one midsummer day when the fresh trail of a bull caribou drew me to shore the trail led straight from the water to a broad alder belt beyond which on the hillside i might find the big brute loafing his time away till evening should come and watch him to see what he would do with himself  as i turned shoreward a kingfisher sounded his rattle and came darting across the mouth of the bay where hukweem the loon had hidden her two eggs i watched him admiring the rippling sweep of his flight like the run of a catspaw breeze across a sleeping lake and the clear blue of his crest against the deeper blue of summer sky under him his reflection rippled along like the rush of a gorgeous fish through the glassy water opposite my canoe he checked himself poised an instant in midair watching the minnows that my paddle had disturbed and dropped bill firstplash with a silvery tinkle in the sound as if hidden bells down among the green water weeds had been set to ringing by this sprite of the air a shower of spray caught the rainbow for a brief instant the ripples gathered and began to dance over the spot where koskomenos had gone down when they were scattered rudely again as he burst out among them with his fish he swept back to the stub whence he had come chuckling on the way there he whacked his fish soundly on the wood threw his head back and through the glass i saw the tail of a minnow wriggling slowly down the road that has for him no turning then i took up the caribou trail  i had gone nearly through the alders following the course of a little brook and stealing along without a sound when behind me i heard the kingfisher coming above the alders rattling as if possessed klrrr klrrr klrrrikikik on the instant there was a heavy plunge and splash just ahead and the swift rush of some large animal up the hillside over me poised the kingfisher looking down first at me then ahead at the unknown beast till the crashing ceased in a faint rustle far away when he swept back to his fishingstub clacking and chuckling immoderately  i pushed cautiously ahead and came presently to a beautiful pool below a rock where the hillside shelved gently towards the alders from the numerous tracks and the look of the place i knew instantly that i had stumbled upon a bears bathing pool the water was still troubled and muddy huge tracks all soppy and broken led up the hillside in big jumps the moss was torn the underbrush spattered with shining water drops no room for doubt here i thought mooween was asleep in this pool and the kingfisher woke him upbut why and did he do it on purpose  i remembered suddenly a record in an old notebook which reads sugarloaf lake 26 julytried to stalk a bear this noon no luck he was nosing alongshore and i had a perfect chance but a kingfisher scared him i began to wonder how the rattle of a kingfisher which is one of the commonest sounds on wilderness waters could scare a bear who knows all the sounds of the wilderness perfectly perhaps koskomenos has an alarm note and uses it for a friend in time of need as gulls go out of their way to alarm a flock of sleeping ducks when danger is approaching  here was a new trait a touch of the human in this unknown clattering suspect of the fishing streams i resolved to watch him with keener interest  somewhere above me deep in the tangle of the summer wilderness mooween stood watching his back track eyes ears and nose alert to discover what the creature was who dared frighten him out of his noonday bath it would be senseless to attempt to surprise him now besides i had no weapon of any kindtomorrow about this time i shall be coming back then look out mooween i thought as i marked the place and stole away to my canoe  but the next day when i came to the place creeping along the upper edge of the alders so as to make no noise the pool was clear and quiet as if nothing but the little trout that hid under the foam bubbles had ever disturbed its peace koskomenos was clattering about the bay below as usual spite of my precaution he had seen me enter the alders but he gave me no attention whatever he went on with his fishing as if he knew perfectly that the bear had deserted his bathing pool  it was nearly a month before i again camped on the beautiful lake summer was gone all her warmth and more than her fragrant beauty still lingered on forest and river but the drowsiness had gone from the atmosphere and the haze had crept into it here and there birches and maples flung out their gorgeous banners of autumn over the silent water a tingle came into the evening air the lakes breath lay heavy and white in the twilight stillness birds and beasts became suddenly changed as they entered the brief period of sport and of full feeding  i was drifting about a reedy bay the same bay in which the almost forgotten kingfisher had cheated me out of my bear after eating a minnow that my paddle had routed out for him shooting frogs for my table with a pocket rifle how different it was here i reflected from the woods about home there the game was already harried the report of a gun set every living creature skulking here the crack of my little rifle was no more heeded than the plunge of a fishhawk or the groaning of a burdened elm bough a score of fat woodcock lay unheeding in that bit of alder tangle yonder the ground bored like a colander after their nights feeding up on the burned hillside the partridges said quit quit when i appeared and jumped to a tree and craned their necks to see what i was the black ducks skulked in the reeds they were fullgrown now and strong of wing but the early hiding habit was not yet broken up by shooting they would glide through the sedges and double the bogs and crouch in a tangle till the canoe was almost upon them when with a rush and a frightened harkark they shot into the air and away to the river the mink changing from brown to black gave up his nestrobbing for honest hunting undismayed by trap or deadfall and up in the inlet i could see grassy domes rising above the bronze and gold of the marsh where musquash was building thick and high for winter cold and spring floods truly it was good to be here and to enter for a brief hour into the shy wild but unharried life of the wood folk  a big bullfrog showed his head among the lily pads and the little rifle unmindful of the joys of an unharried existence rose slowly to its place my eye was glancing along the sights when a sudden movement in the alders on the shore above and beyond the unconscious head of chigwooltz the frog spared him for a little season to his lily pads and his minnow hunting at the same moment a kingfisher went rattling by to his old perch over the minnow pool the alders swayed again as if struck a huge bear lumbered out of them to the shore with a disgruntled woof at some twig that had switched his ear too sharply  i slid lower in the canoe till only my head and shoulders were visible mooween went nosing alongshore till somethinga dead fish or a mussel bedtouched his appetite when he stopped and began feeding scarcely two hundred yards away i reached first for my heavy rifle then for the paddle and cautiously fanned the canoe towards shore till an old stump on the point covered my approach then the little bark jumped forward as if alive but i had scarcely started whenklrrrr klrrr ikikik over my head swept koskomenos with a rush of wings and an alarm cry that spoke only of haste and danger i had a glimpse of the bear as he shot into the alders as if thrown by a catapult the kingfisher wheeled in a great rattling circle about the canoe before he pitched upon the old stump jerking his tail and clattering in great excitement  i swung noiselessly out into the lake where i could watch the alders they were all still for a space of ten minutes but mooween was there i knew sniffing and listening then a great snake seemed to be wriggling through the bushes making no sound but showing a wavy line of quivering tops as he went  down the shore a little way was a higher point with a fallen tree that commanded a view of half the lake i had stood there a few days before while watching to determine the air paths and lines of flight that sheldrakes use in passing up and down the lakefor birds have runways or rather flyways just as foxes do mooween evidently knew the spot the alders showed that he was heading straight for it to look out on the lake and see what the alarm was about as yet he had no idea what peril had threatened him though like all wild creatures he had obeyed the first clang of a danger note on the instant not a creature in the woods from mooween down to tookhees the wood mouse but has learned from experience that in matters of this kind it is well to jump to cover first and investigate afterwards  i paddled swiftly to the point landed and crept to a rock from which i could just see the fallen tree mooween was coming my bear this time i thought as a twig snapped faintly then koskomenos swept into the woods hovering over the brush near the butt of the old tree looking down and rattlingklrrrik clear out klrrrik clear out there was a heavy rush such as a bear always makes when alarmed koskomenos swept back to his perch and i sought the shore half inclined to make my next hunting more evenchanced by disposing of one meddlesome factor you wretched noisy clattering meddler i muttered the front sight of my rifle resting fair on the blue back of koskomenos that is the third time you have spoiled my shot and you wont have another chancebut wait who is the meddler here  slowly the bent finger relaxed on the trigger a loon went floating by the point all unconscious of danger with a rippling wake that sent silver reflections glinting across the lakes deep blue far overhead soared an eagle breezeborne in wide circles looking down on his own wide domain unheeding the mans intrusion nearer a red squirrel barked down his resentment from a giant spruce trunk down on my left a heavy splash and a wild free tumult of quacking told where the black ducks were coming in as they had done undisturbed for generations behind me a long roll echoed through the woodssome young cock partridge whom the warm sun had beguiled into drumming his spring lovecall from the mountain side a cow moose rolled back a startling answer close at hand yet seeming miles away a chipmunk was chunking sleepily in the sunshine while a nest of young wood mice were calling their mother in the grass at my feet and every wild sound did but deepen the vast wondrous silence of the wilderness  after all what place has the roar of a rifle or the smell of sulphurous powder in the midst of all this blessed peace i asked half sadly as if in answer the kingfisher dropped with his musical plash and swept back with exultant rattle to his watchtowergo on with your clatter and your fishing the wilderness and the solitary place shall still be glad for you and mooween and the trout pools would be lonely without you but i wish you knew that your life lay a moment ago in the bend of my finger and that some one besides the bear appreciates your brave warning  then i went back to the point to measure the tracks and to estimate how big the bear was and to console myself with the thought of how i would certainly have had him if something had not interferedwhich is the philosophy of all hunters since esau  it was a few days later that the chance came of repaying koskomenos with coals of fire the lake surface was still warm no storms nor frosts had cooled it the big trout had risen from the deep places but were not yet quickened enough to take my flies so trout hungry i had gone trolling for them with a minnow i had taken two good fish and was moving slowly by the mouth of the bay simmo at the paddle when a suspicious movement on the shore attracted my attention i passed the line to simmo the better to use my glasses and was scanning the alders sharply when a cry of wonder came from the indian o bah cosh see das second time i catchum koskomenos and there twenty feet above the lake a young kingfisherone of koskomenos frowzyheaded wildeyedyoungsterswas whirling wildly at the end of my line he had seen the minnow trailing a hundred feet astern and with more hunger than discretion had swooped for it promptly simmo feeling the tug but seeing nothing behind him had struck promptly and the hook went home  i seized the line and began to pull in gently the young kingfisher came most unwillingly with a continuous clatter of protest that speedily brought koskomenos and his mate and two or three of the captives brethren in a wild clamoring about the canoe they showed no lack of courage but swooped again and again at the line and even at the man who held it in a moment i had the youngster in my hand and had disengaged the hook he was not hurt at all but terribly frightened so i held him a little while enjoying the excitement of the others whom the captives alarm rattle kept circling wildly about the canoe it was noteworthy that not another bird heeded the cry or came near even in distress they refused to recognize the outcast then as koskomenos hovered on quivering wings just over my head i tossed the captive close up beside him there koskomenos take your young chucklehead and teach him better wisdom next time you see me stalking a bear please go on with your fishing  but there was no note of gratitude in the noisy babel that swept up the bay after the kingfishers when i saw them again they were sitting on a dead branch five of them in a row chuckling and clattering all at once unmindful of the minnows that played beneath them i have no doubt that in their own way they were telling each other all about it     meeko the mischiefmaker  there is a curious indian legend about meeko the red squirrelthe mischiefmaker as the milicetes call himwhich is also an excellent commentary upon his character simmo told it to me one day when we had caught meeko coming out of a woodpeckers hole with the last of a brood of fledgelings in his mouth chuckling to himself over his hunting  long ago in the days when clote scarpe ruled the animals meeko was much larger than he is now large as mooween the bear but his temper was so fierce and his disposition so altogether bad that all the wood folk were threatened with destruction meeko killed right and left with the temper of a weasel who kills from pure lust of blood so clote scarpe to save the little woodspeople made meeko smallersmall as he is now unfortunately clote scarpe forgot meekos disposition that remained as big and as bad as before so now meeko goes about the woods with a small body and a big temper barking scolding quarreling and since he cannot destroy in his rage as before setting other animals by the ears to destroy each other  when you have listened to meekos scolding for a season and have seen him going from nest to nest after innocent fledgelings or creeping into the den of his big cousin the beautiful gray squirrel to kill the young or driving away his little cousin the chipmunk to steal his hoarded nuts or watching every fight that goes on in the woods jeering and chuckling above itthen you begin to understand the indian legend  spite of his evil ways however he is interesting and always unexpected when you have watched the red squirrel that lives near your camp all summer and think you know all about him he does the queerest thing good or bad to upset all your theories and even the indian legends about him  i remember one that greeted me the first living thing in the great woods as i ran my canoe ashore on a wilderness river meeko heard me coming his bark sounded loudly in a big spruce above the dip of the paddles as we turned shoreward he ran down the tree in which he was and out on a fallen log to meet us i grasped a branch of the old log to steady the canoe and watched him curiously he had never seen a man before he barked jeered scolded jerked his tail whistled did everything within his power to make me show my teeth and my disposition  suddenly he grew excitedand when meeko grows excited the woods are not big enough to hold him he came nearer and nearer to my canoe till he leaped upon the gunwale and sat there chattering as if he were adjidaumo come back again and i were hiawatha all the while he had poured out a torrent of squirrel talk but now his note changed jeering and scolding and curiosity went out of it something else crept in i began to feel somehow that he was trying to make me understand something and found me very stupid about it  i began to talk quietly calling him a rattlehead and a disturber of the peace at the first sound of my voice he listened with intense curiosity then leaped to the log ran the length of it jumped down and began to dig furiously among the moss and dead leaves every moment or two he would stop and jump to the log to see if i were watching him  presently he ran to my canoe sprang upon the gunwale jumped back again and ran along the log as before to where he had been digging he did it again looking back at me and saying plainly come here come and look i stepped out of the canoe to the old log whereupon meeko went off into a fit of terrible excitementi was bigger than he expected i had only two legs kutekchuck kutekchuck whit whit whit kutekchuck  i stood where i was until he got over his excitement then he came towards me and led me along the log with much chuckling and jabbering to the hole in the leaves where he had been digging when i bent over it he sprang to a spruce trunk on a level with my head fairly bursting with excitement but watching me with intensest interest in the hole i found a small lizard one of the rare kind that lives under logs and loves the dusk he had been bitten through the back and disabled he could still use legs tail and head feebly but could not run away when i picked him up and held him in my hand meeko came closer with loudvoiced curiosity longing to leap to my hand and claim his own but held back by fearwhat is it hes mine i found him what is it he barked jumping about as if bewitched two curiosities the lizard and the man were almost too much for him i never saw a squirrel more excited he had evidently found the lizard by accident bit him to keep him still and then astonished by the rare find hid him away where he could dig him out and watch him at leisure  i put the lizard back into the hole and covered him with leaves then went to unloading my canoe meeko watched me closely and the moment i was gone he dug away the leaves took his treasure out watched it with wide bright eyes bit it once more to keep it still and covered it up again carefully then he came chuckling along to where i was putting up my tent  in a week he owned the camp coming and going at his own will stealing my provisions when i forgot to feed him and scolding me roundly at every irregular occurrence he was an early riser and insisted on my conforming to the custom every morning he would leap at daylight from a fir tip to my ridgepole run it along to the front and sit there barking and whistling until i put my head out of my door or until simmo came along with his axe of simmo and his axe meeko had a mortal dread which i could not understand till one day when i paddled silently back to camp and instead of coming up the path sat idly in my canoe watching the indian who had broken his one pipe and now sat making another out of a chunk of black alder and a length of nanny bush simmo was as interesting to watch in his way as any of the wood folk  presently meeko came down chattering his curiosity at seeing the indian so still and so occupied a red squirrel is always unhappy unless he knows all about everything he watched from the nearest tree for a while but could not make up his mind what was doing then he came down on the ground and advanced a foot at a time jumping up continually but coming down in the same spot barking to make simmo turn his head and show his hand simmo watched out of the corner of his eye until meeko was near a solitary tree which stood in the middle of the camp ground when he jumped up suddenly and rushed at the squirrel who sprang to the tree and ran to a branch out of reach snickering and jeering  simmo took his axe deliberately and swung it mightily at the foot of the tree as if to chop it down only he hit the trunk with the head not the blade of his weapon at the first blow which made his toes tingle meeko stopped jeering and ran higher simmo swung again and meeko went up another notch so it went on simmo looking up intently to see the effect and meeko running higher after each blow until the tiptop was reached then simmo gave a mighty whack the squirrel leaped far out and came to the ground sixty feet below picked himself up none the worse for his leap and rushed scolding away to his nest then simmo said umpfh like a bear and went back to his pipemaking he had not smiled nor relaxed the intent expression of his face during the whole little comedy  i found out afterwards that making meeko jump from a tree top is one of the few diversions of indian children i tried it myself many times with many squirrels and found to my astonishment that a jump from any height however great is no concern to a squirrel red or gray they have a way of flattening the body and bushy tail against the air which breaks their fall their bodies and especially their bushy tails have a curious tremulous motion like the quiver of wings as they come down the flying squirrels sailing down from a tree top to another tree fifty feet away is but an exaggeration due to the membrane connecting the fore and hind legs of what all squirrels practice continually i have seen a red squirrel land lightly after jumping from an enormous height and run away as if nothing unusual had happened but though i have watched them often i have never seen a squirrel do this except when compelled to do so when chased by a weasel or a marten or when the axe beats against the trunk beloweither because the vibration hurts their feet or else they fear the tree is being cut downthey use the strange gift to save their lives but i fancy it is a breathless experience and they never try it for fun though i have seen them do all sorts of risky stumps in leaping from branch to branch  it is a curious fact that though a squirrel leaps from a great height without hesitation it is practically impossible to make him take a jump of a few feet to the ground probably the upward rush of air caused by falling a long distance is necessary to flatten the body enough to make him land lightly   it would be interesting to know whether the raccoon also a large heavy animal has the same way of breaking his fall when he jumps from a height one bright moonlight night when i ran ahead of the dogs i saw a big coon leap from a tree to the ground a distance of some thirty or forty feet the dogs had treed him in an evergreen and he left them howling below while he stole silently from branch to branch until a good distance away when to save time he leaped to the ground he struck with a heavy thump but ran on uninjured as swiftly as before and gave the dogs a long run before they treed him again  the sole of a coons foot is padded thick with fat and gristle so that it must feel like landing on springs when he jumps but i suspect that he also knows the squirrel trick of flattening his body and tail against the air so as to fall lightly  the chipmunk seems to be the only one of the squirrel family in whom this gift is wanting possibly he has it also if the need ever comes i fancy however that he would fare badly if compelled to jump from a spruce top for his body is heavy and his tail small from long living on the ground all of which seems to indicate that the treesquirrels bushy tail is given him not for ornament but to aid his passage from branch to branch and to break his fall when he comes down from a height  by way of contrast with meeko you may try a curious trick on the chipmunk it is not easy to get him into a tree he prefers a log or an old wall when frightened and he is seldom more than two or three jumps from his den but watch him as he goes from his garner to the grove where the acorns are or to the field where his winter corn is ripening put yourself near his path he always follows the same one to and fro where there is no refuge close at hand then as he comes along rush at him suddenly and he will take to the nearest tree in his alarm when he recovers from his frightwhich is soon over for he is the most trustful of squirrels and looks down at you with interest never questioning your motivestake a stick and begin to tap the tree softly the more slow and rhythmical your tattoo the sooner he is charmed presently he comes down closer and closer his eyes filled with strange wonder more than once i have had a chipmunk come to my hand and rest upon it looking everywhere for the queer sound that brought him down forgetting fright and cornfield and coming winter in his bright curiosity  meeko is a bird of another color he never trusts you nor anybody else fully and his curiosity is generally of the vulgar selfish kind when the autumn woods are busy places and wings flutter and little feet go pattering everywhere after winter supplies he also begins garnering remembering the hungry days of last winter but he is always more curious to see what others are doing than to fill his own bins he seldom trusts to one storehousehe is too suspicious for thatbut hides his things in twenty different places some shagbarks in the old wall a handful of acorns in a hollow tree an ear of corn under the eaves of the old barn a pint of chestnuts scattered about in the trees some in crevices in the bark some in a pine crotch covered carefully with needles and one or two stuck firmly into the splinters of every broken branch that is not too conspicuous but he never gathers much at a time the moment he sees anybody else gathering he forgets his own work and goes spying to see where others are hiding their store the little chipmunk who knows his thieving and his devices always makes one turn at least in the tunnel to his den too small for meeko to follow  he sees a blue jay flitting through the woods and knows by his unusual silence that he is hiding things meeko follows after him stopping all his jabber and stealing from tree to tree watching patiently for hours it need be until he knows that deedeeaskh is gathering corn from a certain field then he watches the line of flight like a bee hunter and sees deedeeaskh disappear twice by an oak on the woods edge a hundred yards away meeko rushes away at a headlong pace and hides himself in the oak there he traces the jays line of flight a little farther into the woods sees the unconscious thief disappear by an old pine meeko hides in the pine and so traces the jay straight to one of his storehouses  sometimes meeko is so elated over the discovery that with all the fields laden with food he cannot wait for winter when the jay goes away meeko falls to eating or to carrying away his store more often he marks the spot and goes away silently when he is hungry he will carry off deedeeaskhs corn before touching his own  once i saw the tables turned in a most interesting fashion deedeeaskh is as big a thief in his way as is meeko and also as vile a nestrobber the red squirrel had found a hoard of chestnutssmall fruit but sweet and goodand was hiding it away part of it he stored in a hollow under the stub of a broken branch twenty feet from the ground so near the source of supply that no one would ever think of looking for it there i was hidden away in a thicket when i discovered him at his work quite by accident he seldom came twice to the same spot but went off to his other storehouses in succession after an unusually long absence when i was expecting him every moment a blue jay came stealing into the tree spying and sneaking about as if a nest of fresh thrushs eggs were somewhere near he smelled a mouse evidently for after a moments spying he hid himself away in the tree top close up against the trunk presently meeko came back with his face bulging as if he had toothache uncovered his store emptied in the half dozen chestnuts from his cheek pockets and covered them all up again  the moment he was gone the blue jay went straight to the spot seized a mouthful of nuts and flew swiftly away he made three trips before the squirrel came back meeko in his hurry never noticed the loss but emptied his pockets and was off to the chestnut tree again when he returned the jay in his eagerness had disturbed the leaves which covered the hidden store meeko noticed it and was all suspicion in an instant he whipped off the covering and stood staring down intently into the garner evidently trying to compute the number he had brought and the number that were there then a terrible scolding began a scolding that was broken short off when a distant screaming of jays came floating through the woods meeko covered his store hurriedly ran along a limb and leaped to the next tree where he hid in a knot hole just his eyes visible watching his garner keenly out of the darkness  meeko has no patience three or four times he showed himself nervously fortunately for me the jay had found some excitement to keep his rattlebrain busy for a moment a flash of blue and he came stealing back just as meeko had settled himself for more watching after much pecking and listening the jay flew down to the storehouse and meeko unable to contain himself a moment longer at sight of the thief jumped out of his hiding and came rushing along the limb hurling threats and vituperation ahead of him the jay fluttered off screaming derision meeko followed hurling more abuse but soon gave up the chase and came back to his chestnuts it was curious to watch him there sitting motionless and intent his nose close down to his treasure trying to compute his loss then he stuffed his cheeks full and began carrying his hoard off to another hiding place  the autumn woods are full of such little comedies jays crows and squirrels are all hiding away winters supplies and no matter how great the abundance not one of them can resist the temptation to steal or to break into anothers garner  meeko is a poor provider he would much rather live on buds and bark and apple seeds and fir cones and what he can steal from others in the winter than bother himself with laying up supplies of his own when the spring comes he goes ahunting and is for a season the most villainous of nestrobbers every bird in the woods then hates him takes a jab at him and cries thief thief wherever he goes  on a trout brook once i had a curious sense of comradeship with meeko it was in the early spring when all the wild things make holiday and man goes afishing near the brook a red squirrel had tapped a maple tree with his teeth and was tasting the sweet sap as it came up scantily seeing him and remembering my own boyhood i cut a little hollow into the bark of a black birch tree and when it brimmed full drank the sap with immense satisfaction meeko stopped his own drinking to watch then to scold and denounce me roundly  while my cup was filling again i went down to the brook and took a wary old trout from his den under the end of a log where the foam bubbles were dancing merrily when i went back thirsting for another sweet draught from the same spring meeko had emptied it to the last drop and had his nose down in the bottom of my cup catching the sap as it welled up with an abundance that must have surprised him when i went away quietly he followed me through the wood to the pool at the edge of the meadow to see what i would do next  wherever you go in the wilderness you find meeko ahead of you and all the best camping grounds preempted by him even on the islands he seems to own the prettiest spots and disputes mightily your right to stay there though he is generally glad enough of your company to share his loneliness and shows it plainly  once i found one living all by himself on an island in the middle of a wilderness lake with no company whatever except a family of mink who are his enemies he had probably crossed on the ice in the late spring and while he was busy here and there with his explorations the ice broke up cutting off his retreat to the mainland which was too far away for his swimming so he was a prisoner for the long summer and welcomed me gladly to share his exile he was the only red squirrel i ever met that never scolded me roundly at least once a day his loneliness had made him quite tame most of the time he lived within sight of my tent door not even simmos axe though it made him jump twice from the top of a spruce could keep him long away he had twenty ways of getting up an excitement and whenever he barked out in the woods i knew that it was simply to call me to see his discoverya new nest a loon that swam up close a thieving muskrat a hawk that rested on a dead stub the mink family eating my fish headsand when i stole out to see what it was he would run ahead barking and chuckling at having some one to share his interests with him  in such places squirrels use the ice for occasional journeys to the mainland sometimes also when the waters are calm they swim over hunters have told me that when the breeze is fair they make use of a floating bit of wood sitting tip straight with tail curled over their backs making a sail of their bodiesjust as an indian with no knowledge of sailing whatever puts a spruce bush in a bow of his canoe and lets the wind do his work for him  that would be the sight of a lifetime to see meeko sailing his boat but i have no doubt whatever that it is true the only red squirrel that i ever saw in the water fell in by accident he swam rapidly to a floating board shook himself sat up with his tail raised along his back and began to dry himself after a little he saw that the slight breeze was setting him farther from shore he began to chatter excitedly and changed his position two or three times evidently trying to catch the wind right finding that it was of no use he plunged in again and swam easily to land  that he lives and thrives in the wilderness spite of enemies and hunger and winter cold is a tribute to his wits he never hibernates except in severe storms when for a few days he lies close in his den hawks and owls and weasels and martens hunt him continually yet he more than holds his own in the big woods which would lose some of their charm if their vast silences were not sometimes broken by his petty scoldings  as with most wild creatures the squirrels that live in touch with civilization are much keener witted than their wilderness brethren the most interesting one i ever knew lived in the trees just outside my dormitory window in a new england college town he was the patriarch of a large family and the greatest thief and rascal among them i speak of the family but so far as i could see there was very little family life each one shifted for himself the moment he was big enough and stole from all the others indiscriminately  it was while watching these squirrels that i discovered first that they have regular paths among the trees as well defined as our own highways not only has each squirrel his own private paths and ways but all the squirrels follow certain courses along the branches in going from one tree to another even the strange squirrels which ventured at times into the grove followed these highways as if they had been used to them all their lives  on a recent visit to the old dormitory i watched the squirrels for a while and found that they used exactly the same pathsup the trunk of a big oak to a certain boss along a branch to a certain crook a jump to a linden twig and so on making use of one of the highways that i had watched them following ten years before yet this course was not the shortest between two points and there were a hundred other branches that they might have used  i had the good fortune one morning to see meeko the patriarch make a new path for himself that none of the others ever followed so long as i was in the dormitory he had a home den over a hallway and a hiding place for acorns in a hollow linden between the two was a driveway but though the branches arched over it from either side the jump was too great for him to take a hundred times i saw him run out on the farthest oak twig and look across longingly at the maple that swayed on the other side it was perhaps three feet away with no branches beneath to seize and break his fall in case he missed his spring altogether too much for a red squirrel to attempt he would rush out as if determined to try it time after time but always his courage failed him he had to go down the oak trunk and cross the driveway on the ground where numberless straying dogs were always ready to chase him  one morning i saw him run twice in succession at the jump only to turn back but the air was keen and bracing and he felt its inspiration he drew farther back then came rushing along the oak branch and before he had time to be afraid hurled himself across the chasm he landed fairly on the maple twig with several inches to spare and hung there with claws and teeth swaying up and down gloriously then chattering his delight at himself he ran down the maple back across the driveway and tried the jump three times in succession to be sure he could do it  after that he sprang across frequently but i noticed that whenever the branches were wet with rain or sleet he never attempted it and he never tried the return jump which was uphill and which he seemed to know by instinct was too much to attempt  when i began feeding him in the cold winter days he showed me many curious bits of his life first i put some nuts near the top of an old well among the stones of which he used to hide things in the autumn long after he had eaten all his store he used to come and search the crannies among the stones to see if perchance he had overlooked any trifles when he found a handful of shagbarks one morning in a hole only a foot below the surface his astonishment knew no bounds his first thought was that he had forgotten them all these hungry days and he promptly ate the biggest of the store within sight a thing i never saw a squirrel do before his second thoughti could see it in his changed attitude his sudden creepings and hidingswas that some other squirrel had hidden them there since his last visit whereupon he carried them all off and hid them in a broken linden branch  then i tossed him peanuts throwing them first far away then nearer and nearer till he would come to my windowsill and when i woke one morning he was sitting there looking in at the window waiting for me to get up and bring his breakfast  in a week he had showed me all his hiding places the most interesting of these was over a roofed piazza in a building near by he had gnawed a hole under the eaves where it would not be noticed and lived there in solitary grandeur during stormy days in a den four by eight feet and rainproof in one corner was a bushel of corncobs some of them two or three years old which he had stolen from a cornfield near by in the early autumn mornings with characteristic improvidence he had fallen to eating the corn while yet there was plenty more to be gathered in consequence he was hungry before february was half over and living by his wits like his brother of the wilderness  the other squirrels soon noticed his journeys to my window and presently they too came for their share spite of his fury in driving them away they managed in twenty ways to circumvent him it was most interesting while he sat on my windowsill eating peanuts to see the nose and eyes of another squirrel peering over the crotch of the nearest tree watching the proceedings from his hiding place then i would give meeko five or six peanuts at once instantly the old hiding instinct would come back he would start away taking as much of his store as he could carry with him the moment he was gone out would come a squirrelsometimes two or three from their concealmentand carry off all the peanuts that remained  meekos wrath when he returned was most comical the indian legend is true as gospel to squirrel nature if he returned unexpectedly and caught one of the intruders there was always a furious chase and a deal of scolding and squirrel jabber before peace was restored and the peanuts eaten  once when he had hidden a dozen or more nuts in the broken linden branch a very small squirrel came prowling along and discovered the store in an instant he was all alertness peeking listening exploring till quite sure that the coast was clear when he rushed away headlong with a mouthful  he did not return that day but the next morning early i saw him do the same thing an hour later meeko appeared and finding nothing on the windowsill went to the linden half his store of yesterday was gone curiously enough he did not suspect at first that they were stolen meeko is always quite sure that nobody knows his secrets he searched the tree over went to his other hiding places came back counted his peanuts then searched the ground beneath thinking no doubt the wind must have blown them outall this before he had tasted a peanut of those that remained  slowly it dawned upon him that he had been robbed and there was an outburst of wrath but instead of carrying what were left to another place he left them where they were still without eating and hid himself near by to watch i neglected a lecture in philosophy to see the proceedings but nothing happened meekos patience soon gave out or else he grew hungry for he ate two or three of his scanty supply of peanuts scolding and threatening to himself but he left the rest carefully where they were  two or three times that day i saw him sneaking about keeping a sharp eye on the linden but the little thief was watching too and kept out of the way  early next morning a great hubbub rose outside my window and i jumped up to see what was going on little thief had come back and big thief caught him in the act of robbery away they went pellmell jabbering like a flock of blackbirds along a linden branch through two maples across a driveway and up a big elm where little thief whisked out of sight into a knot hole  after him came big thief swearing vengeance but the knot hole was too small he couldnt get in twist and turn and push and threaten as he would he could not get in and little thief sat just inside jeering maliciously  meeko gave it up after a while and went off nursing his wrath but ten feet from the tree a thought struck him he rushed away out of sight making a great noise then came back quietly and hid under an eave where he could watch the knot hole  presently little thief came out rubbed his eyes and looked all about through my glass i could see meeko blinking and twitching under the dark eave trying to control his anger little thief ventured to a branch a few feet away from his refuge and big thief unable to hold himself a moment longer rushed out firing a volley of direful threats ahead of him in a flash little thief was back in his knot hole and the comedy began all over again  i never saw how it ended but for a day or two there was an unusual amount of chasing and scolding going on outside my windows  it was this same big squirrel that first showed me a curious trick of biding whenever he found a handful of nuts on my windowsill and suspected that other squirrels were watching to share the bounty he had a way of hiding them all very rapidly he would never carry them direct to his various garners first because these were too far away and the other squirrels would steal while he was gone second because with hungry eyes watching somewhere they might follow and find out where he habitually kept things so he used to bide them all on the ground under the leaves in autumn under snow in winter and all within sight of the windowsill where he could watch the store as he hurried to and fro then at his leisure he would dig them up and carry them off to his den two cheekfuls at a time  each nut was hidden by itself never so much as two in one spot for a long time it puzzled me to know how he remembered so many places i noticed first that he would always start from a certain point a tree or a stone with his burden when it was hidden he would come back by the shortest route to the windowsill but with his new mouthful he would always go first to the tree or stone he had selected and from there search out a new hiding place  it was many days before i noticed that starting from one fixed point he generally worked toward another tree or stone in the distance then his secret was out he hid things in a line next day he would come back start from his fixed point and move slowly towards the distant one till his nose told him he was over a peanut which he dug up and ate or carried away to his den but he always seemed to distrust himself for on hungry days he would go over two or three of his old lines in the hope of finding a mouthful that he had overlooked  this method was used only when he had a large supply to dispose of hurriedly and not always then meeko is a careless fellow and soon forgets when i gave him only a few to dispose of he hid them helterskelter among the leaves forgetting some of them afterwards and enjoying the rare delight of stumbling upon them when he was hungriestmuch like a child whom i saw once giving himself a sensation he would throw his penny on the ground go round the house and saunter back with his hands in his pockets till he saw the penny which he pounced upon with almost the joy of treasuretrove in the highway  meeko made a sad enda fate which he deserved well enough but which i had to pity spite of myself when the spring came on he went back to evil ways sap was sweet and buds were luscious with the first swelling of tender leaves spring rains had washed out plenty of acorns in the crannies under the big oak and there were freshroasted peanuts still at the corner windowsill within easy jump of a linden twig but he took to watching the robins to see where they nested and when the young were hatched he came no more to my window twice i saw him with fledgelings in his mouth and i drove him day after day from a late clutch of robins eggs that i could watch from my study  he had warnings enough once some students who had been friendly all winter stoned him out of a tree where he was nestrobbing once the sparrows caught him in their nest under the high eaves and knocked him off promptly a twig upon which he caught in falling saved his life undoubtedly for the sparrows were after him and he barely escaped into a knot hole leaving the angry horde clamoring outside but nothing could reform him  one morning at daylight a great crying of robins brought me to the window meeko was running along a limb the first of the fledgelings in his mouth after him were five or six robins whom the parents danger cry had brought to the rescue they were all excited and tremendously in earnest they cried thief thief and swooped at him like hawks their cries speedily brought a score of other birds some to watch others to join in the punishment  meeko dropped the young bird and ran for his den but a robin dashed recklessly in his face and knocked him fair from the tree that and the fall of the fledgeling excited the birds more than ever this thieving birdeater was not invulnerable a dozen rushed at him on the ground and left the marks of their beaks on his coat before he could reach the nearest tree  again he rushed for his den but wherever he turned now angry wings fluttered over him and beaks jabbed in his face raging but frightened he sat up to snarl wickedly like a flash a robin hurled himself down caught the squirrel just under his ear and knocked him again to the ground  things began to look dark for meeko the birds grew bolder and angrier every minute when he started to climb a tree he was hurled off twice ere he reached a crotch and drew himself down into it he was safe there with his back against a big limb they could not get at him from behind but the angry clamor in front frightened him and again he started for his place of refuge his footing was unsteady now and his head dizzy from the blows he had received before he had gone half a limbs length he was again on the ground with a dozen birds pecking at him as they swooped over  with his last strength he snapped viciously at his foes and rushed to the linden my window was open and he came creeping hurrying towards it on the branch over which he had often capered so lightly in the winter days over him clamored the birds forgetting all fear of me in their hatred of the nestrobber  a dozen times he was struck on the way but at every blow he clung to the branch with claws and teeth then staggered on doggedly making no defense his whole thought now was to reach the windowsill  at the place where he always jumped he stopped and began to sway gripping the bark with his claws trying to summon strength for the effort he knew it was too much but it was his last hope at the instant of his spring a robin swooped in his face another caught him a side blow in midair and he fell heavily to the stones belowsic semper tyrannis yelled the robins scattering wildly as i ran down the steps to save him if it were not too late  he died in my hands a moment later with curious maliciousness nipping my finger sharply at the last gasp he was the only squirrel of the lot who knew how to hide in a line and never a one since his day has taken the jump from oak to maple over the driveway     the ol beech patridge  of all the wild birds that still haunt our remaining solitudes the ruffed grousethe patridge of our younger daysis perhaps the wildest the most alert the most suggestive of the primeval wilderness that we have lost you enter the woods from the hillside pasture lounging a moment on the old gray fence to note the play of light and shadow on the birch bolls your eye lingers restfully on the wonderful mixture of soft colors that no brush has ever yet imitated the rich old gold of autumn tapestries the glimmering graygreen of the mouldering stump that the fungi have painted what a giant that tree must have been generations ago in its days of strength how puny the birches that now grow out of its roots you remember the great canoe birches by the wilderness river whiter than the little tent that nestled beneath them their wide bark banners waving in the wind soft as the flutter of owls wings that swept among them shadowlike in the twilight a vague regret steals over you that our own wilderness is gone and with it most of the shy folk that loved its solitudes  suddenly there is a rustle in the leaves something stirs by the old stump a moment ago you thought it was only a brown root now it runs hides draws itself erectkwit kwit kwit and with a whirring rush of wings and a whirling eddy of dead leaves a grouse bursts up and darts away like a blunt arrow flinttipped grayfeathered among the startled birch stems as you follow softly to rout him out again and to thrill and be startled by his unexpected rush something of the indian has come unbidden into your cautious tread all regret for the wilderness is vanished you are simply glad that so much wildness still remains to speak eloquently of the good old days  it is this element of unconquerable wildness in the grouse coupled with a host of early halffearful impressions that always sets my heart to beating as to an old tune whenever a partridge bursts away at my feet i remember well a little child that used to steal away into the still woods which drew him by an irresistible attraction while as yet their dim arches and quiet paths were full of mysteries and haunting terrors step by step the child would advance into the shadows cautious as a wood mouse timid as a rabbit suddenly a swift rustle and a thunderous rush of something from the ground that first set the childs heart to beating wildly and then reached his heels in a fearful impulse which sent him rushing out of the woods tumbling headlong over the old gray wall and scampering halfway across the pasture before he dared halt from the terror behind and then at last another impulse which always sent the child stealing back into the woods again shy alert tense as a watching fox to find out what the fearful thing was that could make such a commotion in the quiet woods  and when he found out at lastah that was a discovery beside which the panthers kittens are as nothing as i think of them one day in the woods near the spot where the awful thunder used to burst away the child heard a cluck and a kwitkwit and saw a beautiful bird dodging gliding halting hiding in the underbrush watching the childs every motion and when he ran forward to put his cap over the bird it burst away and thenwhirr whirr whirr a whole covey of grouse roared up all about him the terror of it weakened his legs so that he fell down in the eddying leaves and covered his ears but this time he knew what it was at last and in a moment he was up and running not away but fast as his little legs could carry him after the last bird that he saw hurtling away among the trees with a birch branch that he had touched with his wings nodding goodby behind him  there is another association with this same bird that always gives an added thrill to the rush of his wings through the startled woods it was in the old school by the crossroads one sleepy september afternoon a class in spelling big boys and little girls toed a crack in front of the wasters desk the rest of the school droned away on appointed tasks in the drowsy interlude the fat boy slept openly on his arms even the mischiefmaker was quiet thinking dreamily of summer days that were gone suddenly there was a terrific crash a clattering tinkle of broken glass a howl from a boy near the window twenty knees banged the desks beneath as twenty boys jumped then before any of us had found his wits jimmy jenkins a redheaded boy whom no calamity could throw off his balance and from whom no opportunity ever got away free had jumped over two forms and was down on the floor in the girls aisle gripping something between his knees  ive got him he announced with the air of a general  got what thundered the master  got a patridge hes an old buster said jimmy and he straightened up holding by the legs a fine cock partridge whose stiffening wings still beat his sides spasmodically he had been scaredup in the neighboring woods frightened by some hunter out of his native coverts when he reached the unknown open places he was more frightened still and as a frightened grouse always flies straight he had driven like a bolt through the schoolhouse window killing himself by the impact  ruleofthree and cube root and the unmapped wilderness of partial payments have left but scant impression on one of those pupils at least but a bird that could wake up a drowsy schoolroom and bring out a living lesson full of life and interest and the subtile call of the woods from a drowsy teacher who studied law by night but never his boys by daythat was a bird to be respected i have studied him with keener interest ever since  yet however much you study the grouse you learn little except how wild he is occasionally when you are still in the woods and a grouse walks up to your hiding place you get a fair glimpse and an idea or two but he soon discovers you and draws himself up straight as a string and watches you for five minutes without stirring or even winking then outdone at his own game he glides away a rustle of little feet on leaves a faint kwitkwit with a question in it and he is gone nor will he come back like the fox to watch from the other side and find out what you are  civilization in its first advances is good to the grouse providing him with an abundance of food and driving away his enemies grouse are always more numerous about settlements than in the wilderness unlike other birds however he grows wilder and wilder by nearness to mens dwellings i suppose that is because the presence of man is so often accompanied by the rush of a dog and the report of a gun and perhaps by the rip and sting of shot in his feathers as he darts away once in the wilderness when very hungry i caught two partridges by slipping over their heads a string noose at the end of a pole here one might as well try to catch a bat in the twilight as to hope to snare one of our upland partridges by any such invention or even to get near enough to meditate the attempt  but there was one grouseand he the very wildest of all that i have ever met in the woodswho showed me unwittingly many bits of his life and with whom i grew to be very well acquainted after a few seasons watching all the hunters of the village knew him well and a halfdozen boys who owned guns and were eager to join the hunters ranks had a shooting acquaintance with him he was known far and wide as the ol beech patridge that he was old no one could deny who knew his ways and his devices and he was frequently scaredup in a beech wood by a brook a couple of miles out of the village  spite of much learned discussion as to different varieties of grouse due to marked variations in coloring i think personally that we have but one variety and that differences in color are due largely to the different surroundings in which they live of all birds the grouse is most invisible when quiet his coloring blends so perfectly with the roots and leaves and tree stems among which he hides this wonderful invisibility is increased by the fact that he changes color easily he is darker in summer lighter in winter like the rabbit when he lives in dark woods he becomes a glossy redbrown and when his haunt is among the birches he is often a decided gray  this was certainly true of the old beech partridge when he spread his tail wide and darted away among the beeches his color blended so perfectly with the gray tree trunks that only a keen eye could separate him and he knew every art of the dodger perfectly when he rose there was scarcely a second of time before he had put a big tree between you and him so as to cover his line of flight i dont know how many times he had been shot at on the wing every hunter i knew had tried it many times and every boy who roamed the woods in autumn had sought to pot him on the ground but he never lost a feather and he would never stand to a dog long enough for the most cunning of our craft to take his position  when a brood of young partridges hear a dog running in the woods they generally flit to the lower branches of a tree and kwitkwit at him curiously they have not yet learned the difference between him and the fox who is the ancient enemy of their kind and whom their ancestors of the wilderness escaped and tantalized in the same way but when it is an old bird that your setter is trailing his actions are a curious mixture of cunning and fascination as old don draws to a point the grouse pulls himself up rigidly by a stump and watches the dog so both stand like statues the dog held by the strange instinct which makes him point lost to sight sound and all things else save the smell in his nose the grouse tense as a fiddlestring every sense alert watching the enemy whom he thinks to be fooled by his good hiding for a few moments they are motionless then the grouse skulks and glides to a better cover as the strong scent fades from dons nose he breaks his point and follows the grouse hears him and again hides by drawing himself up against a stump where he is invisible again don stiffens into his point one foot lifted nose and tail in a straight line as if he were frozen and could not move  so it goes on now gliding through the coverts now still as a stone till the grouse discovers that so long as he is still the dog seems paralyzed unable to move or feel then he draws himself up braced against a root or a tree boll and there they stand within twenty feet of each other never stirring never winking till the dog falls from exhaustion at the strain or breaks it by leaping forward or till the hunters step on the leaves fills the grouse with a new terror that sends him rushing away through the october woods to deeper solitudes  once at noon i saw old ben a famous dog draw to a perfect point just ahead in a tangle of brown brakes i could see the head and neck of a grouse watching the dog keenly old bens master to test the splendid training of his dog proposed lunch on the spot we withdrew a little space and ate deliberately watching the bird and the dog with an interest that grew keener and keener as the meal progressed while old ben stood like a rock and the grouses eye shone steadily out of the tangle of brakes nor did either move so much as an eyelid while we ate and bens master smoked his pipe with quiet confidence at last after a full hour he whacked his pipe on his boot heel and rose to reach for his gun that meant death for the grouse but i owed him too much of keen enjoyment to see him cut down in swift flight in the moment that the masters back was turned i hurled a knot at the tangle of brakes the grouse burst away and old ben shaken out of his trance by the whirr of wings dropped obediently to the charge and turned his head to say reproachfully with his eyes what in the world is the matter with you back theredidnt i hold him long enough  the noble old fellow was trembling like a leaf after the long strain when i went up to him to pat his head and praise his steadiness and share with him the better half of my lunch but to this day bens master does not know what started the grouse so suddenly and as he tells you about the incident will still say regretfully i ought to astarted jest a minute sooner fore he got tired then id a had im  the old beech partridge however was a bird of a different mind no dog ever stood him for more than a second he had learned too well what the thing meant the moment he heard the patter of a dogs feet on leaves he would run rapidly and skulk and hide and run again keeping dog and hunter on the move till he found the cover he wantedthick trees or a tangle of wild grapevineswhen he would burst out on the farther side and no eye however keen could catch more than a glimpse of a gray tail before he was gone other grouse make short straight flights and can be followed and found again but he always drove away on strong wings for an incredible distance and swerved far to right or left so that it was a waste of time to follow him up before you found him he had rested his wings and was ready for another flight and when you did find him he would shoot away like an arrow out of the top of a pine tree and give you never a glimpse of himself  he lived most of the time on a ridge behind the fales place an abandoned farm on the east of the old post road this was his middle range a place of dense coverts bullbrier thickets and sunny open spots among the ledges where you might with goodluck find him on special days at any season but he had all the migratory instincts of a newfoundland caribou in winter he moved south with twenty other grouse to the foot of the ridge which dropped away into a succession of knolls and ravines and sunny wellprotected little valleys where food was plenty here fifty years ago was the farm pasture but now it had grown up everywhere with thickets and berry patches and wild apple trees of the birds planting all the birds loved it in their season quail nested on its edges and you could kick a brown rabbit out of almost any of its decaying brush piles or hollow mossgrown logs  in the spring he crossed the ridge northward again moving into the still dark woods where he had two or three wives with as many broods of young partridges all of whom by the way he regarded with astonishing indifference  across the whole rangestealing silently out of the big woods brawling along the foot of the ridge and singing through the old pastureran a brook that the old beech partridge seemed to love a hundred times i started him from its banks you had only to follow it any november morning before eight oclock and you would be sure to find him but why he haunted it at this particular time and season i never found out  i used to wonder sometimes why i never saw him drink other birds had their regular drinking places and bathing pools there and i frequently watched them from my hiding but though i saw him many times after i learned his haunts he never touched the water  one early summer morning a possible explanation suggested itself i was sitting quietly by the brook on the edge of the big woods waiting for a pool to grow quiet out of which i had just taken a trout and in which i suspected there was a larger one hiding as i waited a mothergrouse and her broodone of the old beech partridges numerous families for whom he provided nothingcame gliding along the edge of the woods they had come to drink evidently but not from the brook a sweeter draught than that was waiting for their coming the dew was still clinging to the grass blades here and there a drop hung from a leaf point flashing like a diamond in the early light and the little partridges cheeping gliding whistling among the drooping stems would raise their little bills for each shining dewdrop that attracted them and drink it down and run with glad little pipings and gurglings to the next drop that flashed an invitation from its bending grass blade the old mother walked sedately in the midst of them now fussing over a laggard now clucking them all together in an eager chirping jumping little crowd each one struggling to be first in at the death of a fat slug she had discovered on the underside of a leaf and anon reaching herself for a dewdrop that hung too high for their drinking so they passed by within a few yards a shy wild happy little family and disappeared into the shadow of the big woods  perhaps that is why i never saw the old beech partridge drink from the brook nature has a fresher draught of her own distilling that is more to his tasting  earlier in the season i found another of his families near the same spot i was stealing along a wood road when i ran plump upon them scratching away at an ant hill in a sunny open spot there was a wild flurry as if a whirlwind had struck the ant hill but it was only the wind of the mother birds wings whirling up the dust to blind my eyes and to hide the scampering retreat of her downy brood again her wings beat the ground sending up a flurry of dead leaves in the midst of which the little partridges jumped and scurried away so much like the leaves that no eye could separate them then the leaves settled slowly and the brood was gone as if the ground had swallowed them up while mother grouse went fluttering along just out of my reach trailing a wing as if broken falling prone on the ground clucking and kwitting and whirling the leaves to draw my attention and bring me away from where the little ones were hiding  i knelt down just within the edge of woods whither i had seen the last laggard of the brood vanish like a brown streak and began to look for them carefully after a time i found one he was crouched flat on a dead oak leaf just under my nose his color hiding him wonderfully something glistened in a tangle of dark roots it was an eye and presently i could make out a little head there that was all i could find of the family though a dozen more were close beside me under the leaves mostly as i backed away i put my hand on another before seeing him and barely saved myself from hurting the little slyboots who never stirred a muscle not even when i took away the leaf that covered him and put it back again softly  across the pathway was a thick scrub oak under which i sat down to watch ten long minutes passed with nothing stirring before mother grouse came stealing back she clucked oncecareful it seemed to say and not a leaf stirred she clucked againdid the ground open there they were a dozen or more of them springing up from nowhere and scurrying with a thousand cheepings to tell her all about it so she gathered them all close about her and they vanished into the friendly shadows  it was curious how jealously the old beech partridge watched over the solitudes where these interesting little families roamed though he seemed to care nothing about them and was never seen near one of his families he suffered no other cock partridge to come into his woods or even to drum within hearing in the winter he shared the southern pasture peaceably with twenty other grouse and on certain days you might by much creeping surprise a whole company of them on a sunny southern slope strutting and gliding in and out and round about with spread tails and drooping wings going through all the movements of a grouse minuet once in indian summer i crept up to twelve or fifteen of the splendid birds who were going through their curious performance in a little opening among the berry bushes and in the midst of themmore vain more resplendent strutting more proudly and clucking more arrogantly than any otherwas the old beech partridge  but when the spring came and the long rolling drumcalls began to throb through the budding woods he retired to his middle range on the ridge and marched from one end to the other driving every other cock grouse out of hearing and drubbing him soundly if he dared resist then after a triumph you would hear his loud drumcall rolling through the may splendor calling as many wives as possible to share his rich living  he had two drumming logs on this range as i soon discovered and once while he was drumming on one log i hid near the other and imitated his call fairly well by beating my hands on a blown bladder that i had buttoned under my jacket the roll of a grouse drum is a curiously muffled sound it is often hard to determine the spot or even the direction whence it comes and it always sounds much farther away than it really is this may have deceived the old beech partridge at first into thinking that he heard some other bird far away on a ridge across the valley where he had no concern for presently he drummed again on his own log i answered it promptly rolling back a defiance and also telling any hen grouse on the range that here was another candidate willing to strut and spread his tail and lift the resplendent ruff about his neck to win his way into her good graces if she would but come to his drumming log and see him  some suspicion that a rival had come to his range must have entered the old beech partridges head for there was a long silence in which i could fancy him standing up straight and stiff on his drumming log listening intently to locate the daring intruder and holding down his bubbling wrath with difficulty  without waiting for him to drum again i beat out a challenge the roll had barely ceased when he came darting up the ridge glancing like a bolt among the thick branches and plunged down by his own log where he drew himself up with marvelous suddenness to listen and watch for the intruder  he seemed relieved that the log was not occupied but he was still full of wrath and suspicion he glided and dodged all about the place looking and listening then he sprang to his log and without waiting to strut and spread his gorgeous feathers as usual he rolled out the long call drawing himself up straight the instant it was done turning his head from side to side to catch the first beat of his rivals answercome out if you dare drum if you dare oh you coward and he hopped five or six high excited hops like a rooster before a storm to the other end of the log and again his quick throbbing drumcall rolled through the woods  though i was near enough to see him clearly without my field glasses i could not even then nor at any other time when i have watched grouse drumming determine just how the call is given after a little while the excitement of a suspected rivals presence wore away and he grew exultant thinking that he had driven the rascal out of his woods he strutted back and forth on the log trailing his wings spreading wide his beautiful tail lifting his crest and his resplendent ruff suddenly he would draw himself up there would be a flash of his wings up and down that no eye could follow and i would hear a single throb of his drum another flash and another throb then faster and faster till he seemed to have two or three pairs of wings whirring and running together like the spokes of a swiftmoving wheel and the drumbeats rolled together into a long call and died away in the woods  generally he stood up on his toes as a rooster does when he flaps his wings before crowing rarely he crouched down close to the log but i doubt if he beat the wood with his wings as is often claimed yet the two logs were different one was dry and hard the other mouldy and mossgrown and the drumcalls were as different as the two logs after a time i could tell by the sound which log he was using at the first beat of his wings but that i think was a matter of resonance a kind of soundingboard effect and not because the two sounded differently as he beat them the call is undoubtedly made either by striking the wings together over his back or as i am inclined to believe by striking them on the down beat against his own sides  once i heard a wounded bird give three or four beats of his drumcall and when i went into the grapevine thicket where he had fallen i found him lying flat on his back beating his sides with his wings  whenever he drums he first struts because he knows not how many pairs of bright eyes are watching him shyly out of the coverts once when i had watched him strut and drum a few times the leaves rustled and two hen grouse emerged from opposite sides into the little opening where his log was then he strutted with greater vanity than before while the two hen grouse went gliding about the place searching for seeds apparently but in reality watching his every movement out of their eye corners and admiring him to his hearts content  in winter i used to follow his trail through the snow to find what he had been doing and what he had found to eat in natures scarce time his worst enemies the man and his dog were no longer to be feared being restrained by law and he roamed the woods with greater freedom than ever he seemed to know that he was safe at this time and more than once i trailed him up to his hiding and saw him whirr away through the open woods sending down a shower of snow behind him as if in that curious way to hide his line of flight from my eyes  there were other enemies however whom no law restrained save the universal woodlaws of fear and hunger often i found the trail of a fox crossing his in the snow and once i followed a double trail fox over grouse for nearly half a mile the fox had struck the trail late the previous afternoon and followed it to a bullbrier thicket in the midst of which was a great cedar in which the old beech partridge roosted the fox went twice around the tree halting and looking up then went straight away to the swamp as if he knew it was of no use to watch longer  rarely when the snow was deep i found the place where he or some other grouse went to sleep on the ground he would plunge down from a tree into the soft snow driving into it headfirst for three or four feet then turn around and settle down in his white warm chamber for the night i would find the small hole where he plunged in at evening and near it the great hole where he burst out when the light waked him taking my direction from his wing prints in the snow i would follow to find where he lit and then trace him on his morning wanderings  one would think that this might be a dangerous proceeding sleeping on the ground with no protection but the snow and a score of hungry enemies prowling about the woods but the grouse knows well that when the storms are out his enemies stay close at home not being able to see or smell and therefore afraid each one of his own enemies there is always a truce in the woods during a snowstorm and that is the reason why a grouse goes to sleep in the snow only while the flakes are still falling when the storm is over and the snow has settled a bit the fox will be abroad again and then the grouse sleeps in the evergreens  once however the old beech partridge miscalculated the storm ceased early in the evening and hunger drove the fox out on a night when ordinarily he would have stayed under cover sometime about daybreak before yet the light had penetrated to where the old beech partridge was sleeping the fox found a hole in the snow which told him that just in front of his hungry nose a grouse was hidden all unconscious of danger i found the spot trailing the fox a few hours later how cautious he was the sly trail was eloquent with hunger and anticipation a few feet away from the promising hole he had stopped looking keenly over the snow to find some suspicious roundness on the smooth surface ah there it was just by the edge of a juniper thicket he crouched down stole forward pushing a deep trail with his body settled himself firmly and sprang and there just beside the hole his paws had made in the snow was another hole where the grouse had burst out scattering snow all over his enemy who had miscalculated by a foot and thundered away to the safety and shelter of the pines  there was another enemy who ought to have known better following the old beech partridge all one early spring when snow was deep and food scarce one day in crossing the partridges southern range i met a small boya keen little fellow with the instincts of a fox for hunting he had always something interesting afootminks or muskrats or a skunk or a big owlso i hailed him with joy  hello johnnie what you after todaybears  but he only shook his heada bit sheepishly i thoughtand talked of all things except the one that he was thinking about and presently he vanished down the old road one of his jacket pockets bulged more than the other and i knew there was a trap in it  late that afternoon i crossed his trail and having nothing more interesting to do followed it it led straight to the bullbrier thicket where the old beech partridge roosted i had searched for it many times in vain before the fox led me to it but johnnie in some of his prowlings had found tracks and a feather or two under a cedar branch and knew just what it meant his trap was there in the very spot where the night before the old beech partridge had stood when he jumped for the lowest limb corn was scattered liberally about and a bluejay that had followed johnnie was already fast in the trap caught at the base of his bill just under the eyes he had sprung the trap in pecking at some corn that was fastened cunningly to the pan by fine wire  when i took the jay carefully from the trap he played possum lying limp in my hand till my grip relaxed when he flew to a branch over my head squalling and upbraiding me for having anything to do with such abominable inventions  i hung the trap to a low limb of the cedar with a note in its jaws telling johnnie to come and see me next day he came at dusk shamefaced and i read him a lecture on fair play and the difference between a thieving mink and an honest partridge but he chuckled over the bluejay and i doubted the withholding power of a mere lecture so to even matters i hinted of an otter slide i had discovered and of a saturday afternoon tramp together twenty times he told me he had tried to snare the old beech partridge when he saw the otter slide he forswore traps and snares for birds and i left the place soon after with good hopes for the grouse knowing that i had spiked the guns of his most dangerous enemy  years later i crossed the old pasture and went straight to the bullbrier tangle there were tracks of a grouse in the snowblunt tracks that rested lightly on the soft whiteness showing that nature remembered his necessity and had caused his new snowshoes to grow famously i hurried to the brook a hundred memories thronging over me of happy days and rare sights when the wood folk revealed their little secrets in the midst of themkwit kwit and with a thunder of wings a grouse whirred away wild and gray as the rare bird that lived there years before and when i questioned a hunter he said that ol beech patridge oh yes hes there hell stay there too till he dies of old age cause you see mister there aint nobody in these parts spry enough to ketch im     following the deer  i was camping one summer on a little lakedeer pond the natives called ita few miles back from a quiet summer resort on the maine coast summer hotels and mackerel fishing and noisy excursions had lost their semblance to a charm so i made a little tent hired a canoe and moved back into the woods  it was better here the days were still and long and the nights full of peace the air was good for nothing but the wild creatures breathed it and the firs had touched it with their fragrance the faraway surge of the sea came up faintly till the spruces answered it and both sounds went gossiping over the hills together on all sides were the woods which on the north especially stretched away over a broken country beyond my farthest explorations  over against my tenting place a colony of herons had their nests in some dark hemlocks they were interesting as a camp of gypsies some going off in straggling bands to the coast at daybreak others frogging in the streams and a few solitary patient philosophical ones joining me daily in following the gentle art of izaak walton and then when the sunset came and the deep red glowed just behind the hemlocks and the gypsy bands came home i would see their sentinels posted here and there among the hemlock tipsstill dark graceful silhouettes etched in sepia against the gorgeous afterglowand hear the mothers croaking their ungainly babies to sleep in the tree tops  down at one end of the pond a brood of young black ducks were learning their daily lessons in hiding at the other end a noisy kingfisher an honest blue heron and a thieving mink shared the pools and watched each other as rival fishermen hares by night and squirrels by day and wood mice at all seasons played round my tent or came shyly to taste my bounty a pair of big owls lived and hunted in a swamp hard by who hooted dismally before the storms came and sometimes swept within the circle of my fire at night every morning a raccoon stopped at a little pool in the brook above my tent to wash his food carefully ere taking it home so there was plenty to do and plenty to learn and the days passed all too swiftly  i had been told by the village hunters that there were no deer that they had vanished long since hounded and crusted and chevied out of season till life was not worth the living so it was with a start of surprise and a thrill of new interest that i came upon the tracks of a large buck and two smaller deer on the shore one morning i was following them eagerly when i ran plump upon old wally the cunningest hunter and trapper in the whole region  sho mister what yer follerin  why these deer tracks i said simply  wally gave me a look of great pity  guess youre greenone o them city fellers aint ye mister them eres sheep tracksmy sheep wandered off int th woods a spell ago and i haint seen the tarnal critters since came up here lookin for um this mornin  i glanced at wallys fish basket and thought of the nibbled lily pads but i said nothing wally was a great hunter albeit jealous apt to think of all the game in the woods as being sent by providence to help him get a lazy living and i knew little about deer at that time so i took him to camp fed him and sent him away  kinder keep a lookout for my sheep will ye mister down t this end o the pond he said pointing away from the deer tracks if ye see ary one send out word and ill come and fetch imneednt foller the tracks though they wander like all possessed this time o year he added earnestly as he went away  that afternoon i went over to a little pond a mile distant from my camp and deeper in the woods the shore was well cut up with numerous deer tracks and among the lily pads everywhere were signs of recent feeding there was a mans track here too which came cautiously out from a thick point of woods and spied about on the shore and went back again more cautiously than before i took the measure of it back to camp and found that it corresponded perfectly with the boot tracks of old wally there were a few deer here undoubtedly which he was watching jealously for his own benefit in the fall hunting  when the next still misty night came it found me afloat on the lonely little pond with a dark lantern fastened to an upright stick just in front of me in the canoe in the shadow of the shores all was black as egypt but out in the middle the outlines of the pond could be followed vaguely by the heavy cloud of woods against the lighter sky the stillness was intense every slightest soundthe creak of a bough or the ripple of a passing musquash the plunk of a water drop into the lake or the snap of a rotten twig broken by the weight of clinging mistcame to the strained ear with startling suddenness then as i waited and sifted the night sounds a dainty plop plop plop sent the canoe gliding like a shadow toward the shore whence the sounds had come  when the lantern opened noiselessly sending a broad beam of gray full of shadows and misty lights through the even blackness of the night the deer stood revealeda beautiful creature shrinking back into the forests shadow yet ever drawn forward by the sudden wonder of the light  she turned her head towards me and her eyes blazed like great colored lights in the lanterns reflection they fascinated me i could see nothing but those great glowing spots blazing and scintillating with a kind of intense fear and wonder out of the darkness she turned away unable to endure the glory any longer then released from the fascination of her eyes i saw her hurrying along the shore a graceful living shadow among the shadows rubbing her head among the bushes as if to brush away from her eyes the charm that dazzled them  i followed a little way watching every move till she turned again and for a longer time stared steadfastly at the light it was harder this time to break away from its power she came nearer two or three times halting between dainty steps to stare and wonder while her eyes blazed into mine then as she faltered irresolutely i reached forward and closed the lantern leaving lake and woods in deeper darkness than before at the sudden release i heard her plunge out of the water but a moment later she was moving nervously among the trees trying to stamp herself up to the courage point of coming back to investigate and when i flashed my lantern at the spot she threw aside caution and came hurriedly down the bank again  later that night i heard other footsteps in the pond and opened my lantern upon three deer a doe a fawn and a large buck feeding at short intervals among the lily pads the buck was wild after one look he plunged into the woods whistling danger to his companions but the fawn heeded nothing knew nothing for the moment save the fascination of the wonderful glare out there in the darkness had i not shut off the light i think he would have climbed into the canoe in his intense wonder  i saw the little fellow again in a curious way a few nights later a wild storm was raging over the woods under its lash the great trees writhed and groaned and the voicesthat strange phenomenon of the forest and rapidswere calling wildly through the roar of the storm and the rush of rain on innumerable leaves i had gone out on the old wood road to lose myself for a little while in the intense darkness and uproar and to feel again the wild thrill of the elements but the night was too dark the storm too fierce every few moments i would blunder against a tree which told me i was off the road and to lose the road meant to wander all night in the stormswept woods so i went back for my lantern with which i again started down the old cart path a little circle of wavering jumping shadows about me the one gray spot in the midst of universal darkness  i had gone but a few hundred yards when there was a rushit was not the wind or the rainin a thicket on my right something jumped into the circle of light two bright spots burned out of the darkness then two more and with strange bleats a deer came close to me with her fawn i stood stockstill with a thrill in my spine that was not altogether of the elements while the deer moved uneasily back and forth the doe wavered between fear and fascination but the fawn knew no fear or perhaps he knew only the great fear of the uproar around him for he came close beside me rested his nose an instant against the light then thrust his head between my arm and body so as to shield his eyes and pressed close against my side shivering with cold and fear pleading dumbly for my protection against the pitiless storm  i refrained from touching the little thing for no wild creature likes to be handled while his mother called in vain from the leafy darkness when i turned to go he followed me close still trying to thrust his face under my arm and i had to close the light with a sharp click before he bounded away down the road where one who knew better than i how to take care of a frightened innocent was no doubt waiting to receive him  i gave up everything else but fishing after that and took to watching the deer but there was little to be learned in the summer woods once i came upon the big buck lying down in a thicket i was following his track trying to learn the indian trick of signtrailing when he shot up in front of me like jackinabox and was gone before i knew what it meant from the impressions in the moss i concluded that he slept with all four feet under him ready to shoot up at an instants notice with power enough in his spring to clear any obstacle near him and then i thought of the way a cow gets up first one end then the other rising from the fore knees at last with puff and grunt and clacking of joints and i took my first lesson in wholesome respect for the creature whom i already considered mine by right of discovery and whose splendid head i saw in anticipation adorning the hall of my houseto the utter discomfiture of old wally  at another time i crept up to an old road beyond the little deer pond where three deer a mother with her fawn and a young spikebuck were playing they kept running up and down leaping over the trees that lay across the road with marvelous ease and gracethat is the two larger deer the little fellow followed awkwardly but he had the spring in him and was learning rapidly to gather himself for the rise and lift his hind feet at the top of his jump and come down with all fours together instead of sprawling clumsily as a horse does  i saw the perfection of it a few days later i was sitting before my tent door at twilight watching the herons when there was a shot and a sudden crash over on their side in a moment the big buck plunged out of the woods and went leaping in swift bounds along the shore head high antlers back the mighty muscles driving him up and onward as if invisible wings were bearing him a dozen great trees were fallen across his path one of which as i afterwards measured lay a clear eight feet above the sand but he never hesitated nor broke his splendid stride he would rush at a tree rise light and swift till above it where he turned as if on a pivot with head thrown back to the wind actually resting an instant in air at the very top of his jump then shoot downward not falling but driven still by the impulse of his great muscles when he struck all four feet were close together and almost quicker than the eye could follow he was in the air again sweeping along the waters edge or rising like a bird over the next obstacle  just below me was a stream with muddy shores on both sides i looked to see if he would stog himself there or turn aside but he knew the place better than i and that just under the soft mud the sand lay firm and sure he struck the muddy place only twice once on either side the fifteenfoot stream sending out a light shower of mud in all directions then because the banks on my side were steep he leaped for the cover of the woods and was gone  i thought i had seen the last of him when i heard him coming bump bump bump the swift blows of his hoofs sounding all together on the forest floor so he flashed by between me and my tent door barely swerved aside for my fire and gave me another beautiful run down the old road rising and falling light as thistledown with the old trees arching over him and brushing his antlers as he rocketed along  the last branch had hardly swished behind him when across the pond the underbrush parted cautiously and old wally appeared trailing a long gun he had followed scarcely a dozen of the bucks jumps when he looked back and saw me watching him from beside a great maple  just afollerin one o my tarnal sheep strayed off day fore yesterday haint seen im hev ye he bawled across  just went along ten or twelve points on his horns and say wally  the old sinner who was glancing about furtively to see if the white sand showed any blood stainslooked up quickly at the changed tone  you let those sheep of yours alone till the first of october then ill help you round em up just now theyre worth forty dollars apiece to the state ill see that the warden collects it too if you shoot another  sho mister i aint ashootin no deer haint seen a deer round here in ten year or more i just took a crack at a patridge at kwitted at me top o a stump  but as he vanished among the hemlocks trailing his old gun i knew that he understood the threat to make the matter sure i drove the deer out of the pond that night giving them the first of a series of rude lessons in caution until the falling leaves should make them wild enough to take care of themselves     still hunting  october the superb month for one who loves the forest found me again in the same woods this time not to watch and learn but to follow the big buck to his death old wally was ahead of me but the falling leaves had done their work well the deer had left the pond at his approach here and there on the ridges i found their tracks and saw them at a distance shy wild alert ready to take care of themselves in any emergency the big buck led them everywhere already his spirit grown keen in long battle against his enemies dominated them all even the fawns had learned fear and followed it as their salvation  then began the most fascinating experience that comes to one who haunts the woodsthe first thrilling glorious days of the stillhunters schooling with the frostcolored october woods for a schoolroom and nature herself for the allwise teacher daylight found me far afield while the heavy mists hung low and the night smells still clung to the first fallen leaves moving swift and silent through the chill fragrant mistiness of the lowlands eye and ear alert for every sign and face set to the heights where the deer were waiting noon found me miles away on the hills munching my crust thankfully in a sunny opening of the woods with a brooks music tinkling among the mossy stones at my feet and the gorgeous crimson and green and gold of the hillside stretching down and away like a vast oriental rug of a giants weaving to the flash and blue gleam of the distant sea and everywherenatures last subtle touches to her picturethe sense of a filmy veil let down ere the end was reached a soft haze on the glowing hilltops a sheen as of silver mist along the stream in the valley a fleecy lightshot cloud on the sea to suggest more and more beautiful beyond the veil  evening found me hurrying homeward through the short twilight along silent wood roads from which the birds had departed breathing deep of the pure air with its pungent tang of ripened leaves sniffing the first night smells listening now for the yap of a fox now for the distant bay of a dog to guide me in a short cut over the hills to where my room in the old farmhouse was waiting  it mattered little that far behind me though not so far from where the trail ended the big buck began his twilight wandering along the ridges sniffing alertly at the vanishing scent of the man on his feeding ground the best things that a hunter brings home are in his heart not in his game bag and a free deer meant another long glorious day following him through the october woods making the tyros mistakes to be sure but feeling also the tyros thrill and the tyros wonder and the consciousness of growing power and skill to read in a new language the secrets that the moss and leaves hide so innocently  there was so much to note and learn and remember in those days a bit of moss with that curiously measured angular cut in it as if the wood folk had taken to studying euclidhow wonderful it was at first the deer had been here his foot drew that sharp triangle and i must measure and feel it carefully and press aside the moss and study the leaves to know whether it were my big buck or no and how long since he had passed and whether he were feeding or running or just nosing about and watching the valley below and all that is much to learn from a tiny triangle in the moss with imaginary a b cs clinging to the dried moss blossoms  how careful one had to be every shift of wind every cloud shadow had to be noted the lesson of a dewdrop splashed from a leaf in the early morning the testimony of a crushed flower or a broken brake or a bending grass blade the counsel of a bit of bark frayed from a birch tree with a shred of deervelvet clinging to itall these were vastly significant and interesting every copse and hiding place and cathedral aisle of the big woods in front must be searched with quiet eyes far ahead as one glided silently from tree to tree that depression in the gray moss of a fir thicket with two others near itthree deer lay down there last night no this morning no scarcely an hour ago and the dim traces along the ridge show no sign of hurry or alarm so i move on following surely the trail that only a few days since would have been invisible as the trail of a fish in the lake to my unschooled eyes searching searching everywhere for dim forms gliding among the trees tilla scream a whistle a rush away and i know that the bluejay which has been gliding after me curiously the last ten minuteshas fathomed my intentions and flown ahead to alarm the deer which are now bounding away for denser cover  i brush ahead heedlessly knowing that caution here only wastes time and study the fresh trail where the quarry jumped away in alarm straight down the wind it goes cunning old buck he has no idea what bluejays alarm was about but a warning whether of crow or jay or tainted wind or snapping twig is never lost on the wood folk now as he bounds along cleaving the woods like a living bolt yet stopping short every hundred yards or so to whirl and listen and sort the messages that the wood wires bring to him he is perfectly sure of himself and his little flock knowing that if danger follow down wind his own nose will tell him all about it i glance at the sun only another hour of light and i am six miles from home i glance at the jay flitting about restlessly in a mixture of mischief and curiosity whistling his toolooloo loudly as a sign to the fleeing game that i am right here and that he sees me then i take up the back trail planning another day  so the days went by one after another the big buck aided by his friends the birds held his own against my craft and patience he grew more wild and alert with every hunt and kept so far ahead of me that only once before the snow blew did i have even the chance of stalking him and then the cunning old fellow foiled me again masterfully  old wally was afield too but so far as i could read from the woods record he fared no better than i on the trail of the buck once when i knew my game was miles ahead i heard the longdrawn whang of wallys old gun across a little valley presently the brush began to crackle and a small doe came jumping among the trees straight towards me within thirty feet she saw me caught herself at the top of her jump came straight down and stood an instant as if turned to stone with a spruce branch bending over to hide her from my eyes then when i moved not having no desire to kill a doe but only to watch the beautiful creature she turned glided a few steps and went bounding away along the ridge  old wally came in a little while not following the trailhe had no skill nor patience for thatbut with a woodsmans instinct following up the general direction of his game not far from where the doe had first appeared he stopped looked all around keenly then rested his hands on the end of his long gun barrel and put his chin on his hands  drat it all never tetched im again that paowder o mine haint wuth a cent you wait till snow blowsaddressing the silent woods at largethen ill get me some paowder as is paowder and foller the critter and ill show ye  old wally said never a word but all this was in his face and attitude as he leaned moodily on his long gun and i watched him chuckling from my hiding among the rocks till with curious instinct he vanished down the ridge behind the very thicket where i had seen the doe flash out of sight a moment before  when i saw him again he was deep in less creditable business it was a perfect autumn daythe air full of light and color the fragrant woods resting under the soft haze like a great bouquet of natures own culling birds bees and squirrels frolicking all day long amidst the trees yet doing an astonishing amount of work in gathering each one his harvest for the cold dark days that were coming  at daylight from the top of a hill i looked down on a little clearing and saw the first signs of the game i was seeking there had been what old people call a duckfrost in the meadows and along the fringes of the woods the white rime lay thick and powdery on grass and dead leaves every foot that touched it left a black mark as if seared with a hot iron when the sun came up and shone upon it across the field three black trails meandered away from the brook but alas under the fringe of evergreen was another trail that of a man which crept and halted and hid yet drew nearer and nearer the point where the three deer trails vanished into the wood then i found powder marks and some brush that was torn by buck shot and three trails that bounded away and a tiny splash of deeper red on a crimson maple leaf so i left the deer to the early hunter and wandered away up the hill for a long lazy satisfying day in the woods alone  presently i came to a low brush fence running zigzag through the woods with snares set every few yards in the partridge and rabbit runs at the third opening a fine cock partridge swung limp and lifeless from a twitchup the cruel wire had torn his neck under his beautiful ruff the broken wing quills showed how terrible had been his struggle hung by the neck till deadan atrocious fate to mete out to a noble bird i followed the hedge of snares for a couple of hundred yards finding three more strangled grouse and a brown rabbit then i sat down in a beautiful spot to watch the life about me and to catch the snarer at his abominable work  the sun climbed higher and blotted out the four trails in the field below red squirrels came down close to my head to chatter and scold and drive me out of the solitude a beautiful gray squirrel went tearing by among the branches pursued by one of the savage little reds that nipped and snarled at his heels the two cannot live together and the gray must always go jays stopped spying on the squirrelsto see and remember where their winter stores were hiddenand lingered near me whistling their curiosity at the silent man below none but jays gave any heed to the five grim corpses swinging by their necks over the deadly hedge and to them it was only a new sensation  then a cruel thing happenedone of the many tragedies that pass unnoticed in the woods there was a scurry in the underbrush and strange cries like those of an agonized child only tiny and distant as if heard in a phonograph over the sounds a crow hovered and rose and fell in his intense absorption seeing nothing but the creature below suddenly he swooped like a hawk into a thicket and out of the cover sprang a leveret young hare only to crouch shivering in the open space under a hemlocks drooping branches there the crow headed him struck once twice three times straight hard blows with his powerful beak and when i ran to the spot the leveret lay quite dead with his skull split while the crow went flapping wildly to the tree tops giving the danger cry to the flock that was gossiping in the sunshine on the ridge across the valley  the woods were all still after that jays and squirrels seemed appalled at the tragedy and avoided me as if i were responsible for the still little body under the hemlock tips an hour passed then a quartermile away in the direction that the deer had taken in the early morning a single jay set up his cry the cry of something new passing in the woods two or three others joined him the cry came nearer a flock of crossbills went whistling overhead coming from the same direction then as i slipped away into an evergreen thicket a partridge came whirring up and darted by me like a brown arrow driven by the bending branches behind him flicking the twigs sharply with his wings as he drove along and then on the path of his last forerunner old wally appeared his keen eyes searching his murderous gibbetline expectantly  now old wally was held in great reputation by the nimrods of the village because he hunted partridges not with scattergun and dogsuch amateurish bungling he disdained and swore againstbut in the good oldfashioned way of stalking with a rifle and when he brought his bunch of birds to market his admirers pointed with pride to the marks of his wondrous skill here was a bird with the head hanging by a thread of skin there one with its neck broken there a furrow along the top of the head and hereperfect worka partridge with both eyes gone showing the course of his unerring bullet  not ten yards from my hiding place he took down a partridge from its gallows fumbled a pointed stick out of his pocket ran it through the birds neck and stowed the creature that had died miserably without a chance for its life away in one of his big pockets a selfsatisfied grin on his face as he glanced down the hedge and saw another bird swinging so he followed his hangmans hedge treating each bird to his pointed stick carefully resetting the snares after him and clearing away the fallen leaves from the fatal pathways when he came to the rabbit he harled him dexterously slipped him over his long gun barrel took his bearings in a quick look and struck over the ridge for another southern hillside  here at last was the secret of wallys boasted skill in partridge hunting with a rifle spite of my indignation at the snare line the cruel death which gaped day and night for the game as it ran about heedlessly in the fancied security of its own coverts a humorous half shamefaced feeling of admiration would creep in as i thought of the old sinners cunning and remembered his look of disdain when he met me one day with a scattergun in my hands and old don following obediently at heel thinking that in his long life he must have learned many things in the woods that i would be glad to know i had invited him cordially to join me but he only withered me with the contempt in his hawk eyes and wiggled his toe as if holding back a kick from my honest dog with difficulty  go hunting with ye not much mister scarin a patridge to death with a dum dog and then turnin a handful o shot loose on the critter an call it huntin thats the way to kill a patridge the ony decent wayand he pulled a bird out of his pocket pointing to a clean hole through the head where the eyes had been  when he had gone i kicked the hedge to pieces quickly cut the twitchups at the butts and threw them with their wire nooses far into the thickets and posted a warning in a cleft stick on the site of the last gibbet then i followed wally to a second and third line of snares which were treated in the same rough way and watched him with curiously mingled feelings of detestation and amusement as he sneaked down the dense hillside with tread light as leatherstocking the old gun over his shoulder his pockets bulging enormously and a string of hanged rabbits swinging to and fro on his gun barrel as if in death they had caught the dizzy motion and could not quit it while the woods they had loved and lived in threw their long sad shadows over them so they came to the meadow into which they had so often come limping down to play or feed among the twilight shadows and crossed it for the last time on wallys gun barrel swinging swinging  the leaves were falling thickly now they formed a dry hard carpet over which it was impossible to follow game accurately and they rustled a sharp warning underfoot if but a wood mouse ran over them it was of little use to stillhunt the wary old buck till the rains should soften the carpet or a snowfall make tracking like boys play but i tried it once more found the quarry on a ridge deep in the woods and followedmore by goodluck than by good managementtill late in the afternoon i saw the buck with two smaller deer standing far away on a halfcleared hillside quietly watching a wide stretch of country below beyond them the ridge narrowed gradually to a long neck ending in a high open bluff above the river  there i tried my last hunters dodgemanoeuvered craftily till near the deer which were hidden by dense thickets and rushed straight at them thinking they would either break away down the open hillside and so give me a running shot or else rush straightaway at the sudden alarm and be caught on the bluff beyond  was it simple instinct i wonder or did the buck that had grown old in hunters wiles feel what was passing in my mind and like a flash take the chance that would save not only his own life but the lives of the two that followed him at the first alarm they separated the two smaller deer broke away down the hillside giving me as pretty a shot as one could wish but i scarcely noticed them my eyes were following eagerly a swift waving of brush tops which told me that the big buck was jumping away straight into the natural trap ahead  i followed on the run till the ridge narrowed so that i could see across it on either side then slowly carefully steadying my nerves for the shot the river was all about him now too wide to jump too steepbanked to climb down the only way out was past me i gripped the rifle hard holding it at a ready as i moved forward watching either side for a slinking form among the scattered coverts at last at last and how easy how perfectly i had trapped him my heart was singing as i stole along  the tracks moved straight on first an easy run then a swift hard rush as they approached the river but what was this the whole end of the bluff was under my eye and no buck standing at bay or running wildly along the bank to escape the tracks moved straight on to the edge in great leaps my heart quickened its beat as if i were nerving myself for a supreme effort would he do it would he dare  a foot this side the brink the lichens were torn away where the sharp hoofs had cut down to solid earth thirty feet away well over the farther bank and ten feet below the level where i stood the fresh earth showed clearly among the hooftorn moss far below the river fretted and roared in a white rush of rapids he had taken the jump a jump that made ones nostrils spread and his breath come hard as he measured it with his eye somewhere over in the spruces shadow there he was hiding watching me no doubt to see if i would dare follow  that was the last of the autumn woods for me if i had only seen himjust one splendid glimpse as he shot over and poised in midair turning for the down plunge that was my only regret as i turned slowly away the river singing beside me and the shadows lengthening along the home trail     winter trails  the snow had come and with it a christmas holiday for weeks i had looked longingly out of college windows as the first trackingsnows came sifting down my thoughts turning from books and the problems of human wisdom to the winter woods with their wide white pages written all over by the feet of wild things then the sun would shine again and i knew that the records were washed clean and the hardpacked leaves as innocent of footmarks as the beach where plover feed when a great wave has chased them away on the twentieth a change came outside the snow fell heavily two days and a night inside books were packed away professors said merry christmas and students were scattering like a bevy of flushed quail to all points of the compass for the holidays the afternoon of the twentyfirst found me again in my room under the eaves of the old farmhouse  before dark i had taken a wide run over the hills and through the woods to the place of my summer camp how wonderful it all was the great woods were covered deep with their pure white mantle not a fleck not a track soiled its even whiteness for the last soft flakes were lingering in the air and fox and grouse and hare and lucivee were still keeping the storm truce hidden deep in their coverts every fir and spruce and hemlock had gone to building fairy grottoes as the snow packed their lower branches under which all sorts of wonders and beauties might be hidden to say nothing of the wild things for whom nature had been building innumerable tents of white and green as they slept the silence was absolute the forests unconscious tribute to the wonder worker even the trout brook running black as night among its whitecapped boulders and delicate arches of frost and fern work between massive banks of feathery white and green had stopped its idle chatter and tinkled a low bell under the ice as if only the angelus could express the wonder of the world  as i came back softly in the twilight a movement in an evergreen ahead caught my eye and i stopped for one of the rare sights of the woodsa partridge going to sleep in a warm room of his own making he looked all about among the trees most carefully listened kwitkwitted in a low voice to himself then with a sudden plunge swooped downward headfirst into the snow i stole to the spot where he had disappeared noted the direction of his tunnel and fell forward with arms outstretched thinking perhaps to catch him under me and examine his feet to see how his natural snowshoes natures winter gift to every grouse were developing before letting him go again but the grouse was an old bird not to be caught napping who had thought on the possibilities of being followed ere he made his plunge he had ploughed under the snow for a couple of feet then swerved sharply to the left and made a little chamber for himself just under some snowpacked spruce tips with a foot of snow for a blanket over him when i fell forward disturbing his rest most rudely ere he had time to wink the snow out of his eyes he burst out with a great whirr and sputter between my left hand and my head scattering snow all over me and thundered off through the startled woods flicking a branch here and there with his wings and shaking down a great white shower as he rushed away for deeper solitudes there no doubt he went to sleep in the evergreens congratulating himself on his escape and preferring to take his chances with the owl rather than with some other groundprowler that might come nosing into his hole before the light snow had time to fill it up effectually behind him  next morning i was early afield heading for a ridge where i thought the deer of the neighborhood might congregate with the intention of yarding for the winter at the foot of a wild little natural meadow made centuries ago by the beavers i found the trail of two deer which had been helping themselves to some hay that had been cut and stacked there the previous summer my big buck was not with them so i left the trail in peace to push through a belt of woods and across a pond to an old road that led for a mile or two towards the ridge i was seeking  early as i was the wood folk were ahead of me their tracks were everywhere eager hungry tracks that poked their noses into every possible hiding place of food or game showing how the twodays fast had whetted their appetites and set them to running keenly the moment the last flakes were down and the storm truce ended  a suspiciouslooking clump of evergreens where something had brushed the snow rudely from the feathery tips stopped me as i hurried down the old road under the evergreens was a hole in the snow and at the bottom of the hole hard inverted cups made by deers feet i followed on to another hole in the snow it could scarcely be called a trail and then to another and another some twelve or fifteen feet apart leading in swift bounds to some big timber there the curious track separated into three deer trails one of which might well be that of a tenpoint buck here was luckluck to find my quarry so early on the first day out and better luck that during my long absence the cunning animal had kept himself and his consort clear of old wally and his devices  when i ran to examine the back trail more carefully i found that the deer had passed the night in a dense thicket of evergreen on a hilltop overlooking the road they had come down the hill picking their way among the stumps of a burned clearing stepping carefully in each others tracks so as to make but a single trail at the road they had leaped clear across from one thicket to another leaving never a trace on the bare even whiteness one might have passed along the road a score of times without noticing that game had crossed there was no doubt now that these were deer that had been often hunted and that had learned their cunning from long experience  i followed them rapidly till they began feeding in a little valley then with much caution stealing from tree to thicket giving scant attention to the trail but searching the woods ahead for the last sign showed that i was now but a few minutes behind the deer there they were at last two graceful forms gliding like gray shadows among the snowladen branches but in vain i searched for a lordly head with wide rough antlers sweeping proudly over the brow my buck was not there scarcely had i made the discovery when there was a whistle and a plunge up on the hill on my left and i had one swift glimpse of him a splendid creature as he bounded away  by way of general precaution or else led by some strange sixth sense of danger he had left his companions feeding and mounted the hill where he could look back on his own track there he had been watching me for half an hour till i approached too near when he sounded the alarm and was off i read it all from the trail a few moments later  it was of no use to follow him for he ran straight down wind the two others had gone quartering off at right angles to his course obeying his signal promptly but having as yet no idea of what danger followed them when alarmed in this way deer never run far before halting to sniff and listen then if not disturbed they run off again circling back and down wind so as to catch from a distance the scent of anything that follows on their trail  i sat still where i was for a good hour watching the chickadees and red squirrels that found me speedily and refusing to move for all the peekings and whistlings of a jay that would fain satisfy his curiosity as to whether i meant harm to the deer or were just benumbed by the cold and incapable of further mischief when i went on i left some scattered bits of meat from my lunch to keep him busy in case the deer were near but there was no need of the precaution the two had learned the leaders lesson of caution well and ran for a mile with many haltings and circlings before they began to feed again even then they moved along at a good pace as they fed till a mile farther on when as i had forelayed the buck came down from a hill to join them and all three moved off toward the big ridge feeding as they went  then began a long chase a chase which for the deer meant a straightaway game and for me a series of wide circlesnever following the trail directly but approaching it at intervals from leeward hoping to circle ahead of the deer and stalk them at last from an unexpected quarter  once when i looked down from a bare hilltop into a valley where the trail ran i had a most interesting glimpse of the big buck doing the same thing from a hill farther on too far away for a shot but near enough to see plainly through my field glass the deer were farther ahead than i supposed they had made a run for it intending to rest after first putting a good space between them and anything that might follow now they were undoubtedly lying down in some faraway thicket their minds at rest but their four feet doubled under them for a jump at short notice trust your nose but keep your feet under youthat is deer wisdom on going to sleep meanwhile to take no chances the wary old leader had circled back to wind the trail and watch it awhile from a distance before joining them in their rest  he stood stockstill in his hiding so still that one might have passed close by without noticing him but his head was above the low evergreens eyes ears and nose were busy giving him perfect report of everything that passed in the woods  i started to stalk him promptly creeping up the hill behind him chuckling to myself at the rare sport of catching a wild thing at his own game but before i sighted him again he grew uneasy the snow tells everything trotted down hill to the trail and put his nose into it here and there to be sure it was not polluted thenanother of his endless devices to make the noonday siesta full of contentmenthe followed the back track a little way stepping carefully in his own footprints branched off on the other side of the trail and so circled swiftly back to join his little flock leaving behind him a sad puzzle of disputing tracks for any novice that might follow him  so the interesting chase went on all day skill against keener cunning instinct against finer instinct through the white wonder of the winter woods till late in the afternoon it swung back towards the starting point the deer had undoubtedly intended to begin their yard that day on the ridge i had selected for at noon i crossed the trail of the two from the haystack heading as if by mutual understanding in that direction but the big buck feeling that he was followed cunningly led his charge away from the spot so as to give no hint of the proposed winter quarters to the enemy that was after him just as the long shadows were stretching across all the valleys from hill to hill and the sun vanished into the last gray bank of clouds on the horizon my deer recrossed the old road leaping it as in the morning so as to leave no telltale track and climbed the hill to the dense thicket where they had passed the previous night  here was my last chance and i studied it deliberately the deer were there safe within the evergreens i had no doubt using their eyes for the open hillside in front and their noses for the woods behind it was useless to attempt stalking from any direction for the cover was so thick that a fox could hardly creep through without alarming ears far less sensitive than a deers skill had failed their cunning was too much for me i must now try an appeal to curiosity  i crept up the hill flat on my face keeping stump or scrub spruce always between me and the thicket on the hilltop the wind was in my favor i had only their eyes to consider somewhere just within the shadow at least one pair were sweeping the back track keenly so i kept well away from it creeping slowly up till i rested behind a great burned stump within forty yards of my game there i fastened a red bandanna handkerchief to a stick and waved it slowly above the stump  almost instantly there was a snort and a rustle of bushes in the thicket above me peeking out i saw the evergreens moving nervously a does head appeared her ears set forward her eyes glistening i waved the handkerchief more erratically my rifle lay across the stumps roots pointing straight at her but she was not the game i was hunting some more waving and dancing of the bright color some more nervous twitchings and rustlings in the evergreens then a whistle and a rush the doe disappeared the movement ceased the thicket was silent as the winter woods behind me  they are just inside i thought pawing the snow to get their courage up to come and see so the handkerchief danced onone two five minutes passed in silence then something made me turn round there in plain sight behind me just this side the fringe of evergreen that lined the old road stood my three deer in a rowthe big buck on the rightlike three beautiful statues their ears all forward their eyes fixed with intensest curiosity on the man lying at full length in the snow with the queer red flag above his head  my first motion broke up the pretty tableau before i could reach for my rifle the deer whirled and vanished like three winks leaving the heavy evergreen tips nodding and blinking behind them in a shower of snow  tired as i was i took a last run to see from the trail how it all happened the deer had been standing just within the thicket as i approached all three had seen the handkerchief the tracks showed that they had pawed the snow and moved about nervously when the leader whistled they had bounded straightaway down the steep on the other side but the farms lay in that direction so they had skirted the base of the hill keeping within the fringe of woods and heading back for their morning trail till the red flag caught their eye again and strong curiosity had halted them for another look  thus the long hunt ended at twilight within sight of the spot where it began in the gray morning stillness with marvelous cunning the deer circled into their old tracks and followed them till night turned them aside into a thicket this i discovered at daylight next morning  that day a change came first a south wind then in succession a thaw a mist a rain turning to snow a cold wind and a bitter frost next day when i entered the woods a brittle crust made silent traveling impossible and over the rocks and bare places was a sheet of ice covered thinly with snow  i was out all day less in hope of finding deer than of watching the wild things but at noon as i sat eating my lunch i heard a rapid running crunch crunch crunch on the ridge above me i stole up quietly as i could to find the fresh trails of my three deer they were running from fright evidently and were very tired as the short irregular jumps showed once where the two leaders cleared a fallen log the third deer had fallen heavily and all three trails showed blood stains where the crust had cut into their legs  i waited there on the trail to see what was followingto give right of way to any hunter but with a good stout stick handy for dealing with dogs which sometimes ran wild in the woods and harried the deer for a long quarterhour the woods were all still then the jays which had come whistling up on the trail flew back screaming and scolding and a huge yellow mongrel showing hounds blood in his ears and nose came slipping limping whining over the crust i waited behind a tree till he was up with me when i jumped out and caught him a resounding thump on the ribs as he ran yelping away i fired my rifle over his head and sent the good club with a vengeance to knock his heels from under him a fresh outburst of howls inspired me with hope perhaps he would remember now to let deer alone for the winter  above the noise of canine lamentation i caught the faint click of snowshoes and hid again to catch the curs owner at his contemptible work but the sound stopped far back on the trail at the sudden uproar  through the trees i caught glimpses of a fur cap and a long gun and the hawk face of old wally peeking listening creeping on the trail and stepping gingerly at last down the valley ashamed or afraid of being caught at his unlawful hunting an ill wind but it blows me good i thought as i took up the trail of the deer half ashamed myself to take advantage of them when tired by the dogs chasing  there was no need of commiseration however now that the dog was out of the way they could take care of themselves very well i found them resting only a short distance ahead but when i attempted to stalk them from leeward the noise of my approach on the crust sent them off with a rush before i caught even a glimpse of them in their thicket  i gave up caution then and there i was fresh and the deer were tiredwhy not run them down and get a fair shot before the sun went down and left the woods too dark to see a rifle sight i had heard that the indians used sometimes to try running a deer down afoot in the old days here was the chance to try a new experience it was fearfully hard traveling without snowshoes to be sure but that seemed only to evenup chances fairly with the deer at the thought i ran on giving no heed when the quarry jumped again just ahead of me but pushing them steadily mile after mile till i realized with a thrill that i was gaining rapidly that their pauses grew more and more frequent and i had constant glimpses of deer ahead among the treesnever of the big buck but of the two does who were struggling desperately to follow their leader as he kept well ahead of them breaking the way then realizing i think that he was followed by strength rather than by skill or cunning the noble old fellow tried a last trick which came near being the end of my hunting altogether  the trail turned suddenly to a high open ridge with scattered thickets here and there as they labored up the slope i had the does in plain sight on top the snow was light and they bounded ahead with fresh strength the trail led straight along the edge of a cliff beyond which the deer had vanished they had stopped running here i noticed with amazement that they had walked with quick short steps across the open eager for a sight of the buck i saw only the thin powdering of snow i forgot the glare ice that covered the rock beneath the deers sharp hoofs had clung to the very edge securely my heedless feet had barely struck the rock when they slipped and i shot over the cliff thirty feet to the rocks below even as i fell and the rifle flew from my grasp i heard the bucks loud whistle from the thicket where he was watching me and then the heavy plunge of the deer as they jumped away  a great drift at the foot of the cliff saved me i picked myself up fearfully bruised but with nothing broken found my rifle and limped away four miles through the woods to the road thinking as i went that i was well served for having delivered the deer from the power of the dog only to take advantage of their long run to secure a head that my skill had failed to win i wondered with an extra twinge in my limp whether i had saved old wally by taking the chase out of his hands unceremoniously above all i wonderedand here i would gladly follow another trail over the same groundwhether the noble beast grown weary with running his splendid strength failing for the first time and his little longtended flock ready to give in and have the tragedy over knew just what he was doing in mincing along the cliffs edge with his heedless enemy close behind what did he think and feel looking back from his hiding and what did his loud whistle mean but that is always the despair of studying the wild things when your problem is almost solved night comes and the trail ends  when i could walk again easily vacation was over the law was on and the deer were safe     snow bound  march is a weary month for the wood folk one who follows them then has it borne in upon him continually that life is a strugglea keen hard hungerdriven struggle to find enough to keep agoing and sleep warm till the tardy sun comes north again with his rich living the fall abundance of stored food has all been eaten except in outoftheway corners that one stumbles upon in a long days wandering the game also is wary and hard to find from being constantly hunted by eager enemies  it is then that the sparrow falleth you find him on the snow a windblown feather guiding your eye to the open where he fell in midflight or under the tree which shows that he lost his grip in the night his empty crop tells the whole pitiful story and why you find him there cold and dead his toes curled up and his body featherlight you would find more but for the fact that hungerpointed eyes are keener than yours and earlier abroad and that crow and jay and mink and wildcat have greater interest than you in finding where the sparrow fell  it is then also that the owl who hunts the sparrow o nights grows so light from scant feeding that he cannot fly against the wind if he would go back to his starting point while the march winds are out he must needs come down close to the ground and yewyaw towards his objective making leeway like an old boat without ballast or centerboard  the grouse have taken to budeating from necessitybirch buds mostly with occasional trips to the orchards for variety they live much now in the trees which they dislike but with a score of hungry enemies prowling for them day and night what can a poor grouse do  when a belated snow falls you follow their particular enemy the fox where he wanders wanders wanders on his nights hunting across the meadow to dine on the remembrance of field micealas safe now under the crust along the brook where he once caught frogs through the thicket where the grouse were hatched past the bullbrier tangle where the covey of quail once rested nightly into the farmyard where the dog is loose and the chickens are safe under lock and key instead of roosting in trees across the highway and through the swamp and into the big bare empty woods till in the sad gray morning light he digs under the wild apple tree and sits down on the snow to eat a frozen apple lest his stomach cry too loudly while he sleeps the day away and tries to forget that he is hungry  everywhere it is the same story hard times and poor hunting even the chickadees are hard pressed to keep up appearances and have their sweet love note ready at the first smell of spring in the air  this was the lesson that the great woods whispered sadly when a few idle march days found me gliding on snowshoes over the old familiar ground wild geese had honked an invitation from the south shore but one can never study a wild goose the only satisfaction is to see him swing in on broad wings over the decoysone glorious moment ere the gun speaks and the dog jumps and everything is spoiled so i left gun and rifle behind and went off to the woods of happy memories to see how my deer were faring  the wonder of the snow was gone there was left only its cold bitterness and a vague sense that it ought no longer to cumber the ground but would better go away as soon as possible and spare the wood folk any more suffering the litter of a score of storms covered its soiled rough surface every shred of bark had left its dark stain where the decaying sap had melted and spread in the midday sun the hard crust which made such excellent running for my snowshoes seemed bitterly cruel when i thought of the starving wild things and of the abundance of food on the brown earth just four feet below their hungry bills and noses  the winter bad been unusually severe reports had come to me from the north woods of deep snows and of deer dying of starvation and cold in their yards i confess that i was anxious as i hurried along now that the hunt was over and the deer had won they belonged to me more than ever more even than if the stuffed head of the buck looked down on my hall instead of resting proudly over his own strong shoulders my snowshoes clicked a rapid march through the sad gray woods while the march wind thrummed an accompaniment high up among the bare branches and the groundspruce nodded briskly beating time with their green tips as if glad of any sound or music that would break the chill silence until the birds came back  here and there the snow told stories gay stories tragic stories sad wandering patient stories of the little woodspeople which the frost had hardened into crust as if nature would keep their memorials forever like the records on the sunhardened bricks of babylon but would the deer live would the big bucks cunning provide a yard large enough for wide wandering with plenty of browse along the paths to carry his flock safely through the winters hunger that was a story waiting somewhere ahead which made me hurry away from the footwritten records that otherwise would have kept me busy for hours  crossbills called welcome to me high overhead nothing can starve them out a red squirrel rushed headlong out of his hollow tree at the first click of my snowshoes nothing can check his curiosity or his scolding except his wife whom he likes and the weasel whom he is mortally afraid of chickadees followed me shyly with their blandishmentstsicadeeee with that gentle upslide of questioning is the spring really coming areare you a harbinger  but the snowshoes clicked on away from the sweet blarney leaving behind the little flatterers who were honestly glad to see me in the woods again and who would fain have delayed me other questions stern ones were calling ahead would the cur dogs find the yard and exterminate the innocents would old wallybut no wally had the rheumatiz and was out of the running illwind blew the deer good that time else he would long ago have run them down on snowshoes and cut their throats as if they were indeed his tarnal sheep that had run wild in the woods  at the southern end of a great hardwood ridge i found the first path of their yard it was half filled with snow unused since the last two storms a glance on either side where everything eatable within reach of a deers neck had long ago been cropped close showed plainly why the path was abandoned i followed it a short distance before running into another path and another then into a great tangle of deer ways spreading out crisscross over the eastern and southern slopes of the ridge  in some of the paths were fresh deer tracks and the signs of recent feeding my heart jumped at sight of one great hoof mark i had measured and studied it too often to fail to recognize its owner there was browse here still to be had for the cropping i began to be hopeful for my little flock and to feel a higher regard for their leader who could plan a yard it seemed as well as a flight and who could not be deceived by early abundance into outlining a small yard forgetting the late snows and the spring hunger  i was stooping to examine the more recent signs when a sharp snort made me raise my head quickly in the path before me stood a doe all aquiver her feet still braced from the suddenness with which she had stopped at sight of an unknown object blocking the path ahead behind her two other deer checked themselves and stood like statues unable to see but obeying their leader promptly  all three were frightened and excited not simply curious as they would have been had they found me in their path unexpectedly the widespread nostrils and heaving sides showed that they had been running hard those in the rear i could see them over the top of the scrub spruce behind which i crouched in the path said in every muscle go on no matter what it is the danger behind is worse go on go on insistence was in the air the doe felt it and bounded aside the crust had softened in the sun and she plunged through it when she struck crrrunch crrrunch up to her sides at every jump the others followed just swinging their heads for a look and a sniff at me springing from hole to hole in the snow and making but a single track a dozen jumps and they struck another path and turned into it running as before down the ridge in the swift glimpses they gave me i noticed with satisfaction that though thin and a bit ragged in appearance they were by no means starved the veteran leader had provided well for his little family  i followed their back track up the ridge for perhaps half a mile when another track made me turn aside two days before a single deer had been driven out of the yard at a point where three paths met she had been running down the ridge when something in front met her and drove her headlong out of her course the soft edges of the path were cut and torn by suspicious claw marks  i followed her flight anxiously finding here and there where the snow had been softest dog tracks big and little the deer was tired from long running apparently the deep holes in the snow where she had broken through the crust were not half the regular distance apart a little way from the path i found her cold and stiff her throat horribly torn by the pack which had run her to death her hind feet were still doubled under her just as she had landed from her last despairing jump when the tired muscles could do no more and she sank down without a struggle to let the dogs do their cruel work  i had barely read all this and had not yet finished measuring the largest tracks to see if it were her old enemy that as dogs frequently do had gathered a pirate band about him and led them forth to the slaughter of the innocents when a faraway cry came stealing down through the gray woods hark the eager yelp of curs and the leading hoot of a hound i whipped out my knife to cut a club and was off for the sounds on a galloping run which is the swiftest possible gait on snowshoes  there were no deer paths here for the hardwood browse upon which deer depend for food grew mostly on the other sides of the ridge that the chase should turn this way out of the yards limits showed the dogs cunning and that they were not new at their evil business they had divided their forces again as they had undoubtedly done when hunting the poor doe whose body i had just found part of the pack hunted down the ridge in full cry while the rest lay in wait to spring at the flying game as it came on and drive it out of the paths into the deep snow where it would speedily be at their mercy at the thought i gripped the club hard promising to stop that kind of hunting for good if only i could get half a chance  presently above the scrape of my snowshoes i heard the deer coming crrrunch crrrunch the heavy plunges growing shorter and fainter while behind the sounds an eager whining trailcry grew into a fierce howl of canine exultation something was telling me to hurry hurry that the big buck i had so often hunted was in my power at last and that if i would square accounts i must beat the dogs though they were nearer to him now than i the excitement of a new kind of hunt a hunt to save not to kill was tingling all over me when i circled a dense thicket of firs with a rush and there he lay up to his shoulders in the snow before me  he had taken his last jump the splendid strength which had carried him so far was spent now to the last ounce he lay resting easily in the snow his head outstretched on the crust before him awaiting the tragedy that had followed him for years by lake and clearing and winter yard and that burst out behind him now with a cry to make ones nerves shudder the glory of his antlers was gone he had dropped them months before but the mighty shoulders and sinewy neck and perfect head showed how well how grandly he had deserved my hunting  he threw up his head as i burst out upon him from an utterly unexpected quarterthe very thing that i had so often tried to do in vain in the old glorious days hast thou found me o mine enemy well here am i that is what his eyes great sad accusing eyes were saying as he laid his head down on the snow again quiet as an indian at the torture too proud to struggle where nothing was to be gained but pity or derision  a strange uncanny silence had settled over the woods wolves cease their cry in the last swift burst of speed that will bring the game in sight then the dogs broke out of the cover behind him with a fiercer howl that was too much for even his nerves to stand nothing on earth could have met such a death unmoved no ears however trained could hear that fierce cry for blood without turning to meet it face to face with a mighty effort the buck whirled in the snow and gathered himself for the tragedy  far ahead of the pack came a small swift bulldog that with no nose of his own for hunting had followed the pirate leader for mere love of killing as he jumped for the throat the buck with his last strength reared on his hind legs so as to get his fore feet clear of the snow and plunged down again with a hard swift sabrecut of his right hoof it caught the dog on the neck as he rose on the spring and ripped him from ear to tail deer and dog came down together then the buck rose swiftly for his last blow and the knifeedged hoofs shot down like lightning one straight hard drive with the crushing force of a tenton hammer behind itand his first enemy was out of the hunt forever before he had time to gather himself again the big yellow brindle with the hounds blood showing in nose and earsold wallys dogleaped into sight his whining trailcry changed to a fierce growl as he sprang for the bucks nose  i had waited for just this moment in hiding and jumped to meet it the club came down between the two heads and there was no reserve this time in the muscles that swung it it caught the brute fair on the head where the nose begins to come up into the skulland he too had harried his last deer  two other curs had leaped aside with quick instinct the moment they saw me and vanished into the thickets as if conscious of their evil doing and anxious to avoid detection but the third a large colliea dog that when he does go wrong becomes the most cunning and vicious of brutesflew straight at my throat with a snarl like a gray wolf cheated of his killing i have faced bear and panther and bull moose when the red dangerlight blazed into their eyes but never before or since have i seen such awful fury in a brutes face it swept over me in an instant that it was his life or mine there was no question or alternative a lucky cut of the club disabled him and i finished the job on the spot for the good of the deer and the community  the big buck had not moved nor tried to after his last great effort now he only turned his head and lifted it wearily as if to get away from the intolerable smell of his dog enemies that lay dying under his very nose his great sorrowful questioning eyes were turned on me continually with a look that only innocence could possibly meet no man on earth i think could have looked into them for a full moment and then raised his hand to slay  i approached very quietly and dragged the dogs away from him one by one his eyes followed me always his nostrils spread his head came up with a start when i flung the first cur aside to leeward but he made no motion only his eyes had a wonderful light in them when i dragged his last enemy the one he had killed himself from under his very head and threw it after the others then i sat down quietly in the snow and we were face to face at last  he feared mei could hardly expect otherwise while a deer has memorybut he lay perfectly still his head extended on the snow his sides heaving after a little while he made a few bounds forward at right angles to the course he had been running with marvelous instinct remembering the nearest point in the many paths out of which the pack had driven him but he stopped and lay quiet at the first sound of my snowshoes behind him the chase law holds you have caught me i am yoursthis is what his sad eyes were saying and sitting down quietly near him again i tried to reassure him you are safe take your own time no dog shall harm you nowthat is what i tried to make him feel by the very power of my own feeling never more strongly roused than now for any wild creature  i whistled a little tune softly which always rouses the wood folks curiosity but as he lay quiet listening his ears shot back and forth nervously at a score of sounds that i could not hear as if above the music he caught faint echoes of the last fearful chase then i brought out my lunch and nibbling a bit myself pushed a slice of black bread over the crust towards him with a long stick  it was curious and intensely interesting to watch the struggle at first he pulled away as if i would poison him then a new rich odor began to steal up into his hungry nostrils for weeks he had not fed full he had been running hard since daylight and was faint and exhausted and in all his life he had never smelled anything so good he turned his head to question me with his eyes slowly his nose came down searching for the bread if he would only eatthat is a truce which i would never break i kept thinking over and over and stopped eating in my eagerness to have him share with me the hunters crust his nose touched it then through his hunger came the smell of the manthe danger smell that had followed him day after day in the beautiful october woods and over white winter trails when he fled for his life and still the man followed the remembrance was too much he raised his head with an effort and bounded away  i followed slowly keeping well out to one side of his trail and sitting quietly within sight whenever he rested in the snow wild animals soon lose their fear in the presence of man if one avoids all excitement even of interest and is quiet in his motions his fear was gone now but the old wild freedom and the intense desire for lifea life which he had resigned when i appeared suddenly before him and the pack broke out behindwere coming back with renewed force his bounds grew longer firmer his stops less frequent till he broke at last into a deer path and shook himself as if to throw off all memory of the experience  from a thicket of fir a doe that had been listening in hiding to the sounds of his coming and to the faint unknown click which was the voice of my snowshoes came out to meet him together they trotted down the path turning often to look and listen and
