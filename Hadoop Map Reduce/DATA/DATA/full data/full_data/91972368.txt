more new arabian nights  the dynamiter  written in collaboration with mrs stevenson       to   messrs cole and cox    police officers  gentlemen  in the volume now in your hands the authors have touched upon that ugly devil of crime with which it is your glory to have contended it were a waste of ink to do so in a serious spirit let us dedicate our horror to acts of a more mingled strain where crime preserves some features of nobility and where reason and humanity can still relish the temptation horror in this case is due to mr parnell he sits before posterity silent mr forsters appeal echoing down the ages horror is due to ourselves in that we have so long coquetted with political crime not seriously weighing not acutely following it from cause to consequence but with a generous unfounded heat of sentiment like the schoolboy with the penny tale applauding what was specious when it touched ourselves truly in a vile shape we proved false to these imaginations discovered in a clap that crime was no less cruel and no less ugly under sounding names and recoiled from our false deities  but seriousness comes most in place when we are to speak of our defenders whoever be in the right in this great and confused war of politics whatever elements of greed whatever traits of the bully dishonour both parties in this inhuman contestyour side your part is at least pure of doubt yours is the side of the child of the breeding woman of individual pity and public trust if our society were the mere kingdom of the devil as indeed it wears some of his colours it yet embraces many precious elements and many innocent persons whom it is a glory to defend courage and devotion so common in the ranks of the police so little recognised so meagrely rewarded have at length found their commemoration in an historical act history which will represent mr parnell sitting silent under the appeal of mr forster and gordon setting forth upon his tragic enterprise will not forget mr cole carrying the dynamite in his defenceless hands nor mr cox coming coolly to his aid       robert louis stevenson      fanny van de grift stevenson     a note for the reader   it is within the bounds of possibility that you may take up this volume and yet be unacquainted with its predecessor the first series of new arabian nights the loss is yoursand mine or to be more exact my publishers but if you are thus unlucky the least i can do is to pass you a hint when you shall find a reference in the following pages to one theophilus godall of the bohemian cigar divan in rupert street soho you must be prepared to recognise under his features no less a person than prince florizel of bohemia formerly one of the magnates of europe now dethroned exiled impoverished and embarked in the tobacco trade       r l s     more new arabian nights  the dynamiter     prologue of the cigar divan   in the city of encounters the bagdad of the west and to be more precise on the broad northern pavement of leicester square two young men of five or sixandtwenty met after years of separation the first who was of a very smooth address and clothed in the best fashion hesitated to recognise the pinched and shabby air of his companion  what he cried paul somerset  i am indeed paul somerset returned the other or what remains of him after a welldeserved experience of poverty and law but in you challoner i can perceive no change and time may be said without hyperbole to write no wrinkle on your azure brow  all replied challoner is not gold that glitters but we are here in an ill posture for confidences and interrupt the movement of these ladies let us if you please find a more private corner  if you will allow me to guide you replied somerset i will offer you the best cigar in london  and taking the arm of his companion he led him in silence and at a brisk pace to the door of a quiet establishment in rupert street soho the entrance was adorned with one of those gigantic highlanders of wood which have almost risen to the standing of antiquities and across the windowglass which sheltered the usual display of pipes tobacco and cigars there ran the gilded legend bohemian cigar divan by t godall the interior of the shop was small but commodious and ornate the salesman grave smiling and urbane and the two young men each puffing a select regalia had soon taken their places on a sofa of mousecoloured plush and proceeded to exchange their stories  i am now said somerset a barrister but providence and the attorneys have hitherto denied me the opportunity to shine a select society at the cheshire cheese engaged my evenings my afternoons as mr godall could testify have been generally passed in this divan and my mornings i have taken the precaution to abbreviate by not rising before twelve at this rate my little patrimony was very rapidly and i am proud to remember most agreeably expended since then a gentleman who has really nothing else to recommend him beyond the fact of being my maternal uncle deals me the small sum of ten shillings a week and if you behold me once more revisiting the glimpses of the street lamps in my favourite quarter you will readily divine that i have come into a fortune  i should not have supposed so replied challoner but doubtless i met you on the way to your tailors  it is a visit that i purpose to delay returned somerset with a smile my fortune has definite limits it consists or rather this morning it consisted of one hundred pounds  that is certainly odd said challoner yes certainly the coincidence is strange i am myself reduced to the same margin  you cried somerset and yet solomon in all his glory  such is the fact i am dear boy on my last legs said challoner besides the clothes in which you see me i have scarcely a decent trouser in my wardrobe and if i knew how i would this instant set about some sort of work or commerce with a hundred pounds for capital a man should push his way  it may be returned somerset but what to do with mine is more than i can fancymr godall he added addressing the salesman you are a man who knows the world what can a young fellow of reasonable education do with a hundred pounds  it depends replied the salesman withdrawing his cheroot the power of money is an article of faith in which i profess myself a sceptic a hundred pounds will with difficulty support you for a year with somewhat more difficulty you may spend it in a night and without any difficulty at all you may lose it in five minutes on the stock exchange if you are of that stamp of man that rises a penny would be as useful if you belong to those that fall a penny would be no more useless when i was myself thrown unexpectedly upon the world it was my fortune to possess an art i knew a good cigar do you know nothing mr somerset  not even law was the reply  the answer is worthy of a sage returned mr godalland you sir he continued turning to challoner as the friend of mr somerset may i be allowed to address you the same question  well replied challoner i play a fair hand at whist  how many persons are there in london returned the salesman who have twoandthirty teeth believe me young gentleman there are more still who play a fair hand at whist whist sir is wide as the world tis an accomplishment like breathing i once knew a youth who announced that he was studying to be chancellor of england the design was certainly ambitious but i find it less excessive than that of the man who aspires to make a livelihood by whist  dear me said challoner i am afraid i shall have to fall to be a working man  fall to be a working man echoed mr godall suppose a rural dean to be unfrocked does he fall to be a major suppose a captain were cashiered would he fall to be a puisne judge the ignorance of your middle class surprises me outside itself it thinks the world to lie quite ignorant and equal sunk in a common degradation but to the eye of the observer all ranks are seen to stand in ordered hierarchies and each adorned with its particular aptitudes and knowledge by the defects of your education you are more disqualified to be a working man than to be the ruler of an empire the gulf sir is below and the true learned artsthose which alone are safe from the competition of insurgent laymenare those which give his title to the artisan  this is a very pompous fellow said challoner in the ear of his companion  he is immense said somerset  just then the door of the divan was opened and a third young fellow made his appearance and rather bashfully requested some tobacco he was younger than the others and in a somewhat meaningless and altogether english way he was a handsome lad when he had been served and had lighted his pipe and taken his place upon the sofa he recalled himself to challoner by the name of desborough  desborough to be sure cried challoner well desborough and what do you do  the fact is said desborough that i am doing nothing  a private fortune possibly inquired the other  well no replied desborough rather sulkily the fact is that i am waiting for something to turn up  all in the same boat cried somerset and have you too one hundred pounds  worse luck said mr desborough  this is a very pathetic sight mr godall said somerset three futiles  a character of this crowded age returned the salesman  sir said somerset i deny that the age is crowded i will admit one fact and one fact only that i am futile that he is futile and that we are all three as futile as the devil what am i i have smattered law smattered letters smattered geography smattered mathematics i have even a working knowledge of judicial astrology and here i stand all london roaring by at the streets end as impotent as any baby i have a prodigious contempt for my maternal uncle but without him it is idle to deny it i should simply resolve into my elements like an unstable mixture i begin to perceive that it is necessary to know some one thing to the bottomwere it only literature and yet sir the man of the world is a great feature of this age he is possessed of an extraordinary mass and variety of knowledge he is everywhere at home he has seen life in all its phases and it is impossible but that this great habit of existence should bear fruit i count myself a man of the world accomplished capàpie so do you challoner and you mr desborough  oh yes returned the young man  well then mr godall here we stand three men of the world without a trade to cover us but planted at the strategic centre of the universe for so you will allow me to call rupert street in the midst of the chief mass of people and within earshot of the most continuous chink of money on the surface of the globe sir as civilised men what do we do i will show you you take in a paper  i take said mr godall solemnly the best paper in the world the standard  good resumed somerset i now hold it in my hand the voice of the world a telephone repeating all mens wants i open it and where my eye first fallswell no not morrisons pillsbut here sure enough and but a little above i find the joint that i was seeking here is the weak spot in the armour of society here is a want a plaint an offer of substantial gratitude two hundred pounds rewardthe above reward will be paid to any person giving information as to the identity and whereabouts of a man observed yesterday in the neighbourhood of the green park he was over six feet in height with shoulders disproportionately broad close shaved with black moustaches and wearing a sealskin greatcoat there gentlemen our fortune if not made is founded  do you then propose dear boy that we should turn detectives inquired challoner  do i propose it no sir cried somerset it is reason destiny the plain face of the world that commands and imposes it here all our merits tell our manners habit of the world powers of conversation vast stores of unconnected knowledge all that we are and have builds up the character of the complete detective it is in short the only profession for a gentleman  the proposition is perhaps excessive replied challoner for hitherto i own i have regarded it as of all dirty sneaking and ungentlemanly trades the least and lowest  to defend society asked somerset to stake ones life for others to deracinate occult and powerful evil i appeal to mr godall he at least as a philosophic lookeron at life will spit upon such philistine opinions he knows that the policeman as he is called upon continually to face greater odds and that both worse equipped and for a better cause is in form and essence a more noble hero than the soldier do you by any chance deceive yourself into supposing that a general would either ask or expect from the best army ever marshalled and on the most momentous battlefield the conduct of a common constable at peckham rye1  i did not understand we were to join the force said challoner  nor shall we these are the hands but herehere sir is the head cried somerset enough it is decreed we shall hunt down this miscreant in the sealskin coat  suppose that we agreed retorted challoner you have no plan no knowledge you know not where to seek for a beginning  challoner cried somerset is it possible that you hold the doctrine of free will and are you devoid of any tincture of philosophy that you should harp on such exploded fallacies chance the blind madonna of the pagan rules this terrestrial bustle and in chance i place my sole reliance chance has brought us three together when we next separate and go forth our several ways chance will continually drag before our careless eyes a thousand eloquent clues not to this mystery only but to the countless mysteries by which we live surrounded then comes the part of the man of the world of the detective born and bred this clue which the whole town beholds without comprehension swift as a cat he leaps upon it makes it his follows it with craft and passion and from one trifling circumstance divines a world  just so said challoner and i am delighted that you should recognise these virtues in yourself but in the meanwhile dear boy i own myself incapable of joining i was neither born nor bred as a detective but as a placable and very thirsty gentleman and for my part i begin to weary for a drink as for clues and adventures the only adventure that is ever likely to occur to me will be an adventure with a bailiff  now there is the fallacy cried somerset there i catch the secret of your futility in life the world teems and bubbles with adventure it besieges you along the streets hands waving out of windows swindlers coming up and swearing they knew you when you were abroad affable and doubtful people of all sorts and conditions begging and truckling for your notice but not you you turn away you walk your seedy mill round you must go the dullest way now here i beg of you the next adventure that offers itself embrace it in with both your arms whatever it looks grimy or romantic grasp it i will do the like the devil is in it but at least we shall have fun and each in turn we shall narrate the story of our fortunes to my philosophic friend of the divan the great godall now hearing me with inward joy come is it a bargain will you indeed both promise to welcome every chance that offers to plunge boldly into every opening and keeping the eye wary and the head composed to study and piece together all that happens come promise let me open to you the doors of the great profession of intrigue  it is not much in my way said challoner but since you make a point of it amen  i dont mind promising said desborough but nothing will happen to me  o faithless ones cried somerset but at least i have your promises and godall i perceive is transported with delight  i promise myself at least much pleasure from your various narratives said the salesman with the customary calm polish of his manner  and now gentlemen concluded somerset let us separate i hasten to put myself in fortunes way hark how in this quiet corner london roars like the noise of battle four million destinies are here concentred and in the strong panoply of one hundred pounds payable to the bearer i am about to plunge into that web   footnote    1 hereupon the arabian author enters on one of his digressions     fearing apparently that the somewhat eccentric views of mr     somerset should throw discredit on a part of truth he calls upon     the english people to remember with more gratitude the services of     the police to what unobserved and solitary acts of heroism they are     called against what odds of numbers and of arms and for how small     a reward either in fame or money matter it has appeared to the     translators too serious for this place     challoners adventure  the squire of dames   mr edward challoner had set up lodgings in the suburb of putney where he enjoyed a parlour and bedroom and the sincere esteem of the people of the house to this remote home he found himself at a very early hour in the morning of the next day condemned to set forth on foot he was a young man of a portly habit no lover of the exercises of the body bland sedentary patient of delay a prop of omnibuses in happier days he would have chartered a cab but these luxuries were now denied him and with what courage he could muster he addressed himself to walk  it was then the height of the season and the summer the weather was serene and cloudless and as he paced under the blinded houses and along the vacant streets the chill of the dawn had fled and some of the warmth and all the brightness of the july day already shone upon the city he walked at first in a profound abstraction bitterly reviewing and repenting his performances at whist but as he advanced into the labyrinth of the southwest his ear was gradually mastered by the silence street after street looked down upon his solitary figure house after house echoed upon his passage with a ghostly jar shop after shop displayed its shuttered front and its commercial legend and meanwhile he steered his course under days effulgent dome and through this encampment of diurnal sleepers lonely as a ship  here he reflected if i were like my scatterbrained companion here were indeed the scene where i might look for an adventure here in broad day the streets are secret as in the blackest night of january and in the midst of some four million sleepers solitary as the woods of yucatan if i but raise my voice i could summon up the number of an army and yet the grave is not more silent than this city of sleep  he was still following these quaint and serious musings when he came into a street of more mingled ingredients than was common in the quarter here on the one hand framed in walls and the green tops of trees were several of those discreet bijou residences on which propriety is apt to look askance here too were many of the brickfronted barracks of the poor a plaster cow perhaps serving as ensign to a dairy or a ticket announcing the business of the mangler before one such house that stood a little separate among walled gardens a cat was playing with a straw and challoner paused a moment looking on this sleek and solitary creature who seemed an emblem of the neighbouring peace with the cessation of the sound of his own steps the silence fell dead the house stood smokeless the blinds down the whole machinery of life arrested and it seemed to challoner that he should hear the breathing of the sleepers  as he so stood he was startled by a dull and jarring detonation from within this was followed by a monstrous hissing and simmering as from a kettle of the bigness of st pauls and at the same time from every chink of door and window spurted an illsmelling vapour the cat disappeared with a cry within the lodginghouse feet pounded on the stairs the door flew back emitting clouds of smoke and two men and an elegantly dressed young lady tumbled forth into the street and fled without a word the hissing had already ceased the smoke was melting in the air the whole event had come and gone as in a dream and still challoner was rooted to the spot at last his reason and his fear awoke together and with the most unwonted energy he fell to running  little by little this first dash relaxed and presently he had resumed his sober gait and begun to piece together out of the confused report of his senses some theory of the occurrence but the occasion of the sounds and stench that had so suddenly assailed him and the strange conjunction of fugitives whom he had seen to issue from the house were mysteries beyond his plummet with an obscure awe he considered them in his mind continuing meanwhile to thread the web of streets and once more alone in morning sunshine  in his first retreat he had entirely wandered and now steering vaguely west it was his luck to light upon an unpretending street which presently widened so as to admit a strip of gardens in the midst here was quite a stir of birds even at that hour the shadow of the leaves was grateful instead of the burnt atmosphere of cities there was something brisk and rural in the air and challoner paced forward his eyes upon the pavement and his mind running upon distant scenes till he was recalled upon a sudden by a wall that blocked his further progress this street whose name i have forgotten is no thoroughfare  he was not the first who had wandered there that morning for as he raised his eyes with an agreeable deliberation they alighted on the figure of a girl in whom he was struck to recognise the third of the incongruous fugitives she had run there seemingly blindfold the wall had checked her career and being entirely wearied she had sunk upon the ground beside the garden railings soiling her dress among the summer dust each saw the other in the same instant of time and she with one wild look sprang to her feet and began to hurry from the scene  challoner was doubly startled to meet once more the heroine of his adventure and to observe the fear with which she shunned him pity and alarm in nearly equal forces contested the possession of his mind and yet in spite of both he saw himself condemned to follow in the ladys wake he did so gingerly as fearing to increase her terrors but tread as lightly as he might his footfalls eloquently echoed in the empty street their sound appeared to strike in her some strong emotion for scarce had he begun to follow ere she paused a second time she addressed herself to flight and a second time she paused then she turned about and with doubtful steps and the most attractive appearance of timidity drew near to the young man he on his side continued to advance with similar signals of distress and bashfulness at length when they were but some steps apart he saw her eyes brim over and she reached out both her hands in eloquent appeal  are you an english gentleman she cried  the unhappy challoner regarded her with consternation he was the spirit of fine courtesy and would have blushed to fail in his devoirs to any lady but in the other scale he was a man averse from amorous adventures he looked east and west but the houses that looked down upon this interview remained inexorably shut and he saw himself though in the full glare of the days eye cut off from any human intervention his looks returned at last upon the suppliant he remarked with irritation that she was charming both in face and figure elegantly dressed and gloved a lady undeniable the picture of distress and innocence weeping and lost in the city of diurnal sleep  madam he said i protest you have no cause to fear intrusion and if i have appeared to follow you the fault is in this street which has deceived us both  an unmistakable relief appeared upon the ladys face i might have guessed it she exclaimed thank you a thousand times but at this hour in this appalling silence and among all these staring windows i am lost in terrorsoh lost in them she cried her face blanching at the words i beg you to lend me your arm she added with the loveliest suppliant inflection i dare not go alone my nerve is gonei had a shock o what a shock i beg of you to be my escort  my dear madam responded challoner heavily my arm is at your service  she took it and clung to it for a moment struggling with her sobs and the next with feverish hurry began to lead him in the direction of the city one thing was plain among so much that was obscure it was plain her fears were genuine still as she went she spied around as if for dangers and now she would shiver like a person in a chill and now clutch his arm in hers to challoner her terror was at once repugnant and infectious it gained and mastered while it still offended him and he wailed in spirit and longed for release  madam he said at last i am of course charmed to be of use to any lady but i confess i was bound in a direction opposite to that you follow and a word of explanation  hush she sobbed not herenot here  the blood of challoner ran cold he might have thought the lady mad but his memory was charged with more perilous stuff and in view of the detonation the smoke and the flight of the illassorted trio his mind was lost among mysteries so they continued to thread the maze of streets in silence with the speed of a guilty flight and both thrilling with incommunicable terrors in time however and above all by their quick pace of walking the pair began to rise to firmer spirits the lady ceased to peer about the corners and challoner emboldened by the resonant tread and distant figure of a constable returned to the charge with more of spirit and directness  i thought he said in the tone of conversation that i had indistinctly perceived you leaving a villa in the company of two gentlemen  oh she said you need not fear to wound me by the truth you saw me flee from a common lodginghouse and my companions were not gentlemen in such a case the best of compliments is to be frank  i thought resumed challoner encouraged as much as he was surprised by the spirit of her reply to have perceived besides a certain odour a noise tooi do not know to what i should compare it  silence she cried you do not know the danger you invoke wait only wait and as soon as we have left those streets and got beyond the reach of listeners all shall be explained meanwhile avoid the topic what a sight is this sleeping city she exclaimed and then with a most thrilling voice dear god she quoted the very houses seem asleep and all that mighty heart is lying still  i perceive madam said he you are a reader  i am more than that she answered with a sigh i am a girl condemned to thoughts beyond her age and so untoward is my fate that this walk upon the arm of a stranger is like an interlude of peace  they had come by this time to the neighbourhood of the victoria station and here at a street corner the young lady paused withdrew her arm from challoners and looked up and down as though in pain or indecision then with a lovely change of countenance and laying her gloved hand upon his arm  what you already think of me she said i tremble to conceive yet i must here condemn myself still further here i must leave you and here i beseech you to wait for my return do not attempt to follow me or spy upon my actions suspend yet awhile your judgment of a girl as innocent as your own sister and do not above all desert me stranger as you are i have none else to look to you see me in sorrow and great fear you are a gentleman courteous and kind and when i beg for a few minutes patience i make sure beforehand you will not deny me  challoner grudgingly promised and the young lady with a grateful eyeshot vanished round the corner but the force of her appeal had been a little blunted for the young man was not only destitute of sisters but of any female relative nearer than a greataunt in wales now he was alone besides the spell that he had hitherto obeyed began to weaken he considered his behaviour with a sneer and plucking up the spirit of revolt he started in pursuit the reader if he has ever plied the fascinating trade of the noctambulist will not be unaware that in the neighbourhood of the great railway centres certain early taverns inaugurate the business of the day it was into one of these that challoner coming round the corner of the block beheld his charming companion disappear to say he was surprised were inexact for he had long since left that sentiment behind him acute disgust and disappointment seized upon his soul and with silent oaths he damned this commonplace enchantress she had scarce been gone a second ere the swingdoors reopened and she appeared again in company with a young man of mean and slouching attire for some five or six exchanges they conversed together with an animated air then the fellow shouldered again into the tap and the young lady with something swifter than a walk retraced her steps towards challoner he saw her coming a miracle of grace her ankle as she hurried flashing from her dress her movements eloquent of speed and youth and though he still entertained some thoughts of flight they grew miserably fainter as the distance lessened against mere beauty he was proof it was her unmistakable gentility that now robbed him of the courage of his cowardice with a proved adventuress he had acted strictly on his right with one whom in spite of all he could not quite deny to be a lady he found himself disarmed at the very corner from whence he had spied upon her interview she came upon him still transfixed andah she cried with a bright flush of colour ah ungenerous  the sharpness of the attack somewhat restored the squire of dames to the possession of himself  madam he returned with a fair show of stoutness i do not think that hitherto you can complain of any lack of generosity i have suffered myself to be led over a considerable portion of the metropolis and if i now request you to discharge me of my office of protector you have friends at hand who will be glad of the succession  she stood a moment dumb  it is well she said go go and may god help me you have seen meme an innocent girl fleeing from a dire catastrophe and haunted by sinister men and neither pity curiosity nor honour move you to await my explanation or to help in my distress go she repeated i am lost indeed and with a passionate gesture she turned and fled along the street  challoner observed her retreat and disappear an almost intolerable sense of guilt contending with the profound sense that he was being gulled she was no sooner gone than the first of these feelings took the upper hand he felt if he had done her less than justice that his conduct was a perfect model of the ungracious the cultured tone of her voice her choice of language and the elegant decorum of her movements cried out aloud against a harsh construction and between penitence and curiosity he began slowly to follow in her wake at the corner he had her once more full in view her speed was failing like a stricken birds even as he looked she threw her arm out gropingly and fell and leaned against the wall at the spectacle challoners fortitude gave way in a few strides he overtook her and for the first time removing his hat assured her in the most moving terms of his entire respect and firm desire to help her he spoke at first unheeded but gradually it appeared that she began to comprehend his words she moved a little and drew herself upright and finally as with a sudden movement of forgiveness turned on the young man a countenance in which reproach and gratitude were mingled ah madam he cried use me as you will and once more but now with a great air of deference he offered her the conduct of his arm she took it with a sigh that struck him to the heart and they began once more to trace the deserted streets but now her steps as though exhausted by emotion began to linger on the way she leaned the more heavily upon his arm and he like the parent bird stooped fondly above his drooping convoy her physical distress was not accompanied by any failing of her spirits and hearing her strike so soon into a playful and charming vein of talk challoner could not sufficiently admire the elasticity of his companions nature let me forget she had said for one halfhour let me forget and sure enough with the very word her sorrows appeared to be forgotten before every house she paused invented a name for the proprietor and sketched his character here lived the old general whom she was to marry on the fifth of the next month there was the mansion of the rich widow who had set her heart on challoner and though she still hung wearily on the young mans arm her laughter sounded low and pleasant in his ears ah she sighed by way of commentary in such a life as mine i must seize tight hold of any happiness that i can find  when they arrived in this leisurely manner at the head of grosvenor place the gates of the park were opening and the bedraggled company of nightwalkers were being at last admitted into that paradise of lawns challoner and his companion followed the movement and walked for awhile in silence in that tatterdemalion crowd but as one after another weary with the nights patrolling of the city pavement sank upon the benches or wandered into separate paths the vast extent of the park had soon utterly swallowed up the last of these intruders and the pair proceeded on their way alone in the grateful quiet of the morning  presently they came in sight of a bench standing very open on a mound of turf the young lady looked about her with relief  here she said here at last we are secure from listeners here then you shall learn and judge my history i could not bear that we should part and that you should still suppose your kindness squandered upon one who was unworthy  thereupon she sat down upon the bench and motioning challoner to take a place immediately beside her began in the following words and with the greatest appearance of enjoyment to narrate the story of her life     story of the destroying angel   my father was a native of england son of a cadet of a great ancient but untitled family and by some event fault or misfortune he was driven to flee from the land of his birth and to lay aside the name of his ancestors he sought the states and instead of lingering in effeminate cities pushed at once into the far west with an exploring party of frontiersmen he was no ordinary traveller for he was not only brave and impetuous by character but learned in many sciences and above all in botany which he particularly loved thus it fell that before many months fremont himself the nominal leader of the troop courted and bowed to his opinion  they had pushed as i have said into the still unknown regions of the west for some time they followed the track of mormon caravans guiding themselves in that vast and melancholy desert by the skeletons of men and animals then they inclined their route a little to the north and losing even these dire memorials came into a country of forbidding stillness i have often heard my father dwell upon the features of that ride rock cliff and barren moor alternated the streams were very far between and neither beast nor bird disturbed the solitude on the fortieth day they had already run so short of food that it was judged advisable to call a halt and scatter upon all sides to hunt a great fire was built that its smoke might serve to rally them and each man of the party mounted and struck off at a venture into the surrounding desert  my father rode for many hours with a steep range of cliffs upon the one hand very black and horrible and upon the other an unwatered vale dotted with boulders like the site of some subverted city at length he found the slot of a great animal and from the clawmarks and the hair among the brush judged that he was on the track of a cinnamon bear of most unusual size he quickened the pace of his steed and still following the quarry came at last to the division of two watersheds on the far side the country was exceeding intricate and difficult heaped with boulders and dotted here and there with a few pines which seemed to indicate the neighbourhood of water here then he picketed his horse and relying on his trusty rifle advanced alone into that wilderness  presently in the great silence that reigned he was aware of the sound of running water to his right and leaning in that direction was rewarded by a scene of natural wonder and human pathos strangely intermixed the stream ran at the bottom of a narrow and winding passage whose walllike sides of rock were sometimes for miles together unscalable by man the water when the stream was swelled with rains must have filled it from side to side the suns rays only plumbed it in the hour of noon the wind in that narrow and damp funnel blew tempestuously and yet in the bottom of this den immediately below my fathers eyes as he leaned over the margin of the cliff a party of some half a hundred men women and children lay scattered uneasily among the rocks they lay some upon their backs some prone and not one stirring their upturned faces seemed all of an extraordinary paleness and emaciation and from time to time above the washing of the stream a faint sound of moaning mounted to my fathers ears  while he thus looked an old man got staggering to his feet unwound his blanket and laid it with great gentleness on a young girl who sat hard by propped against a rock the girl did not seem to be conscious of the act and the old man after having looked upon her with the most engaging pity returned to his former bed and lay down again uncovered on the turf but the scene had not passed without observation even in that starving camp from the very outskirts of the party a man with a white beard and seemingly of venerable years rose up on his knees and came crawling stealthily among the sleepers towards the girl and judge of my fathers indignation when he beheld this cowardly miscreant strip from her both the coverings and return with them to his original position here he lay down for a while below his spoils and as my father imagined feigned to be asleep but presently he had raised himself again upon one elbow looked with sharp scrutiny at his companions and then swiftly carried his hand into his bosom and thence to his mouth by the movement of his jaws he must be eating in that camp of famine he had reserved a store of nourishment and while his companions lay in the stupor of approaching death secretly restored his powers  my father was so incensed at what he saw that he raised his rifle and but for an accident he has often declared he would have shot the fellow dead upon the spot how different would then have been my history but it was not to be even as he raised the barrel his eye lighted on the bear as it crawled along a ledge some way below him and ceding to the hunters instinct it was at the brute not at the man that he discharged his piece the bear leaped and fell into a pool of the river the cañon reechoed the report and in a moment the camp was afoot with cries that were scarce human stumbling falling and throwing each other down these starving people rushed upon the quarry and before my father climbing down by the ledge had time to reach the level of the stream many were already satisfying their hunger on the raw flesh and a fire was being built by the more dainty  his arrival was for some time unremarked he stood in the midst of these tottering and clayfaced marionettes he was surrounded by their cries but their whole soul was fixed on the dead carcase even those who were too weak to move lay halfturned over with their eyes riveted upon the bear and my father seeing himself stand as though invisible in the thick of this dreary hubbub was seized with a desire to weep a touch upon the arm restrained him turning about he found himself face to face with the old man he had so nearly killed and yet at the second glance recognised him for no old man at all but one in the full strength of his years and of a strong speaking and intellectual countenance stigmatised by weariness and famine he beckoned my father near the cliff and there in the most private whisper begged for brandy my father looked at him with scorn you remind me he said of a neglected duty here is my flask it contains enough i trust to revive the women of your party and i will begin with her whom i saw you robbing of her blankets and with that not heeding his appeals my father turned his back upon the egoist  the girl still lay reclined against the rock she lay too far sunk in the first stage of death to have observed the bustle round her couch but when my father had raised her head put the flask to her lips and forced or aided her to swallow some drops of the restorative she opened her languid eyes and smiled upon him faintly never was there a smile of a more touching sweetness never were eyes more deeply violet more honestly eloquent of the soul i speak with knowledge for these were the same eyes that smiled upon me in the cradle from her who was to be his wife my father still jealously watched and followed by the man with the grey beard carried his attentions to all the women of the party and gave the last drainings of his flask to those among the men who seemed in the most need  is there none left not a drop for me said the man with the beard  not one drop replied my father and if you find yourself in want let me counsel you to put your hand into the pocket of your coat  ah cried the other you misjudge me you think me one who clings to life for selfish and commonplace considerations but let me tell you that were all this caravan to perish the world would but be lightened of a weight these are but human insects pullulating thick as mayflies in the slums of european cities whom i myself have plucked from degradation and misery from the dungheap and ginpalace door and you compare their lives with mine  you are then a mormon missionary asked my father  oh cried the man with a strange smile a mormon missionary if you will i value not the title were i no more than that i could have died without a murmur but with my life as a physician is bound up the knowledge of great secrets and the future of man this it was when we missed the caravan tried for a short cut and wandered to this desolate ravine that ate into my soul and in five days has changed my beard from ebony to silver  and you are a physician mused my father looking on his face bound by oath to succour man in his distresses  sir returned the mormon my name is grierson you will hear that name again and you will then understand that my duty was not to this caravan of paupers but to mankind at large  my father turned to the remainder of the party who were now sufficiently revived to hear told them that he would set off at once to bring help from his own party and he added if you be again reduced to such extremities look round you and you will see the earth strewn with assistance here for instance growing on the underside of fissures in this cliff you will perceive a yellow moss trust me it is both edible and excellent  ha said dr grierson you know botany  not i alone returned my father lowering his voice for see where these have been scraped away am i right was that your secret store  my fathers comrades he found when he returned to the signalfire had made a good days hunting they were thus the more easily persuaded to extend assistance to the mormon caravan and the next day beheld both parties on the march for the frontiers of utah the distance to be traversed was not great but the nature of the country and the difficulty of procuring food extended the time to nearly three weeks and my father had thus ample leisure to know and appreciate the girl whom he had succoured i will call my mother lucy her family name i am not at liberty to mention it is one you would know well by what series of undeserved calamities this innocent flower of maidenhood lovely refined by education ennobled by the finest taste was thus cast among the horrors of a mormon caravan i must not stay to tell you let it suffice that even in these untoward circumstances she found a heart worthy of her own the ardour of attachment which united my father and mother was perhaps partly due to the strange manner of their meeting it knew at least no bounds either divine or human my father for her sake determined to renounce his ambition and abjure his faith and a week had not passed upon the march before he had resigned from his party accepted the mormon doctrine and received the promise of my mothers hand on the arrival of the party at salt lake  the marriage took place and i was its only offspring my father prospered exceedingly in his affairs remained faithful to my mother and though you may wonder to hear it i believe there were few happier homes in any country than that in which i saw the light and grew to girlhood we were indeed and in spite of all our wealth avoided as heretics and halfbelievers by the more precise and pious of the faithful young himself that formidable tyrant was known to look askance upon my fathers riches but of this i had no guess i dwelt indeed under the mormon system with perfect innocence and faith some of our friends had many wives but such was the custom and why should it surprise me more than marriage itself from time to time one of our rich acquaintances would disappear his family be broken up his wives and houses shared among the elders of the church and his memory only recalled with bated breath and dreadful headshakings when i had been very still and my presence perhaps was forgotten some such topic would arise among my elders by the evening fire i would see them draw the closer together and look behind them with scared eyes and i might gather from their whisperings how some one rich honoured healthy and in the prime of his days some one perhaps who had taken me on his knees a week before had in one hour been spirited from home and family and vanished like an image from a mirror leaving not a print behind it was terrible indeed but so was death the universal law and even if the talk should wax still bolder full of ominous silences and nods and i should hear named in a whisper the destroying angels how was a child to understand these mysteries i heard of a destroying angel as some more happy child might hear in england of a bishop or a rural dean with vague respect and without the wish for further information life anywhere in society as in nature rests upon dread foundations i beheld safe roads a garden blooming in the desert pious people crowding to worship i was aware of my parents tenderness and all the harmless luxuries of my existence and why should i pry beneath this honest seeming surface for the mysteries on which it stood  we dwelt originally in the city but at an early date we moved to a beautiful house in a green dingle musical with splashing water and surrounded on almost every side by twenty miles of poisonous and rocky desert the city was thirty miles away there was but one road which went no farther than my fathers door the rest were bridletracks impassable in winter and we thus dwelt in a solitude inconceivable to the european our only neighbour was dr grierson to my young eyes after the hairoiled chinbearded elders of the city and the illfavoured and mentally stunted women of their harems there was something agreeable in the correct manner the fine bearing the thin white hair and beard and the piercing looks of the old doctor yet though he was almost our only visitor i never wholly overcame a sense of fear in his presence and this disquietude was rather fed by the awful solitude in which he lived and the obscurity that hung about his occupations his house was but a mile or two from ours but very differently placed it stood overlooking the road on the summit of a steep slope and planted close against a range of overhanging bluffs nature you would say had here desired to imitate the works of man for the slope was even like the glacis of a fort and the cliffs of a constant height like the ramparts of a city not even spring could change one feature of that desolate scene and the windows looked down across a plain snowy with alkali to ranges of cold stone sierras on the north twice or thrice i remember passing within view of this forbidding residence and seeing it always shuttered smokeless and deserted i remarked to my parents that some day it would certainly be robbed  ah no said my father never robbed and i observed a strange conviction in his tone  at last and not long before the blow fell on my unhappy family i chanced to see the doctors house in a new light my father was ill my mother confined to his bedside and i was suffered to go under the charge of our driver to the lonely house some twenty miles away where our packages were left for us the horse cast a shoe night overtook us halfway home and it was well on for three in the morning when the driver and i alone in a light waggon came to that part of the road which ran below the doctors house the moon swam clear the cliffs and mountains in this strong light lay utterly deserted but the house from its station on the top of the long slope and close under the bluff not only shone abroad from every window like a place of festival but from the great chimney at the west end poured forth a coil of smoke so thick and so voluminous that it hung for miles along the windless nightair and its shadow lay far abroad in the moonlight upon the glittering alkali as we continued to draw near besides a regular and panting throb began to divide the silence first it seemed to me like the beating of a heart and next it put into my mind the thought of some giant smothered under mountains and still with incalculable effort fetching breath i had heard of the railway though i had not seen it and i turned to ask the driver if this resembled it but some look in his eye some pallor whether of fear or moonlight on his face caused the words to die upon my lips we continued therefore to advance in silence till we were close below the lighted house when suddenly without premonitory rustle there burst forth a report of such a bigness that it shook the earth and set the echoes of the mountains thundering from cliff to cliff a pillar of amber flame leaped from the chimneytop and fell in multitudes of sparks and at the same time the lights in the windows turned for one instant ruby red and then expired the driver had checked his horse instinctively and the echoes were still rumbling farther off among the mountains when there broke from the now darkened interior a series of yellswhether of man or woman it was impossible to guessthe door flew open and there ran forth into the moonlight at the top of the long slope a figure clad in white which began to dance and leap and throw itself down and roll as if in agony before the house i could no more restrain my cries the driver laid his lash about the horses flank and we fled up the rough track at the peril of our lives and did not draw rein till turning the corner of the mountain we beheld my fathers ranch and deep green groves and gardens sleeping in the tranquil light  this was the one adventure of my life until my father had climbed to the very topmost point of material prosperity and i myself had reached the age of seventeen i was still innocent and merry like a child tended my garden or ran upon the hills in glad simplicity gave not a thought to coquetry or to material cares and if my eye rested on my own image in a mirror or some sylvan spring it was to seek and recognise the features of my parents but the fears which had long pressed on others were now to be laid on my youth i had thrown myself one sultry cloudy afternoon on a divan the windows stood open on the verandah where my mother sat with her embroidery and when my father joined her from the garden their conversation clearly audible to me was of so startling a nature that it held me enthralled where i lay  the blow has come my father said after a long pause  i could hear my mother start and turn but in words she made no reply  yes continued my father i have received today a list of all that i possess of all i say of what i have lent privately to men whose lips are sealed with terror of what i have buried with my own hand on the bare mountain when there was not a bird in heaven does the air then carry secrets are the hills of glass do the stones we tread upon preserve the footprint to betray us oh lucy lucy that we should have come to such a country  but this returned my mother is no very new or very threatening event you are accused of some concealment you will pay more taxes in the future and be mulcted in a fine it is disquieting indeed to find our acts so spied upon and the most private known but is this new have we not long feared and suspected every blade of grass  ay and our shadows cried my father but all this is nothing here is the letter that accompanied the list  i heard my mother turn the pages and she was some time silent  i see she said at last and then with the tone of one reading from a believer so largely blessed by providence with this worlds goods she continued the church awaits in confidence some signal mark of piety there lies the sting am i not right these are the words you fear  these are the words replied my father lucy you remember priestley two days before he disappeared he carried me to the summit of an isolated butte we could see around us for ten miles sure if in any quarter of this land a man were safe from spies it were in such a station but it was in the very aguefit of terror that he told me and that i heard his story he had received a letter such as this and he submitted to my approval an answer in which he offered to resign a third of his possessions i conjured him as he valued life to raise his offering and before we parted he had doubled the amount well two days later he was gonegone from the chief street of the city in the hour of noonand gone for ever o god cried my father by what art do they thus spirit out of life the solid body what death do they command that leaves no traces that this material structure these strong arms this skeleton that can resist the grave for centuries should be thus reft in a moment from the world of sense a horror dwells in that thought more awful than mere death  is there no hope in grierson asked my mother  dismiss the thought replied my father he now knows all that i can teach and will do naught to save me his power besides is small his own danger not improbably more imminent than mine for he too lives apart he leaves his wives neglected and unwatched he is openly cited for an unbeliever and unless he buys security at a more awful pricebut no i will not believe it i have no love for him but i will not believe it  believe what asked my mother and then with a change of note but oh what matters it she cried abimelech there is but one way open we must fly  it is in vain returned my father i should but involve you in my fate to leave this land is hopeless we are closed in it as men are closed in life and there is no issue but the grave  we can but die then replied my mother let us at least die together let not asenath2 and myself survive you think to what a fate we should be doomed  my father was unable to resist her tender violence and though i could see he nourished not one spark of hope he consented to desert his whole estate beyond some hundreds of dollars that he had by him at the moment and to flee that night which promised to be dark and cloudy as soon as the servants were asleep he was to load two mules with provisions two others were to carry my mother and myself and striking through the mountains by an unfrequented trail we were to make a fair stroke for liberty and life as soon as they had thus decided i showed myself at the window and owning that i had heard all assured them that they could rely on my prudence and devotion i had no fear indeed but to show myself unworthy of my birth i held my life in my hand without alarm and when my father weeping upon my neck had blessed heaven for the courage of his child it was with a sentiment of pride and some of the joy that warriors take in war that i began to look forward to the perils of our flight  before midnight under an obscure and starless heaven we had left far behind us the plantations of the valley and were mounting a certain cañon in the hills narrow encumbered with great rocks and echoing with the roar of a tumultuous torrent cascade after cascade thundered and hung up its flag of whiteness in the night or fanned our faces with the wet wind of its descent the trail was breakneck and led to famineguarded deserts it had been long since deserted for more practicable routes and it was now a part of the world untrod from year to year by human footing judge of our dismay when turning suddenly an angle of the cliffs we found a bright bonfire blazing by itself under an impending rock and on the face of the rock drawn very rudely with charred wood the great open eye which is the emblem of the mormon faith we looked upon each other in the firelight my mother broke into a passion of tears but not a word was said the mules were turned about and leaving that great eye to guard the lonely cañon we retraced our steps in silence day had not yet broken ere we were once more at home condemned beyond reprieve  what answer my father sent i was not told but two days later a little before sundown i saw a plain honestlooking man ride slowly up the road in a great pother of dust he was clad in homespun with a broad straw hat wore a patriarchal beard and had an air of a simple rustic farmer that was in my eyes very reassuring he was indeed a very honest man and pious mormon with no liking for his errand though neither he nor any one in utah dared to disobey and it was with every mark of diffidence that he had had himself announced as mr aspinwall and entered the room where our unhappy family was gathered my mother and me he awkwardly enough dismissed and as soon as he was alone with my father laid before him a blank signature of president youngs and offered him a choice of services either to set out as a missionary to the tribes about the white sea or to join the next day with a party of destroying angels in the massacre of sixty german immigrants the last of course my father could not entertain and the first he regarded as a pretext even if he could consent to leave his wife defenceless and to collect fresh victims for the tyranny under which he was himself oppressed he felt sure he would never be suffered to return he refused both and aspinwall he said betrayed sincere emotion part religious as the spectacle of such disobedience but part human in pity for my father and his family he besought him to reconsider his decision and at length finding he could not prevail gave him till the moon rose to settle his affairs and say farewell to wife and daughter for said he then at the latest you must ride with me  i dare not dwell upon the hours that followed they fled all too fast and presently the moon outtopped the eastern range and my father and mr aspinwall set forth side by side on their nocturnal journey my mother though still bearing an heroic countenance had hastened to shut herself in her apartment thenceforward solitary and i alone in the dark house and consumed by grief and apprehension made haste to saddle my indian pony to ride up to the corner of the mountain and to enjoy one farewell sight of my departing father the two men had set forth at a deliberate pace nor was i long behind them when i reached the point of view i was the more amazed to see no moving creature in the landscape the moon as the saying is shone bright as day and nowhere under the whole arch of night was there a growing tree a bush a farm a patch of tillage or any evidence of man but one from the corner where i stood a rugged bastion of the line of bluffs concealed the doctors house and across the top of that projection the soft night wind carried and unwound about the hills a coil of sable smoke what fuel could produce a vapour so sluggish to dissipate in that dry air or what furnace pour it forth so copiously i was unable to conceive but i knew well enough that it came from the doctors chimney i saw well enough that my father had already disappeared and in despite of reason i connected in my mind the loss of that dear protector with the ribbon of foul smoke that trailed along the mountains  days passed and still my mother and i waited in vain for news a week went by a second followed but we heard no word of the father and husband as smoke dissipates as the image glides from the mirror so in the ten or twenty minutes that i had spent in getting my horse and following upon his trail had that strong and brave man vanished out of life hope if any hope we had fled with every hour the worst was now certain for my father the worst was to be dreaded for his defenceless family without weakness with a desperate calm at which i marvel when i look back upon it the widow and the orphan awaited the event on the last day of the third week we rose in the morning to find ourselves alone in the house alone so far as we searched on the estate all our attendants with one accord had fled and as we knew them to be gratefully devoted we drew the darkest intimations from their flight the day passed indeed without event but in the fall of the evening we were called at last into the verandah by the approaching clink of horses hoofs  the doctor mounted on an indian pony rode into the garden dismounted and saluted us he seemed much more bent and his hair more silvery than ever but his demeanour was composed serious and not unkind  madam said he i am come upon a weighty errand and i would have you recognise it as an effect of kindness in the president that he should send as his ambassador your only neighbour and your husbands oldest friend in utah  sir said my mother i have but one concern one thought you know well what it is speak my husband  madam returned the doctor taking a chair on the verandah if you were a silly child my position would now be painfully embarrassing you are on the other hand a woman of great intelligence and fortitude you have by my forethought been allowed three weeks to draw your own conclusions and to accept the inevitable further words from me are i conceive superfluous  my mother was as pale as death and trembled like a reed i gave her my hand and she kept it in the folds of her dress and wrung it till i could have cried aloud then sir said she at last you speak to deaf ears if this be indeed so what have i to do with errands what do i ask of heaven but to die  come said the doctor command yourself i bid you dismiss all thoughts of your late husband and bring a clear mind to bear upon your own future and the fate of that young girl  you bid me dismiss began my mother then you know she cried  i know replied the doctor  you know broke out the poor woman then it was you who did the deed i tear off the mask and with dread and loathing see you as you areyou whom the poor fugitive beholds in nightmares and awakes ravingyou the destroying angel  well madam and what then returned the doctor have not my fate and yours been similar are we not both immured in this strong prison of utah have you not tried to flee and did not the open eye confront you in the cañon who can escape the watch of that unsleeping eye of utah not i at least horrible tasks have indeed been laid upon me and the most ungrateful was the last but had i refused my offices would that have spared your husband you know well it would not i too had perished along with him nor would i have been able to alleviate his last moments nor could i today have stood between his family and the hand of brigham young  ah cried i and could you purchase life by such concessions  young lady answered the doctor i both could and did and you will live to thank me for that baseness you have a spirit asenath that it pleases me to recognise but we waste time mr fonblanques estate reverts as you doubtless imagine to the church but some part of it has been reserved for him who is to marry the family and that person i should perhaps tell you without more delay is no other than myself  at this odious proposal my mother and i cried out aloud and clung together like lost souls  it is as i supposed resumed the doctor with the same measured utterance you recoil from this arrangement do you expect me to convince you you know very well that i have never held the mormon view of women absorbed in the most arduous studies i have left the slatterns whom they call my wives to scratch and quarrel among themselves of me they have had nothing but my purse such was not the union i desired even if i had the leisure to pursue it no you need not madam and my old friend and here the doctor rose and bowed with something of gallantryyou need not apprehend my importunities on the contrary i am rejoiced to read in you a roman spirit and if i am obliged to bid you follow me at once and that in the name not of my wish but of my orders i hope it will be found that we are of a common mind  so bidding us dress for the road he took a lamp for the night had now fallen and set off to the stable to prepare our horses  what does it meanwhat will become of us i cried  not that at least replied my mother shuddering so far we can trust him i seem to read among his words a certain tragic promise asenath if i leave you if i die you will not forget your miserable parents  thereupon we fell to crosspurposes i beseeching her to explain her words she putting me by and continuing to recommend the doctor for a friend the doctor i cried at last the man who killed my father  nay said she let us be just i do believe before heaven he played the friendliest part and he alone asenath can protect you in this land of death  at this the doctor returned leading our two horses and when we were all in the saddle he bade me ride on before as he had matter to discuss with mrs fonblanque they came at a footspace eagerly conversing in a whisper and presently after the moon rose and showed them looking eagerly into each others faces as they went my mother laying her hand upon the doctors arm and the doctor himself against his usual custom making vigorous gestures of protest or asseveration  at the foot of the track which ascended the talus of the mountain to his door the doctor overtook me at a trot  here he said we shall dismount and as your mother prefers to be alone you and i shall walk together to my house  shall i see her again i asked  i give you my word he said and helped me to alight we leave the horses here he added there are no thieves in this stone wilderness  the track mounted gradually keeping the house in view the windows were once more bright the chimney once more vomited smoke but the most absolute silence reigned and but for the figure of my mother very slowly following in our wake i felt convinced there was no human soul within a range of miles at the thought i looked upon the doctor gravely walking by my side with his bowed shoulders and white hair and then once more at his house lit up and pouring smoke like some industrious factory and then my curiosity broke forth in heavens name i cried what do you make in this inhuman desert  he looked at me with a peculiar smile and answered with an evasion  this is not the first time said he that you have seen my furnaces alight one morning in the small hours i saw you driving past a delicate experiment miscarried and i cannot acquit myself of having startled either your driver or the horse that drew you  what cried i beholding again in fancy the antics of the figure could that be you  it was i he replied but do not fancy that i was mad i was in agony i had been scalded cruelly  we were now near the house which unlike the ordinary houses of the country was built of hewn stone and very solid stone too was its foundation stone its background not a blade of grass sprouted among the broken mineral about the walls not a flower adorned the windows over the door by way of sole adornment the mormon eye was rudely sculptured i had been brought up to view that emblem from my childhood but since the night of our escape it had acquired a new significance and set me shrinking the smoke rolled voluminously from the chimneytop its edges ruddy with the fire and from the far corner of the building near the ground angry puffs of steam shone snowwhite in the moon and vanished  the doctor opened the door and paused upon the threshold you ask me what i make here he observed two things life and death and he motioned me to enter  i shall await my mother said i  child he replied look at me am i not old and broken of us two which is the stronger the young maiden or the withered man  i bowed and passing by him entered a vestibule or kitchen lit by a good fire and a shaded readinglamp it was furnished only with a dresser a rude table and some wooden benches and on one of these the doctor motioned me to take a seat and passing by another door into the interior of the house he left me to myself presently i heard the jar of iron from the far end of the building and this was followed by the same throbbing noise that had startled me in the valley but now so near at hand as to be menacing by loudness and even to shake the house with every recurrence of the stroke i had scarce time to master my alarm when the doctor returned and almost in the same moment my mother appeared upon the threshold but how am i to describe to you the peace and ravishment of that face years seemed to have passed over her head during that brief ride and left her younger and fairer her eyes shone her smile went to my heart she seemed no more a woman but the angel of ecstatic tenderness i ran to her in a kind of terror but she shrank a little back and laid her finger on her lips with something arch and yet unearthly to the doctor on the contrary she reached out her hand as to a friend and helper and so strange was the scene that i forgot to be offended  lucy said the doctor all is prepared will you go alone or shall your daughter follow us  let asenath come she answered dear asenath at this hour when i am purified of fear and sorrow and already survive myself and my affections it is for your sake and not for mine that i desire her presence were she shut out dear friend it is to be feared she might misjudge your kindness  mother i cried wildly mother what is this  but my mother with her radiant smile said only hush as though i were a child again and tossing in some feverfit and the doctor bade me be silent and trouble her no more you have made a choice he continued addressing my mother that has often strangely tempted me the two extremes all or else nothing never or this very hour upon the clockthese have been my incongruous desires but to accept the middle term to be content with a halfgift to flicker awhile and to burn outnever for an hour never since i was born has satisfied the appetite of my ambition he looked upon my mother fixedly much of admiration and some touch of envy in his eyes then with a profound sigh he led the way into the inner room  it was very long from end to end it was lit up by many lamps which by the changeful colour of their light and by the incessant snapping sounds with which they burned i have since divined to be electric at the extreme end an open door gave us a glimpse into what must have been a leanto shed beside the chimney and this in strong contrast to the room was painted with a red reverberation as from furnacedoors the walls were lined with books and glazed cases the tables crowded with the implements of chemical research great glass accumulators glittered in the light and through a hole in the gable near the shed door a heavy drivingbelt entered the apartment and ran overhead upon steel pulleys with clumsy activity and many ghostly and fluttering sounds in one corner i perceived a chair resting upon crystal feet and curiously wreathed with wire to this my mother advanced with a decisive swiftness  is this it she asked  the doctor bowed in silence  asenath said my mother in this sad end of my life i have found one helper look upon him it is doctor grierson be not o my daughter be not ungrateful to that friend  she sat upon the chair and took in her hands the globes that terminated the arms  am i right she asked and looked upon the doctor with such a radiancy of face that i trembled for her reason once more the doctor bowed but this time leaning hard against the wall he must have touched a spring the least shock agitated my mother where she sat the least passing jar appeared to cross her features and she sank back in the chair like one resigned to weariness i was at her knees that moment but her hands fell loosely in my grasp her face still beatified with the same touching smile sank forward on her bosom her spirit had for ever fled  i do not know how long may have elapsed before raising for a moment my tearful face i met the doctors eyes they rested upon mine with such a depth of scrutiny pity and interest that even from the freshness of my sorrow i was startled into attention  enough he said to lamentation your mother went to death as to a bridal dying where her husband died it is time asenath to think of the survivors follow me to the next room  i followed him like a person in a dream he made me sit by the fire he gave me wine to drink and then pacing the stone floor he thus began to address me  you are now my child alone in the world and under the immediate watch of brigham young it would be your lot in ordinary circumstances to become the fiftieth bride of some ignoble elder or by particular fortune as fortune is counted in this land to find favour in the eyes of the president himself such a fate for a girl like you were worse than death better to die as your mother died than to sink daily deeper in the mire of this pit of womans degradation but is escape conceivable your father tried and you beheld yourself with what security his jailers acted and how a dumb drawing on a rock was counted a sufficient sentry over the avenues of freedom where your father failed will you be wiser or more fortunate or are you too helpless in the toils  i had followed his words with changing emotion but now i believed i understood  i see i cried you judge me rightly i must follow where my parents led and oh i am not only willing i am eager  no replied the doctor not death for you the flawed vessel we may break but not the perfect no your mother cherished a different hope and so do i i see he cried the girl develop to the completed woman the plan reach fulfilment the promiseay outdone i could not bear to arrest so lively so comely a process it was your mothers thought he added with a change of tone that i should marry you myself i fear i must have shown a perfect horror of aversion from this fate for he made haste to quiet me reassure yourself asenath he resumed old as i am i have not forgotten the tumultuous fancies of youth i have passed my days indeed in laboratories but in all my vigils i have not forgotten the tune of a young pulse age asks with timidity to be spared intolerable pain youth taking fortune by the beard demands joy like a right these things i have not forgotten none rather has more keenly felt none more jealously considered them i have but postponed them to their day see then you stand without support the only friend left to you this old investigator old in cunning young in sympathy answer me but one question are you free from the entanglement of what the world calls love do you still command your heart and purposes or are you fallen in some bondslavery of the eye and ear  i answered him in broken words my heart i think i must have told him lay with my dead parents  it is enough he said it has been my fate to be called on often too often for those services of which we spoke tonight none in utah could carry them so well to a conclusion hence there has fallen into my hands a certain share of influence which i now lay at your service partly for the sake of my dead friends your parents partly for the interest i bear you in your own right i shall send you to england to the great city of london there to await the bridegroom i have selected he shall be a son of mine a young man suitable in age and not grossly deficient in that quality of beauty that your years demand since your heart is free you may well pledge me the sole promise that i ask in return for much expense and still more danger to await the arrival of that bridegroom with the delicacy of a wife  i sat awhile stunned the doctors marriages i remembered to have heard had been unfruitful and this added perplexity to my distress but i was alone as he had said alone in that dark land the thought of escape of any equal marriage was already enough to revive in me some dawn of hope and in what words i know not i accepted the proposal  he seemed more moved by my consent than i could reasonably have looked for you shall see he cried you shall judge for yourself and hurrying to the next room he returned with a small portrait somewhat coarsely done in oils it showed a man in the dress of nearly forty years before young indeed but still recognisable to be the doctor do you like it he asked that is myself when i was young mymy boy will be like that like but nobler with such health as angels might condescend to envy and a man of mind asenath of commanding mind that should be a man i think that should be one among ten thousand a man like thatone to combine the passions of youth with the restraint the force the dignity of ageone to fill all the parts and faculties one to be mans epitomesay will that not satisfy the needs of an ambitious girl say is not that enough and as he held the picture close before my eyes his hand shook  i told him briefly i would ask no better for i was transpierced with this display of fatherly emotion but even as i said the words the most insolent revolt surged through my arteries i held him in horror him his portrait and his son and had there been any choice but death or a mormon marriage i declare before heaven i had embraced it  it is well he replied and i had rightly counted on your spirit eat then for you have far to go so saying he set meat before me and while i was endeavouring to obey he left the room and returned with an armful of coarse raiment there said he is your disguise i leave you to your toilet  the clothes had probably belonged to a somewhat lubberly boy of fifteen and they hung about me like a sack and cruelly hampered my movements but what filled me with uncontrollable shudderings was the problem of their origin and the fate of the lad to whom they had belonged i had scarcely effected the exchange when the doctor returned opened a back window helped me out into the narrow space between the house and the overhanging bluffs and showed me a ladder of iron footholds mortised in the rock mount he said swiftly when you are at the summit walk so far as you are able in the shadow of the smoke the smoke will bring you sooner or later to a cañon follow that down and you will find a man with two horses him you will implicitly obey and remember silence that machinery which i now put in motion for your service may by one word be turned against you go heaven prosper you  the ascent was easy arrived at the top of the cliff i saw before me on the other side a vast and gradual declivity of stone lying bare to the moon and the surrounding mountains nowhere was any vantage or concealment and knowing how these deserts were beset with spies i made haste to veil my movements under the blowing trail of smoke sometimes it swam high rising on the night wind and i had no more substantial curtain than its moonthrown shadow sometimes again it crawled upon the earth and i would walk in it no higher than to my shoulders like some mountain fog but one way or another the smoke of that illomened furnace protected the first steps of my escape and led me unobserved to the cañon  there sure enough i found a taciturn and sombre man beside a pair of saddlehorses and thenceforward all night long we wandered in silence by the most occult and dangerous paths among the mountains a little before the dayspring we took refuge in a wet and gusty cavern at the bottom of a gorge lay there all day concealed and the next night before the glow had faded out of the west resumed our wanderings about noon we stopped again in a lawn upon a little river where was a screen of bushes and here my guide handing me a bundle from his pack bade me change my dress once more the bundle contained clothing of my own taken from our house with such necessaries as a comb and soap i made my toilet by the mirror of a quiet pool and as i was so doing and smiling with some complacency to see myself restored to my own image the mountains rang with a scream of far more than human piercingness and where i still stood astonished there sprang up and swiftly increased a storm of the most awful and earthrending sounds shall i own to you that i fell upon my face and shrieked and yet this was but the overland train winding among the near mountains the very means of my salvation the strong wings that were to carry me from utah  when i was dressed the guide gave me a bag which contained he said both money and papers and telling me that i was already over the borders in the territory of wyoming bade me follow the stream until i reached the railway station half a mile below here he added is your ticket as far as council bluffs the east express will pass in a few hours with that he took both horses and without further words or any salutation rode off by the way that we had come  three hours afterwards i was seated on the end platform of the train as it swept eastward through the gorges and thundered in tunnels of the mountains the change of scene the sense of escape the still throbbing terror of pursuitabove all the astounding magic of my new conveyance kept me from any logical or melancholy thought i had gone to the doctors house two nights before prepared to die prepared for worse than death what had passed terrible although it was looked almost bright compared to my anticipations and it was not till i had slept a full night in the flying palace car that i awoke to the sense of my irreparable loss and to some reasonable alarm about the future in this mood i examined the contents of the bag it was well supplied with gold it contained tickets and complete directions for my journey as far as liverpool and a long letter from the doctor supplying me with a fictitious name and story recommending the most guarded silence and bidding me to await faithfully the coming of his son all then had been arranged beforehand he had counted upon my consent and what was tenfold worse upon my mothers voluntary death my horror of my only friend my aversion for this son who was to marry me my revolt against the whole current and conditions of my life were now complete i was sitting stupefied by my distress and helplessness when to my joy a very pleasant lady offered me her conversation i clutched at the relief and i was soon glibly telling her the story in the doctors letter how i was a miss gould of nevada city going to england to an uncle what money i had what family my age and so forth until i had exhausted my instructions and as the lady still continued to ply me with questions began to embroider on my own account this soon carried one of my inexperience beyond her depth and i had already remarked a shadow on the ladys face when a gentleman drew near and very civilly addressed me  miss gould i believe said he and then excusing himself to the lady by the authority of my guardian drew me to the fore platform of the pullman car miss gould he said in my ear is it possible that you suppose yourself in safety let me completely undeceive you one more such indiscretion and you return to utah and in the meanwhile if this woman should again address you you are to reply with these words madam i do not like you and i will be obliged if you will suffer me to choose my own associates  alas i had to do as i was bid this lady to whom i already felt myself drawn with the strongest cords of sympathy i dismissed with insult and thenceforward through all that day i sat in silence gazing on the bare plains and swallowing my tears let that suffice it was the pattern of my journey whether on the train at the hotels or on board the ocean steamer i never exchanged a friendly word with any fellowtraveller but i was certain to be interrupted in every place on every side the most unlikely persons man or woman rich or poor became protectors to forward me upon my journey or spies to observe and regulate my conduct thus i crossed the states thus passed the ocean the mormon eye still following my movements and when at length a cab had set me down before that london lodginghouse from which you saw me flee this morning i had already ceased to struggle and ceased to hope  the landlady like every one else through all that journey was expecting my arrival a fire was lighted in my room which looked upon the garden there were books on the table clothes in the drawers and there i had almost said with contentment and certainly with resignation i saw month follow month over my head at times my landlady took me for a walk or an excursion but she would never suffer me to leave the house alone and i seeing that she also lived under the shadow of that widespread mormon terror felt too much pity to resist to the child born on mormon soil as to the man who accepts the engagements of a secret order no escape is possible so i had clearly read and i was thankful even for this respite meanwhile i tried honestly to prepare my mind for my approaching nuptials the day drew near when my bridegroom was to visit me and gratitude and fear alike obliged me to consent a son of dr griersons be he what he pleased must still be young and it was even probable he should be handsome on more than that i felt i dared not reckon and in moulding my mind towards consent i dwelt the more carefully on these physical attractions which i felt i might expect and averted my eyes from moral or intellectual considerations we have a great power upon our spirits and as time passed i worked myself into a frame of acquiescence nay and i began to grow impatient for the hour at night sleep forsook me i sat all day by the fire absorbed in dreams conjuring up the features of my husband and anticipating in fancy the touch of his hand and the sound of his voice in the dead level and solitude of my existence this was the one eastern window and the one door of hope at last i had so cultivated and prepared my will that i began to be besieged with fears upon the other side how if it was i that did not please how if this unseen lover should turn from me with disaffection and now i spent hours before the glass studying and judging my attractions and was never weary of changing my dress or ordering my hair  when the day came i was long about my toilet but at last with a sort of hopeful desperation i had to own that i could do no more and must now stand or fall by nature my occupation ended i fell a prey to the most sickening impatience mingled with alarms giving ear to the swelling rumour of the streets and at each change of sound or silence starting shrinking and colouring to the brow love is not to be prepared i know without some knowledge of the object and yet when the cab at last rattled to the door and i heard my visitor mount the stairs such was the tumult of hopes in my poor bosom that love itself might have been proud to own their parentage the door opened and it was dr grierson that appeared i believe i must have screamed aloud and i know at least that i fell fainting to the floor  when i came to myself he was standing over me counting my pulse i have startled you he said a difficulty unforeseenthe impossibility of obtaining a certain drug in its full purityhas forced me to resort to london unprepared i regret that i should have shown myself once more without those poor attractions which are much perhaps to you but to me are no more considerable than rain that falls into the sea youth is but a state as passing as that syncope from which you are but just awakened and if there be truth in science as easy to recall for i find asenath that i must now take you for my confidant since my first years i have devoted every hour and act of life to one ambitious task and the time of my success is at hand in these new countries where i was so long content to stay i collected indispensable ingredients i have fortified myself on every side from the possibility of error what was a dream now takes the substance of reality and when i offered you a son of mine i did so in a figure that sonthat husband asenath is myselfnot as you now behold me but restored to the first energy of youth you think me mad it is the customary attitude of ignorance i will not argue i will leave facts to speak when you behold me purified invigorated renewed restamped in the original imagewhen you recognise in me what i shall be the first perfect expression of the powers of mankindi shall be able to laugh with a better grace at your passing and natural incredulity to what can you aspirefame riches power the charm of youth the dearbought wisdom of agethat i shall not be able to afford you in perfection do not deceive yourself i already excel you in every human gift but one when that gift also has been restored to me you will recognise your master  hereupon consulting his watch he told me he must now leave me to myself and bidding me consult reason and not girlish fancies he withdrew i had not the courage to move the night fell and found me still where he had laid me during my faint my face buried in my hands my soul drowned in the darkest apprehensions late in the evening he returned carrying a candle and with a certain irritable tremor bade me rise and sup is it possible he added that i have been deceived in your courage a cowardly girl is no fit mate for me  i flung myself before him on my knees and with floods of tears besought him to release me from this engagement assuring him that my cowardice was abject and that in every point of intellect and character i was his hopeless and derisible inferior  why certainly he replied i know you better than yourself and i am well enough acquainted with human nature to understand this scene it is addressed to me he added with a smile in my character of the still untransformed but do not alarm yourself about the future let me but attain my end and not you only asenath but every woman on the face of the earth becomes my willing slave  thereupon he obliged me to rise and eat sat down with me to table helped and entertained me with the attentions of a fashionable host and it was not till a late hour that bidding me courteously goodnight he once more left me alone to my misery  in all this talk of an elixir and the restoration of his youth i scarce knew from which hypothesis i should the more eagerly recoil if his hopes reposed on any base of fact if indeed by some abhorrent miracle he should discard his age death were my only refuge from that most unnatural that most ungodly union if on the other hand these dreams were merely lunatic the madness of a life waxed suddenly acute my pity would become a load almost as heavy to bear as my revolt against the marriage so passed the night in alternations of rebellion and despair of hate and pity and with the next morning i was only to comprehend more fully my enslaved position for though he appeared with a very tranquil countenance he had no sooner observed the marks of grief upon my brow than an answering darkness gathered on his own asenath he said you owe me much already with one finger i still hold you suspended over death my life is full of labour and anxiety and i choose said he with a remarkable accent of command that you shall greet me with a pleasant face he never needed to repeat the recommendation from that day forward i was always ready to receive him with apparent cheerfulness and he rewarded me with a good deal of his company and almost more than i could bear of his confidence he had set up a laboratory in the back part of the house where he toiled day and night at his elixir and he would come thence to visit me in my parlour now with passing humours of discouragement now and far more often radiant with hope it was impossible to see so much of him and not to recognise that the sands of his life were running low and yet all the time he would be laying out vast fields of future and planning with all the confidence of youth the most unbounded schemes of pleasure and ambition how i replied i know not but i found a voice and words to answer even while i wept and raged to hear him  a week ago the doctor entered my room with the marks of great exhilaration contending with pitiful bodily weakness asenath said he i have now obtained the last ingredient in one week from now the perilous moment of the last projection will draw nigh you have once before assisted although unconsciously at the failure of a similar experiment it was the elixir which so terribly exploded one night when you were passing my house and it is idle to deny that the conduct of so delicate a process among the million jars and trepidations of so great a city presents a certain element of danger from this point of view i cannot but regret the perfect stillness of my house among the deserts but on the other hand i have succeeded in proving that the singularly unstable equilibrium of the elixir at the moment of projection is due rather to the impurity than to the nature of the ingredients and as all are now of an equal and exquisite nicety i have little fear for the result in a week then from today my dear asenath this period of trial will be ended and he smiled upon me in a manner unusually paternal  i smiled back with my lips but at my heart there raged the blackest and most unbridled terror what if he failed and oh tenfold worse what if he succeeded what detested and unnatural changeling would appear before me to claim my hand and could there i asked myself with a dreadful sinking be any truth in his boasts of an assured victory over my reluctance i knew him indeed to be masterful to lead my life at a sign suppose then this experiment to succeed suppose him to return to me hideously restored like a vampire in a legend and suppose that by some devilish fascination my head turned all former fears deserted me and i felt i could embrace the worst in preference to this  my mind was instantly made up the doctors presence in london was justified by the affairs of the mormon polity often in our conversation he would gloat over the details of that great organisation which he feared even while yet he wielded it and would remind me that even in the humming labyrinth of london we were still visible to that unsleeping eye in utah his visitors indeed who were of every sort from the missionary to the destroying angel and seemed to belong to every rank of life had up to that moment filled me with unmixed repulsion and alarm i knew that if my secret were to reach the ear of any leader my fate were sealed beyond redemption and yet in my present pass of horror and despair it was to these very men that i turned for help i waylaid upon the stair one of the mormon missionaries a man of a low class but not inaccessible to pity told him i scarce remember what elaborate fable to explain my application and by his intermediacy entered into correspondence with my fathers family they recognised my claim for help and on this very day i was to begin my escape  last night i sat up fully dressed awaiting the result of the doctors labours and prepared against the worst the nights at this season and in this northern latitude are short and i had soon the company of the returning daylight the silence in and around the house was only broken by the movements of the doctor in the laboratory to these i listened watch in hand awaiting the hour of my escape and yet consumed by anxiety about the strange experiment that was going forward overhead indeed now that i was conscious of some protection for myself my sympathies had turned more directly to the doctors side i caught myself even praying for his success and when some hours ago a low peculiar cry reached my ears from the laboratory i could no longer control my impatience but mounted the stairs and opened the door  the doctor was standing in the middle of the room in his hand a large roundbellied crystal flask some three parts full of a bright ambercoloured liquid on his face a rapture of gratitude and joy unspeakable as he saw me he raised the flask at armslength victory he cried victory asenath and thenwhether the flask escaped his trembling fingers or whether the explosion was spontaneous i cannot tellenough that we were thrown i against the doorpost the doctor into the corner of the room enough that we were shaken to the soul by the same explosion that must have startled you upon the street and that in the brief space of an indistinguishable instant there remained nothing of the labours of the doctors lifetime but a few shards of broken crystal and those voluminous and illsmelling vapours that pursued me in my flight   footnote    2 in this name the accent falls upon the e the s is sibilant     the squire of dames concluded   what with the ladys animated manner and dramatic conduct of her voice challoner had thrilled to every incident with genuine emotion his fancy which was not perhaps of a very lively character applauded both the matter and the style but the more judicial functions of his mind refused assent it was an excellent story and it might be true but he believed it was not miss fonblanque was a lady and it was doubtless possible for a lady to wander from the truth but how was a gentleman to tell her so his spirits for some time had been sinking but they now fell to zero and long after her voice had died away he still sat with a troubled and averted countenance and could find no form of words to thank her for her narrative his mind indeed was empty of everything beyond a dull longing for escape from this pause which grew the more embarrassing with every second he was roused by the sudden laughter of the lady his vanity was alarmed he turned and faced her their eyes met and he caught from hers a spark of such frank merriment as put him instantly at ease  you certainly he said appear to bear your calamities with excellent spirit  do i not she cried and fell once more into delicious laughter but from this access she more speedily recovered this is all very well said she nodding at him gravely but i am still in a most distressing situation from which if you deny me your help i shall find it difficult indeed to free myself  at this mention of help challoner fell back to his original gloom  my sympathies are much engaged with you he said and i should be delighted i am sure but our position is most unusual and circumstances over which i have i can assure you no control deprive me of the powerthe pleasureunless indeed he added somewhat brightening at the thought i were to recommend you to the care of the police  she laid her hand upon his arm and looked hard into his eyes and he saw with wonder that for the first time since the moment of their meeting every trace of colour had faded from her cheek  do so she said andweigh my words wellyou kill me as certainly as with a knife  god bless me exclaimed challoner  oh she cried i can see you disbelieve my story and make light of the perils that surround me but who are you to judge my family share my apprehensions they help me in secret and you saw yourself by what an emissary and in what a place they have chosen to supply me with the funds for my escape i admit that you are brave and clever and have impressed me most favourably but how are you to prefer your opinion before that of my uncle an exminister of state a man with the ear of the queen and of a long political experience if i am mad is he and you must allow me besides a special claim upon your help strange as you may think my story you know that much of it is true and if you who heard the explosion and saw the mormon at victoria refuse to credit and assist me to whom am i to turn  he gave you money then asked challoner who had been dwelling singly on that fact  i begin to interest you she cried but frankly you are condemned to help me if the service i had to ask of you were serious were suspicious were even unusual i should say no more but what is it to take a pleasure trip for which if you will suffer me i propose to pay and to carry from one lady to another a sum of money what can be more simple  is the sum asked challoner considerable  she produced a packet from her bosom and observing that she had not yet found time to make the count tore open the cover and spread upon her knees a considerable number of bank of england notes it took some time to make the reckoning for the notes were of every degree of value but at last and counting a few loose sovereigns she made out the sum to be a little under £710 sterling the sight of so much money worked an immediate revolution in the mind of challoner  and you propose madam he cried to intrust that money to a perfect stranger  ah said she with a charming smile but i no longer regard you as a stranger  madam said challoner i perceive i must make you a confession although of a very good familythrough my mother indeed a lineal descendant of the patriot brucei dare not conceal from you that my affairs are deeply very deeply involved i am in debt my pockets are practically empty and in short i am fallen to that state when a considerable sum of money would prove to many men an irresistible temptation  do you not see returned the young lady that by these words you have removed my last hesitation take them and she thrust the notes into the young mans hand  he sat so long holding them like a baby at the font that miss fonblanque once more bubbled into laughter  pray she said hesitate no further put them in your pocket and to relieve our position of any shadow of embarrassment tell me by what name i am to address my knighterrant for i find myself reduced to the awkwardness of the pronoun  had borrowing been in question the wisdom of our ancestors had come lightly to the young mans aid but upon what pretext could he refuse so generous a trust upon none he saw that was not unpardonably wounding and the bright eyes and the high spirits of his companion had already made a breach in the rampart of challoners caution the whole thing he reasoned might be a mere mystification which it were the height of solemn folly to resent on the other hand the explosion the interview at the publichouse and the very money in his hands seemed to prove beyond denial the existence of some serious danger and if that were so could he desert her there was a choice of risks the risk of behaving with extraordinary incivility and unhandsomeness to a lady and the risk of going on a fools errand the story seemed false but then the money was undeniable the whole circumstances were questionable and obscure but the lady was charming and had the speech and manners of society while he still hung in the wind a recollection returned upon his mind with some of the dignity of prophecy had he not promised somerset to break with the traditions of the commonplace and to accept the first adventure offered well here was the adventure  he thrust the money into his pocket  my name is challoner said he  mr challoner she replied you have come very generously to my aid when all was against me though i am myself a very humble person my family commands great interest and i do not think you will repent this handsome action  challoner flushed with pleasure  i imagine that perhaps a consulship she added her eyes dwelling on him with a judicial admiration a consulship in some great town or capitalor elsebut we waste time let us set about the work of my delivery  she took his arm with a frank confidence that went to his heart and once more laying by all serious thoughts she entertained him as they crossed the park with her agreeable gaiety of mind near the marble arch they found a hansom which rapidly conveyed them to the terminus at euston square and here in the hotel they sat down to an excellent breakfast the young ladys first step was to call for writing materials and write upon one corner of the table a hasty note still as she did so glancing with smiles at her companion here said she here is the letter which will introduce you to my cousin she began to fold the paper my cousin although i have never seen her has the character of a very charming woman and a recognised beauty of that i know nothing but at least she has been very kind to me so has my lord her father so have youkinder than allkinder than i can bear to think of she said this with unusual emotion and at the same time sealed the envelope ah she cried i have shut my letter it is not quite courteous and yet as between friends it is perhaps better so i introduce you after all into a family secret and though you and i are already old comrades you are still unknown to my uncle you go then to this address richard street glasgow go please as soon as you arrive and give this letter with your own hands into those of miss fonblanque for that is the name by which she is to pass when we next meet you will tell me what you think of her she added with a touch of the provocative  ah said challoner almost tenderly she can be nothing to me  you do not know replied the young lady with a sigh by the by i had forgottenit is very childish and i am almost ashamed to mention itbut when you see miss fonblanque you will have to make yourself a little ridiculous and i am sure the part in no way suits you we had agreed upon a watchword you will have to address an earls daughter in these words nigger nigger never die but reassure yourself she added laughing for the fair patrician will at once finish the quotation come now say your lesson  nigger nigger never die repeated challoner with undisguised reluctance  miss fonblanque went into fits of laughter excellent said she it will be the most humorous scene and she laughed again  and what will be the counterword asked challoner stiffly  i will not tell you till the last moment said she for i perceive you are growing too imperious  breakfast over she accompanied the young man to the platform bought him the graphic the athenæum and a papercutter and stood on the step conversing till the whistle sounded then she put her head into the carriage black face and shining eye she whispered and instantly leaped down upon the platform with a trill of gay and musical laughter as the train steamed out of the great arch of glass the sound of that laughter still rang in the young mans ears  challoners position was too unusual to be long welcome to his mind he found himself projected the whole length of england on a mission beset with obscure and ridiculous circumstances and yet by the trust he had accepted irrevocably bound to persevere how easy it appeared in the retrospect to have refused the whole proposal returned the money and gone forth again upon his own affairs a free and happy man and it was now impossible the enchantress who had held him with her eye had now disappeared taking his honour in pledge and as she had failed to leave him an address he was denied even the inglorious safety of retreat to use the paperknife or even to read the periodicals with which she had presented him was to renew the bitterness of his remorse and as he was alone in the compartment he passed the day staring at the landscape in impotent repentance and long before he was landed on the platform of st enochs had fallen to the lowest and coldest zones of selfcontempt  as he was hungry and elegant in his habits he would have preferred to dine and to remove the stains of travel but the words of the young lady and his own impatient eagerness would suffer no delay in the late luminous and lampstarred dusk of the summer evening he accordingly set forward with brisk steps  the street to which he was directed had first seen the day in the character of a row of small suburban villas on a hillside but the extension of the city had long since and on every hand surrounded it with miles of streets from the top of the hill a range of very tall buildings densely inhabited by the poorest classes of the population and variegated by dryingpoles from every second window overplumbed the villas and their little gardens like a seaboard cliff but still under the grime of years of city smoke these antiquated cottages with their venetian blinds and rural porticoes retained a somewhat melancholy savour of the past  the street when challoner entered it was perfectly deserted from hard by indeed the sound of a thousand footfalls filled the ear but in richard street itself there was neither light nor sound of human habitation the appearance of the neighbourhood weighed heavily on the mind of the young man once more as in the streets of london he was impressed by the sense of city deserts and as he approached the number indicated and somewhat falteringly rang the bell his heart sank within him  the bell was ancient like the house it had a thin and garrulous note and it was some time before it ceased to sound from the rear quarters of the building following upon this an inner door was stealthily opened and careful and catlike steps drew near along the hall challoner supposing he was to be instantly admitted produced his letter and as well as he was able prepared a smiling face to his indescribable surprise however the footsteps ceased and then after a pause and with the like stealthiness withdrew once more and died away in the interior of the house a second time the young man rang violently at the bell a second time to his keen hearkening a certain bustle of discreet footing moved upon the hollow boards of the old villa and again the fainthearted garrison only drew near to retreat the cup of the visitors endurance was now full to overflowing and committing the whole family of fonblanque to every mood and shade of condemnation he turned upon his heel and redescended the steps perhaps the mover in the house was watching from a window and plucked up courage at the sight of this desistance or perhaps where he lurked trembling in the back parts of the villa reason in its own right had conquered his alarms challoner at least had scarce set foot upon the pavement when he was arrested by the sound of the withdrawal of an inner bolt one followed another rattling in their sockets the key turned harshly in the lock the door opened and there appeared upon the threshold a man of a very stalwart figure in his shirt sleeves he was a person neither of great manly beauty nor of a refined exterior he was not the man in ordinary moods to attract the eyes of the observer but as he now stood in the doorway he was marked so legibly with the extreme passion of terror that challoner stood wonderstruck for a fraction of a minute they gazed upon each other in silence and then the man of the house with ashen lips and gasping voice inquired the business of his visitor challoner replied in tones from which he strove to banish his surprise that he was the bearer of a letter to a certain miss fonblanque at this name as at a talisman the man fell back and impatiently invited him to enter and no sooner had the adventurer crossed the threshold than the door was closed behind him and his retreat cut off  it was already long past eight at night and though the late twilight of the north still lingered in the streets in the passage it was already groping dark the man led challoner directly to a parlour looking on the garden to the back here he had apparently been supping for by the light of a tallow dip the table was seen to be covered with a napkin and set out with a quart of bottled ale and the heel of a gouda cheese the room on the other hand was furnished with faded solidity and the walls were lined with scholarly and costly volumes in glazed cases the house must have been taken furnished for it had no congruity with this man of the shirt sleeves and the mean supper as for the earls daughter the earl and the visionary consulships in foreign cities they had long ago begun to fade in challoners imagination like dr grierson and the mormon angels they were plainly woven of the stuff of dreams not an illusion remained to the knighterrant not a hope was left him but to be speedily relieved from this disreputable business  the man had continued to regard his visitor with undisguised anxiety and began once more to press him for his errand  i am here said challoner simply to do a service between two ladies and i must ask you without further delay to summon miss fonblanque into whose hands alone i am authorised to deliver the letter that i bear  a growing wonder began to mingle on the mans face with the lines of solicitude i am miss fonblanque he said and then perceiving the effect of this communication good god he cried what are you staring at i tell you i am miss fonblanque  seeing the speaker wore a chinbeard of considerable length and the remainder of his face was blue with shaving challoner could only suppose himself the subject of a jest he was no longer under the spell of the young ladys presence and with men and above all with his inferiors he was capable of some display of spirit  sir said he pretty roundly i have put myself to great inconvenience for persons of whom i know too little and i begin to be weary of the business either you shall immediately summon miss fonblanque or i leave this house and put myself under the direction of the police  this is horrible exclaimed the man i declare before heaven i am the person meant but how shall i convince you it must have been clara i perceive that sent you on this erranda madwoman who jests with the most deadly interests and here we are incapable perhaps of an agreement and heaven knows what may depend on our delay  he spoke with a really startling earnestness and at the same time there flashed upon the mind of challoner the ridiculous jingle which was to serve as password this may perhaps assist you he said and then with some embarrassment nigger nigger never die  a light of relief broke upon the troubled countenance of the man with the chinbeard black face and shining eyegive me the letter he panted in one gasp  well said challoner though still with some reluctance i suppose i must regard you as the proper recipient and though i may justly complain of the spirit in which i have been treated i am only too glad to be done with all responsibility here it is and he produced the envelope  the man leaped upon it like a beast and with hands that trembled in a manner painful to behold tore it open and unfolded the letter as he read terror seemed to mount upon him to the pitch of nightmare he struck one hand upon his brow while with the other as if unconsciously he crumpled the paper to a ball my gracious powers he cried and then dashing to the window which stood open on the garden he clapped forth his head and shoulders and whistled long and shrill challoner fell back into a corner and resolutely grasping his staff prepared for the most desperate events but the thoughts of the man with the chinbeard were far removed from violence turning again into the room and once more beholding his visitor whom he appeared to have forgotten he fairly danced with trepidation impossible he cried oh quite impossible o lord i have lost my head and then once more striking his hand upon his brow the money he exclaimed give me the money  my good friend replied challoner this is a very painful exhibition and until i see you reasonably master of yourself i decline to proceed with any business  you are quite right said the man i am of a very nervous habit a long course of the dumb ague has undermined my constitution but i know you have money it may be still the saving of me and oh dear young gentleman in pitys name be expeditious  challoner sincerely uneasy as he was could scarce refrain from laughter but he was himself in a hurry to be gone and without more delay produced the money you will find the sum i trust correct he observed and let me ask you to give me a receipt  but the man heeded him not he seized the money and disregarding the sovereigns that rolled loose upon the floor thrust the bundle of notes into his pocket  a receipt repeated challoner with some asperity i insist on a receipt  receipt repeated the man a little wildly a receipt immediately await me here  challoner in reply begged the gentleman to lose no unnecessary time as he was himself desirous of catching a particular train  ah by god and so am i exclaimed the man with the chinbeard and with that he was gone out of the room and had rattled upstairs four at a time to the upper story of the villa  this is certainly a most amazing business thought challoner certainly a most disquieting affair and i cannot conceal from myself that i have become mixed up with either lunatics or malefactors i may truly thank my stars that i am so nearly and so creditably done with it thus thinking and perhaps remembering the episode of the whistle he turned to the open window the garden was still faintly clear he could distinguish the stairs and terraces with which the small domain had been adorned by former owners and the blackened bushes and dead trees that had once afforded shelter to the country birds beyond these he saw the strong retaining wall some thirty feet in height which enclosed the garden to the back and again above that the pile of dingy buildings rearing its frontage high into the night a peculiar object lying stretched upon the lawn for some time baffled his eyesight but at length he had made it out to be a long ladder or series of ladders bound into one and he was still wondering of what service so great an instrument could be in such a scant enclosure when he was recalled to himself by the noise of some one running violently down the stairs this was followed by the sudden clamorous banging of the house door and that again by rapid and retreating footsteps in the street  challoner sprang into the passage he ran from room to room upstairs and downstairs and in that old dingy and wormeaten house he found himself alone only in one apartment looking to the front were there any traces of the late inhabitant a bed that had been recently slept in and not made a chest of drawers disordered by a hasty search and on the floor a roll of crumpled paper this he picked up the light in this upper story looking to the front was considerably brighter than in the parlour and he was able to make out that the paper bore the mark of the hotel at euston and even by peering closely to decipher the following lines in a very elegant and careful female hand     dear mguireit is certain your retreat is known we have just had    another failure clockwork thirty hours too soon with the usual    humiliating result zero is quite disheartened we are all scattered    and i could find no one but the solemn ass who brings you this and    the money i would love to see your meetingever yours       shining eye  challoner was stricken to the heart he perceived by what facility by what unmanly fear of ridicule he had been brought down to be the gull of this intriguer and his wrath flowed forth in almost equal measure against himself against the woman and against somerset whose idle counsels had impelled him to embark on that adventure at the same time a great and troubled curiosity and a certain chill of fear possessed his spirits the conduct of the man with the chinbeard the terms of the letter and the explosion of the early morning fitted together like parts in some obscure and mischievous imbroglio evil was certainly afoot evil secrecy terror and falsehood were the conditions and the passions of the people among whom he had begun to move like a blind puppet and he who began as a puppet his experience told him was often doomed to perish as a victim  from the stupor of deep thought into which he had glided with the letter in his hand he was awakened by the clatter of the bell he glanced from the window and conceive his horror and surprise when he beheld clustered on the steps in the front garden and on the pavement of the street a formidable posse of police he started to the full possession of his powers and courage escape and escape at any cost was the one idea that possessed him swiftly and silently he redescended the creaking stairs he was already in the passage when a second and more imperious summons from the door awoke the echoes of the empty house nor had the bell ceased to jangle before he had bestridden the windowsill of the parlour and was lowering himself into the garden his coat was hooked upon the iron flowerbasket for a moment he hung dependent heels and head below and then with the noise of rending cloth and followed by several pots he dropped upon the sod once more the bell was rung and now with furious and repeated peals the desperate challoner turned his eyes on every side they fell upon the ladder and he ran to it and with strenuous but unavailing effort sought to raise it from the ground suddenly the weight which was thus resisting his whole strength began to lighten in his hands the ladder like a thing of life reared its bulk from off the sod and challoner leaping back with a cry of almost superstitious terror beheld the whole structure mount foot by foot against the face of the retainingwall at the same time two heads were dimly visible above the parapet and he was hailed by a guarded whistle something in its modulation recalled like an echo the whistle of the man with the chinbeard  had he chanced upon a means of escape prepared beforehand by those very miscreants whose messenger and gull he had become was this indeed a means of safety or but the startingpoint of further complication and disaster he paused not to reflect scarce was the ladder reared to its full length than he had sprung already on the rounds hand over hand swift as an ape he scaled the tottering stairway strong arms received embraced and helped him he was lifted and set once more upon the earth and with the spasm of his alarm yet unsubsided found himself in the company of two roughlooking men in the paved backyard of one of the tall houses that crowned the summit of the hill meanwhile from below the note of the bell had been succeeded by the sound of vigorous and redoubling blows  are you all out asked one of his companions and as soon as he had babbled an answer in the affirmative the rope was cut from the top round and the ladder thrust roughly back into the garden where it fell and broke with clattering reverberations its fall was hailed with many broken cries for the whole of richard street was now in high emotion the people crowding to the windows or clambering on the garden walls the same man who had already addressed challoner seized him by the arm whisked him through the basement of the house and across the street upon the other side and before the unfortunate adventurer had time to realise his situation a door was opened and he was thrust into a low and dark compartment  bedad observed his guide there was no time to lose is mguire gone or was it you that whistled  mguire is gone said challoner  the guide now struck a light ah said he this will never do you dare not go upon the streets in such a figure wait quietly here and i will bring you something decent  with that the man was gone and challoner his attention thus rudely awakened began ruefully to consider the havoc that had been worked in his attire his hat was gone his trousers were cruelly ripped and the best part of one tail of his very elegant frockcoat had been left hanging from the iron crockets of the window he had scarce had time to measure these disasters when his host reentered the apartment and proceeded without a word to envelop the refined and urbane challoner in a long ulster of the cheapest material and of a pattern so gross and vulgar that his spirit sickened at the sight this calumnious disguise was crowned and completed by a soft felt hat of the tyrolese design and several sizes too small at another moment challoner would simply have refused to issue forth upon the world thus travestied but the desire to escape from glasgow was now too strongly and too exclusively impressed upon his mind with one haggard glance at the spotted tails of his new coat he inquired what was to pay for this accoutrement the man assured him that the whole expense was easily met from funds in his possession and begged him instead of wasting time to make his best speed out of the neighbourhood  the young man was not loath to take the hint true to his usual courtesy he thanked the speaker and complimented him upon his taste in greatcoats and leaving the man somewhat abashed by these remarks and the manner of their delivery he hurried forth into the lamplit city the last train was gone ere after many deviations he had reached the terminus attired as he was he dared not present himself at any reputable inn and he felt keenly that the unassuming dignity of his demeanour would serve to attract attention perhaps mirth and possibly suspicion in any humbler hostelry he was thus condemned to pass the solemn and uneventful hours of a whole night in pacing the streets of glasgow supperless a figure of fun for all beholders waiting the dawn with hope indeed but with unconquerable shrinkings and above all things filled with a profound sense of the folly and weakness of his conduct it may be conceived with what curses he assailed the memory of the fair narrator of hyde park her parting laughter rang in his ears all night with damning mockery and iteration and when he could spare a thought from this chief artificer of his confusion it was to expend his wrath on somerset and the career of the amateur detective with the coming of the day he found in a shy milkshop the means to appease his hunger there were still many hours to wait before the departure of the south express these he passed wandering with indescribable fatigue in the obscurer bystreets of the city and at length slipped quietly into the station and took his place in the darkest corner of a thirdclass carriage here all day long he jolted on the bare boards distressed by heat and continually reawakened from uneasy slumbers by the half return ticket in his purse he was entitled to make the journey on the easy cushions and with the ample space of the firstclass but alas in his absurd attire he durst not for decency commingle with his equals and this small annoyance coming last in such a series of disasters cut him to the heart  that night when in his putney lodging he reviewed the expense anxiety and weariness of his adventure when he beheld the ruins of his last good trousers and his last presentable coat and above all when his eye by any chance alighted on the tyrolese hat or the degrading ulster his heart would overflow with bitterness and it was only by a serious call on his philosophy that he maintained the dignity of his demeanour     somersets adventure  the superfluous mansion   mr paul somerset was a young gentleman of a lively and fiery imagination with very small capacity for action he was one who lived exclusively in dreams and in the future the creature of his own theories and an actor in his own romances from the cigar divan he proceeded to parade the streets still heated with the fire of his eloquence and scouting upon every side for the offer of some fortunate adventure in the continual stream of passersby on the sealed fronts of houses on the posters that covered the hoardings and in every lineament and throb of the great city he saw a mysterious and hopeful hieroglyph but although the elements of adventure were streaming by him as thick as drops of water in the thames it was in vain that now with a beseeching now with something of a braggadocio air he courted and provoked the notice of the passengers in vain that putting fortune to the touch he even thrust himself into the way and came into direct collision with those of the more promising demeanour persons brimful of secrets persons pining for affection persons perishing for lack of help or counsel he was sure he could perceive on every side but by some contrariety of fortune each passed upon his way without remarking the young gentleman and went farther surely to fare worse in quest of the confidant the friend or the adviser to thousands he must have turned an appealing countenance and yet not one regarded him  a light dinner eaten to the accompaniment of his impetuous aspirations broke in upon the series of his attempts on fortune and when he returned to the task the lamps were already lighted and the nocturnal crowd was dense upon the pavement before a certain restaurant whose name will readily occur to any student of our babylon people were already packed so closely that passage had grown difficult and somerset standing in the kennel watched with a hope that was beginning to grow somewhat weary the faces and the manners of the crowd suddenly he was startled by a gentle touch upon the shoulder and facing about he was aware of a very plain and elegant brougham drawn by a pair of powerful horses and driven by a man in sober livery there were no arms upon the panel the window was open but the interior was obscure the driver yawned behind his palm and the young man was already beginning to suppose himself the dupe of his own fancy when a hand no larger than a childs and smoothly gloved in white appeared in a corner of the window and privily beckoned him to approach he did so and looked in the carriage was occupied by a single small and very dainty figure swathed head and shoulders in impenetrable folds of white lace and a voice speaking low and silvery addressed him in these words  open the door and get in  it must be thought the young man with an almost unbearable thrill it must be that duchess at last yet although the moment was one to which he had long looked forward it was with a certain share of alarm that he opened the door and mounting into the brougham took his seat beside the lady of the lace whether or no she had touched a spring or given some other signal the young man had hardly closed the door before the carriage with considerable swiftness and with a very luxurious and easy movement on its springs turned and began to drive towards the west  somerset as i have written was not unprepared it had long been his particular pleasure to rehearse his conduct in the most unlikely situations and this among others of the patrician ravisher was one he had familiarly studied strange as it may seem however he could find no apposite remark and as the lady on her side vouchsafed no further sign they continued to drive in silence through the streets except for alternate flashes from the passing lamps the carriage was plunged in obscurity and beyond the fact that the fittings were luxurious and that the lady was singularly small and slender in person and all but one gloved hand still swathed in her costly veil the young man could decipher no detail of an inspiring nature the suspense began to grow unbearable twice he cleared his throat and twice the whole resources of the language failed him in similar scenes when he had forecast them on the theatre of fancy his presence of mind had always been complete his eloquence remarkable and at this disparity between the rehearsal and the performance he began to be seized with a panic of apprehension here on the very threshold of adventure suppose him ignominiously to fail suppose that after ten twenty or sixty seconds of still uninterrupted silence the lady should touch the checkstring and redeposit him weighed and found wanting on the common street thousands of persons of no mind at all he reasoned would be found more equal to the part could that very instant by some decisive step prove the ladys choice to have been well inspired and put a stop to this intolerable silence  his eye at this point lighted on the hand it was better to fall by desperate councils than to continue as he was and with one tremulous swoop he pounced on the gloved fingers and drew them to himself one overt step it had appeared to him would dissolve the spell of his embarrassment in act he found it otherwise he found himself no less incapable of speech or further progress and with the ladys hand in his sat helpless but worse was in store a peculiar quivering began to agitate the form of his companion the hand that lay unresistingly in somersets trembled as with ague and presently there broke forth in the shadow of the carriage the bubbling and musical sound of laughter resisted but triumphant the young man dropped his prize had it been possible he would have bounded from the carriage the lady meanwhile lying back upon the cushions passed on from trill to trill of the most heartfelt highpitched clear and fairysounding merriment  you must not be offended she said at last catching an opportunity between two paroxysms if you have been mistaken in the warmth of your attentions the fault is solely mine it does not flow from your presumption but from my eccentric manner of recruiting friends and believe me i am the last person in the world to think the worse of a young man for showing spirit as for tonight it is my intention to entertain you to a little supper and if i shall continue to be as much pleased with your manners as i was taken with your face i may perhaps end by making you an advantageous offer  somerset sought in vain to find some form of answer but his discomfiture had been too recent and complete  come returned the lady we must have no display of temper that is for me the one disqualifying fault and as i perceive we are drawing near our destination i shall ask you to descend and offer me your arm  indeed at that very moment the carriage drew up before a stately and severe mansion in a spacious square and somerset who was possessed of an excellent temper with the best grace in the world assisted the lady to alight the door was opened by an old woman of a grim appearance who ushered the pair into a diningroom somewhat dimly lighted but already laid for supper and occupied by a prodigious company of large and valuable cats here as soon as they were alone the lady divested herself of the lace in which she was enfolded and somerset was relieved to find that although still bearing the traces of great beauty and still distinguished by the fire and colour of her eye her hair was of silvery whiteness and her face lined with years  and now mon preux said the old lady nodding at him with a quaint gaiety you perceive that i am no longer in my first youth you will soon find that i am all the better company for that  as she spoke the maid reentered the apartment with a light but tasteful supper they sat down accordingly to table the cats with savage pantomime surrounding the old ladys chair and what with the excellence of the meal and the gaiety of his entertainer somerset was soon completely at his ease when they had well eaten and drunk the old lady leaned back in her chair and taking a cat upon her lap subjected her guest to a prolonged but evidently mirthful scrutiny  i fear madam said somerset that my manners have not risen to the height of your preconceived opinion  my dear young man she replied you were never more mistaken in your life i find you charming and you may very well have lighted on a fairy godmother i am not one of those who are given to change their opinions and short of substantial demerit those who have once gained my favour continue to enjoy it but i have a singular swiftness of decision read my fellow men and women with a glance and have acted throughout life on first impressions yours as i tell you has been favourable and if as i suppose you are a young fellow of somewhat idle habits i think it not improbable that we may strike a bargain  ah madam returned somerset you have divined my situation i am a man of birth parts and breeding excellent company or at least so i find myself but by a peculiar iniquity of fate destitute alike of trade or money i was indeed this evening upon the quest of an adventure resolved to close with any offer of interest emolument or pleasure and your summons which i profess i am still at some loss to understand jumped naturally with the inclination of my mind call it if you will impudence i am here at least prepared for any proposition you can find it in your heart to make and resolutely determined to accept  you express yourself very well replied the old lady and are certainly a droll and curious young man i should not care to affirm that you were sane for i have never found any one entirely so besides myself but at least the nature of your madness entertains me and i will reward you with some description of my character and life  thereupon the old lady still fondling the cat upon her lap proceeded to narrate the following particulars     narrative of the spirited old lady   i was the eldest daughter of the reverend bernard fanshawe who held a valuable living in the diocese of bath and wells our family a very large one was noted for a sprightly and incisive wit and came of a good old stock where beauty was an heirloom in christian grace of character we were unhappily deficient from my earliest years i saw and deplored the defects of those relatives whose age and position should have enabled them to conquer my esteem and while i was yet a child my father married a second wife in whom strange to say the fanshawe failings were exaggerated to a monstrous and almost laughable degree whatever may be said against me it cannot be denied i was a pattern daughter but it was in vain that with the most touching patience i submitted to my stepmothers demands and from the hour she entered my fathers house i may say that i met with nothing but injustice and ingratitude  i stood not alone however in the sweetness of my disposition for one other of the family besides myself was free from any violence of character before i had reached the age of sixteen this cousin john by name had conceived for me a sincere but silent passion and although the poor lad was too timid to hint at the nature of his feelings i had soon divined and begun to share them for some days i pondered on the odd situation created for me by the bashfulness of my admirer and at length perceiving that he begun in his distress rather to avoid than seek my company i determined to take the matter into my own hands finding him alone in a retired part of the rectory garden i told him that i had divined his amiable secret that i knew with what disfavour our union was sure to be regarded and that under the circumstances i was prepared to flee with him at once poor john was literally paralysed with joy such was the force of his emotions that he could find no words in which to thank me and that i seeing him thus helpless was obliged to arrange myself the details of our flight and of the stolen marriage which was immediately to crown it john had been at that time projecting a visit to the metropolis in this i bade him persevere and promised on the following day to join him at the tavistock hotel  true on my side to every detail of our arrangement i arose on the day in question before the servants packed a few necessaries in a bag took with me the little money i possessed and bade farewell for ever to the rectory i walked with good spirits to a town some thirty miles from home and was set down the next morning in this great city of london as i walked from the coachoffice to the hotel i could not help exulting in the pleasant change that had befallen me beholding meanwhile with innocent delight the traffic of the streets and depicting in all the colours of fancy the reception that awaited me from john but alas when i inquired for mr fanshawe the porter assured me there was no such gentleman among the guests by what channel our secret had leaked out or what pressure had been brought to bear on the too facile john i could never fathom enough that my family had triumphed that i found myself alone in london tender in years smarting under the most sensible mortification and by every sentiment of pride and selfrespect debarred for ever from my fathers house  i rose under the blow and found lodgings in the neighbourhood of euston road where for the first time in my life i tasted the joys of independence three days afterwards an advertisement in the times directed me to the office of a solicitor whom i knew to be in my fathers confidence there i was given the promise of a very moderate allowance and a distinct intimation that i must never look to be received at home i could not but resent so cruel a desertion and i told the lawyer it was a meeting i desired as little as themselves he smiled at my courageous spirit paid me the first quarter of my income and gave me the remainder of my personal effects which had been sent to me under his care in a couple of rather ponderous boxes with these i returned in triumph to my lodgings more content with my position than i should have thought possible a week before and fully determined to make the best of the future  all went well for several months and indeed it was my own fault alone that ended this pleasant and secluded episode of life i have i must confess the fatal trick of spoiling my inferiors my landlady to whom i had as usual been overkind impertinently called me in fault for some particular too small to mention and i annoyed that i had allowed her the freedom upon which she thus presumed ordered her to leave my presence she stood a moment dumb and then recalling her selfpossession your bill said she shall be ready this evening and tomorrow madam you shall leave my house see she added that you are able to pay what you owe me for if i do not receive the uttermost farthing no box of yours shall pass my threshold  i was confounded at her audacity but as a whole quarters income was due to me not otherwise affected by the threat that afternoon as i left the solicitors door carrying in one hand and done up in a paper parcel the whole amount of my fortune there befell me one of those decisive incidents that sometimes shape a life the lawyers office was situated in a street that opened at the upper end upon the strand and was closed at the lower at the time of which i speak by a row of iron railings looking on the thames down this street then i beheld my stepmother advancing to meet me and doubtless bound to the very house i had just left she was attended by a maid whose face was new to me but her own was too clearly printed on my memory and the sight of it even from a distance filled me with generous indignation flight was impossible there was nothing left but to retreat against the railing and with my back turned to the street pretend to be admiring the barges on the river or the chimneys of transpontine london  i was still so standing and had not yet fully mastered the turbulence of my emotions when a voice at my elbow addressed me with a trivial question it was the maid whom my stepmother with characteristic hardness had left to await her on the street while she transacted her business with the family solicitor the girl did not know who i was the opportunity was too golden to be lost and i was soon hearing the latest news of my fathers rectory and parish it did not surprise me to find that she detested her employers and yet the terms in which she spoke of them were hard to bear hard to let pass unchallenged i heard them however without dissent for my selfcommand is wonderful and we might have parted as we met had she not proceeded in an evil hour to criticise the rectors missing daughter and with the most shocking perversions to narrate the story of her flight my nature is so essentially generous that i can never pause to reason i flung up my hand sharply by way as well as i remember of indignant protest and in the act the packet slipped from my fingers glanced between the railings and fell and sunk in the river i stood a moment petrified and then struck by the drollery of the incident gave way to peals of laughter i was still laughing when my stepmother reappeared and the maid who doubtless considered me insane ran off to join her nor had i yet recovered my gravity when i presented myself before the lawyer to solicit a fresh advance his answer made me serious enough for it was a flat refusal and it was not until i had besought him even with tears that he consented to lend me ten pounds from his own pocket i am a poor man said he and you must look for nothing further at my hands  the landlady met me at the door here madam said she with a curtsey insolently low here is my bill would it inconvenience you to settle it at once  you shall be paid madam said i in the morning in the proper course and i took the paper with a very high air but inwardly quaking  i had no sooner looked at it than i perceived myself to be lost i had been short of money and had allowed my debt to mount and it had now reached the sum which i shall never forget of twelve pounds thirteen and fourpence halfpenny all evening i sat by the fire considering my situation i could not pay the bill my landlady would not suffer me to remove my boxes and without either baggage or money how was i to find another lodging for three months unless i could invent some remedy i was condemned to be without a roof and without a penny it can surprise no one that i decided on immediate flight but even here i was confronted by a difficulty for i had no sooner packed my boxes than i found i was not strong enough to move far less to carry them  in this strait i did not hesitate a moment but throwing on a shawl and bonnet and covering my face with a thick veil i betook myself to that great bazaar of dangerous and smiling chances the pavement of the city it was already late at night and the weather being wet and windy there were few abroad besides policemen these on my present mission i had wit enough to know for enemies and wherever i perceived their moving lanterns i made haste to turn aside and choose another thoroughfare a few miserable women still walked the pavement here and there were young fellows returning drunk or ruffians of the lowest class lurking in the mouths of alleys but of any one to whom i might appeal in my distress i began almost to despair  at last at the corner of a street i ran into the arms of one who was evidently a gentleman and who in all his appointments from his furred greatcoat to the fine cigar which he was smoking comfortably breathed of wealth much as my face has changed from its original beauty i still retain or so i tell myself some traces of the youthful lightness of my figure even veiled as i then was i could perceive the gentleman was struck by my appearance and this emboldened me for my adventure  sir said i with a quickly beating heart sir are you one in whom a lady can confide  why my dear said he removing his cigar that depends on circumstances if you will raise your veil  sir i interrupted let there be no mistake i ask you as a gentleman to serve me but i offer no reward  that is frank said he but hardly tempting and what may i inquire is the nature of the service  but i knew well enough it was not my interest to tell him on so short an interview if you will accompany me said i to a house not far from here you can see for yourself  he looked at me awhile with hesitating eyes and then tossing away his cigar which was not yet a quarter smoked here goes said he and with perfect politeness offered me his arm i was wise enough to take it to prolong our walk as far as possible by more than one excursion from the shortest line and to beguile the way with that sort of conversation which should prove to him indubitably from what station in society i sprang by the time we reached the door of my lodging i felt sure i had confirmed his interest and might venture before i turned the passkey to beseech him to moderate his voice and to tread softly he promised to obey me and i admitted him into the passage and thence into my sittingroom which was fortunately next the door  and now said he when with trembling fingers i had lighted a candle what is the meaning of all this  i wish you said i speaking with great difficulty to help me out with these boxesand i wish nobody to know  he took up the candle and i wish to see your face said he  i turned back my veil without a word and looked at him with every appearance of resolve that i could summon up for some time he gazed into my face still holding up the candle well said he at last and where do you wish them taken  i knew that i had gained my point and it was with a tremor in my voice that i replied i had thought we might carry them between us to the corner of euston road said i where even at this late hour we may still find a cab  very good was his reply and he immediately hoisted the heavier of my trunks upon his shoulder and taking one handle of the second signed to me to help him at the other end in this order we made good our retreat from the house and without the least adventure drew pretty near to the corner of euston road before a house where there was a light still burning my companion paused let us here said he set down our boxes while we go forward to the end of the street in quest of a cab by doing so we can still keep an eye upon their safety and we avoid the very extraordinary figure we should otherwise presenta young man a young lady and a mass of baggage standing castaway at midnight on the streets of london so it was done and the event proved him to be wise for long before there was any word of a cab a policeman appeared upon the scene turned upon us the full glare of his lantern and hung suspiciously behind us in a doorway  there seem to be no cabs about policeman said my champion with affected cheerfulness but the constables answer was ungracious and as for the offer of a cigar with which this rebuff was most unwisely followed up he refused it pointblank and without the least civility the young gentleman looked at me with a warning grimace and there we continued to stand on the edge of the pavement in the beating rain and with the policeman still silently watching our movements from the doorway  at last and after a delay that seemed interminable a fourwheeler appeared lumbering along in the mud and was instantly hailed by my companion just pull up here will you he cried we have some baggage up the street  and now came the hitch of our adventure for when the policeman still closely following us beheld my two boxes lying in the rain he arose from mere suspicion to a kind of certitude of something evil the light in the house had been extinguished the whole frontage of the street was dark there was nothing to explain the presence of these unguarded trunks and no two innocent people were ever i believe detected in such questionable circumstances  where have these things come from asked the policeman flashing his light full into my champions face  why from that house of course replied the young gentleman hastily shouldering a trunk  the policeman whistled and turned to look at the dark windows he then took a step towards the door as though to knock a course which had infallibly proved our ruin but seeing us already hurrying down the street under our double burthen thought better or worse of it and followed in our wake  for gods sake whispered my companion tell me where to drive to  anywhere i replied with anguish i have no idea anywhere you like  thus it fell that when the boxes had been stowed and i had already entered the cab my deliverer called out in clear tones the address of the house in which we are now seated the policeman i could see was staggered this neighbourhood so retired so aristocratic was far from what he had expected for all that he took the number of the cab and spoke for a few seconds and with a decided manner in the cabmans ear  what can he have said i gasped as soon as the cab had rolled away  i can very well imagine replied my champion and i can assure you that you are now condemned to go where i have said for should we attempt to change our destination by the way the jarvey will drive us straight to a policeoffice let me compliment you on your nerves he added i have had i believe the most horrible fright of my existence  but my nerves which he so much misjudged were in so strange a disarray that speech was now become impossible and we made the drive thenceforward in unbroken silence when we arrived before the door of our destination the young gentleman alighted opened it with a passkey like one who was at home bade the driver carry the trunks into the hall and dismissed him with a handsome fee he then led me into this diningroom looking nearly as you behold it but with certain marks of bachelor occupancy and hastened to pour out a glass of wine which he insisted on my drinking as soon as i could find my voice in gods name i cried where am i  he told me i was in his house where i was very welcome and had no more urgent business than to rest myself and recover my spirits as he spoke he offered me another glass of wine of which indeed i stood in great want for i was faint and inclined to be hysterical then he sat down beside the fire lit another cigar and for some time observed me curiously in silence  and now said he that you have somewhat restored yourself will you be kind enough to tell me in what sort of crime i have become a partner are you murderer smuggler thief or only the harmless and domestic moonlight flitter  i had been already shocked by his lighting a cigar without permission for i had not forgotten the one he threw away on our first meeting and now at these explicit insults i resolved at once to reconquer his esteem the judgment of the world i have consistently despised but i had already begun to set a certain value on the good opinion of my entertainer beginning with a note of pathos but soon brightening into my habitual vivacity and humour i rapidly narrated the circumstances of my birth my flight and subsequent misfortunes he heard me to an end in silence gravely smoking miss fanshawe said he when i had done you are a very comical and most enchanting creature and i can see nothing for it but that i should return tomorrow morning and satisfy your landladys demands  you strangely misinterpret my confidence was my reply and if you had at all appreciated my character you would understand that i can take no money at your hands  your landlady will doubtless not be so particular he returned nor do i at all despair of persuading even your unconquerable self i desire you to examine me with critical indulgence my name is henry luxmore lord southwarks second son i possess nine thousand a year the house in which we are now sitting and seven others in the best neighbourhoods in town i do not believe i am repulsive to the eye and as for my character you have seen me under trial i think you simply the most original of created things i need not tell you what you know very well that you are ravishingly pretty and i have nothing more to add except that foolish as it may appear i am already head over heels in love with you  sir said i i am prepared to be misjudged but while i continue to accept your hospitality that fact alone should be enough to protect me from insult  pardon me said he i offer you marriage and leaning back in his chair he replaced his cigar between his lips  i own i was confounded by an offer not only so unprepared but couched in terms so singular but he knew very well how to obtain his purposes for he was not only handsome in person but his very coolness had a charm and to make a long story short a fortnight later i became the wife of the honourable henry luxmore  for nearly twenty years i now led a life of almost perfect quiet my henry had his weaknesses i was twice driven to flee from his roof but not for long for though he was easily overexcited his nature was placable below the surface and with all his faults i loved him tenderly at last he was taken from me and such is the power of selfdeception and so strange are the whims of the dying he actually assured me with his latest breath that he forgave the violence of my temper  there was but one pledge of the marriage my daughter clara she had indeed inherited a shadow of her fathers failing but in all things else unless my partial eyes deceived me she derived her qualities from me and might be called my moral image on my side whatever else i may have done amiss as a mother i was above reproach here then was surely every promise for the future here at last was a relation in which i might hope to taste repose but it was not to be you will hardly credit me when i inform you that she ran away from home yet such was the case some whim about oppressed nationalitiesireland poland and the likehas turned her brain and if you should anywhere encounter a young lady i must say of remarkable attractions answering to the name of luxmore lake or fonblanque for i am told she uses these indifferently as well as many others tell her from me that i forgive her cruelty and though i will never more behold her face i am at any time prepared to make her a liberal allowance  on the death of mr luxmore i sought oblivion in the details of business i believe i have mentioned that seven mansions besides this formed part of mr luxmores property i have found them seven white elephants the greed of tenants the dishonesty of solicitors and the incapacity that sits upon the bench have combined together to make these houses the burthen of my life i had no sooner indeed begun to look into these matters for myself than i discovered so many injustices and met with so much studied incivility that i was plunged into a long series of lawsuits some of which are pending to this day you must have heard my name already i am the mrs luxmore of the law reports a strange destiny indeed for one born with an almost cowardly desire for peace but i am of the stamp of those who when they have once begun a task will rather die than leave their duty unfulfilled i have met with every obstacle insolence and ingratitude from my own lawyers in my adversaries that fault of obstinacy which is to me perhaps the most distasteful in the calendar from the bench civility indeedalways i must allow civilitybut never a spark of independence never that knowledge of the law and love of justice which we have a right to look for in a judge the most august of human officers and still against all these odds i have undissuadably persevered  it was after the loss of one of my innumerable cases a subject on which i will not dwell that it occurred to me to make a melancholy pilgrimage to my various houses four were at that time tenantless and closed like pillars of salt commemorating the corruption of the age and the decline of private virtue three were occupied by persons who had wearied me by every conceivable unjust demand and legal subterfugepersons whom at that very hour i was moving heaven and earth to turn into the streets this was perhaps the sadder spectacle of the two and my heart grew hot within me to behold them occupying in my very teeth and with an insolent ostentation these handsome structures which were as much mine as the flesh upon my body  one more house remained for me to visit that in which we now are i had let it for at that period i lodged in a hotel the life that i have always preferred to a colonel geraldine a gentleman attached to prince florizel of bohemia whom you must certainly have heard of and i had supposed from the character and position of my tenant that here at least i was safe against annoyance what was my surprise to find this house also shuttered and apparently deserted i will not deny that i was offended i conceived that a house like a yacht was better to be kept in commission and i promised myself to bring the matter before my solicitor the following morning meanwhile the sight recalled my fancy naturally to the past and yielding to the tender influence of sentiment i sat down opposite the door upon the garden parapet it was august and a sultry afternoon but that spot is sheltered as you may observe by daylight under the branches of a spreading chestnut the square too was deserted there was a sound of distant music in the air and all combined to plunge me into that most agreeable of states which is neither happiness nor sorrow but shares the poignancy of both  from this i was recalled by the arrival of a large van very handsomely appointed drawn by valuable horses mounted by several men of an appearance more than decent and bearing on its panels instead of a traders name a coat of arms too modest to be deciphered from where i sat it drew up before my house the door of which was immediately opened by one of the men his companionsi counted seven of them in allproceeded with disciplined activity to take from the van and carry into the house a variety of hampers bottlebaskets and boxes such as are designed for plate and napery the windows of the diningroom were thrown widely open as though to air it and i saw some of those within laying the table for a meal plainly i concluded my tenant was about to return and while still determined to submit to no aggression on my rights i was gratified by the number and discipline of his attendants and the quiet profusion that appeared to reign in his establishment i was still so thinking when to my extreme surprise the windows and shutters of the diningroom were once more closed the men began to reappear from the interior and resume their stations on the van the last closed the door behind his exit the van drove away and the house was once more left to itself looking blindly on the square with shuttered windows as though the whole affair had been a vision  it was no vision however for as i rose to my feet and thus brought my eyes a little nearer to the level of the fanlight over the door i saw that though the day had still some hours to run the hall lamps had been lighted and left burning plainly then guests were expected and were not expected before night for whom i asked myself with indignation were such secret preparations likely to be made although no prude i am a woman of decided views upon morality if my house to which my husband had brought me was to serve in the character of a petite maison i saw myself forced however unwillingly into a new course of litigation and determined to return and know the worst i hastened to my hotel for dinner  i was at my post by ten the night was clear and quiet the moon rode very high and put the lamps to shame and the shadow below the chestnut was black as ink here then i ensconced myself on the low parapet with my back against the railings face to face with the moonlit front of my old home and ruminating gently on the past time fled eleven struck on all the city clocks and presently after i was aware of the approach of a gentleman of stately and agreeable demeanour he was smoking as he walked his light paletot which was open did not conceal his evening clothes and he bore himself with a serious grace that immediately awakened my attention before the door of this house he took a passkey from his pocket quietly admitted himself and disappeared into the lamplit hall  he was scarcely gone when i observed another and a much younger man approaching hastily from the opposite side of the square considering the season of the year and the genial mildness of the night he was somewhat closely muffled up and as he came for all his hurry he kept looking nervously behind him arrived before my door he halted and set one foot upon the step as though about to enter then with a sudden change he turned and began to hurry away halted a second time as if in painful indecision and lastly with a violent gesture wheeled about returned straight to the door and rapped upon the knocker he was almost immediately admitted by the first arrival  my curiosity was now broad awake i made myself as small as i could in the very densest of the shadow and waited for the sequel nor had i long to wait from the same side of the square a second young man made his appearance walking slowly and softly and like the first muffled to the nose before the house he paused looked all about him with a swift and comprehensive glance and seeing the square lie empty in the moon and lamplight leaned far across the area railings and appeared to listen to what was passing in the house from the diningroom there came the report of a champagne cork and following upon that the sound of rich and manly laughter the listener took heart of grace produced a key unlocked the area gate shut it noiselessly behind him and descended the stair just when his head had reached the level of the pavement he turned half round and once more raked the square with a suspicious eyeshot the mufflings had fallen lower round his neck the moon shone full upon him and i was startled to observe the pallor and passionate agitation of his face  i could remain no longer passive persuaded that something deadly was afoot i crossed the roadway and drew near the area railings there was no one below the man must therefore have entered the house with what purpose i dreaded to imagine i have at no part of my career lacked courage and now finding the area gate was merely laidto i pushed it gently open and descended the stairs the kitchen door of the house like the area gate was closed but not fastened it flashed upon me that the criminal was thus preparing his escape and the thought as it confirmed the worst of my suspicions lent me new resolve i entered the house and being now quite reckless of my life i shut and locked the door  from the diningroom above i could hear the pleasant tones of a voice in easy conversation on the ground floor all was not only profoundly silent but the darkness seemed to weigh upon my eyes here then i stood for some time having thrust myself uncalled into the utmost peril and being destitute of any power to help or interfere nor will i deny that fear had begun already to assail me when i became aware all at once and as though by some immediate but silent incandescence of a certain glimmering of light upon the passage floor towards this i groped my way with infinite precaution and having come at length as far as the angle of the corridor beheld the door of the butlers pantry standing just ajar and a narrow thread of brightness falling from the chink creeping still closer i put my eye to the aperture the man sat within upon a chair listening i could see with the most rapt attention on a table before him he had laid a watch a pair of steel revolvers and a bullseye lantern for one second many contradictory theories and projects whirled together in my head the next i had slammed the door and turned the key upon the malefactor surprised at my own decision i stood and panted leaning on the wall from within the pantry not a sound was to be heard the man whatever he was had accepted his fate without a struggle and now as i hugged myself to fancy sat frozen with terror and looking for the worst to follow i promised myself that he should not be disappointed and the better to complete my task i turned to ascend the stairs  the situation as i groped my way to the first floor appealed to me suddenly by my strong sense of humour here was i the owner of the house burglariously present in its walls and there in the diningroom were two gentlemen unknown to me seated complacently at supper and only saved by my promptitude from some surprising or deadly interruption it were strange if i could not manage to extract the matter of amusement from so unusual a situation  behind this diningroom there is a small apartment intended for a library it was to this that i cautiously groped my way and you will see how fortune had exactly served me the weather i have said was sultry in order to ventilate the diningroom and yet preserve the uninhabited appearance of the mansion to the front the window of the library had been widely opened and the door of communication between the two apartments left ajar to this interval i now applied my eye  wax tapers set in silver candlesticks shed their chastened brightness on the damask of the tablecloth and the remains of a cold collation of the rarest delicacy the two gentlemen had finished supper and were now trifling with cigars and maraschino while in a silver spiritlamp coffee of the most captivating fragrance was preparing in the fashion of the east the elder of the two he who had first arrived was placed directly facing me the other was set on his left hand both like the man in the butlers pantry seemed to be intently listening and on the face of the second i thought i could perceive the marks of fear oddly enough however when they came to speak the parts were found to be reversed  i assure you said the elder gentleman i not only heard the slamming of a door but the sound of very guarded footsteps  your highness was certainly deceived replied the other i am endowed with the acutest hearing and i can swear that not a mouse has rustled yet the pallor and contraction of his features were in total discord with the tenor of his words  his highness whom of course i readily divined to be prince florizel looked at his companion for the least fraction of a second and though nothing shook the easy quiet of his attitude i could see that he was far from being duped it is well said he let us dismiss the topic and now sir that i have very freely explained the sentiments by which i am directed let me ask you according to your promise to imitate my frankness  i have heard you replied the other with great interest  with singular patience said the prince politely  ay your highness and with unlookedfor sympathy returned the young man i know not how to tell the change that has befallen me you have i must suppose a charm to which even your enemies are subject he looked at the clock on the mantelpiece and visibly blanched so late he cried your highnessgod knows i am now speaking from the heartbefore it be too late leave this house  the prince glanced once more at his companion and then very deliberately shook the ash from his cigar that is a strange remark said he and à propos de bottes i never continue a cigar when once the ash is fallen the spell breaks the soul of the flavour flies away and there remains but the dead body of tobacco and i make it a rule to throw away that husk and choose another he suited the action to the words  do not trifle with my appeal resumed the young man in tones that trembled with emotion it is made at the price of my honour and to the peril of my life gogo now lose not a moment and if you have any kindness for a young man miserably deceived indeed but not devoid of better sentiments look not behind you as you leave  sir said the prince i am here upon your honour i assure you upon mine that i shall continue to rely upon that safeguard the coffee is ready i must again trouble you i fear and with a courteous movement of the hand he seemed to invite his companion to pour out the coffee  the unhappy young man rose from his seat i appeal to you he cried by every holy sentiment in mercy to me if not in pity to yourself begone before it is too late  sir replied the prince i am not readily accessible to fear and if there is one defect to which i must plead guilty it is that of a curious disposition you go the wrong way about to make me leave this house in which i play the part of your entertainer and suffer me to add young man if any peril threaten us it was of your contriving not of mine  alas you do not know to what you condemn me cried the other but i at least will have no hand in it with these words he carried his hand to his pocket hastily swallowed the contents of a phial and with the very act reeled back and fell across his chair upon the floor the prince left his place and came and stood above him where he lay convulsed upon the carpet poor moth i heard his highness murmur alas poor moth must we again inquire which is the more fatalweakness or wickedness and can a sympathy with ideas surely not ignoble in themselves conduct a man to this dishonourable death  by this time i had pushed the door open and walked into the room your highness said i this is no time for moralising with a little promptness we may save this creatures life and as for the other he need cause you no concern for i have him safely under lock and key  the prince had turned about upon my entrance and regarded me certainly with no alarm but with a profundity of wonder which almost robbed me of my selfpossession my dear madam he cried at last and who the devil are you  i was already on the floor beside the dying man i had of course no idea with what drug he had attempted his life and i was forced to try him with a variety of antidotes here were both oil and vinegar for the prince had done the young man the honour of compounding for him one of his celebrated salads and of each of these i administered from a quarter to half a pint with no apparent efficacy i next plied him with the hot coffee of which there may have been near upon a quart  have you no milk i inquired  i fear madam that milk has been omitted returned the prince  salt then said i salt is a revulsive pass the salt  and possibly the mustard asked his highness as he offered me the contents of the various saltcellars poured together on a plate  ah cried i the thought is excellent mix me about half a pint of mustard drinkably dilute  whether it was the salt or the mustard or the mere combination of so many subversive agents as soon as the last had been poured over his throat the young sufferer obtained relief  there i exclaimed with natural triumph i have saved a life  and yet madam returned the prince your mercy may be cruelly disguised where the honour is lost it is at least superfluous to prolong the life  if you had led a life as changeable as mine your highness i replied you would hold a very different opinion for my part and after whatever extremity of misfortune or disgrace i should still count tomorrow worth a trial  you speak as a lady madam said the prince and for such you speak the truth but to men there is permitted such a field of licence and the good behaviour asked of them is at once so easy and so little that to fail in that is to fall beyond the reach of pardon but will you suffer me to repeat a question put to you at first i am afraid with some defect of courtesy and to ask you once more who you are and how i have the honour of your company  i am the proprietor of the house in which we stand said i  and still i am at fault returned the prince  but at that moment the timepiece on the mantelshelf began to strike the hour of twelve and the young man raising himself upon one elbow with an expression of despair and horror that i have never seen excelled cried lamentably midnight oh just god we stood frozen to our places while the tingling hammer of the timepiece measured the remaining strokes nor had we yet stirred so tragic had been the tones of the young man when the various bells of london began in turn to declare the hour the timepiece was inaudible beyond the walls of the chamber where we stood but the second pulsation of big ben had scarcely throbbed into the night before a sharp detonation rang about the house the prince sprang for the door by which i had entered but quick as he was i yet contrived to intercept him  are you armed i cried  no madam replied he you remind me appositely i will take the poker  the man below said i has two revolvers would you confront him at such odds  he paused as though staggered in his purpose and yet madam said he we cannot continue to remain in ignorance of what has passed  no cried i and who proposes it i am as curious as yourself but let us rather send for the police or if your highness dreads a scandal for some of your own servants  nay madam he replied smiling for so brave a lady you surprise me would you have me then send others where i fear to go myself  you are perfectly right said i and i was entirely wrong go in gods name and i will hold the candle  together therefore we descended to the lower story he carrying the poker i the light and together we approached and opened the door of the butlers pantry in some sort i believe i was prepared for the spectacle that met our eyes i was prepared that is to find the villain dead but the rude details of such a violent suicide i was unable to endure the prince unshaken by horror as he had remained unshaken by alarm assisted me with the most respectful gallantry to regain the diningroom  there we found our patient still indeed deadly pale but vastly recovered and already seated on a chair he held out both his hands with a most pitiful gesture of interrogation  he is dead said the prince  alas cried the young man and it should be i what do i do thus lingering on the stage i have disgraced while he my sure comrade blameworthy indeed for much but yet the soul of fidelity has judged and slain himself for an involuntary fault ah sir said he and you too madam without whose cruel help i should be now beyond the reach of my accusing conscience you behold in me the victim equally of my own faults and virtues i was born a hater of injustice from my most tender years my blood boiled against heaven when i beheld the sick and against men when i witnessed the sorrows of the poor the paupers crust stuck in my throat when i sat down to eat my dainties and the cripple child has set me weeping what was there in that but what was noble and yet observe to what a fall these thoughts have led me year after year this passion for the lost besieged me closer what hope was there in kings what hope in these wellfeathered classes that now roll in money i had observed the course of history i knew the burgess our ruler of today to be base cowardly and dull i saw him in every age combine to pull down that which was immediately above and to prey upon those that were below his dulness i knew would ultimately bring about his ruin i knew his days were numbered and yet how was i to wait how was i to let the poor child shiver in the rain the better days indeed were coming but the child would die before that alas your highness in surely no ungenerous impatience i enrolled myself among the enemies of this unjust and doomed society in surely no unnatural desire to keep the fires of my philanthropy alight i bound myself by an irrevocable oath  that oath is all my history to give freedom to posterity i had forsworn my own i must attend upon every signal and soon my father complained of my irregular hours and turned me from his house i was engaged in betrothal to an honest girl from her also i had to part for she was too shrewd to credit my inventions and too innocent to be intrusted with the truth behold me then alone with conspirators alas as the years went on my illusions left me surrounded as i was by the fervent disciples and apologists of revolution i beheld them daily advance in confidence and desperation i beheld myself upon the other hand and with an almost equal regularity decline in faith i had sacrificed all to further that cause in which i still believed and daily i began to grow in doubts if we were advancing it indeed horrible was the society with which we warred but our own means were not less horrible  i will not dwell upon my sufferings i will not pause to tell you how when i beheld young men still free and happy married fathers of children cheerfully toiling at their work my heart reproached me with the greatness and vanity of my unhappy sacrifice i will not describe to you how worn by poverty poor lodging scanty food and an unquiet conscience my health began to fail and in the long nights as i wandered bedless in the rainy streets the most cruel sufferings of the body were added to the tortures of my mind these things are not personal to me they are common to all unfortunates in my position an oath so light a thing to swear so grave a thing to break an oath taken in the heat of youth repented with what sobbings of the heart but yet in vain repented as the years go on an oath that was once the very utterance of the truth of god but that falls to be the symbol of a meaningless and empty slavery such is the yoke that many young men joyfully assume and under whose dead weight they live to suffer worse than death  it is not that i was patient i have begged to be released but i knew too much and i was still refused i have fled ay and for the time successfully i reached paris i found a lodging in the rue st jacques almost opposite the val de grâce my room was mean and bare but the sun looked into it towards evening it commanded a peep of a green garden a bird hung by a neighbours window and made the morning beautiful and i who was sick might lie in bed and rest myself i who was in full revolt against the principles that i had served was now no longer at the beck of the council and was no longer charged with shameful and revolting tasks oh what an interval of peace was that i still dream at times that i can hear the note of my neighbours bird  my money was running out and it became necessary that i should find employment scarcely had i been three days upon the search ere i thought that i was being followed i made certain of the features of the man which were quite strange to me and turned into a small café where i whiled away an hour pretending to read the papers but inwardly convulsed with terror when i came forth again into the street it was quite empty and i breathed again but alas i had not turned three corners when i once more observed the human hound pursuing me not an hour was to be lost timely submission might yet preserve a life which otherwise was forfeit and dishonoured and i fled with what speed you may conceive to the paris agency of the society i served  my submission was accepted i took up once more the hated burthen of that life once more i was at the call of men whom i despised and hated while yet i envied and admired them they at least were wholehearted in the things they purposed but i who had once been such as they had fallen from the brightness of my faith and now laboured like a hireling for the wages of a loathed existence ay sir to that i was condemned i obeyed to continue to live and lived but to obey  the last charge that was laid upon me was the one which has tonight so tragically ended boldly telling who i was i was to request from your highness on behalf of my society a private audience where it was designed to murder you if one thing remained to me of my old convictions it was the hate of kings and when this task was offered me i took it gladly alas sir you triumphed as we supped you gained upon my heart your character your talents your designs for our unhappy country all had been misrepresented i began to forget you were a prince i began all too feelingly to remember that you were a man as i saw the hour approach i suffered agonies untold and when at last we heard the slamming of the door which announced in my unwilling ears the arrival of the partner of my crime you will bear me out with what instancy i besought you to depart you would not alas and what could i kill you i could not my heart revolted my hand turned back from such a deed yet it was impossible that i should suffer you to stay for when the hour struck and my companion came true to his appointment and he at least true to our design i could neither suffer you to be killed nor yet him to be arrested from such a tragic passage death and death alone could save me and it is no fault of mine if i continue to exist  but you madam continued the young man addressing himself more directly to myself were doubtless born to save the prince and to confound our purposes my life you have prolonged and by turning the key on my companion you have made me the author of his death he heard the hour strike he was impotent to help and thinking himself forfeit to honour thinking that i should fall alone upon his highness and perish for lack of his support he has turned his pistol on himself  you are right said prince florizel it was in no ungenerous spirit that you brought these burthens on yourself and when i see you so nobly to blame so tragically punished i stand like one reproved for is it not strange madam that you and i by practising accepted and inconsiderable virtues and commonplace but still unpardonable faults should stand here in the sight of god with what we call clean hands and quiet consciences while this poor youth for an error that i could almost envy him should be sunk beyond the reach of hope  sir resumed the prince turning to the young man i cannot help you my help would but unchain the thunderbolt that overhangs you and i can but leave you free  and sir said i as this house belongs to me i will ask you to have the kindness to remove the body you and your conspirators it appears to me can hardly in civility do less  it shall be done said the young man with a dismal accent  and you dear madam said the prince you to whom i owe my life how can i serve you  your highness i said to be very plain this is my favourite house being not only a valuable property but endeared to me by various associations i have endless troubles with tenants of the ordinary class and at first applauded my good fortune when i found one of the station of your master of the horse i now begin to think otherwise dangers set a siege about great personages and i do not wish my tenement to share these risks procure me the resiliation of the lease and i shall feel myself your debtor  i must tell you madam replied his highness that colonel geraldine is but a cloak for myself and i should be sorry indeed to think myself so unacceptable a tenant  your highness said i i have conceived a sincere admiration for your character but on the subject of house property i cannot allow the interference of my feelings i will however to prove to you that there is nothing personal in my request here solemnly engage my word that i will never put another tenant in this house  madam said florizel you plead your cause too charmingly to be refused  thereupon we all three withdrew the young man still reeling in his walk departed by himself to seek the assistance of his fellowconspirators and the prince with the most attentive gallantry lent me his escort to the door of my hotel the next day the lease was cancelled nor from that hour to this though sometimes regretting my engagement have i suffered a tenant in this house     the superfluous mansion continued   as soon as the old lady had finished her relation somerset made haste to offer her his compliments  madam said he your story is not only entertaining but instructive and you have told it with infinite vivacity i was much affected towards the end as i held at one time very liberal opinions and should certainly have joined a secret society if i had been able to find one but the whole tale came home to me and i was the better able to feel for you in your various perplexities as i am myself of somewhat hasty temper  i do not understand you said mrs luxmore with some marks of irritation you must have strangely misinterpreted what i have told you you fill me with surprise  somerset alarmed by the old ladys change of tone and manner hurried to recant  dear mrs luxmore said he you certainly misconstrue my remark as a man of somewhat fiery humour my conscience repeatedly pricked me when i heard what you had suffered at the hands of persons similarly constituted  oh very well indeed replied the old lady and a very proper spirit i regret that i have met with it so rarely  but in all this resumed the young man i perceive nothing that concerns myself  i am about to come to that she returned and you have already before you in the pledge i gave prince florizel one of the elements of the affair i am a woman of the nomadic sort and when i have no case before the courts i make it a habit to visit continental spas not that i have ever been ill but then i am no longer young and i am always happy in a crowd well to come more shortly to the point i am now on the wing for evian this incubus of a house which i must leave behind and dare not let hangs heavily upon my hands and i propose to rid myself of that concern and do you a very good turn into the bargain by lending you the mansion with all its fittings as it stands the idea was sudden it appealed to me as humorous and i am sure it will cause my relatives if they should ever hear of it the keenest possible chagrin here then is the key and when you return at two tomorrow afternoon you will find neither me nor my cats to disturb you in your new possession  so saying the old lady arose as if to dismiss her visitor but somerset looking somewhat blankly on the key began to protest  dear mrs luxmore said he this is a most unusual proposal you know nothing of me beyond the fact that i displayed both impudence and timidity i may be the worst kind of scoundrel i may sell your furniture  you may blow up the house with gunpowder for what i care cried mrs luxmore it is in vain to reason such is the force of my character that when i have one idea clearly in my head i do not care two straws for any side consideration it amuses me to do it and let that suffice on your side you may do what you pleaselet apartments or keep a private hotel on mine i promise you a full months warning before i return and i never fail religiously to keep my promises  the young man was about to renew his protest when he observed a sudden and significant change in the old ladys countenance  if i thought you capable of disrespect she cried  madam said somerset with the extreme fervour of asseveration madam i accept i beg you to understand that i accept with joy and gratitude  ah well returned mrs luxmore if i am mistaken let it pass and now since all is comfortably settled i wish you a goodnight  thereupon as if to leave him no room for repentance she hurried somerset out of the front door and left him standing key in hand upon the pavement  the next day about the hour appointed the young man found his way to the square which i will here call golden square though that was not its name what to expect he knew not for a man may live in dreams and yet be unprepared for their realisation it was already with a certain pang of surprise that he beheld the mansion standing in the eye of day a solid among solids the key upon trial readily opened the front door he entered that great house a privileged burglar and escorted by the echoes of desertion rapidly reviewed the empty chambers cats servant old lady the very marks of habitation like writing on a slate had been in these few hours obliterated he wandered from floor to floor and found the house of great extent the kitchen offices commodious and well appointed the rooms many and large and the drawingroom in particular an apartment of princely size and tasteful decoration although the day without was warm genial and sunny with a ruffling wind from the quarter of torquay a chill as it were of suspended animation inhabited the house dust and shadows met the eye and but for the ominous procession of the echoes and the rumour of the wind among the garden trees the ear of the young man was stretched in vain  behind the diningroom that pleasant library referred to by the old lady in her tale looked upon the flat roofs and netted cupolas of the kitchen quarters and on a second visit this room appeared to greet him with a smiling countenance he might as well he thought avoid the expense of lodging the library fitted with an iron bedstead which he had remarked in one of the upper chambers would serve his purpose for the night while in the diningroom which was large airy and lightsome looking on the square and garden he might very agreeably pass his days cook his meals and study to bring himself to some proficiency in that art of painting which he had recently determined to adopt it did not take him long to make the change he had soon returned to the mansion with his modest kit and the cabman who brought him was readily induced by the young mans pleasant manner and a small gratuity to assist him in the installation of the iron bed by six in the evening when somerset went forth to dine he was able to look back upon the mansion with a sense of pride and property foursquare it stood of an imposing frontage and flanked on either side by family hatchments his eye from where he stood whistling in the key with his back to the garden railings reposed on every feature of reality and yet his own possession seemed as flimsy as a dream  in the course of a few days the genteel inhabitants of the square began to remark the customs of their neighbour the sight of a young gentleman discussing a clay pipe about four oclock of the afternoon in the drawingroom balcony of so discreet a mansion and perhaps still more his periodical excursion to a decent tavern in the neighbourhood and his unabashed return nursing the full tankard had presently raised to a high pitch the interest and indignation of the liveried servants of the square the disfavour of some of these gentlemen at first proceeded to the length of insult but somerset knew how to be affable with any class of men and a few rude words merrily accepted and a few glasses amicably shared gained for him the right of toleration  the young man had embraced the art of raphael partly from a notion of its ease partly from an inborn distrust of offices he scorned to bear the yoke of any regular schooling and proceeded to turn one half of the diningroom into a studio for the reproduction of still life there he amassed a variety of objects indiscriminately chosen from the kitchen the drawingroom and the back garden and there spent his days in smiling assiduity meantime the great bulk of empty building overhead lay like a load upon his imagination to hold so great a stake and to do nothing argued some defect of energy and he at length determined to act upon the hint given by mrs luxmore herself and to stick with wafers in the window of the diningroom a small handbill announcing furnished lodgings at halfpast six of a fine july morning he affixed the bill and went forth into the square to study the result it seemed to his eye promising and unpretentious and he returned to the drawingroom balcony to consider over a studious pipe the knotty problem of how much he was to charge  thereupon he somewhat relaxed in his devotion to the art of painting indeed from that time forth he would spend the best part of the day in the front balcony like the attentive angler poring on his float and the better to support the tedium he would frequently console himself with his clay pipe on several occasions passersby appeared to be arrested by the ticket and on several others ladies and gentlemen drove to the very doorstep by the carriageful but it appeared there was something repulsive in the appearance of the house for with one accord they would cast but one look upward and hastily resume their onward progress or direct the driver to proceed somerset had thus the mortification of actually meeting the eye of a large number of lodgingseekers and though he hastened to withdraw his pipe and to compose his features to an air of invitation he was never rewarded by so much as an inquiry can there he thought be anything repellent in myself but a candid examination in one of the pierglasses of the drawingroom led him to dismiss the fear  something however was amiss his vast and accurate calculations on the flyleaves of books or on the backs of playbills appeared to have been an idle sacrifice of time by these he had variously computed the weekly takings of the house from sums as modest as fiveandtwentyshillings up to the more majestic figure of a hundred pounds and yet in despite of the very elements of arithmetic here he was making literally nothing  this incongruity impressed him deeply and occupied his thoughtful leisure on the balcony and at last it seemed to him that he had detected the error of his method this he reflected is an age of generous display the age of the sandwichman of griffiths of pears legendary soap and of enos fruit salt which by sheer brass and notoriety and the most disgusting pictures i ever remember to have seen has overlaid that comforter of my childhood lamploughs pyretic saline lamplough was genteel eno was omnipresent lamplough was trite eno original and abominably vulgar and here have i a man of some pretensions to knowledge of the world contented myself with half a sheet of notepaper a few cold words which do not directly address the imagination and the adornment if adornment it may be called of four red wafers am i then to sink with lamplough or to soar with eno am i to adopt that modesty which is doubtless becoming in a duke or to take hold of the red facts of life with the emphasis of the tradesman and the poet  pursuant upon these meditations he procured several sheets of the very largest size of drawingpaper and laying forth his paints proceeded to compose an ensign that might attract the eye and at the same time in his own phrase directly address the imagination of the passenger something taking in the way of colour a good savoury choice of words and a realistic design setting forth the life a lodger might expect to lead within the walls of that palace of delight these he perceived must be the elements of his advertisement it was possible upon the one hand to depict the sober pleasures of domestic life the evening fire blondheaded urchins and the hissing urn but on the other it was possible and he almost felt as if it were more suited to his muse to set forth the charms of an existence somewhat wider in its range or boldly say the paradise of the mohammedan so long did the artist waver between these two views that before he arrived at a conclusion he had finally conceived and completed both designs with the proverbially tender heart of the parent he found himself unable to sacrifice either of these offspring of his art and decided to expose them on alternate days in this way he thought i shall address myself indifferently to all classes of the world  the tossing of a penny decided the only remaining point and the more imaginative canvas received the suffrages of fortune and appeared first in the window of the mansion it was of a high fancy the legend eloquently writ the scheme of colour taking and bold and but for the imperfection of the artists drawing it might have been taken for a model of its kind as it was however when viewed from his favourite point against the garden railings and with some touch of distance it caused a pleasurable rising of the artists heart i have thrown away he ejaculated an invaluable motive and this shall be the subject of my first academy picture  the fate of neither of these works was equal to its merit a crowd would certainly from time to time collect before the arearailings but they came to jeer and not to speculate and those who pushed their inquiries further were too plainly animated by the spirit of derision the racier of the two cartoons displayed indeed no symptom of attractive merit and though it had a certain share of that success called scandalous failed utterly of its effect on the day however of the second appearance of the companion work a real inquirer did actually present himself before the eyes of somerset  this was a gentlemanly man with some marks of recent merriment and his voice under inadequate control  i beg your pardon said he but what is the meaning of your extraordinary bill  i beg yours returned somerset hotly its meaning is sufficiently explicit and being now from dire experience fearful of ridicule he was preparing to close the door when the gentleman thrust his cane into the aperture  not so fast i beg of you said he if you really let apartments here is a possible tenant at your door and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see the accommodation and to learn your terms  his heart joyously beating somerset admitted the visitor showed him over the various apartments and with some return of his persuasive eloquence expounded their attractions the gentleman was particularly pleased by the elegant proportions of the drawingroom  this he said would suit me very well what may i ask would be your terms a week for this floor and the one above it  i was thinking returned somerset of a hundred pounds  surely not exclaimed the gentleman  well then returned somerset fifty  the gentleman regarded him with an air of some amazement you seem to be strangely elastic in your demands said he what if i were to proceed on your own principle of division and offer twentyfive  done cried somerset and then overcome by a sudden embarrassment you see he added apologetically it is all found money for me  really said the stranger looking at him all the while with growing wonder without extras then  ii suppose so stammered the keeper of the lodginghouse  service included pursued the gentleman  service cried somerset do you mean that you expect me to empty your slops  the gentleman regarded him with a very friendly interest my dear fellow said he if you take my advice you will give up this business and thereupon he resumed his hat and took himself away  this smarting disappointment produced a strong effect on the artist of the cartoons and he began with shame to eat up his rosier illusions first one and then the other of his great works was condemned withdrawn from exhibition and relegated as a mere wallpicture to the decoration of the diningroom their place was taken by a replica of the original watered announcement to which in particularly large letters he had added the pithy rubric no service meanwhile he had fallen into something as nearly bordering on low spirits as was consistent with his disposition depressed at once by the failure of his scheme the laughable turn of his late interview and the judicial blindness of the public to the merit of the twin cartoons  perhaps a week had passed before he was again startled by the note of the knocker a gentleman of a somewhat foreign and somewhat military air yet closely shaven and wearing a soft hat desired in the politest terms to visit the apartments he had he explained a friend a gentleman in tender health desirous of a sedate and solitary life apart from interruptions and the noises of the common lodginghouse the unusual clause he continued in your announcement particularly struck me this i said is the place for mr jones you are yourself sir a professional gentleman concluded the visitor looking keenly in somersets face  i am an artist replied the young man lightly  and these observed the other taking a side glance through the open door of the diningroom which they were then passing these are some of your works very remarkable and he again and still more sharply peered into the countenance of the young man  somerset unable to suppress a blush made the more haste to lead his visitor upstairs and to display the apartments  excellent observed the stranger as he looked from one of the back windows is that a mews behind sir very good well sir see here my friend will take your drawingroom floor he will sleep in the back drawingroom his nurse an excellent irish widow will attend on all his wants and occupy a garret he will pay you the round sum of ten dollars a week and you on your part will engage to receive no other lodger i think that fair  somerset had scarcely words in which to clothe his gratitude and joy  agreed said the other and to spare you trouble my friend will bring some men with him to make the changes you will find him a retiring inmate sir receives but few and rarely leaves the house except at night  since i have been in this house returned somerset i have myself unless it were to fetch beer rarely gone abroad except in the evening but a man he added must have some amusement  an hour was then agreed on the gentleman departed and somerset sat down to compute in english money the value of the figure named the result of this investigation filled him with amazement and disgust but it was now too late nothing remained but to endure and he awaited the arrival of his tenant still trying by various arithmetical expedients to obtain a more favourable quotation for the dollar with the approach of dusk however his impatience drove him once more to the front balcony the night fell mild and airless the lamps shone around the central darkness of the garden and through the tall grove of trees that intervened many warmly illuminated windows on the farther side of the square told their tale of white napery choice wine and genial hospitality the stars were already thickening overhead when the young mans eyes alighted on a procession of three fourwheelers coasting round the garden railing and bound for the superfluous mansion they were laden with formidable boxes moved in a military order one following another and by the extreme slowness of their advance inspired somerset with the most serious ideas of his tenants malady  by the time he had the door open the cabs had drawn up beside the pavement and from the two first there had alighted the military gentleman of the morning and two very stalwart porters these proceeded instantly to take possession of the house with their own hands and firmly rejecting somersets assistance they carried in the various crates and boxes with their own hands dismounted and transferred to the back drawingroom the bed in which the tenant was to sleep and it was not until the bustle of arrival had subsided and the arrangements were complete that there descended from the third of the three vehicles a gentleman of great stature and broad shoulders leaning on the shoulder of a woman in a widows dress and himself covered by a long cloak and muffled in a coloured comforter  somerset had but a glimpse of him in passing he was soon shut into the back drawingroom the other men departed silence redescended on the house and had not the nurse appeared a little before halfpast ten and with a strong brogue asked if there were a decent publichouse in the neighbourhood somerset might have still supposed himself to be alone in the superfluous mansion  day followed day and still the young man had never come by speech or sight of his mysterious lodger the doors of the drawingroom flat were never open and although somerset could hear him moving to and fro the tall man had never quitted the privacy of his apartments visitors indeed arrived sometimes in the dusk sometimes at intempestuous hours of night or morning men for the most part some meanly attired some decently some loud some cringing and yet all in the eyes of somerset displeasing a certain air of fear and secrecy was common to them all they were all voluble he thought and ill at ease even the military gentleman proved on a closer inspection to be no gentleman at all and as for the doctor who attended the sick man his manners were not suggestive of a university career the nurse again was scarcely a desirable housefellow since her arrival the fall of whisky in the young mans private bottle was much accelerated and though never communicative she was at times unpleasantly familiar when asked about the patients health she would dolorously shake her head and declare that the poor gentleman was in a pitiful condition  yet somehow somerset had early begun to entertain the notion that his complaint was other than bodily the illlooking birds that gathered to the house the strange noises that sounded from the drawingroom in the dead hours of night the careless attendance and intemperate habits of the nurse the entire absence of correspondence the entire seclusion of mr jones himself whose face up to that hour he could not have sworn to in a court of justiceall weighed unpleasantly upon the young mans mind a sense of something evil irregular and underhand haunted and depressed him and this uneasy sentiment was the more firmly rooted in his mind when in the fulness of time he had an opportunity of observing the features of his tenant it fell in this way the young landlord was awakened about four in the morning by a noise in the hall leaping to his feet and opening the door of the library he saw the tall man candle in hand in earnest conversation with the gentleman who had taken the rooms the faces of both were strongly illuminated and in that of his tenant somerset could perceive none of the marks of disease but every sign of health energy and resolution while he was still looking the visitor took his departure and the invalid having carefully fastened the front door sprang upstairs without a trace of lassitude  that night upon his pillow somerset began to kindle once more into the hot fit of the detective fever and the next morning resumed the practice of his art with careless hand and an abstracted mind the day was destined to be fertile in surprises nor had he long been seated at the easel ere the first of these occurred a cab laden with baggage drew up before the door and mrs luxmore in person rapidly mounted the steps and began to pound upon the knocker somerset hastened to attend the summons  my dear fellow she said with the utmost gaiety here i come dropping from the moon i am delighted to find you faithful and i have no doubt you will be equally pleased to be restored to liberty  somerset could find no words whether of protest or welcome and the spirited old lady pushed briskly by him and paused on the threshold of the diningroom the sight that met her eyes was one well calculated to inspire astonishment the mantelpiece was arrayed with saucepans and empty bottles on the fire some chops were frying the floor was littered from end to end with books clothes walkingcanes and the materials of the painters craft but what far outstripped the other wonders of the place was the corner which had been arranged for the study of stilllife this formed a sort of rockery conspicuous upon which according to the principles of the art of composition a cabbage was relieved against a copper kettle and both contrasted with the mail of a boiled lobster  my gracious goodness cried the lady of the house and then turning in wrath on the young man from what rank in life are you sprung she demanded you have the exterior of a gentleman but from the astonishing evidences before me i should say you can only be a greengrocers man pray gather up your vegetables and let me see no more of you  madam babbled somerset you promised me a months warning  that was under a misapprehension returned the old lady i now give you warning to leave at once  madam said the young man i wish i could and indeed as far as i am concerned it might be done but then my lodger  your lodger echoed mrs luxmore  my lodger why should i deny it returned somerset he is only by the week  the old lady sat down upon a chair you have a lodgeryou she cried and pray how did you get him  by advertisement replied the young man o madam i have not lived unobservantly i adoptedhis eyes involuntarily shifted to the cartoonsi adopted every method  her eyes had followed his for the first time in somersets experience she produced a double eyeglass and as soon as the full merit of the works had flashed upon her she gave way to peal after peal of her trilling and soprano laughter  oh i think you are perfectly delicious she cried i do hope you had them in the window mpherson she continued crying to her maid who had been all this time grimly waiting in the hall i lunch with mr somerset take the cellar key and bring some wine  in this gay humour she continued throughout the luncheon presented somerset with a couple of dozen of wine which she made mpherson bring up from the cellaras a present my dear she said with another burst of tearful merriment for your charming pictures which you must be sure to leave me when you go and finally protesting that she dared not spoil the absurdest houseful of madmen in the whole of london departed as she vaguely phrased it for the continent of europe  she was no sooner gone than somerset encountered in the corridor the irish nurse sober to all appearance and yet a prey to singularly strong emotion it was made to appear from her account that mr jones had already suffered acutely in his health from mrs luxmores visit and that nothing short of a full explanation could allay the invalids uneasiness somerset somewhat staring told what he thought fit of the affair  is that all cried the woman as god sees you is that all  my good woman said the young man i have no idea what you can be driving at suppose the lady were my friends wife suppose she were my fairy godmother suppose she were the queen of portugal and how should that affect yourself or mr jones  blessed mary cried the nurse its he that will be glad to hear it  and immediately she fled upstairs  somerset on his part returned to the diningroom and with a very thoughtful brow and ruminating many theories disposed of the remainder of the bottle it was port and port is a wine sole among its equals and superiors that can in some degree support the competition of tobacco sipping smoking and theorising somerset moved on from suspicion to suspicion from resolve to resolve still growing braver and rosier as the bottle ebbed he was a sceptic none prouder of the name he had no horror at command whether for crimes or vices but beheld and embraced the world with an immoral approbation the frequent consequence of youth and health at the same time he felt convinced that he dwelt under the same roof with secret malefactors and the unregenerate instinct of the chase impelled him to severity the bottle had run low the summer sun had finally withdrawn and at the same moment night and the pangs of hunger recalled him from his dreams  he went forth and dined in the criterion a dinner in consonance not so much with his purse as with the admirable wine he had discussed what with one thing and another it was long past midnight when he returned home a cab was at the door and entering the hall somerset found himself face to face with one of the most regular of the few who visited mr jones a man of powerful figure strong lineaments and a chinbeard in the american fashion this person was carrying on one shoulder a black portmanteau seemingly of considerable weight that he should find a visitor removing baggage in the dead of night recalled some odd stories to the young mans memory he had heard of lodgers who thus gradually drained away not only their own effects but the very furniture and fittings of the house that sheltered them and now in a mood between pleasantry and suspicion and aping the manner of a drunkard he roughly bumped against the man with the chinbeard and knocked the portmanteau from his shoulder to the floor with a face struck suddenly as white as paper the man with the chinbeard called lamentably on the name of his maker and fell in a mere heap on the mat at the foot of the stairs at the same time though only for a single instant the heads of the sick lodger and the irish nurse popped out like rabbits over the banisters of the first floor and on both the same scare and pallor were apparent  the sight of this incredible emotion turned somerset to stone and he continued speechless while the man gathered himself together and with the help of the handrail and audibly thanking god scrambled once more upon his feet  what in heavens name ails you gasped the young man as soon as he could find words and utterance  have you a drop of brandy returned the other i am sick  somerset administered two drams one after the other to the man with the chinbeard who then somewhat restored began to confound himself in apologies for what he called his miserable nervousness the result he said of a long course of dumb ague and having taken leave with a hand that still sweated and trembled he gingerly resumed his burthen and departed  somerset retired to bed but not to sleep what he asked himself had been the contents of the black portmanteau stolen goods the carcass of one murdered orand at the thought he sat upright in bedan infernal machine he took a solemn vow that he would set these doubts at rest and with the next morning installed himself beside the diningroom window vigilant with eye and ear to await and profit by the earliest opportunity  the hours went heavily by within the house there was no circumstance of novelty unless it might be that the nurse more frequently made little journeys round the corner of the square and before afternoon was somewhat loose of speech and gait a little after six however there came round the corner of the gardens a very handsome and elegantly dressed young woman who paused a little way off and for some time and with frequent sighs contemplated the front of the superfluous mansion it was not the first time that she had thus stood afar and looked upon it like our common parents at the gates of eden and the young man had already had occasion to remark the lively slimness of her carriage and had already been the butt of a chance arrow from her eye he hailed her coming then with pleasant feelings and moved a little nearer to the window to enjoy the sight what was his surprise however when as if with a sensible effort she drew near mounted the steps and tapped discreetly at the door he made haste to get before the irish nurse who was not improbably asleep and had the satisfaction to receive this gracious visitor in person  she inquired for mr jones and then without transition asked the young man if he were the person of the house and at the words he thought he could perceive her to be smiling because she added if you are i should like to see some of the other rooms  somerset told her he was under an engagement to receive no other lodgers but she assured him that would be no matter as these were friends of mr joness and she continued moving suddenly to the diningroom door let us begin here somerset was too late to prevent her entering and perhaps lacked the courage to essay ah she cried how changed it is  madam cried the young man since your entrance it is i who have the right to say so  she received this inane compliment with a demure and conscious droop of the eyelids and gracefully steering her dress among the mingled litter now with a smile now with a sigh reviewed the wonders of the two apartments she gazed upon the cartoons with sparkling eyes and a heightened colour and in a somewhat breathless voice expressed a high opinion of their merits she praised the effective disposition of the rockery and in the bedroom of which somerset had vainly endeavoured to defend the entry she fairly broke forth in admiration how simple and manly she cried none of that effeminacy of neatness which is so detestable in a man hard upon this telling him before he had time to reply that she very well knew her way and would trouble him no further she took her leave with an engaging smile and ascended the staircase alone  for more than an hour the young lady remained closeted with mr jones and at the end of that time the night being now come completely they left the house in company this was the first time since the arrival of his lodger that somerset had found himself alone with the irish widow and without the loss of any more time than was required by decency he stepped to the foot of the stairs and hailed her by her name she came instantly wreathed in weak smiles and with a nodding head and when the young man politely offered to introduce her to the treasures of his art she swore that nothing could afford her greater pleasure for though she had never crossed the threshold she had frequently observed his beautiful pictures through the door on entering the diningroom the sight of a bottle and two glasses prepared her to be a gentle critic and as soon as the pictures had been viewed and praised she was easily persuaded to join the painter in a single glass here she said are my respects and a pleasure it is in this horrible house to see a gentleman like yourself so affable and free and a very nice painter i am sure one glass so agreeably prefaced was sure to lead to the acceptance of a second at the third somerset was free to cease from the affectation of keeping her company and as for the fourth she asked it of her own accord for indeed said she what with all these clocks and chemicals without a drop of the creature life would be impossible entirely and you seen yourself that even mguire was glad to beg for it and even himself when he is downhearted with all these cruel disappointments though as temperate a man as any child will be sometimes crying for a glass of it and ill thank you for a thimbleful to settle what i got soon after she began with tears to narrate the deathbed dispositions and lament the trifling assets of her husband then she declared she heard the master calling her rose to her feet made but one lurch of it into the stilllife rockery and with her head upon the lobster fell into stertorous slumbers  somerset mounted at once to the first story and opened the door of the drawingroom which was brilliantly lit by several lamps it was a great apartment looking on the square with three tall windows and joined by a pair of ample foldingdoors to the next room elegant in proportion papered in seagreen furnished in velvet of a delicate blue and adorned with a majestic mantelpiece of variously tinted marbles such was the room that somerset remembered that which he now beheld was changed in almost every feature the furniture covered with a figured chintz the walls hung with a rhubarbcoloured paper and diversified by the curtained recesses for no less than seven windows it seemed to himself that he must have entered without observing the transition into the adjoining house presently from these more specious changes his eye condescended to the many curious objects with which the floor was littered here were the locks of dismounted pistols clocks and clockwork in every stage of demolition some still busily ticking some reduced to their dainty elements a great company of carboys jars and bottles a carpenters bench and a laboratorytable  the back drawingroom to which somerset proceeded had likewise undergone a change it was transformed to the exact appearance of a common lodginghouse bedroom a bed with green curtains occupied one corner and the window was blocked by the regulation table and mirror the door of a small closet here attracted the young mans attention and striking a vesta he opened it and entered on a table several wigs and beards were lying spread about the walls hung an incongruous display of suits and overcoats and conspicuous among the last the young man observed a large overall of the most costly sealskin in a flash his mind reverted to the advertisement in the standard newspaper the great height of his lodger the disproportionate breadth of his shoulders and the strange particulars of his instalment all pointed to the same conclusion  the vesta had now burned to his fingers and taking the coat upon his arm somerset hastily returned to the lighted drawingroom there with a mixture of fear and admiration he pored upon its goodly proportions and the regularity and softness of the pile the sight of a large pierglass put another fancy in his head he donned the fur coat and standing before the mirror in an attitude suggestive of a russian prince he thrust his hands into the ample pockets there his fingers encountered a folded journal he drew it out and recognised the type and paper of the standard and at the same instant his eyes alighted on the offer of two hundred pounds plainly then his lodger now no longer mysterious had laid aside his coat on the very day of the appearance of the advertisement  he was thus standing the telltale coat upon his back the incriminating paper in his hand when the door opened and the tall lodger with a firm but somewhat pallid face stepped into the room and closed the door again behind him for some time the two looked upon each other in perfect silence then mr jones moved forward to the table took a seat and still without once changing the direction of his eyes addressed the young man  you are right he said it is for me the blood money is offered and now what will you do  it was a question to which somerset was far from being able to reply taken as he was at unawares masquerading in the mans own coat and surrounded by a whole arsenal of diabolical explosives the keeper of the lodginghouse was silenced  yes resumed the other i am he i am that man whom with impotent hate and fear they still hunt from den to den from disguise to disguise yet my landlord you have it in your power if you be poor to lay the basis of your fortune if you be unknown to capture honour at one snatch you have hocussed an innocent widow and i find you here in my apartment for whose use i pay you in stamped money searching my wardrobe and your handshame siryour hand in my very pocket you can now complete the cycle of your ignominious acts by what will be at once the simplest the safest and the most remunerative the speaker paused as if to emphasise his words and then with a great change of tone and manner thus resumed and yet sir when i look upon your face i feel certain that i cannot be deceived certain that in spite of all i have the honour and pleasure of speaking to a gentleman take off my coat sirwhich but cumbers you divest yourself of this confusion that which is but thought upon thank god need be no burthen to the conscience we have all harboured guilty thoughts and if it flashed into your mind to sell my flesh and blood my anguish in the dock and the sweat of my death agonyit was a thought dear sir you were as incapable of acting on as i of any further question of your honour at these words the speaker with a very open smiling countenance like a forgiving father offered somerset his hand  it was not in the young mans nature to refuse forgiveness or dissect generosity he instantly and almost without thought accepted the proffered grasp  and now resumed the lodger now that i hold in mine your loyal hand i lay by my apprehensions i dismiss suspicion i go furtherby an effort of will i banish the memory of what is past how you came here i care not enough that you are hereas my guest sit ye down and let us with your good permission improve acquaintance over a glass of excellent whisky  so speaking he produced glasses and a bottle and the pair pledged each other in silence  confess observed the smiling host you were surprised at the appearance of the room  i was indeed said somerset nor can i imagine the purpose of these changes  these replied the conspirator are the devices by which i continue to exist conceive me now accused before one of your unjust tribunals conceive the various witnesses appearing and the singular variety of their reports one will have visited me in this drawingroom as it originally stood a second finds it as it is tonight and tomorrow or next day all may have been changed if you love romance as artists do few lives are more romantic than that of the obscure individual now addressing you obscure yet famous mine is an anonymous infernal glory by infamous means i work towards my bright purpose i found the liberty and peace of a poor country desperately abused the future smiles upon that land yet in the meantime i lead the existence of a hunted brute work towards appalling ends and practise hells dexterities  somerset glass in hand contemplated the strange fanatic before him and listened to his heated rhapsody with indescribable bewilderment he looked him in the face with curious particularity saw there the marks of education and wondered the more profoundly  sir he saidfor i know not whether i should still address you as mr jones  jones breitman higginbotham pumpernickel daviot henderland by all or any of these you may address me said the plotter for all i have at some time borne yet that which i most prize that which is most feared hated and obeyed is not a name to be found in your directories it is not a name current in postoffices or banks and indeed like the celebrated clan mgregor i may justly describe myself as being nameless by day but he continued rising to his feet by night and among my desperate followers i am the redoubted zero  somerset was unacquainted with the name but he politely expressed surprise and gratification i am to understand he continued that under this alias you follow the profession of a dynamiter3  the plotter had resumed his seat and now replenished the glasses  i do he said in this dark period of time a starthe star of dynamitehas risen for the oppressed and among those who practise its use so thick beset with dangers and attended by such incredible difficulties and disappointments few have been more assiduous and not many he paused and a shade of embarrassment appeared upon his facenot many have been more successful than myself  i can imagine observed somerset that from the sweeping consequences looked for the career is not devoid of interest you have besides some of the entertainment of the game of hideandseek but it would still seem to mei speak as a laymanthat nothing could be simpler or safer than to deposit an infernal machine and retire to an adjacent county to await the painful consequences  you speak indeed returned the plotter with some evidence of warmth you speak indeed most ignorantly do you make nothing then of such a peril as we share this moment do you think it nothing to occupy a house like this one mined menaced and in a word literally tottering to its fall  good god ejaculated somerset  and when you speak of ease pursued zero in this age of scientific studies you fill me with surprise are you not aware that chemicals are proverbially fickle as woman and clockwork as capricious as the very devil do you see upon my brow these furrows of anxiety do you observe the silver threads that mingle with my hair clockwork clockwork has stamped them on my browchemicals have sprinkled them upon my locks no mr somerset he resumed after a moments pause his voice still quivering with sensibility you must not suppose the dynamiters life to be all gold on the contrary you cannot picture to yourself the bloodshot vigils and the staggering disappointments of a life like mine i have toiled let us say for months up early and down late my bag is ready my clock set a daring agent has hurried with white face to deposit the instrument of ruin we await the fall of england the massacre of thousands the yell of fear and execration and lo a snap like that of a childs pistol an offensive smell and the entire loss of so much time and plant if he concluded musingly we had been merely able to recover the lost bags i believe with but a touch or two i could have remedied the peccant engine but what with the loss of plant and the almost insuperable scientific difficulties of the task our friends in france are almost ready to desert the chosen medium they propose instead to break up the drainage system of cities and sweep off whole populations with the devastating typhoid pestilence a tempting and a scientific project a process indiscriminate indeed but of idyllical simplicity i recognise its elegance but sir i have something of the poet in my nature something possibly of the tribune and for my small part i shall remain devoted to that more emphatic more striking and if you please more popular method of the explosive bomb yes he cried with unshaken hope i will still continue and i feel it in my bosom i shall yet succeed  two things i remark said somerset the first somewhat staggers me have you thenin all this course of life which you have sketched so vividlyhave you not once succeeded  pardon me said zero i have had one success you behold in me the author of the outrage of red lion court  but if i remember right objected somerset the thing was a fiasco a scavengers barrow and some copies of the weekly budgetthese were the only victims  you will pardon me again returned zero with positive asperity a child was injured  and that fitly brings me to my second point said somerset for i observed you to employ the word indiscriminate now surely a scavengers barrow and a child if child there were represent the very acme and top pinpoint of indiscriminate and pardon me of ineffectual reprisal  did i employ the word asked zero well i will not defend it but for efficiency you touch on graver matters and before entering upon so vast a subject permit me once more to fill our glasses disputation is dry work he added with a charming gaiety of manner  once more accordingly the pair pledged each other in a stalwart grog and zero leaning back with an air of some complacency proceeded more largely to develop his opinions  the indiscriminate he began war my dear sir is indiscriminate war spares not the child it spares not the barrow of the harmless scavenger no more he concluded beaming no more do i whatever may strike fear whatever may confound or paralyse the activities of the guilty nation barrow or child imperial parliament or excursion steamer is welcome to my simple plans you are not he inquired with a shade of sympathetic interest you are not i trust a believer  sir i believe in nothing said the young man  you are then replied zero in a position to grasp my argument we agree that humanity is the object the glorious triumph of humanity and being pledged to labour for that end and face to face with the banded opposition of kings parliaments churches and the members of the force who am iwho are we dear sirto affect a nicety about the tools employed you might perhaps expect us to attack the queen the sinister gladstone the rigid derby or the dexterous granville but there you would be in error our appeal is to the body of the people it is these that we would touch and interest now sir have you observed the english housemaid  i should think i had cried somerset  from a man of taste and a votary of art i had expected it returned the conspirator politely a type apart a very charming figure and thoroughly adapted to our ends the neat cap the clean print the comely person the engaging manner her position between classes parents in one employers in another the probability that she will have at least one sweetheart whose feelings we shall addressyes i have a leaningcall it if you will a weaknessfor the housemaid not that i would be understood to despise the nurse for the child is a very interesting feature i have long since marked out the child as the sensitive point in society he wagged his head with a wise pensive smile and talking sir of children and of the perils of our trade let me now narrate to you a little incident of an explosive bomb that fell out some weeks ago under my own observation it fell out thus  and zero leaning back in his chair narrated the following simple tale   footnote    3 the arabian author of the original has here a long passage     conceived in a style too oriental for the english reader we subjoin     a specimen and it seems doubtful whether it should be printed as     prose or verse any writard who writes dynamitard shall find in me     a neverresting fightard and he goes on if we correctly gather     his meaning to object to such elegant and obviously correct     spellings as lamplightard corndealard applefilchard clearly     justified by the parallelpilchard and operadançard     dynamitist he adds i could understand     zeros tale of the explosive bomb4   i dined by appointment with one of our most trusted agents in a private chamber at st jamess hall you have seen the man it was mguire the most chivalrous of creatures but not himself expert in our contrivances hence the necessity of our meeting for i need not remind you what enormous issues depend upon the nice adjustment of the engine i set our little petard for half an hour the scene of action being hard by and the better to avert miscarriage employed a device a recent invention of my own by which the opening of the gladstone bag in which the bomb was carried should instantly determine the explosion mguire was somewhat dashed by this arrangement which was new to him and pointed out with excellent clear good sense that should he be arrested it would probably involve him in the fall of our opponents but i was not to be moved made a strong appeal to his patriotism gave him a good glass of whisky and despatched him on his glorious errand  our objective was the effigy of shakespeare in leicester square a spot i think admirably chosen not only for the sake of the dramatist still very foolishly claimed as a glory by the english race in spite of his disgusting political opinions but from the fact that the seats in the immediate neighbourhood are often thronged by children errandboys unfortunate young ladies of the poorer class and infirm old menall classes making a direct appeal to public pity and therefore suitable with our designs as mguire drew near his heart was inflamed by the most noble sentiment of triumph never had he seen the garden so crowded children still stumbling in the impotence of youth ran to and fro shouting and playing round the pedestal an old sick pensioner sat upon the nearest bench a medal on his breast a stick with which he walked for he was disabled by wounds reclining on his knee guilty england would thus be stabbed in the most delicate quarters the moment had indeed been well selected and mguire with a radiant prevision of the event drew merrily nearer suddenly his eye alighted on the burly form of a policeman standing hard by the effigy in an attitude of watch my bold companion paused he looked about him closely here and there at different points of the enclosure other men stood or loitered affecting an abstraction feigning to gaze upon the shrubs feigning to talk feigning to be weary and to rest upon the benches mguire was no child in these affairs he instantly divined one of the plots of the machiavellian gladstone  a chief difficulty with which we have to deal is a certain nervousness in the subaltern branches of the corps as the hour of some design draws near these chickensouled conspirators appear to suffer some revulsion of intent and frequently despatch to the authorities not indeed specific denunciations but vague anonymous warnings but for this purely accidental circumstance england had long ago been an historical expression on the receipt of such a letter the government lays a trap for its adversaries and surrounds the threatened spot with hirelings my blood sometimes boils in my veins when i consider the case of those who sell themselves for money in such a cause true thanks to the generosity of our supporters we patriots receive a very comfortable stipend i myself of course touch a salary which puts me quite beyond the reach of any peddling mercenary thoughts mguire again ere he joined our ranks was on the brink of starving and now thank god receives a decent income that is as it should be the patriot must not be diverted from his task by any base consideration and the distinction between our position and that of the police is too obvious to be stated  plainly however our leicester square design had been divulged the government had craftily filled the place with minions even the pensioner was not improbably a hireling in disguise and our emissary without other aid or protection than the simple apparatus in his bag found himself confronted by force brutal force that strong hand which was a character of the ages of oppression should he venture to deposit the machine it was almost certain that he would be observed and arrested a cry would arise and there was just a fear that the police might not be present in sufficient force to protect him from the savagery of the mob the scheme must be delayed he stood with his bag on his arm pretending to survey the front of the alhambra when there flashed into his mind a thought to appal the bravest the machine was set at the appointed hour it must explode and how in the interval was he to be rid of it  put yourself i beseech you into the body of that patriot there he was friendless and helpless a man in the very flower of life for he is not yet forty with long years of happiness before him and now condemned in one moment to a cruel and revolting death by dynamite the square he said went round him like a thaumatrope he saw the alhambra leap into the air like a balloon and reeled against the railing it is probable he fainted  when he came to himself a constable had him by the arm  my god he cried  you seem to be unwell sir said the hireling  i feel better now cried poor mguire and with uneven steps for the pavement of the square seemed to lurch and reel under his footing he fled from the scene of this disaster fled alas from what was he fleeing did he not carry that from which he fled along with him and had he the wings of the eagle had he the swiftness of the ocean winds could he have been rapt into the uttermost quarters of the earth how should he escape the ruin that he carried we have heard of living men who have been fettered to the dead the grievance soberly considered is no more than sentimental the case is but a fleabite to that of him who should be linked like poor mguire to an explosive bomb  a thought struck him in green street like a dart through his liver suppose it were the hour already he stopped as though he had been shot and plucked his watch out there was a howling in his ears as loud as a winter tempest his sight was now obscured as if by a cloud now as by a lightning flash would show him the very dust upon the street but so brief were these intervals of vision and so violently did the watch vibrate in his hands that it was impossible to distinguish the numbers on the dial he covered his eyes for a few seconds and in that space it seemed to him that he had fallen to be a man of ninety when he looked again the watchplate had grown legible he had twenty minutes twenty minutes and no plan  green street at that time was very empty and he now observed a little girl of about six drawing near to him and as she came kicking in front of her as children will a piece of wood she sang too and something in her accent recalling him to the past produced a sudden clearness in his mind here was a godsent opportunity  my dear said he would you like a present of a pretty bag  the child cried aloud with joy and put out her hands to take it she had looked first at the bag like a true child but most unfortunately before she had yet received the fatal gift her eyes fell directly on mguire and no sooner had she seen the poor gentlemans face than she screamed out and leaped backward as though she had seen the devil almost at the same moment a woman appeared upon the threshold of a neighbouring shop and called upon the child in anger come here colleen she said and dont be plaguing the poor old gentleman with that she reentered the house and the child followed her sobbing aloud  with the loss of this hope mguires reason swooned within him when next he awoke to consciousness he was standing before st martinsinthefields wavering like a drunken man the passersby regarded him with eyes in which he read as in a glass an image of the terror and horror that dwelt within his own  i am afraid you are very ill sir observed a woman stopping and gazing hard in his face can i do anything to help you  ill said mguire o god and then recovering some shadow of his selfcommand chronic madam said he a long course of the dumb ague but since you are so compassionatean errand that i lack the strength to carry out he gaspedthis bag to portman square o compassionate woman as you hope to be saved as you are a mother in the name of your babes that wait to welcome you at home oh take this bag to portman square i have a mother too he added with a broken voice number 19 portman square  i suppose he had expressed himself with too much energy of voice for the woman was plainly taken with a certain fear of him poor gentleman said she if i were you i would go home and she left him standing there in his distress  home thought mguire what a derision what home was there for him the victim of philanthropy he thought of his old mother of his happy youth of the hideous rending pang of the explosion of the possibility that he might not be killed that he might be cruelly mangled crippled for life condemned to lifelong pains blinded perhaps and almost surely deafened ah you spoke lightly of the dynamiters peril but even waiving death have you realised what it is for a fine brave young man of forty to be smitten suddenly with deafness cut off from all the music of life and from the voice of friendship and love how little do we realise the sufferings of others even your brutal government in the heyday of its lust for cruelty though it scruples not to hound the patriot with spies to pack the corrupt jury to bribe the hangman and to erect the infamous gallows would hesitate to inflict so horrible a doom not i am well aware from virtue not from philanthropy but with the fear before it of the withering scorn of the good  but i wander from mguire from this dread glance into the past and future his thoughts returned at a bound upon the present how had he wandered there and how longo heavens how long had he been about it he pulled out his watch and found that but three minutes had elapsed it seemed too bright a thing to be believed he glanced at the church clock and sure enough it marked an hour four minutes in advance of the watch  of all that he endured mguire declares that pang was the most desolate till then he had had one friend one counsellor in whom he plenarily trusted by whose advertisement he numbered the minutes that remained to him of life on whose sure testimony he could tell when the time was come to risk the last adventure to cast the bag away from him and take to flight and now in what was he to place reliance his watch was slow it might be losing time if so in what degree what limit could he set to its derangement and how much was it possible for a watch to lose in thirty minutes five ten fifteen it might be so already it seemed years since he had left st jamess hall on this so promising enterprise at any moment then the blow was to be looked for  in the face of this new distress the wild disorder of his pulses settled down and a broken weariness succeeded as though he had lived for centuries and for centuries been dead the buildings and the people in the street became incredibly small and faraway and bright london sounded in his ears stilly like a whisper and the rattle of the cab that nearly charged him down was like a sound from africa meanwhile he was conscious of a strange abstraction from himself and heard and felt his footfalls on the ground as those of a very old small debile and tragically fortuned man whom he sincerely pitied  as he was thus moving forward past the national gallery in a medium it seemed of greater rarity and quiet than ordinary air there slipped into his mind the recollection of a certain entry in whitcomb street hard by where he might perhaps lay down his tragic cargo unremarked thither then he bent his steps seeming as he went to float above the pavement and there in the mouth of the entry he found a man in a sleeved waistcoat gravely chewing a straw he passed him by and twice patrolled the entry scouting for the barest chance but the man had faced about and continued to observe him curiously  another hope was gone mguire reissued from the entry still followed by the wondering eyes of the man in the sleeved waistcoat he once more consulted his watch there were but fourteen minutes left to him at that it seemed as if a sudden genial heat were spread about his brain for a second or two he saw the world as red as blood and thereafter entered into a complete possession of himself with an incredible cheerfulness of spirits prompting him to sing and chuckle as he walked and yet this mirth seemed to belong to things external and within like a black and leadenheavy kernel he was conscious of the weight upon his soul    i care for nobody no not i    and nobody cares for me  he sang and laughed at the appropriate burthen so that the passengers stared upon him on the street and still the warmth seemed to increase and to become more genial what was life he considered and what he mguire what even erin our green erin all seemed so incalculably little that he smiled as he looked down upon it he would have given years had he possessed them for a glass of spirits but time failed and he must deny himself this last indulgence  at the corner of the haymarket he very jauntily hailed a hansom cab jumped in bade the fellow drive him to a part of the embankment which he named and as soon as the vehicle was in motion concealed the bag as completely as he could under the vantage of the apron and once more drew out his watch so he rode for five interminable minutes his heart in his mouth at every jolt scarce able to possess his terrors yet fearing to wake the attention of the driver by too obvious a change of plan and willing if possible to leave him time to forget the gladstone bag  at length at the head of some stairs on the embankment he hailed the cab was stopped and he alightedwith how glad a heart he thrust his hand into his pocket all was now over he had saved his life nor that alone but he had engineered a striking act of dynamite for what could be more pictorial what more effective than the explosion of a hansom cab as it sped rapidly along the streets of london he felt in one pocket then in another the most crushing seizure of despair descended on his soul and struck into abject dumbness he stared upon the driver he had not one penny  hillo said the driver dont seem well  lost my money said mguire in tones so faint and strange that they surprised his hearing  the man looked through the trap i dessay said he youve left your bag  mguire half unconsciously fetched it out and looking on that black continent at arms length withered inwardly and felt his features sharpen as with mortal sickness  this is not mine said he your last fare must have left it you had better take it to the station  now look here returned the cabman are you off your chump or am i  well then ill tell you what exclaimed mguire you take it for your fare  oh i dessay replied the driver anything else whats in your bag open it and let me see  no no returned mguire o no not that its a surprise its prepared expressly a surprise for honest cabmen  no you dont said the man alighting from his perch and coming very close to the unhappy patriot youre either going to pay my fare or get in again and drive to the office  it was at this supreme hour of his distress that mguire spied the stout figure of one godall a tobacconist of rupert street drawing near along the embankment the man was not unknown to him he had bought of his wares and heard him quoted for the soul of liberality and such was now the nearness of his peril that even at such a straw of hope he clutched with gratitude  thank god he cried here comes a friend of mine ill borrow and he dashed to meet the tradesman sir said he mr godall i have dealt with youyou doubtless know my facecalamities for which i cannot blame myself have overwhelmed me oh sir for the love of innocence for the sake of the bonds of humanity and as you hope for mercy at the throne of grace lend me twoandsix  i do not recognise your face replied mr godall but i remember the cut of your beard which i have the misfortune to dislike here sir is a sovereign which i very willingly advance to you on the single condition that you shave your chin  mguire grasped the coin without a word cast it to the cabman calling out to him to keep the change bounded down the steps flung the bag far forth into the river and fell headlong after it he was plucked from a watery grave it is believed by the hands of mr godall even as he was being hoisted dripping to the shore a dull and choked explosion shook the solid masonry of the embankment and far out in the river a momentary fountain rose and disappeared   footnote    4 the arabian author with that quaint particularity of touch     which our translation usually prætermits here registers a somewhat     interesting detail zero pronounced the word boom and the reader     if but for the nonce will possibly consent to follow him     the superfluous mansion continued   somerset in vain strove to attach a meaning to these words he had in the meanwhile applied himself assiduously to the flagon the plotter began to melt in twain and seemed to expand and hover on his seat and with a vague sense of nightmare the young man rose unsteadily to his feet and refusing the proffer of a third grog insisted that the hour was late and he must positively get to bed  dear me observed zero i find you very temperate but i will not be oppressive suffice it that we are now fast friends and my dear landlord au revoir  so saying the plotter once more shook hands and with the politest ceremonies and some necessary guidance conducted the bewildered young gentleman to the top of the stair  precisely how he got to bed was a point on which somerset remained in utter darkness but the next morning when at a blow he started broad awake there fell upon his mind a perfect hurricane of horror and wonder that he should have suffered himself to be led into the semblance of intimacy with such a man as his abominable lodger appeared in the cold light of day a mystery of human weakness true he was caught in a situation that might have tested the aplomb of talleyrand that was perhaps a palliation but it was no excuse for so wholesale a capitulation of principle for such a fall into criminal familiarity no excuse indeed was possible nor any remedy but to withdraw at once from the relation  as soon as he was dressed he hurried upstairs determined on a rupture zero hailed him with the warmth of an old friend  come in he cried dear mr somerset come in sit down and without ceremony join me at my morning meal  sir said somerset you must permit me first to disengage my honour last night i was surprised into a certain appearance of complicity but once for all let me inform you that i regard you and your machinations with unmingled horror and disgust and i will leave no stone unturned to crush your vile conspiracy  my dear fellow replied zero with an air of some complacency i am well accustomed to these human weaknesses disgust i have felt it myself it speedily wears off i think none the worse i think the more of you for this engaging frankness and in the meanwhile what are you to do you find yourself if i interpret rightly in very much the same situation as charles the second possibly the least degraded of your british sovereigns when he was taken into the confidence of the thief to denounce me is out of the question and what else can you attempt no dear mr somerset your hands are tied and you find yourself condemned under pain of behaving like a cad to be that same charming and intellectual companion who delighted me last night  at least cried somerset i can and do order you to leave this house  ah cried the plotter but there i fail to follow you you may if you please enact the part of judas but if as i suppose you recoil from that extremity of meanness i am on my side far too intelligent to leave these lodgings in which i please myself exceedingly and from which you lack the power to drive me no no dear sir here i am and here i propose to stay  i repeat cried somerset beside himself with a sense of his own weakness i repeat that i give you warning i am master of this house and i emphatically give you warning  a weeks warning said the imperturbable conspirator very well we will talk of it a week from now that is arranged and in the meanwhile i observe my breakfast growing cold do dear mr somerset since you find yourself condemned for a week at least to the society of a very interesting character display some of that open favour some of that interest in lifes obscurer sides which stamp the character of the true artist hang me if you will tomorrow but today show yourself divested of the scruple of the burgess and sit down pleasantly to share my meal  man cried somerset do you understand my sentiments  certainly replied zero and i respect them would you be outdone in such a contest will you alone be partial and in this nineteenth century cannot two gentlemen of education agree to differ on a point of politics come sir all your hard words have left me smiling judge then which of us is the philosopher  somerset was a young man of a very tolerant disposition and by nature easily amenable to sophistry he threw up his hands with a gesture of despair and took the seat to which the conspirator invited him the meal was excellent the host not only affable but primed with curious information he seemed indeed like one who had too long endured the torture of silence to exult in the most wholesale disclosures the interest of what he had to tell was great his character besides developed step by step and somerset as the time fled not only outgrew some of the discomfort of his false position but began to regard the conspirator with a familiarity that verged upon contempt in any circumstances he had a singular inability to leave the society in which he found himself company even if distasteful held him captive like a limed sparrow and on this occasion he suffered hour to follow hour was easily persuaded to sit down once more to table and did not even attempt to withdraw till on the approach of evening zero with many apologies dismissed his guest his fellowconspirators the dynamiter handsomely explained as they were unacquainted with the sterling qualities of the young man would be alarmed at the sight of a strange face  as soon as he was alone somerset fell back upon the humour of the morning he raged at the thought of his facility he paced the diningroom forming the sternest resolutions for the future he wrung the hand which had been dishonoured by the touch of an assassin and among all these whirling thoughts there flashed in from time to time and ever with a chill of fear the thought of the confounded ingredients with which the house was stored a powder magazine seemed a secure smokingroom alongside of the superfluous mansion  he sought refuge in flight in locomotion in the flowing bowl as long as the bars were open he travelled from one to another seeking light safety and the companionship of human faces when these resources failed him he fell back on the belated bakedpotato man and at length still pacing the streets he was goaded to fraternise with the police alas with what a sense of guilt he conversed with these guardians of the law how gladly had he wept upon their ample bosoms and how the secret fluttered to his lips and was still denied an exit fatigue began at last to triumph over remorse and about the hour of the first milkman he returned to the door of the mansion looked at it with a horrid expectation as though it should have burst that instant into flames drew out his key and when his foot already rested on the steps once more lost heart and fled for repose to the grisly shelter of a coffeeshop  it was on the stroke of noon when he awoke dismally searching in his pockets he found himself reduced to halfacrown and when he had paid the price of his distasteful couch saw himself obliged to return to the superfluous mansion he sneaked into the hall and stole on tiptoe to the cupboard where he kept his money yet half a minute he told himself and he would be free for days from his obseding lodger and might decide at leisure on the course he should pursue but fate had otherwise designed there came a tap at the door and zero entered  have i caught you he cried with innocent gaiety dear fellow i was growing quite impatient and on the speakers somewhat stolid face there came a glow of genuine affection i am so long unused to have a friend he continued that i begin to be afraid i may prove jealous and he wrung the hand of his landlord  somerset was of all men least fit to deal with such a greeting to reject these kind advances was beyond his strength that he could not return cordiality for cordiality was already almost more than he could carry that inequality between kind sentiments which to generous characters will always seem to be a sort of guilt oppressed him to the ground and he stammered vague and lying words  that is all right cried zerothat is as it should besay no more i had a vague alarm i feared you had deserted me but i now own that fear to have been unworthy and apologise to doubt of your forgiveness were to repeat my sin come then dinner waits join me again and tell me your adventures of the night  kindness still sealed the lips of somerset and he suffered himself once more to be set down to table with his innocent and criminal acquaintance once more the plotter plunged up to the neck in damaging disclosures now it would be the name and biography of an individual now the address of some important centre that rose as if by accident upon his lips and each word was like another turn of the thumbscrew to his unhappy guest finally the course of zeros bland monologue led him to the young lady of two days ago that young lady who had flashed on somerset for so brief a while but with so conquering a charm and whose engaging grace communicative eyes and admirable conduct of the sweeping skirt remained imprinted on his memory  you saw her said zero beautiful is she not she too is one of ours a true enthusiast nervous perhaps in presence of the chemicals but in matters of intrigue the very soul of skill and daring lake fonblanque de marly valdevia such are some of the names that she employs her true namebut there perhaps i go too far suffice it that it is to her i owe my present lodging and dear somerset the pleasure of your acquaintance it appears she knew the house you see dear fellow i make no concealment all that you can care to hear i tell you openly  for gods sake cried the wretched somerset hold your tongue you cannot imagine how you torture me  a shade of serious discomposure crossed the open countenance of zero  there are times he said when i begin to fancy that you do not like me why why dear somerset this lack of cordiality i am depressed the touchstone of my life draws near and if i failhe gloomily noddedfrom all the height of my ambitious schemes i fall dear boy into contempt these are grave thoughts and you may judge my need of your delightful company innocent prattler you relieve the weight of my concerns and yet  and yet the speaker pushed away his plate and rose from table follow me said he follow me my mood is on i must have air i must behold the plain of battle  so saying he led the way hurriedly to the top flat of the mansion and thence by ladder and trap to a certain leaded platform sheltered at one end by a great stalk of chimneys and occupying the actual summit of the roof on both sides it bordered without parapet or rail on the incline of slates and northward above all commanded an extensive view of housetops and rising through the smoke the distant spires of churches  here cried zero you behold this field of city rich crowded laughing with the spoil of continents but soon how soon to be laid low some day some night from this coign of vantage you shall perhaps be startled by the detonation of the judgment gunnot sharp and empty like the crack of cannon but deepmouthed and unctuously solemn instantly thereafter you shall behold the flames break forth ay he cried stretching forth his hand ay that will be a day of retribution then shall the pallid constable flee side by side with the detected thief blaze he cried blaze derided city fall flatulent monarchy fall like dagon  with these words his foot slipped upon the lead and but for somersets quickness he had been instantly precipitated into space pale as a sheet and limp as a pockethandkerchief he was dragged from the edge of downfall by one arm helped or rather carried down the ladder and deposited in safety on the attic landing here he began to come to himself wiped his brow and at length seizing somersets hand in both of his began to utter his acknowledgments  this seals it said he ours is a life and death connection you have plucked me from the jaws of death and if i were before attracted by your character judge now of the ardour of my gratitude and love but i perceive i am still greatly shaken lend me i beseech you lend me your arm as far as my apartment  a dram of spirits restored the plotter to something of his customary selfpossession and he was standing glass in hand and genially convalescent when his eye was attracted by the dejection of the unfortunate young man  good heavens dear somerset he cried what ails you let me offer you a touch of spirits  but somerset had fallen below the reach of this material comfort  let me be he said i am lost you have caught me in the toils up to this moment i have lived all my life in the most reckless manner and done exactly what i pleased with the most perfect innocence and nowwhat am i are you so blind and wooden that you do not see the loathing you inspire me with is it possible you can suppose me willing to continue to exist upon such terms to think he cried that a young man guilty of no fault on earth but amiability should find himself involved in such a damned imbroglio and placing his knuckles in his eyes somerset rolled upon the sofa  my god said zero is this possible and i so filled with tenderness and interest can it be dear somerset that you are under the empire of these outworn scruples or that you judge a patriot by the morality of the religious tract i thought you were a good agnostic  mr jones said somerset it is in vain to argue i boast myself a total disbeliever not only in revealed religion but in the data method and conclusions of the whole of ethics well what matters it what signifies a form of words i regard you as a reptile whom i would rejoice whom i long to stamp under my heel you would blow up others well then understand i want with every circumstance of infamy and agony to blow up you  somerset somerset said zero turning very pale this is wrong this is very wrong you pain you wound me somerset  give me a match cried somerset wildly let me set fire to this incomparable monster let me perish with him in his fall  for gods sake cried zero clutching hold of the young man for gods sake command yourself we stand upon the brink death yawns around us a mana stranger in this foreign landone whom you have called your friend  silence cried somerset you are no friend no friend of mine i look on you with loathing like a toad my flesh creeps with physical repulsion my soul revolts against the sight of you  zero burst into tears alas he sobbed this snaps the last link that bound me to humanity my friend disownshe insults me i am indeed accurst  somerset stood for an instant staggered by this sudden change of front the next moment with a despairing gesture he fled from the room and from the house the first dash of his escape carried him hard upon half way to the next policeoffice but presently began to droop and before he reached the house of lawful intervention he fell once more among doubtful counsels was he an agnostic had he a right to act away with such nonsense and let zero perish ran his thoughts and then again had he not promised had he not shaken hands and broken bread and that with open eyes and if so how could he take action and not forfeit honour but honour what was honour a figment which in the hot pursuit of crime he ought to dash aside ay but crime a figment too which his enfranchised intellect discarded all day he wandered in the parks a prey to whirling thoughts all night patrolled the city and at the peep of day he sat down by the wayside in the neighbourhood of peckham and bitterly wept his gods had fallen he who had chosen the broad daylit unencumbered paths of universal scepticism found himself still the bondslave of honour he who had accepted life from a point of view as lofty as the predatory eagles though with no design to prey he who had clearly recognised the common moral basis of war of commercial competition and of crime he who was prepared to help the escaping murderer or to embrace the impenitent thief found to the overthrow of all his logic that he objected to the use of dynamite the dawn crept among the sleeping villas and over the smokeless fields of city and still the unfortunate sceptic sobbed over his fall from consistency  at length he rose and took the rising sun to witness there is no question as to fact he cried right and wrong are but figments and the shadow of a word but for all that there are certain things that i cannot do and there are certain others that i will not stand thereupon he decided to return to make one last effort of persuasion and if he could not prevail on zero to desist from his infernal trade throw delicacy to the winds give the plotter an hours start and denounce him to the police fast as he went being winged by this resolution it was already well on in the morning when he came in sight of the superfluous mansion tripping down the steps was the young lady of the various aliases and he was surprised to see upon her countenance the marks of anger and concern  madam he began yielding to impulse and with no clear knowledge of what he was to add  but at the sound of his voice she seemed to experience a shock of fear or horror started back lowered her veil with a sudden movement and fled without turning from the square  here then we step aside a moment from following the fortunes of somerset and proceed to relate the strange and romantic episode of the brown box     desboroughs adventure  the brown box   mr harry desborough lodged in the fine and grave old quarter of bloomsbury roared about on every side by the high tides of london but itself rejoicing in romantic silences and city peace it was in queen square that he had pitched his tent next door to the childrens hospital on your left hand as you go north queen square sacred to humane and liberal arts whence homes were made beautiful where the poor were taught where the sparrows were plentiful and loud and where groups of patient little ones would hover all day long before the hospital if by chance they might kiss their hand or speak a word to their sick brother at the window desboroughs room was on the first floor and fronted to the square but he enjoyed besides a right by which he often profited to sit and smoke upon a terrace at the back which looked down upon a fine forest of back gardens and was in turn commanded by the windows of an empty room  on the afternoon of a warm day desborough sauntered forth upon this terrace somewhat out of hope and heart for he had been now some weeks on the vain quest of situations and prepared for melancholy and tobacco here at least he told himself that he would be alone for like most youths who are neither rich nor witty nor successful he rather shunned than courted the society of other men even as he expressed the thought his eye alighted on the window of the room that looked upon the terrace and to his surprise and annoyance he beheld it curtained with a silken hanging it was like his luck he thought his privacy was gone he could no longer brood and sigh unwatched he could no longer suffer his discouragement to find a vent in words or soothe himself with sentimental whistling and in the irritation of the moment he struck his pipe upon the rail with unnecessary force it was an old sweet seasoned briarroot glossy and dark with long employment and justly dear to his fancy what then was his chagrin when the head snapped from the stem leaped airily in space and fell and disappeared among the lilacs of the garden  he threw himself savagely into the garden chair pulled out the storypaper which he had brought with him to read tore off a fragment of the last sheet which contains only the answers to correspondents and set himself to roll a cigarette he was no master of the art again and again the paper broke between his fingers and the tobacco showered upon the ground and he was already on the point of angry resignation when the window swung slowly inward the silken curtain was thrust aside and a lady somewhat strangely attired stepped forth upon the terrace  señorito said she and there was a rich thrill in her voice like an organ note señorito you are in difficulties suffer me to come to your assistance  with the words she took the paper and tobacco from his unresisting hands and with a facility that in desboroughs eyes seemed magical rolled and presented him a cigarette he took it still seated still without a word staring with all his eyes upon that apparition her face was warm and rich in colour in shape it was that piquant triangle so innocently sly so saucily attractive so rare in our more northern climates her eyes were large starry and visited by changing lights her hair was partly covered by a lace mantilla through which her arms bare to the shoulder gleamed white her figure full and soft in all the womanly contours was yet alive and active light with excess of life and slender by grace of some divine proportion  you do not like my cigarrito señor she asked yet it is better made than yours at that she laughed and her laughter trilled in his ear like music but the next moment her face fell i see she cried it is my manner that repels you i am too constrained too cold i am not she added with a more engaging air i am not the simple english maiden i appear  oh murmured harry filled with inexpressible thoughts  in my own dear land she pursued things are differently ordered there i must own a girl is bound by many and rigorous restrictions little is permitted her she learns to be distant she learns to appear forbidding but here in free englandoh glorious liberty she cried and threw up her arms with a gesture of inimitable gracehere there are no fetters here the woman may dare to be herself entirely and the men the chivalrous menis it not written on the very shield of your nation honi soit ah it is hard for me to learn hard for me to dare to be myself you must not judge me yet awhile i shall end by conquering this stiffness i shall end by growing english do i speak the language well  perfectlyoh perfectly said harry with a fervency of conviction worthy of a graver subject  ah then she said i shall soon learn english blood ran in my fathers veins and i have had the advantage of some training in your expressive tongue if i speak already without accent with my thorough english appearance there is nothing left to change except my manners  oh no said desborough oh pray not imadam  i am interrupted the lady the señorita teresa valdevia the evening air grows chill adios señorito and before harry could stammer out a word she had disappeared into her room  he stood transfixed the cigarette still unlighted in his hand his thoughts had soared above tobacco and still recalled and beautified the image of his new acquaintance her voice reechoed in his memory her eyes of which he could not tell the colour haunted his soul the clouds had risen at her coming and he beheld a newcreated world what she was he could not fancy but he adored her her age he durst not estimate fearing to find her older than himself and thinking sacrilege to couple that fair favour with the thought of mortal changes as for her character beauty to the young is always good so the poor lad lingered late upon the terrace stealing timid glances at the curtained window sighing to the gold laburnums rapt into the country of romance and when at length he entered and sat down to dine on cold boiled mutton and a pint of ale he feasted on the food of gods  next day when he returned to the terrace the window was a little ajar and he enjoyed a view of the ladys shoulder as she sat patiently sewing and all unconscious of his presence on the next he had scarce appeared when the window opened and the señorita tripped forth into the sunlight in a morning disorder delicately neat and yet somehow foreign tropical and strange in one hand she held a packet  will you try she said some of my fathers tobaccofrom dear cuba there as i suppose you know all smoke ladies as well as gentlemen so you need not fear to annoy me the fragrance will remind me of home my home señor was by the sea and as she uttered these few words desborough for the first time in his life realised the poetry of the great deep awake or asleep i dream of it dear home dear cuba  but some day said desborough with an inward pang some day you will return  never she cried ah never in heavens name  are you then resident for life in england he inquired with a strange lightening of spirit  you ask too much for you ask more than i know she answered sadly and then resuming her gaiety of manner but you have not tried my cuban tobacco she said  señorita said he shyly abashed by some shadow of coquetry in her manner whatever comes to meyoui mean he concluded deeply flushing that i have no doubt the tobacco is delightful  ah señor she said with almost mournful gravity you seemed so simple and good and already you are trying to pay complimentsand besides she added brightening with a quick upward glance into a smile you do it so badly english gentlemen i used to hear could be fast friends respectful honest friends could be companions comforters if the need arose or champions and yet never encroach do not seek to please me by copying the graces of my countrymen be yourself the frank kindly honest english gentleman that i have heard of since my childhood and still longed to meet  harry much bewildered and far from clear as to the manners of the cuban gentlemen strenuously disclaimed the thought of plagiarism  your national seriousness of bearing best becomes you señor said the lady see marking a line with her dainty slippered foot thus far it shall be common ground there at my windowsill begins the scientific frontier if you choose you may drive me to my forts but if on the other hand we are to be real english friends i may join you here when i am not too sad or when i am yet more graciously inclined you may draw your chair beside the window and teach me english customs while i work you will find me an apt scholar for my heart is in the task she laid her hand lightly upon harrys arm and looked into his eyes do you know said she i am emboldened to believe that i have already caught something of your english aplomb do you not perceive a change señor slight perhaps but still a change is my deportment not more open more free more like that of the dear british miss than when you saw me first she gave a radiant smile withdrew her hand from harrys arm and before the young man could formulate in words the eloquent emotions that ran riot through his brainwith an adios señor goodnight my english friend she vanished from his sight behind the curtain  the next day harry consumed an ounce of tobacco in vain upon the neutral terrace neither sight nor sound rewarded him and the dinnerhour summoned him at length from the scene of disappointment on the next it rained but nothing neither business nor weather neither prospective poverty nor present hardship could now divert the young man from the service of his lady and wrapt in a long ulster with the collar raised he took his stand against the balustrade awaiting fortune the picture of damp and discomfort to the eye but glowing inwardly with tender and delightful ardours presently the window opened and the fair cuban with a smile imperfectly dissembled appeared upon the sill  come here she said here beside my window the small verandah gives a belt of shelter and she graciously handed him a foldingchair  as he sat down visibly aglow with shyness and delight a certain bulkiness in his pocket reminded him that he was not come emptyhanded  i have taken the liberty said he of bringing you a little book i thought of you when i observed it on the stall because i saw it was in spanish the man assured me it was by one of the best authors and quite proper as he spoke he placed the little volume in her hand her eyes fell as she turned the pages and a flush rose and died again upon her cheeks as deep as it was fleeting you are angry he cried in agony i have presumed  no señor it is not that returned the lady iand a flood of colour once more mounted to her browi am confused and ashamed because i have deceived you spanish she began and pausedspanish is of course my native tongue she resumed as though suddenly taking courage and this should certainly put the highest value on your thoughtful present but alas sir of what use is it to me and how shall i confess to you the truththe humiliating truththat i cannot read  as harrys eyes met hers in undisguised amazement the fair cuban seemed to shrink before his gaze read repeated harry you  she pushed the window still more widely open with a large and noble gesture enter señor said she the time has come to which i have long looked forward not without alarm when i must either fear to lose your friendship or tell you without disguise the story of my life  it was with a sentiment bordering on devotion that harry passed the window a semibarbarous delight in form and colour had presided over the studied disorder of the room in which he found himself it was filled with dainty stuffs furs and rugs and scarves of brilliant hues and set with elegant and curious triflesfans on the mantelshelf an antique lamp upon a bracket and on the table a silvermounted bowl of cocoanut about half full of unset jewels the fair cuban herself a gem of colour and the fit masterpiece for that rich frame motioned harry to a seat and sinking herself into another thus began her history     story of the fair cuban   i am not what i seem my father drew his descent on the one hand from grandees of spain and on the other through the maternal line from the patriot bruce my mother too was the descendant of a line of kings but alas these kings were african she was fair as the day fairer than i for i inherited a darker stain of blood from the veins of my european father her mind was noble her manners queenly and accomplished and seeing her more than the equal of her neighbours and surrounded by the most considerate affection and respect i grew up to adore her and when the time came received her last sigh upon my lips still ignorant that she was a slave and alas my fathers mistress her death which befell me in my sixteenth year was the first sorrow i had known it left our home bereaved of its attractions cast a shade of melancholy on my youth and wrought in my father a tragic and durable change months went by with the elasticity of my years i regained some of the simple mirth that had before distinguished me the plantation smiled with fresh crops the negroes on the estate had already forgotten my mother and transferred their simple obedience to myself but still the cloud only darkened on the brows of señor valdevia his absences from home had been frequent even in the old days for he did business in precious gems in the city of havana they now became almost continuous and when he returned it was but for the night and with the manner of a man crushed down by adverse fortune  the place where i was born and passed my days was an isle set in the caribbean sea some halfhours rowing from the coasts of cuba it was steep rugged and except for my fathers family and plantation uninhabited and left to nature the house a low building surrounded by spacious verandahs stood upon a rise of ground and looked across the sea to cuba the breezes blew about it gratefully fanned us as we lay swinging in our silken hammocks and tossed the boughs and flowers of the magnolia behind and to the left the quarter of the negroes and the waving fields of the plantation covered an eighth part of the surface of the isle on the right and closely bordering on the garden lay a vast and deadly swamp densely covered with wood breathing fever dotted with profound sloughs and inhabited by poisonous oysters maneating crabs snakes alligators and sickly fishes into the recesses of that jungle none could penetrate but those of african descent an invisible unconquerable foe lay there in wait for the european and the air was death  one morning from which i must date the beginning of my ruinous misfortune i left my room a little after day for in that warm climate all are early risers and found not a servant to attend upon my wants i made the circuit of the house still calling and my surprise had almost changed into alarm when coming at last into a large verandahed court i found it thronged with negroes even then even when i was amongst them not one turned or paid the least regard to my arrival they had eyes and ears for but one person a woman richly and tastefully attired of elegant carriage and a musical speech not so much old in years as worn and marred by selfindulgence her face which was still attractive stamped with the most cruel passions her eye burning with the greed of evil it was not from her appearance i believe but from some emanation of her soul that i recoiled in a kind of fainting terror as we hear of plants that blight and snakes that fascinate the woman shocked and daunted me but i was of a brave nature trod the weakness down and forcing my way through the slaves who fell back before me in embarrassment as though in the presence of rival mistresses i asked in imperious tones who is this person  a slave girl to whom i had been kind whispered in my ear to have a care for that was madam mendizabal but the name was new to me  in the meanwhile the woman applying a pair of glasses to her eyes studied me with insolent particularity from head to foot  young woman said she at last i have had a great experience in refractory servants and take a pride in breaking them you really tempt me and if i had not other affairs and these of more importance on my hand i should certainly buy you at your fathers sale  madam i began but my voice failed me  is it possible that you do not know your position she returned with a hateful laugh how comical positively i must buy her accomplishments i suppose she added turning to the servants  several assured her that the young mistress had been brought up like any lady for so it seemed in their inexperience  she would do very well for my place of business in havana said señora mendizabal once more studying me through her glasses and i should take a pleasure she pursued more directly addressing myself in bringing you acquainted with a whip and she smiled at me with a savoury lust of cruelty upon her face  at this i found expression calling by name upon the servants i bade them turn this woman from the house fetch her to the boat and set her back upon the mainland but with one voice they protested that they durst not obey coming close about me pleading and beseeching me to be more wise and when i insisted rising higher in passion and speaking of this foul intruder in the terms she had deserved they fell back from me as from one who had blasphemed a superstitious reverence plainly encircled the stranger i could read it in their changed demeanour and in the paleness that prevailed upon the natural colour of their faces and their fear perhaps reacted on myself i looked again at madam mendizabal she stood perfectly composed watching my face through her glasses with a smile of scorn and at the sight of her assured superiority to all my threats a cry broke from my lips a cry of rage fear and despair and i fled from the verandah and the house  i ran i knew not where but it was towards the beach as i went my head whirled so strange so sudden were these events and insults who was she what in heavens name the power she wielded over my obedient negroes why had she addressed me as a slave why spoken of my fathers sale to all these tumultuary questions i could find no answer and in the turmoil of my mind nothing was plain except the hateful leering image of the woman  i was still running mad with fear and anger when i saw my father coming to meet me from the landingplace and with a cry that i thought would have killed me leaped into his arms and broke into a passion of sobs and tears upon his bosom he made me sit down below a tall palmetto that grew not far off comforted me but with some abstraction in his voice and as soon as i regained the least command upon my feelings asked me not without harshness what this grief betokened i was surprised by his tone into a still greater measure of composure and in firm tones though still interrupted by sobs i told him there was a stranger in the island at which i thought he started and turned pale that the servants would not obey me that the strangers name was madam mendizabal and at that he seemed to me both troubled and relieved that she had insulted me treated me as a slave and here my fathers brow began to darken threatened to buy me at a sale and questioned my own servants before my face and that at last finding myself quite helpless and exposed to these intolerable liberties i had fled from the house in terror indignation and amazement  teresa said my father with singular gravity of voice i must make today a call upon your courage much must be told you there is much that you must do to help me and my daughter must prove herself a woman by her spirit as for this mendizabal what shall i say or how am i to tell you what she is twenty years ago she was the loveliest of slaves today she is what you see herprematurely old disgraced by the practice of every vice and every nefarious industry but free rich married they say to some reputable man whom may heaven assist and exercising among her ancient mates the slaves of cuba an influence as unbounded as its reason is mysterious horrible rites it is supposed cement her empire the rites of hoodoo be that as it may i would have you dismiss the thought of this incomparable witch it is not from her that danger threatens us and into her hands i make bold to promise you shall never fall  father i cried fall was there any truth then in her words am io father tell me plain i can bear anything but this suspense  i will tell you he replied with merciful bluntness your mother was a slave it was my design so soon as i had saved a competence to sail to the free land of britain where the law would suffer me to marry her a design too long procrastinated for death at the last moment intervened you will now understand the heaviness with which your mothers memory hangs about my neck  i cried out aloud in pity for my parents and in seeking to console the survivor i forgot myself  it matters not resumed my father what i have left undone can never be repaired and i must bear the penalty of my remorse but teresa with so cutting a reminder of the evils of delay i set myself at once to do what was still possible to liberate yourself  i began to break forth in thanks but he checked me with a sombre roughness  your mothers illness he resumed had engaged too great a portion of my time my business in the city had lain too long at the mercy of ignorant underlings my head my taste my unequalled knowledge of the more precious stones that art by which i can distinguish even on the darkest night a sapphire from a ruby and tell at a glance in what quarter of the earth a gem was disinterredall these had been too long absent from the conduct of affairs teresa i was insolvent  what matters that i cried what matters poverty if we be left together with our love and sacred memories  you do not comprehend he said gloomily slave as you are youngalas scarce more than childaccomplished beautiful with the most touching beauty innocent as an angelall these qualities that should disarm the very wolves and crocodiles are in the eyes of those to whom i stand indebted commodities to buy and sell you are a chattel a marketable thing and worthheavens that i should say such wordsworth money do you begin to see if i were to give you freedom i should defraud my creditors the manumission would be certainly annulled you would be still a slave and i a criminal  i caught his hand in mine kissed it and moaned in pity for myself in sympathy for my father  how i have toiled he continued how i have dared and striven to repair my losses heaven has beheld and will remember its blessing was denied to my endeavours or as i please myself by thinking but delayed to descend upon my daughters head at length all hope was at an end i was ruined beyond retrieve a heavy debt fell due upon the morrow which i could not meet i should be declared a bankrupt and my goods my lands my jewels that i so much loved my slaves whom i have spoiled and rendered happy and oh tenfold worse you my beloved daughter would be sold and pass into the hands of ignorant and greedy traffickers too long i saw had i accepted and profited by this great crime of slavery but was my daughter my innocent unsullied daughter was she to pay the price i cried outnoi took heaven to witness my temptation i caught up this bag and fled close upon my track are the pursuers perhaps tonight perhaps tomorrow they will land upon this isle sacred to the memory of the dear soul that bore you to consign your father to an ignominious prison and yourself to slavery and dishonour we have not many hours before us off the north coast of our isle by strange good fortune an english yacht has for some days been hovering it belongs to sir george greville whom i slightly know to whom ere now i have rendered unusual services and who will not refuse to help in our escape or if he did if his gratitude were in default i have the power to force him for what does it mean my childwhat means this englishman who hangs for years upon the shores of cuba and returns from every trip with new and valuable gems  he may have found a mine i hazarded  so he declares returned my father but the strange gift i have received from nature easily transpierced the fable he brought me diamonds only which i bought at first in innocence at a second glance i started for of these stones my child some had first seen the day in africa some in brazil while others from their peculiar water and rude workmanship i divined to be the spoil of ancient temples thus put upon the scent i made inquiries oh he is cunning but i was cunninger than he he visited i found the shop of every jeweller in town to one he came with rubies to one with emeralds to one with precious beryl to all with this same story of the mine but in what mine what rich epitome of the earths surface were there conjoined the rubies of ispahan the pearls of coromandel and the diamonds of golconda no child that man for all his yacht and title that man must fear and must obey me tonight then as soon as it is dark we must take our way through the swamp by the path which i shall presently show you thence across the highlands of the isle a track is blazed which shall conduct us to the haven on the north and close by the yacht is riding should my pursuers come before the hour at which i look to see them they will still arrive too late a trusty man attends on the mainland as soon as they appear we shall behold if it be dark the redness of a fireif it be day a pillar of smoke on the opposing headland and thus warned we shall have time to put the swamp between ourselves and danger meantime i would conceal this bag i would before all things be seen to arrive at the house with empty hands a babbling slave might else undo us for see he added and holding up the bag which he had already shown me he poured into my lap a shower of unmounted jewels brighter than flowers of every size and colour and catching as they fell upon a million dainty facets the ardour of the sun  i could not restrain a cry of admiration  even in your ignorant eyes pursued my father they command respect yet what are they but pebbles passive to the tool cold as death ingrate he cried each one of thesemiracles of natures patience conceived out of the dust in centuries of microscopical activity each one is for you and me a year of life liberty and mutual affection how then should i cherish them and why do i delay to place them beyond reach teresa follow me  he rose to his feet and led me to the borders of the great jungle where they overhung in a wall of poisonous and dusky foliage the declivity of the hill on which my fathers house stood planted for some while he skirted with attentive eyes the margin of the thicket then seeming to recognise some mark for his countenance became immediately lightened of a load of thought he paused and addressed me here said he is the entrance of the secret path that i have mentioned and here you shall await me i but pass some hundreds of yards into the swamp to bury my poor treasure as soon as that is safe i will return it was in vain that i sought to dissuade him urging the dangers of the place in vain that i begged to be allowed to follow pleading the black blood that i now knew to circulate in my veins to all my appeals he turned a deaf ear and bending back a portion of the screen of bushes disappeared into the pestilential silence of the swamp  at the end of a full hour the bushes were once more thrust aside and my father stepped from out the thicket and paused and almost staggered in the first shock of the blinding sunlight his face was of a singular dusky red and yet for all the heat of the tropical noon he did not seem to sweat  you are tired i cried springing to meet him you are ill  i am tired he replied the air in that jungle stifles one my eyes besides have grown accustomed to its gloom and the strong sunshine pierces them like knives a moment teresa give me but a moment all shall yet be well i have buried the hoard under a cypress immediately beyond the bayou on the lefthand margin of the path beautiful bright things they now lie whelmed in slime you shall find them there if needful but come let us to the house it is time to eat against our journey of the night to eat and then to sleep my poor teresa then to sleep and he looked upon me out of bloodshot eyes shaking his head as if in pity  we went hurriedly for he kept murmuring that he had been gone too long and that the servants might suspect passed through the airy stretch of the verandah and came at length into the grateful twilight of the shuttered house the meal was spread the house servants already informed by the boatmen of the masters return were all back at their posts and terrified as i could see to face me my father still murmuring of haste with weary and feverish pertinacity i hurried at once to take my place at table but i had no sooner left his arm than he paused and thrust forth both his hands with a strange gesture of groping how is this he cried in a sharp unhuman voice am i blind i ran to him and tried to lead him to the table but he resisted and stood stiffly where he was opening and shutting his jaws as if in a painful effort after breath then suddenly he raised both hands to his temples cried out my head my head and reeled and fell against the wall  i knew too well what it must be i turned and begged the servants to relieve him but they with one accord denied the possibility of hope the master had gone into the swamp they said the master must die all help was idle why should i dwell upon his sufferings i had him carried to a bed and watched beside him he lay still and at times ground his teeth and talked at times unintelligibly only that one word of hurry hurry coming distinctly to my ears and telling me that even in the last struggle with the powers of death his mind was still tortured by his daughters peril the sun had gone down the darkness had fallen when i perceived that i was alone on this unhappy earth what thoughts had i of flight of safety of the impending dangers of my situation beside the body of my last friend i had forgotten all except the natural pangs of my bereavement  the sun was some four hours above the eastern line when i was recalled to a knowledge of the things of earth by the entrance of the slavegirl to whom i have already referred the poor soul was indeed devotedly attached to me and it was with streaming tears that she broke to me the import of her coming with the first light of dawn a boat had reached our landingplace and set on shore upon our isle till now so fortunate a party of officers bearing a warrant to arrest my fathers person and a man of a gross body and low manners who declared the island the plantation and all its human chattels to be now his own i think said my slavegirl he must be a politician or some very powerful sorcerer for madam mendizabal had no sooner seen them coming than she took to the woods  fool said i it was the officer she feared and at any rate why does that beldam still dare to pollute the island with her presence and oh cora i exclaimed remembering my grief what matter all these troubles to an orphan  mistress said she i must remind you of two things never speak as you do now of madam mendizabal or never to a person of colour for she is the most powerful woman in this world and her real name even if one durst pronounce it were a spell to raise the dead and whatever you do speak no more of her to your unhappy cora for though it is possible she may be afraid of the police and indeed i think that i have heard she is in hiding and though i know that you will laugh and not believe yet it is true and proved and known that she hears every word that people utter in this whole vast world and your poor cora is already deep enough in her black books she looks at me mistress till my blood turns ice that is the first i had to say and now for the second do pray for heavens sake bear in mind that you are no longer the poor señors daughter he is gone dear gentleman and now you are no more than a common slavegirl like myself the man to whom you belong calls for you oh my dear mistress go at once with your youth and beauty you may still if you are winning and obedient secure yourself an easy life  for the moment i looked on the creature with the indignation you may conceive the next it was gone she did but speak after her kind as the bird sings or cattle bellow go said i go cora i thank you for your kind intentions leave me alone one moment with my dead father and tell this man that i will come at once  she went and i turning to the bed of death addressed to those deaf ears the last appeal and defence of my beleaguered innocence father i said it was your last thought even in the pangs of dissolution that your daughter should escape disgrace here at your side i swear to you that purpose shall be carried out by what means i know not by crime if need be and heaven forgive both you and me and our oppressors and heaven help my helplessness thereupon i felt strengthened as by long repose stepped to the mirror ay even in that chamber of the dead hastily arranged my hair refreshed my tearworn eyes breathed a dumb farewell to the originator of my days and sorrows and composing my features to a smile went forth to meet my master  he was in a great hot bustle reviewing that house once ours to which he had but now succeeded a corpulent sanguine man of middle age sensual vulgar humorous and if i judged rightly not illdisposed by nature but the sparkle that came into his eye as he observed me enter warned me to expect the worse  is this your late mistress he inquired of the slaves and when he had learnt it was so instantly dismissed them now my dear said he i am a plain man none of your damned spaniards but a true blue hardworking honest englishman my name is caulder  thank you sir said i and curtsied very smartly as i had seen the servants  come said he this is better than i had expected and if you choose to be dutiful in the station to which it has pleased god to call you you will find me a very kind old fellow i like your looks he added calling me by my name which he scandalously mispronounced is your hair all your own he then inquired with a certain sharpness and coming up to me as though i were a horse he grossly satisfied his doubts i was all one flame from head to foot but i contained my righteous anger and submitted that is very well he continued chucking me goodhumouredly under the chin you will have no cause to regret coming to old caulder eh but that is by the way what is more to the point is this your late master was a most dishonest rogue and levanted with some valuable property that belonged of rights to me now considering your relation to him i regard you as the likeliest person to know what has become of it and i warn you before you answer that my whole future kindness will depend upon your honesty i am an honest man myself and expect the same in my servants  do you mean the jewels said i sinking my voice into a whisper  that is just precisely what i do said he and chuckled  hush said i  hush he repeated and why hush i am on my own place i would have you to know and surrounded by my own lawful servants  are the officers gone i asked and oh how my hopes hung upon the answer  they are said he looking somewhat disconcerted why do you ask  i wish you had kept them i answered solemnly enough although my heart at that same moment leaped with exultation master i must not conceal from you the truth the servants on this estate are in a dangerous condition and mutiny has long been brewing  why he cried i never saw a milderlooking lot of niggers in my life but for all that he turned somewhat pale  did they tell you i continued that madam mendizabal is on the island that since her coming they obey none but her that if this morning they have received you with even decent civility it was only by her ordersissued with what afterthought i leave you to consider  madam jezebel said he well she is a dangerous devil the police are after her besides for a whole series of murders but after all what then to be sure she has a great influence with you coloured folk but what in fortunes name can be her errand here  the jewels i replied ah sir had you seen that treasure sapphire and emerald and opal and the golden topaz and rubies red as the sunsetof what incalculable worth of what unequalled beauty to the eyehad you seen it as i have and alas as she hasyou would understand and tremble at your danger  she has seen them he cried and i could see by his face that my audacity was justified by its success  i caught his hand in mine my master said i i am now yours it is my duty it should be my pleasure to defend your interests and life hear my advice then and i conjure you be guided by my prudence follow me privily let none see where we are going i will lead you to the place where the treasure has been buried that once disinterred let us make straight for the boat escape to the mainland and not return to this dangerous isle without the countenance of soldiers  what free man in a free land would have credited so sudden a devotion but this oppressor through the very arts and sophistries he had abused to quiet the rebellion of his conscience and to convince himself that slavery was natural fell like a child into the trap i laid for him he praised and thanked me told me i had all the qualities he valued in a servant and when he had questioned me further as to the nature and value of the treasure and i had once more artfully inflamed his greed bade me without delay proceed to carry out my plan of action  from a shed in the garden i took a pick and shovel and thence by devious paths among the magnolias led my master to the entrance of the swamp i walked first carrying as i was now in duty bound the tools and glancing continually behind me lest we should be spied upon and followed when we were come as far as the beginning of the path it flashed into my mind i had forgotten meat and leaving mr caulder in the shadow of a tree i returned alone to the house for a basket of provisions were they for him i asked myself and a voice within me answered no while we were face to face while i still saw before my eyes the man to whom i belonged as the hand belongs to the body my indignation held me bravely up but now that i was alone i conceived a sickness at myself and my designs that i could scarce endure i longed to throw myself at his feet avow my intended treachery and warn him from that pestilential swamp to which i was decoying him to die but my vow to my dead father my duty to my innocent youth prevailed upon these scruples and though my face was pale and must have reflected the horror that oppressed my spirits it was with a firm step that i returned to the borders of the swamp and with smiling lips that i bade him rise and follow me  the path on which we now entered was cut like a tunnel through the living jungle on either hand and overhead the mass of foliage was continuously joined the day sparingly filtered through the depth of superimpending wood and the air was hot like steam and heady with vegetable odours and lay like a load upon the lungs and brain underfoot a great depth of mould received our silent footprints on each side mimosas as tall as a man shrank from my passing skirts with a continuous hissing rustle and but for these sentient vegetables all in that den of pestilence was motionless and noiseless  we had gone but a little way in when mr caulder was seized with sudden nausea and must sit down a moment on the path my heart yearned as i beheld him and i seriously begged the doomed mortal to return upon his steps what were a few jewels in the scales with life i asked but no he said that witch madam jezebel would find them out he was an honest man and would not stand to be defrauded and so forth panting the while like a sick dog presently he got to his feet again protesting he had conquered his uneasiness but as we again began to go forward i saw in his changed countenance the first approaches of death  master said i you look pale deathly pale your pallor fills me with dread your eyes are bloodshot they are red like the rubies that we seek  wench he cried look before you look at your steps i declare to heaven if you annoy me once again by looking back i shall remind you of the change in your position  a little after i observed a worm upon the ground and told in a whisper that its touch was death presently a great green serpent vivid as the grass in spring wound rapidly across the path and once again i paused and looked back at my companion with a horror in my eyes the coffin snake said i the snake that dogs its victim like a hound  but he was not to be dissuaded i am an old traveller said he this is a foul jungle indeed but we shall soon be at an end  ay said i looking at him with a strange smile what end  thereupon he laughed again and again but not very heartily and then perceiving that the path began to widen and grow higher there said he what did i tell you we are past the worst  indeed we had now come to the bayou which was in that place very narrow and bridged across by a fallen trunk but on either hand we could see it broaden out under a cavern of great arms of trees and hanging creepers sluggish putrid of a horrible and sickly stench floated on by the flat heads of alligators and its banks alive with scarlet crabs  if we fall from that unsteady bridge said i see where the caiman lies ready to devour us if by the least divergence from the path we should be snared in a morass see where those myriads of scarlet vermin scour the border of the thicket once helpless how they would swarm together to the assault what could man do against a thousand of such mailed assailants and what a death were that to perish alive under their claws  are you mad girl he cried i bid you be silent and lead on  again i looked upon him half relenting and at that he raised the stick that was in his hand and cruelly struck me on the face lead on he cried again must i be all day catching my death in this vile slough and all for a prating slavegirl  i took the blow in silence i took it smiling but the blood welled back upon my heart something i know not what fell at that moment with a dull plunge in the waters of the lagoon and i told myself it was my pity that had fallen  on the farther side to which we now hastily scrambled the wood was not so dense the web of creepers not so solidly convolved it was possible here and there to mark a patch of somewhat brighter daylight or to distinguish through the lighter web of parasites the proportions of some soaring tree the cypress on the left stood very visibly forth upon the edge of such a clearing the path in that place widened broadly and there was a patch of open ground beset with horrible antheaps thick with their artificers i laid down the tools and basket by the cypress root where they were instantly blackened over with the crawling ants and looked once more in the face of my unconscious victim mosquitoes and foul flies wove so close a veil between us that his features were obscured and the sound of their flight was like the turning of a mighty wheel  here i said is the spot i cannot dig for i have not learned to use such instruments but for your own sake i beseech you to be swift in what you do  he had sunk once more upon the ground panting like a fish and i saw rising in his face the same dusky flush that had mantled on my fathers i feel ill he gasped horribly ill the swamp turns around me the drone of these carrion flies confounds me have you not wine  i gave him a glass and he drank greedily it is for you to think said i if you should further persevere the swamp has an ill name and at the word i ominously nodded  give me the pick said he where are the jewels buried  i told him vaguely and in the sweltering heat and closeness and dim twilight of the jungle he began to wield the pickaxe swinging it overhead with the vigour of a healthy man at first there broke forth upon him a strong sweat that made his face to shine and in which the greedy insects settled thickly  to sweat in such a place said i o master is this wise fever is drunk in through open pores  what do you mean he screamed pausing with the pick buried in the soil do you seek to drive me mad do you think i do not understand the danger that i run  that is all i want said i i only wish you to be swift and then my mind flitting to my fathers deathbed i began to murmur scarce above my breath the same vain repetition of words hurry hurry hurry  presently to my surprise the treasureseeker took them up and while he still wielded the pick but now with staggering and uncertain blows repeated to himself as it were the burthen of a song hurry hurry hurry and then again there is no time to lose the marsh has an ill name ill name and then back to hurry hurry hurry with a dreadful mechanical hurried and yet wearied utterance as a sick man rolls upon his pillow the sweat had disappeared he was now dry but all that i could see of him of the same dull brickred presently his pick unearthed the bag of jewels but he did not observe it and continued hewing at the soil  master said i there is the treasure  he seemed to waken from a dream where he cried and then seeing it before his eyes can this be possible he added i must be lightheaded girl he cried suddenly with the same screaming tone of voice that i had once before observed what is wrong is this swamp accursed  it is a grave i answered you will not go out alive and as for me my life is in gods hands  he fell upon the ground like a man struck by a blow but whether from the effect of my words or from sudden seizure of the malady i cannot tell pretty soon he raised his head you have brought me here to die he said at the risk of your own days you have condemned me why  to save my honour i replied bear me out that i have warned you greed of these pebbles and not i has been your undoer  he took out his revolver and handed it to me you see he said i could have killed you even yet but i am dying as you say nothing could save me and my bill is long enough already dear me dear me he said looking in my face with a curious puzzled and pathetic look like a dull child at school if there be a judgment afterwards my bill is long enough  at that i broke into a passion of weeping crawled at his feet kissed his hands begged his forgiveness put the pistol back into his grasp and besought him to avenge his death for indeed if with my life i could have bought back his i had not balanced at the cost but he was determined the poor soul that i should yet more bitterly regret my act  i have nothing to forgive said he dear heaven what a thing is an old fool i thought upon my word you had taken quite a fancy to me  he was seized at the same time with a dreadful swimming dizziness clung to me like a child and called upon the name of some woman presently this spasm which i watched with choking tears lessened and died away and he came again to the full possession of his mind i must write my will he said get out my pocketbook i did so and he wrote hurriedly on one page with a pencil do not let my son know he said he is a cruel dog is my son philip do not let him know how you have paid me out and then all of a sudden god he cried i am blind and clapped both hands before his eyes and then again and in a groaning whisper dont leave me to the crabs i swore i would be true to him so long as a pulse stirred and i redeemed my promise i sat there and watched him as i had watched my father but with what different with what appalling thoughts through the long afternoon he gradually sank all that while i fought an uphill battle to shield him from the swarms of ants and the clouds of mosquitoes the prisoner of my crime the night fell the roar of insects instantly redoubled in the dark arcades of the swamp and still i was not sure that he had breathed his last at length the flesh of his hand which i yet held in mine grew chill between my fingers and i knew that i was free  i took his pocketbook and the revolver being resolved rather to die than to be captured and laden besides with the basket and the bag of gems set forward towards the north the swamp at that hour of the night was filled with a continuous din animals and insects of all kinds and all inimical to life contributing their parts yet in the midst of this turmoil of sound i walked as though my eyes were bandaged beholding nothing the soil sank under my foot with a horrid slippery consistence as though i were walking among toads the touch of the thick wall of foliage by which alone i guided myself affrighted me like the touch of serpents the darkness checked my breathing like a gag indeed i have never suffered such extremes of fear as during that nocturnal walk nor have i ever known a more sensible relief than when i found the path beginning to mount and to grow firmer under foot and saw although still some way in front of me the silver brightness of the moon  presently i had crossed the last of the jungle and come forth amongst noble and lofty woods clean rock the clean dry dust the aromatic smell of mountain plants that had been baked all day in sunlight and the expressive silence of the night my negro blood had carried me unhurt across that reeking and pestiferous morass by mere good fortune i had escaped the crawling and stinging vermin with which it was alive and i had now before me the easier portion of my enterprise to cross the isle and to make good my arrival at the haven and my acceptance on the english yacht it was impossible by night to follow such a track as my father had described and i was casting about for any landmark and in my ignorance vainly consulting the disposition of the stars when there fell upon my ear from somewhere far in front the sound of many voices hurriedly singing  i scarce knew upon what grounds i acted but i shaped my steps in the direction of that sound and in a quarter of an hours walking came unperceived to the margin of an open glade it was lighted by the strong moon and by the flames of a fire in the midst there stood a little low and rude building surmounted by a cross a chapel as i then remembered to have heard long since desecrated and given over to the rites of hoodoo hard by the steps of entrance was a black mass continually agitated and stirring to and fro as if with inarticulate life and this i presently perceived to be a heap of cocks hares dogs and other birds and animals still struggling but helplessly tethered and cruelly tossed one upon another both the fire and the chapel were surrounded by a ring of kneeling africans both men and women now they would raise their palms half closed to heaven with a peculiar passionate gesture of supplication now they would bow their heads and spread their hands before them on the ground as the double movement passed and repassed along the line the heads kept rising and falling like waves upon the sea and still as if in time to these gesticulations the hurried chant continued i stood spellbound knowing that my life depended by a hair knowing that i had stumbled on a celebration of the rites of hoodoo  presently the door of the chapel opened and there came forth a tall negro entirely nude and bearing in his hand the sacrificial knife he was followed by an apparition still more strange and shocking madam mendizabal naked also and carrying in both hands and raised to the level of her face an open basket of wicker it was filled with coiling snakes and these as she stood there with the uplifted basket shot through the osier grating and curled about her arms at the sight of this the fervour of the crowd seemed to swell suddenly higher and the chant rose in pitch and grew more irregular in time and accent then at a sign from the tall negro where he stood motionless and smiling in the moon and firelight the singing died away and there began the second stage of this barbarous and bloody celebration from different parts of the ring one after another man or woman ran forth into the midst ducked with that same gesture of the thrownup hand before the priestess and her snakes and with various adjurations uttered aloud the blackest wishes of the heart death and disease were the favours usually invoked the death or the disease of enemies or rivals some calling down these plagues upon the nearest of their own blood and one to whom i swear i had been never less than kind invoking them upon myself at each petition the tall negro still smiling picked up some bird or animal from the heaving mass upon his left slew it with the knife and tossed its body on the ground at length it seemed it reached the turn of the high priestess she set down the basket on the steps moved into the centre of the ring grovelled in the dust before the reptiles and still grovelling lifted up her voice between speech and singing and with so great with so insane a fervour of excitement as struck a sort of horror through my blood  power she began whose name we do not utter power that is neither good nor evil but below them both stronger than good greater than evilall my life long i have adored and served thee who has shed blood upon thine altars whose voice is broken with the singing of thy praises whose limbs are faint before their age with leaping in thy revels who has slain the child of her body i she cried i metamnbogu by my own name i name myself i tear away the veil i would be served or perish hear me slime of the fat swamp blackness of the thunder venom of the serpents udderhear or slay me i would have two things o shapeless one o horror of emptinesstwo things or die the blood of my whitefaced husband oh give me that he is the enemy of hoodoo give me blood and yet another o racer of the blind winds o germinator in the ruins of the dead o root of life root of corruption i grow old i grow hideous i am known i am hunted for my life let thy servant then lay by this outworn body let thy chief priestess turn again to the blossom of her days and be a girl once more and the desired of all men even as in the past and o lord and master as i here ask a marvel not yet wrought since we were torn from the old land have i not prepared the sacrifice in which thy soul delighteththe kid without the horns  even as she uttered the words there was a great rumour of joy through all the circle of worshippers it rose and fell and rose again and swelled at last into rapture when the tall negro who had stepped an instant into the chapel reappeared before the door carrying in his arms the body of the slavegirl cora i know not if i saw what followed when next my mind awoke to a clear knowledge cora was laid upon the steps before the serpents the negro with the knife stood over her the knife rose and at this i screamed out in my great horror bidding them in gods name to pause  a stillness fell upon the mob of cannibals a moment more and they must have thrown off this stupor and i infallibly have perished but heaven had designed to save me the silence of these wretched men was not yet broken when there arose in the empty night a sound louder than the roar of any european tempest swifter to travel than the wings of any eastern wind blackness engulfed the world blackness stabbed across from every side by intricate and blinding lightning almost in the same second at one worldswallowing stride the heart of the tornado reached the clearing i heard an agonising crash and the light of my reason was overwhelmed  when i recovered consciousness the day was come i was unhurt the trees close about me had not lost a bough and i might have thought at first that the tornado was a feature in a dream it was otherwise indeed for when i looked abroad i perceived i had escaped destruction by a handsbreadth right through the forest which here covered hill and dale the storm had ploughed a lane of ruin on either hand the trees waved uninjured in the air of the morning but in the forthright course of its advance the hurricane had left no trophy standing everything in that line tree man or animal the desecrated chapel and the votaries of hoodoo had been subverted and destroyed in that brief spasm of anger of the powers of air everything but a yard or two beyond the line of its passage humble flower lofty tree and the poor vulnerable maid who now knelt to pay her gratitude to heaven awoke unharmed in the crystal purity and peace of the new day  to move by the path of the tornado was a thing impossible to man so wildly were the wrecks of the tall forest piled together by that fugitive convulsion i crossed it indeed with such labour and patience with so many dangerous slips and falls as left me at the farther side bankrupt alike of strength and courage there i sat down awhile to recruit my forces and as i ate how should i bless the kindliness of heaven my eye flitting to and fro in the colonnade of the great trees alighted on a trunk that had been blazed yes by the directing hand of providence i had been conducted to the very track i was to follow with what a light heart i now set forth and walking with how glad a step traversed the uplands of the isle  it was hard upon the hour of noon when i came all tattered and wayworn to the summit of a steep descent and looked below me on the sea about all the coast the surf roused by the tornado of the night beat with a particular fury and made a fringe of snow close at my feet i saw a haven set in precipitous and palmcrowned bluffs of rock just outside a ship was heaving on the surge so trimly sparred so glossily painted so elegant and pointdevice in every feature that my heart was seized with admiration the english colours blew from her masthead and from my high station i caught glimpses of her snowy planking as she rolled on the uneven deep and saw the sun glitter on the brass of her deck furniture there then was my ship of refuge and of all my difficulties only one remained to get on board of her  half an hour later i issued at last out of the woods on the margin of a cove into whose jaws the tossing and blue billows entered and along whose shores they broke with a surprising loudness a wooded promontory hid the yacht and i had walked some distance round the beach in what appeared to be a virgin solitude when my eye fell on a boat drawn into a natural harbour where it rocked in safety but deserted i looked about for those who should have manned her and presently in the immediate entrance of the wood spied the red embers of a fire and stretched around in various attitudes a party of slumbering mariners to these i drew near most were black a few white but all were dressed with the conspicuous decency of yachtsmen and one from his peaked cap and glittering buttons i rightly divined to be an officer him then i touched upon the shoulder he started up the sharpness of his movement woke the rest and they all stared upon me in surprise  what do you want inquired the officer  to go on board the yacht i answered  i thought they all seemed disconcerted at this and the officer with something of sharpness asked me who i was now i had determined to conceal my name until i met sir george and the first name that rose to my lips was that of the señora mendizabal at the word there went a shock about the little party of seamen the negroes stared at me with indescribable eagerness the whites themselves with something of a scared surprise and instantly the spirit of mischief prompted me to add and if the name is new to your ears call me metamnbogu  i had never seen an effect so wonderful the negroes threw their hands into the air with the same gesture i remarked the night before about the hoodoo campfire first one and then another ran forward and kneeled down and kissed the skirts of my torn dress and when the white officer broke out swearing and calling to know if they were mad the coloured seamen took him by the shoulders dragged him on one side till they were out of hearing and surrounded him with open mouths and extravagant pantomime the officer seemed to struggle hard he laughed aloud and i saw him make gestures of dissent and protest but in the end whether overcome by reason or simply weary of resistance he gave inapproached me civilly enough but with something of a sneering manner underneathand touching his cap my lady said he if that is what you are the boat is ready  my reception on board the nemorosa for so the yacht was named partook of the same mingled nature we were scarcely within hail of that great and elegant fabric where she lay rolling gunwale under and churning the blue sea to snow before the bulwarks were lined with the heads of a great crowd of seamen black white and yellow and these and the few who manned the boat began exchanging shouts in some lingua franca incomprehensible to me all eyes were directed on the passenger and once more i saw the negroes toss up their hands to heaven but now as if with passionate wonder and delight  at the head of the gangway i was received by another officer a gentlemanly man with blond and bushy whiskers and to him i addressed my demand to see sir george  but this is not he cried and paused  i know it returned the other officer who had brought me from the shore but what the devil can we do look at all the niggers  i followed his direction and as my eye lighted upon each the poor ignorant africans ducked and bowed and threw their hands into the air as though in the presence of a creature half divine apparently the officer with the whiskers had instantly come round to the opinion of his subaltern for he now addressed me with every signal of respect  sir george is at the island my lady said he for which with your ladyships permission i shall immediately make all sail the cabins are prepared steward take lady greville below  under this new name then and so captivated by surprise that i could neither think nor speak i was ushered into a spacious and airy cabin hung about with weapons and surrounded by divans the steward asked for my commands but i was by this time so wearied bewildered and disturbed that i could only wave him to leave me to myself and sink upon a pile of cushions presently by the changed motion of the ship i knew her to be under way my thoughts so far from clarifying grew the more distracted and confused dreams began to mingle and confound them and at length by insensible transition i sank into a dreamless slumber  when i awoke the day and night had passed and it was once more morning the world on which i reopened my eyes swam strangely up and down the jewels in the bag that lay beside me clinked together ceaselessly the clock and the barometer wagged to and fro like pendulums and overhead seamen were singing out at their work and coils of rope clattering and thumping on the deck yet it was long before i had divined that i was at sea long before i had recalled one after another the tragical mysterious and inexplicable events that had brought me where i was  when i had done so i thrust the jewels which i was surprised to find had been respected into the bosom of my dress and seeing a silver bell hard by upon a table rang it loudly the steward instantly appeared i asked for food and he proceeded to lay the table regarding me the while with a disquieting and pertinacious scrutiny to relieve myself of my embarrassment i asked him with as fair a show of ease as i could muster if it were usual for yachts to carry so numerous a crew  madam said he i know not who you are nor what mad desire has induced you to usurp a name and an appalling destiny that are not yours i warn you from the soul no sooner arrived at the island  at this moment he was interrupted by the whiskered officer who had entered unperceived behind him and now laid a hand upon his shoulder the sudden pallor the deadly and sick fear that was imprinted on the stewards face formed a startling addition to his words  parker said the officer and pointed towards the door  yes mr kentish said the steward for gods sake mr kentish and vanished with a white face from the cabin  thereupon the officer bade me sit down and began to help me and join in the meal i fill your ladyships glass said he and handed me a tumbler of neat rum  sir cried i do you expect me to drink this  he laughed heartily your ladyship is so much changed said he that i no longer expect any one thing more than any other  immediately after a white seaman entered the cabin saluted both mr kentish and myself and informed the officer there was a sail in sight which was bound to pass us very close and that mr harland was in doubt about the colours  being so near the island asked mr kentish  that was what mr harland said sir returned the sailor with a scrape  better not i think said mr kentish my compliments to mr harland and if she seem a lively boat give her the stars and stripes but if she be dull and we can easily outsail her show john dutchman that is always another word for incivility at sea so we can disregard a hail or a flag of distress without attracting notice  as soon as the sailor had gone on deck i turned to the officer in wonder mr kentish if that be your name said i are you ashamed of your own colours  your ladyship refers to the jolly roger he inquired with perfect gravity and immediately after went into peals of laughter pardon me said he but here for the first time i recognise your ladyships impetuosity nor try as i pleased could i extract from him any explanation of this mystery but only oily and commonplace evasion  while we were thus occupied the movement of the nemorosa gradually became less violent its speed at the same time diminished and presently after with a sullen plunge the anchor was discharged into the sea kentish immediately rose offered his arm and conducted me on deck where i found we were lying in a roadstead among many low and rocky islets hovered about by an innumerable cloud of seafowl immediately under our board a somewhat larger isle was green with trees set with a few low buildings and approached by a pier of very crazy workmanship and a little inshore of us a smaller vessel lay at anchor  i had scarce time to glance to the four quarters ere a boat was lowered i was handed in kentish took place beside me and we pulled briskly to the pier a crowd of villainous armed loiterers both black and white looked on upon our landing and again the word passed about among the negroes and again i was received with prostrations and the same gesture of the flungup hand by this what with the appearance of these men and the lawless seagirt spot in which i found myself my courage began a little to decline and clinging to the arm of mr kentish i begged him to tell me what it meant  nay madam he returned you know and leading me smartly through the crowd which continued to follow at a considerable distance and at which he still kept looking back i thought with apprehension he brought me to a low house that stood alone in an encumbered yard opened the door and begged me to enter  but why said i i demand to see sir george  madam returned mr kentish looking suddenly as black as thunder to drop all fence i know neither who nor what you are beyond the fact that you are not the person whose name you have assumed but be what you please spy ghost devil or most illjudging jester if you do not immediately enter that house i will cut you to the earth and even as he spoke he threw an uneasy glance behind him at the following crowd of blacks  i did not wait to be twice threatened i obeyed at once and with a palpitating heart and the next moment the door was locked from the outside and the key withdrawn the interior was long low and quite unfurnished but filled almost from end to end with sugarcane tarbarrels old tarry rope and other incongruous and highly inflammable material and not only was the door locked but the solitary window barred with iron  i was by this time so exceedingly bewildered and afraid that i would have given years of my life to be once more the slave of mr caulder i still stood with my hands clasped the image of despair looking about me on the lumber of the room or raising my eyes to heaven when there appeared outside the window bars the face of a very black negro who signed to me imperiously to draw near i did so and he instantly and with every mark of fervour addressed me a long speech in some unknown and barbarous tongue  i declare i cried clasping my brow i do not understand one syllable  not he said in spanish great great are the powers of hoodoo her very mind is changed but o chief priestess why have you suffered yourself to be shut into this cage why did you not call your slaves at once to your defence do you not see that all has been prepared to murder you at a spark this flimsy house will go in flames and alas who shall then be the chief priestess and what shall be the profit of the miracle  heavens cried i can i not see sir george i must i must come by speech of him oh bring me to sir george and my terror fairly mastering my courage i fell upon my knees and began to pray to all the saints  lordy cried the negro here they come and his black head was instantly withdrawn from the window  i never heard such nonsense in my life exclaimed a voice  why so we all say sir george replied the voice of mr kentish but put yourself in our place the niggers were near two to one and upon my word if youll excuse me sir considering the notion they have taken in their heads i regard it as precious fortunate for all of us that the mistake occurred  this is no question of fortune sir returned sir george it is a question of my orders and you may take my word for it kentish either harland or yourself or parkeror by george all three of youshall swing for this affair these are my sentiments give me the key and be off  immediately after the key turned in the lock and there appeared upon the threshold a gentleman between forty and fifty with a very open countenance and of a stout and personable figure  my dear young lady said he who the devil may you be  i told him all my story in one rush of words he heard me from the first with an amazement you can scarcely picture but when i came to the death of the señora mendizabal in the tornado he fairly leaped into the air  my dear child he cried clasping me in his arms excuse a man who might be your father this is the best news i ever had since i was born for that hag of a mulatto was no less a person than my wife he sat down upon a tarbarrel as if unmanned by joy dear me said he i declare this tempts me to believe in providence and what he added can i do for you  sir george said i i am already rich all that i ask is your protection  understand one thing he said with great energy i will never marry  i had not ventured to propose it i exclaimed unable to restrain my mirth i only seek to be conveyed to england the natural home of the escaped slave  well returned sir george frankly i owe you something for this exhilarating news besides your father was of use to me now i have made a small competence in businessa jewel mine a sort of naval agency et cætera and i am on the point of breaking up my company and retiring to my place in devonshire to pass a plain old age unmarried one good turn deserves another if you swear to hold your tongue about this island these little bonfire arrangements and the whole episode of my unfortunate marriage why ill carry you home aboard the nemorosa  i eagerly accepted his conditions  one thing more said he my late wife was some sort of a sorceress among the blacks and they are all persuaded she has come alive again in your agreeable person now you will have the goodness to keep up that fancy if you please and to swear to them on the authority of hoodoo or whatever his name may be that i am from this moment quite a sacred character  i swear it said i by my fathers memory and that is a vow that i will never break  i have considerably better hold on you than any oath returned sir george with a chuckle for you are not only an escaped slave but have by your own account a considerable amount of stolen property  i was struck dumb i saw it was too true in a glance i recognised that these jewels were no longer mine with similar quickness i decided they should be restored ay if it cost me the liberty that i had just regained forgetful of all else forgetful of sir george who sat and watched me with a smile i drew out mr caulders pocketbook and turned to the page on which the dying man had scrawled his testament how shall i describe the agony of happiness and remorse with which i read it for my victim had not only set me free but bequeathed to me the bag of jewels  my plain tale draws towards a close sir george and i in my character of his rejuvenated wife displayed ourselves arminarm among the negroes and were cheered and followed to the place of embarkation there sir george turning about made a speech to his old companions in which he thanked and bade them farewell with a very manly spirit and towards the end of which he fell on some expressions which i still remember if any of you gentry lose your money he said take care you do not come to me for in the first place i shall do my best to have you murdered and if that fails i hand you over to the law blackmail wont do for me ill rather risk all upon a cast than be pulled to pieces by degrees ill rather be found out and hang than give a doit to one manjack of you that same night we got under way and crossed to the port of new orleans whence as a sacred trust i sent the pocketbook to mr caulders son in a weeks time the men were all paid off new hands were shipped and the nemorosa weighed her anchor for old england  a more delightful voyage it were hard to fancy sir george of course was not a conscientious man but he had an unaffected gaiety of character that naturally endeared him to the young and it was interesting to hear him lay out his projects for the future when he should be returned to parliament and place at the service of the nation his experience of marine affairs i asked him if his notion of piracy upon a private yacht were not original but he told me no a yacht miss valdevia he observed is a chartered nuisance who smuggles who robs the salmon rivers of the west of scotland who cruelly beats the keepers if they dare to intervene the crews and the proprietors of yachts all i have done is to extend the line a trifle and if you ask me for my unbiassed opinion i do not suppose that i am in the least alone  in short we were the best of friends and lived like father and daughter though i still withheld from him of course that respect which is only due to moral excellence  we were still some days sail from england when sir george obtained from an outwardbound ship a packet of newspapers and from that fatal hour my misfortunes recommenced he sat the same evening in the cabin reading the news and making savoury comments on the decline of england and the poor condition of the navy when i suddenly observed him to change countenance  hullo said he this is bad this is deuced bad miss valdevia you would not listen to sound sense you would send that pocketbook to that man caulders son  sir george said i it was my duty  you are prettily paid for it at least says he and much as i regret it i for one am done with you this fellow caulder demands your extradition  but a slave i returned is safe in england  yes by george replied the baronet but its not a slave miss valdevia its a thief that he demands he has quietly destroyed the will and now accuses you of robbing your fathers bankrupt estate of jewels to the value of a hundred thousand pounds  i was so much overcome by indignation at this hateful charge and concern for my unhappy fate that the genial baronet made haste to put me more at ease  do not be cast down said he of course i wash my hands of you myself a man in my positionbaronet old family and all thatcannot possibly be too particular about the company he keeps but i am a deuced goodhumoured old boy let me tell you when not ruffled and i will do the best i can to put you right i will lend you a trifle of ready money give you the address of an excellent lawyer in london and find a way to set you on shore unsuspected  he was in every particular as good as his word four days later the nemorosa sounded her way under the cloak of a dark night into a certain haven of the coast of england and a boat rowing with muffled oars set me ashore upon the beach within a stones throw of a railway station thither guided by sir georges directions i groped a devious way and finding a bench upon the platform sat me down wrapped in a mans fur greatcoat to await the coming of the day it was still dark when a light was struck behind one of the windows of the building nor had the east begun to kindle to the warmer colours of the dawn before a porter carrying a lantern issued from the door and found himself face to face with the unfortunate teresa he looked all about him in the grey twilight of the dawn the haven was seen to lie deserted and the yacht had long since disappeared  who are you he cried  i am a traveller said i  and where do you come from he asked  im going by the first train to london i replied  in such manner like a ghost or a new creation was teresa with her bag of jewels landed on the shores of england in this silent fashion without history or name she took her place among the millions of a new country  since then i have lived by the expedients of my lawyer lying concealed in quiet lodgings dogged by the spies of cuba and not knowing at what hour my liberty and honour may be lost     the brown box concluded   the effect of this tale on the mind of harry desborough was instant and convincing the fair cuban had been already the loveliest she now became in his eyes the most romantic the most innocent and the most unhappy of her sex he was bereft of words to utter what he felt what pity what admiration what youthful envy of a career so vivid and adventurous oh madam he began and finding no language adequate to that apostrophe caught up her hand and wrung it in his own count upon me he added with bewildered fervour and getting somehow or other out of the apartment and from the circle of that radiant sorceress he found himself in the strange outofdoors beholding dull houses wondering at dull passersby a fallen angel she had smiled upon him as he left and with how significant how beautiful a smile the memory lingered in his heart and when he found his way to a certain restaurant where music was performed flutes as it were of paradise accompanied his meal the strings went to the melody of that parting smile they paraphrased and glossed it in the sense that he desired and for the first time in his plain and somewhat dreary life he perceived himself to have a taste for music  the next day and the next his meditations moved to that delectable air now he saw her and was favoured now saw her not at all now saw her and was put by the fall of her foot upon the stair entranced him the books that he sought out and read were books on cuba and spoke of her indirectly nay and in the very landladys parlour he found one that told of precisely such a hurricane and down to the smallest detail confirmed had confirmation been required the truth of her recital presently he began to fall into that prettiest mood of a young love in which the lover scorns himself for his presumption who was he the dull one the commonplace unemployed the man without adventure the impure the untruthful to aspire to such a creature made of fire and air and hallowed and adorned by such incomparable passages of life what should he do to be more worthy by what devotion call down the notice of these eyes to so terrene a being as himself  he betook himself thereupon to the rural privacy of the square where being a lad of a kind heart he had made himself a circle of acquaintances among its shy frequenters the halfdomestic cats and the visitors that hung before the windows of the childrens hospital there he walked considering the depth of his demerit and the height of the adored ones superexcellence now lighting upon earth to say a pleasant word to the brother of some infant invalid now with a great heave of breath remembering the queen of women and the sunshine of his life  what was he to do teresa he had observed was in the habit of leaving the house towards afternoon she might perchance run danger from some cuban emissary when the presence of a friend might turn the balance in her favour how then if he should follow her to offer his company would seem like an intrusion to dog her openly were a manifest impertinence he saw himself reduced to a more stealthy part which though in some ways distasteful to his mind he did not doubt that he could practise with the skill of a detective  the next day he proceeded to put his plan in action at the corner of tottenham court road however the señorita suddenly turned back and met him face to face with every mark of pleasure and surprise  ah señor i am sometimes fortunate she cried i was looking for a messenger and with the sweetest of smiles she despatched him to the east end of london to an address which he was unable to find this was a bitter pill to the knighterrant but when he returned at night worn out with fruitless wandering and dismayed by his fiasco the lady received him with a friendly gaiety protesting that all was for the best since she had changed her mind and long since repented of her message  next day he resumed his labours glowing with pity and courage and determined to protect teresa with his life but a painful shock awaited him in the narrow and silent hanway street she turned suddenly about and addressed him with a manner and a light in her eyes that were new to the young mans experience  do i understand that you follow me señor she cried are these the manners of the english gentleman  harry confounded himself in the most abject apologies and prayers to be forgiven vowed to offend no more and was at length dismissed crestfallen and heavy of heart the check was final he gave up that road to service and began once more to hang about the square or on the terrace filled with remorse and love admirable and idiotic a fit object for the scorn and envy of older men in these idle hours while he was courting fortune for a sight of the beloved it fell out naturally that he should observe the manners and appearance of such as came about the house one person alone was the occasional visitor of the young lady a man of considerable stature and distinguished only by the doubtful ornament of a chinbeard in the style of an american deacon something in his appearance grated upon harry this distaste grew upon him in the course of days and when at length he mustered courage to inquire of the fair cuban who this was he was yet more dismayed by her reply  that gentleman said she a smile struggling to her face that gentleman i will not attempt to conceal from you desires my hand in marriage and presses me with the most respectful ardour alas what am i to say i the forlorn teresa how shall i refuse or accept such protestations  harry feared to say more a horrid pang of jealousy transfixed him and he had scarce the strength of mind to take his leave with decency in the solitude of his own chamber he gave way to every manifestation of despair he passionately adored the señorita but it was not only the thought of her possible union with another that distressed his soul it was the indefeasible conviction that her suitor was unworthy to a duke a bishop a victorious general or any man adorned with obvious qualities he had resigned her with a sort of bitter joy he saw himself follow the wedding party from a great way off he saw himself return to the poor house then robbed of its jewel and while he could have wept for his despair he felt he could support it nobly but this affair looked otherwise the man was patently no gentleman he had a startled skulking guilty bearing his nails were black his eyes evasive his love perhaps was a pretext he was perhaps under this deep disguise a cuban emissary harry swore that he would satisfy these doubts and the next evening about the hour of the usual visit he posted himself at a spot whence his eye commanded the three issues of the square  presently after a fourwheeler rumbled to the door and the man with the chinbeard alighted paid off the cabman and was seen by harry to enter the house with a brown box hoisted on his back half an hour later he came forth again without the box and struck eastward at a rapid walk and desborough with the same skill and caution that he had displayed in following teresa proceeded to dog the steps of her admirer the man began to loiter studying with apparent interest the wares of the small fruiterer or tobacconist twice he returned hurriedly upon his former course and then as though he had suddenly conquered a moments hesitation once more set forth with resolute and swift steps in the direction of lincolns inn at length in a deserted bystreet he turned and coming up to harry with a countenance which seemed to have become older and whiter inquired with some severity of speech if he had not had the pleasure of seeing the gentleman before  you have sir said harry somewhat abashed but with a good show of stoutness and i will not deny that i was following you on purpose doubtless he added for he supposed that all mens minds must still be running on teresa you can divine my reason  at these words the man with the chinbeard was seized with a palsied tremor he seemed for some seconds to seek the utterance which his fear denied him and then whipping sharply about he took to his heels at the most furious speed of running  harry was at first so taken aback that he neglected to pursue and by the time he had recovered his wits his best expedition was only rewarded by a glimpse of the man with the chinbeard mounting into a hansom which immediately after disappeared into the moving crowds of holborn  puzzled and dismayed by this unusual behaviour harry returned to the house in queen square and ventured for the first time to knock at the fair cubans door she bade him enter and he found her kneeling with rather a disconsolate air beside a brown wooden trunk  señorita he broke out i doubt whether that mans character is what he wishes you to believe his manner when he found and indeed when i admitted that i was following him was not the manner of an honest man  oh she cried throwing up her hands as in desperation don quixote don quixote have you again been tilting against windmills and then with a laugh poor soul she added how you must have terrified him for know that the cuban authorities are here and your poor teresa may soon be hunted down even yon humble clerk from my solicitors office may find himself at any moment the quarry of armed spies  a humble clerk cried harry why you told me yourself that he wished to marry you  i thought you english like what you call a joke replied the lady calmly as a matter of fact he is my lawyers clerk and has been here tonight charged with disastrous news i am in sore straits señor harry will you help me  at this most welcome word the young mans heart exulted and in the hope pride and selfesteem that kindled with the very thought of service he forgot to dwell upon the ladys jest can you ask he cried what is there that i can do only tell me that  with signs of an emotion that was certainly unfeigned the fair cuban laid her hand upon the box this box she said contains my jewels papers and clothes all in a word that still connects me with cuba and my dreadful past they must now be smuggled out of england or by the opinion of my lawyer i am lost beyond remedy tomorrow on board the irish packet a sure hand awaits the box the problem still unsolved is to find some one to carry it as far as holyhead to see it placed on board the steamer and instantly return to town will you be he will you leave tomorrow by the first train punctually obey orders bear still in mind that you are surrounded by cuban spies and without so much as a look behind you or a single movement to betray your interest leave the box where you have put it and come straight on shore will you do this and so save your friend  i do not clearly understand  began harry  no more do i replied the cuban it is not necessary that we should so long as we obey the lawyers orders  señorita returned harry gravely i think this of course a very little thing to do for you when i would willingly do all but suffer me to say one word if london is unsafe for your treasures it cannot long be safe for you and indeed if i at all fathom the plan of your solicitor i fear i may find you already fled on my return i am not considered clever and can only speak out plainly what is in my heart that i love you and that i cannot bear to lose all knowledge of you i hope no more than to be your servant i ask no more than just that i shall hear of you oh promise me so much  you shall she said after a pause i promise you you shall but though she spoke with earnestness the marks of great embarrassment and a strong conflict of emotions appeared upon her face  i wish to tell you resumed desborough in case of accidents  accidents she cried why do you say that  i do not know said he you may be gone before my return and we may not meet again for long and so i wished you to know this that since the day you gave me the cigarette you have never once not once been absent from my mind and if it will in any way serve you you may crumple me up like that piece of paper and throw me on the fire i would love to die for you  go she said go now at once my brain is in a whirl i scarce know what we are talking go and goodnight and oh may you come safe  once back in his own room a fearful joy possessed the young mans mind and as he recalled her face struck suddenly white and the broken utterance of her last words his heart at once exulted and misgave him love had indeed looked upon him with a tragic mask and yet what mattered since at least it was lovesince at least she was commoved at their division he got to bed with these particoloured thoughts passed from one dream to another all night long the white face of teresa still haunting him wrung with unspoken thoughts and in the grey of the dawn leaped suddenly out of bed in a kind of horror it was already time for him to rise he dressed made his breakfast on cold food that had been laid for him the night before and went down to the room of his idol for the box the door was open a strange disorder reigned within the furniture all pushed aside and the centre of the room left bare of impediment as though for the pacing of a creature with a tortured mind there lay the box however and upon the lid a paper with these words harry i hope to be back before you go teresa  he sat down to wait laying his watch before him on the table she had called him harry that should be enough he thought to fill the day with sunshine and yet somehow the sight of that disordered room still poisoned his enjoyment the door of the bedchamber stood gaping open and though he turned aside his eyes as from a sacrilege he could not but observe the bed had not been slept in he was still pondering what this should mean still trying to convince himself that all was well when the moving needle of his watch summoned him to set forth without delay he was before all things a man of his word ran round to southampton row to fetch a cab and taking the box on the front seat drove off towards the terminus  the streets were scarcely awake there was little to amuse the eye and the young mans attention centred on the dumb companion of his drive a card was nailed upon one side bearing the superscription miss doolan passenger to dublin glass with care he thought with a sentimental shock that the fair idol of his heart was perhaps driven to adopt the name of doolan and as he still studied the card he was aware of a deadly black depression settling steadily upon his spirits it was in vain for him to contend against the tide in vain that he shook himself or tried to whistle the sense of some impending blow was not to be averted he looked out in the long empty streets the cab pursued its way without a trace of any follower he gave ear and over and above the jolting of the wheels upon the road he was conscious of a certain regular and quiet sound that seemed to issue from the box he put his ear to the cover at one moment he seemed to perceive a delicate ticking the next the sound was gone nor could his closest hearkening recapture it he laughed at himself but still the gloom continued and it was with more than the common relief of an arrival that he leaped from the cab before the station  probably enough on purpose teresa had named an hour some thirty minutes earlier than needful and when harry had given the box into the charge of a porter who set it on a truck he proceeded briskly to pace the platform presently the bookstall opened and the young man was looking at the books when he was seized by the arm he turned and though she was closely veiled at once recognised the fair cuban  where is it she asked and the sound of her voice surprised him  it he said what  the box have it put on a cab instantly i am in fearful haste  he hurried to obey marvelling at these changes but not daring to trouble her with questions and when the cab had been brought round and the box mounted on the front she passed a little way off upon the pavement and beckoned him to follow  now said she still in those mechanical and hushed tones that had at first affected him you must go on to holyhead alone go on board the steamer and if you see a man in tartan trousers and a pink scarf say to him that all has been put off if not she added with a sobbing sigh it does not matter so goodbye  teresa said harry get into your cab and i will go along with you you are in some distress perhaps some danger and till i know the whole not even you can make me leave you  you will not she asked oh harry it were better  i will not said harry stoutly  she looked at him for a moment through her veil took his hand suddenly and sharply but more as if in fear than tenderness and still holding him walked to the cabdoor  where are we to drive asked harry  home quickly she answered double fare and as soon as they had both mounted to their places the vehicle crazily trundled from the station  teresa leaned back in a corner the whole way harry could perceive her tears to flow under her veil but she vouchsafed no explanation at the door of the house in queen square both alighted and the cabman lowered the box which harry glad to display his strength received upon his shoulders  let the man take it she whispered let the man take it  i will do no such thing said harry cheerfully and having paid the fare he followed teresa through the door which she had opened with her key the landlady and maid were gone upon their morning errands the house was empty and still and as the rattling of the cab died away down gloucester street and harry continued to ascend the stair with his burthen he heard close against his shoulders the same faint and muffled ticking as before the lady still preceding him opened the door of her room and helped him to lower the box tenderly in the corner by the window  and now said harry what is wrong  you will not go away she cried with a sudden break in her voice and beating her hands together in the very agony of impatience oh harry harry go away oh go and leave me to the fate that i deserve  the fate repeated harry what is this  no fate she resumed i do not know what i am saying but i wish to be alone you may come back this evening harry come again when you like but leave me now only leave me now and then suddenly i have an errand she exclaimed you cannot refuse me that  no replied harry you have no errand you are in grief or danger lift your veil and tell me what it is  then she said with a sudden composure you leave but one course open to me and raising the veil she showed him a countenance from which every trace of colour had fled eyes marred with weeping and a brow on which resolve had conquered fear harry she began i am not what i seem  you have told me that before said harry several times  oh harry harry she cried how you shame me but this is the gods truth i am a dangerous and wicked girl my name is clara luxmore i was never nearer cuba than penzance from first to last i have cheated and played with you and what i am i dare not even name to you in words indeed until today until the sleepless watches of last night i never grasped the depth and foulness of my guilt  the young man looked upon her aghast then a generous current poured along his veins that is all one he said if you be all you say you have the greater need of me  is it possible she exclaimed that i have schemed in vain and will nothing drive you from this house of death  of death he echoed  death she cried death in that box which you have dragged about london and carried on your defenceless shoulders sleep at the triggers mercy the destroying energies of dynamite  my god cried harry  ah she continued wildly will you flee now at any moment you may hear the click that sounds the ruin of this building i was sure mguire was wrong this morning before day i flew to zero he confirmed my fears i beheld you my beloved harry fall a victim to my own contrivances i knew then i loved youharry will you go now will you not spare me this unwilling crime  harry remained speechless his eyes fixed upon the box at last he turned to her  is it he asked hoarsely an infernal machine  her lips formed the word yes which her voice refused to utter  with fearful curiosity he drew near and bent above the box in that still chamber the ticking was distinctly audible and at the measured sound the blood flowed back upon his heart  for whom he asked  what matters it she cried seizing him by the arm if you may still be saved what matter questions  god in heaven cried harry and the childrens hospital at whatever cost this damned contrivance must be stopped  it cannot she gasped the power of man cannot avert the blow but you harryyou my belovedyou may still  and then from the box that lay so quietly in the corner a sudden catch was audible like the catch of a clock before it strikes the hour for one second the two stared at each other with lifted brows and stony eyes then harry throwing one arm over his face with the other clutched the girl to his breast and staggered against the wall  a dull and startling thud resounded through the room their eyes blinked against the coming horror and still clinging together like drowning people they fell to the floor then followed a prolonged and strident hissing as from the indignant pit an offensive stench seized them by the throat the room was filled with dense and choking fumes  presently these began a little to disperse and when at length they drew themselves all limp and shaken to a sitting posture the first object that greeted their vision was the box reposing uninjured in its corner but still leaking little wreaths of vapour round the lid  oh poor zero cried the girl with a strange sobbing laugh alas poor zero this will break his heart     the superfluous mansion concluded   somerset ran straight upstairs the door of the drawingroom contrary to all custom was unlocked and bursting in the young man found zero seated on a sofa in an attitude of singular dejection close beside him stood an untasted grog the mark of strong preoccupation the room besides was in confusion boxes had been tumbled to and fro the floor was strewn with keys and other implements and in the midst of this disorder lay a ladys glove  i have come cried somerset to make an end of this either you will instantly abandon all your schemes or cost what it may i will denounce you to the police  ah replied zero slowly shaking his head you are too late dear fellow i am already at the end of all my hopes and fallen to be a laughingstock and mockery my reading he added with a gentle despondency of manner has not been much among romances yet i recall from one a phrase that depicts my present state with critical exactitude and you behold me sitting here like a burst drum  what has befallen you cried somerset  my last batch retorted the plotter wearily like all the others is a hollow mockery and a fraud in vain do i combine the elements in vain adjust the springs and i have now arrived at such a pitch of disconsideration that except yourself dear fellow i do not know a soul that i can face my subordinates themselves have turned upon me what language have i heard today what illiberality of sentiment what pungency of expression she came once i could have pardoned that for she was moved but she returned returned to announce to me this crushing blow and somerset she was very inhumane yes dear fellow i have drunk a bitter cup the speech of females is remarkable for  well well denounce me if you will you but denounce the dead i am extinct it is strange how at this supreme crisis of my life i should be haunted by quotations from works of an inexact and even fanciful description but here he added is another othellos occupations gone yes dear somerset it is gone i am no more a dynamiter and how i ask you after having tasted of these joys am i to condescend to a less glorious life  i cannot describe how you relieve me returned somerset sitting down on one of several boxes that had been drawn out into the middle of the floor i had conceived a sort of maudlin toleration for your character i have a great distaste besides for anything in the nature of a duty and upon both grounds your news delights me but i seem to perceive he added a certain sound of ticking in this box  yes replied zero with the same slow weariness of manner i have set several of them going  my god cried somerset bounding to his feet machines  machines returned the plotter bitterly machines indeed i blush to be their author alas he said burying his face in his hands that i should live to say it  madman cried somerset shaking him by the arm what am i to understand have you indeed set these diabolical contrivances in motion and do we stay here to be blown up  hoist with his own petard returned the plotter musingly one more quotation strange but indeed my brain is struck with numbness yes dear boy i have as you say put my contrivances in motion the one on which you are sitting i have timed for half an hour yon other  half an hour echoed somerset dancing with trepidation merciful heavens in half an hour  dear fellow why so much excitement inquired zero my dynamite is not more dangerous than toffy had i an only child i would give it him to play with you see this brick he continued lifting a cake of the infernal compound from the laboratorytable at a touch it should explode and that with such unconquerable energy as should bestrew the square with ruins well now behold i dash it on the floor  somerset sprang forward and with the strength of the very ecstasy of terror wrested the brick from his possession heavens he cried wiping his brow and then with more care than ever mother handled her firstborn withal gingerly transported the explosive to the far end of the apartment the plotter his arms once more fallen to his side dispiritedly watching him  it was entirely harmless he sighed they describe it as burning like tobacco  in the name of fortune cried somerset what have i done to you or what have you done to yourself that you should persist in this insane behaviour if not for your own sake then for mine let us depart from this doomed house where i profess i have not the heart to leave you and then if you will take my advice and if your determination be sincere you will instantly quit this city where no further occupation can detain you  such dear fellow was my own design replied the plotter i have as you observe no further business here and once i have packed a little bag i shall ask you to share a frugal meal to go with me as far as to the station and see the last of a brokenhearted man and yet he added looking on the boxes with a lingering regret i should have liked to make quite certain i cannot but suspect my underlings of some mismanagement it may be fond but yet i cherish that idea it may be the weakness of a man of science but yet he cried rising into some energy i will never i cannot if i try believe that my poor dynamite has had fair usage  five minutes said somerset glancing with horror at the timepiece if you do not instantly buckle to your bag i leave you  a few necessaries returned zero only a few necessaries dear somerset and you behold me ready  he passed into the bedroom and after an interval which seemed to draw out into eternity for his unfortunate companion he returned bearing in his hand an open gladstone bag his movements were still horribly deliberate and his eyes lingered gloatingly on his dear boxes as he moved to and fro about the drawingroom gathering a few small trifles last of all he lifted one of the squares of dynamite  put that down cried somerset if what you say be true you have no call to load yourself with that ungodly contraband  merely a curiosity dear boy he said persuasively and slipped the brick into his bag merely a memento of the pastah happy past bright past you will not take a touch of spirits no i find you very abstemious well he added if you have really no curiosity to await the event  i cried somerset my blood boils to get away  well then said zero i am ready i would i could say willing but thus to leave the scene of my sublime endeavours  without further parley somerset seized him by the arm and dragged him downstairs the halldoor shut with a clang on the deserted mansion and still towing his laggardly companion the young man sped across the square in the oxford street direction they had not yet passed the corner of the garden when they were arrested by a dull thud of an extraordinary amplitude of sound accompanied and followed by a shattering fracas somerset turned in time to see the mansion rend in twain vomit forth flames and smoke and instantly collapse into its cellars at the same moment he was thrown violently to the ground his first glance was towards zero the plotter had but reeled against the garden rail he stood there the gladstone bag clasped tight upon his heart his whole face radiant with relief and gratitude and the young man heard him murmur to himself nunc dimittis nunc dimittis  the consternation of the populace was indescribable the whole of golden square was alive with men women and children running wildly to and fro and like rabbits in a warren dashing in and out of the house doors and under favour of this confusion somerset dragged away the lingering plotter  it was grand he continued to murmur it was indescribably grand ah green erin green erin what a day of glory and oh my calumniated dynamite how triumphantly hast thou prevailed  suddenly a shade crossed his face and pausing in the middle of the footway he consulted the dial of his watch  good god he cried how mortifying seven minutes too early the dynamite surpassed my hopes but the clockwork fickle clockwork has once more betrayed me alas can there be no success unmixed with failure and must even this redletter day be chequered by a shadow  incomparable ass said somerset what have you done blown up the house of an unoffending old lady and the whole earthly property of the only person who is fool enough to befriend you  you do not understand these matters replied zero with an air of great dignity this will shake england to the heart gladstone the truculent old man will quail before the pointing finger of revenge and now that my dynamite is proved effective  heavens you remind me ejaculated somerset that brick in your bag must be instantly disposed of but how if we could throw it in the river  a torpedo cried zero brightening a torpedo in the thames superb dear fellow i recognise in you the marks of an accomplished anarch  true returned somerset it cannot so be done and there is no help but you must carry it away with you come on then and let me at once consign you to a train  nay nay dear boy protested zero there is now no call for me to leave my character is now reinstated my fame brightens this is the best thing i have done yet and i see from here the ovations that await the author of the golden square atrocity  my young friend returned the other i give you your choice i will either see you safe on board a train or safe in gaol  somerset this is unlike you said the chemist you surprise me somerset  i shall considerably more surprise you at the next police office returned somerset with something bordering on rage for on one point my mind is settled either i see you packed off to america brick and all or else you dine in prison  you have perhaps neglected one point returned the unoffended zero for speaking as a philosopher i fail to see what means you can employ to force me the will my dear fellow  now see here interrupted somerset you are ignorant of anything but science which i can never regard as being truly knowledge i sir have studied life and allow me to inform you that i have but to raise my hand and voicehere in this streetand the mob  good god in heaven somerset cried zero turning deadly white and stopping in his walk great god in heaven what words are these oh not in jest not even in jest should they be used the brutal mob the savage passions somerset for gods sake a publichouse  somerset considered him with freshly awakened curiosity this is very interesting said he you recoil from such a death  who would not asked the plotter  and to be blown up by dynamite inquired the young man doubtless strikes you as a form of euthanasia  pardon me returned zero i own and since i have braved it daily in my professional career i own it even with pride it is a death unusually distasteful to the mind of man  one more question said somerset you object to lynch law why  it is assassination said the plotter calmly but with eyebrows a little lifted as in wonder at the question  shake hands with me cried somerset thank god i have now no illfeeling left and though you cannot conceive how i burn to see you on the gallows i can quite contentedly assist at your departure  i do not very clearly take your meaning said zero but i am sure you mean kindly as to my departure there is another point to be considered i have neglected to supply myself with funds my little all has perished in what history will love to relate under the name of the golden square atrocity and without what is coarsely if vigorously called stamps you must be well aware it is impossible for me to pass the ocean  for me said somerset you have now ceased to be a man you have no more claim upon me than a doorscraper but the touching confusion of your mind disarms me from extremities until today i always thought stupidity was funny i now know otherwise and when i look upon your idiot face laughter rises within me like a deadly sickness and the tears spring up into my eyes as bitter as blood what should this portend i begin to doubt i am losing faith in scepticism is it possible he cried in a kind of horror of himselfis it conceivable that i believe in right and wrong already i have found myself with incredulous surprise to be the victim of a prejudice of personal honour and must this change proceed have you robbed me of my youth must i fall at my time of life into the common banker but why should i address that head of wood let this suffice i dare not let you stay among women and children i lack the courage to denounce you if by any means i may avoid it you have no money well then take mine and go and if ever i behold your face after today that day will be your last  under the circumstances replied zero i scarce see my way to refuse your offer your expressions may pain they cannot surprise me i am aware our point of view requires a little training a little moral hygiene if i may so express it and one of the points that has always charmed me in your character is this delightful frankness as for the small advance it shall be remitted you from philadelphia  it shall not said somerset  dear fellow you do not understand returned the plotter i shall now be received with fresh confidence by my superiors and my experiments will be no longer hampered by pitiful conditions of the purse  what i am now about sir is a crime replied somerset and were you to roll in wealth like vanderbilt i should scorn to be reimbursed of money i had so scandalously misapplied take it and keep it by george sir three days of you have transformed me to an ancient roman  with these words somerset hailed a passing hansom and the pair were driven rapidly to the railway terminus there an oath having been extracted the money changed hands  and now said somerset i have bought back my honour with every penny i possess and i thank god though there is nothing before me but starvation i am free from all entanglement with mr zero pumpernickel jones  to starve cried zero dear fellow i cannot endure the thought  take your ticket returned somerset  i think you display temper said zero  take your ticket reiterated the young man  well said the plotter as he returned ticket in hand your attitude is so strange and painful that i scarce know if i should ask you to shake hands  as a man no replied somerset but i have no objection to shake hands with you as i might with a pumpwell that ran poison or hellfire  this is a very cold parting sighed the dynamiter and still followed by somerset he began to descend the platform this was now bustling with passengers the train for liverpool was just about to start another had but recently arrived and the double tide made movement difficult as the pair reached the neighbourhood of the bookstall however they came into an open space and here the attention of the plotter was attracted by a standard broadside bearing the words second edition explosion in golden square his eye lighted groping in his pocket for the necessary coin he sprang forwardhis bag knocked sharply on the corner of the stalland instantly with a formidable report the dynamite exploded when the smoke cleared away the stall was seen much shattered and the stallkeeper running forth in terror from the ruins but of the irish patriot or the gladstone bag no adequate remains were to be found  in the first scramble of the alarm somerset made good his escape and came out upon the euston road his head spinning his body sick with hunger and his pockets destitute of coin yet as he continued to walk the pavements he wondered to find in his heart a sort of peaceful exultation a great content a sense as it were of divine presence and the kindliness of fate and he was able to tell himself that even if the worst befell he could now starve with a certain comfort since zero was expunged  late in the afternoon he found himself at the door of mr godalls shop and being quite unmanned by his long fast and scarce considering what he did he opened the glass door and entered  ha said mr godall mr somerset well have you met with an adventure have you the promised story sit down if you please suffer me to choose you a cigar of my own special brand and reward me with a narrative in your best style  i must not take a cigar said somerset  indeed said mr godall but now i come to look at you more closely i perceive that you are changed my poor boy i hope there is nothing wrong  somerset burst into tears     epilogue of the cigar divan   on a certain day of lashing rain in the december of last year and between the hours of nine and ten in the morning mr edward challoner pioneered himself under an umbrella to the door of the cigar divan in rupert street it was a place he had visited but once before the memory of what had followed on that visit and the fear of somerset having prevented his return even now he looked in before he entered but the shop was free of customers  the young man behind the counter was so intently writing in a penny versionbook that he paid no heed to challoners arrival on a second glance it seemed to the latter that he recognised him  by jove he thought unquestionably somerset  and though this was the very man he had been so sedulously careful to avoid his unexplained position at the receipt of custom changed distaste to curiosity  or opulent rotunda strike the sky said the shopman to himself in the tone of one considering a verse i suppose it would be too much to say orotunda and yet how noble it were or opulent orotunda strike the sky but that is the bitterness of arts you see a good effect and some nonsense about sense continually intervenes  somerset my dear fellow said challoner is this a masquerade  what challoner cried the shopman i am delighted to see you one moment till i finish the octave of my sonnet only the octave and with a friendly waggle of the hand he once more buried himself in the commerce of the muses i say he said presently looking up you seem in wonderful preservation how about the hundred pounds  i have made a small inheritance from a great aunt in wales replied challoner modestly  ah said somerset i very much doubt the legitimacy of inheritance the state in my view should collar it i am now going through a stage of socialism and poetry he added apologetically as one who spoke of a course of medicinal waters  and are you really the person of theestablishment inquired challoner deftly evading the word shop  a vendor sir a vendor returned the other pocketing his poesy i help old happy and glorious can i offer you a weed  well i scarcely like  began challoner  nonsense my dear fellow cried the shopman we are very proud of the business and the old man let me inform you besides being the most egregious of created beings from the point of view of ethics is literally sprung from the loins of kings de godall je suis le fervent there is only one godallby the way he added as challoner lit his cigar how did you get on with the detective trade  i did not try said challoner curtly  ah well i did returned somerset and made the most incomparable mess of it lost all my money and fairly covered myself with odium and ridicule there is more in that business challoner than meets the eye there is more in fact in all businesses you must believe in them or get up the belief that you believe hence he added the recognised inferiority of the plumber for no one could believe in plumbing  a propos asked challoner do you still paint  not now replied paul but i think of taking up the violin  challoners eye which had been somewhat restless since the trade of the detective had been named now rested for a moment on the columns of the morning paper where it lay spread upon the counter  by jove he cried thats odd  what is odd asked paul  oh nothing returned the other only i once met a person called mguire  so did i cried somerset is there anything about him  challoner read as follows mysterious death in stepney an inquest was held yesterday on the body of patrick mguire described as a carpenter dr dovering stated that he had for some time treated the deceased as a dispensary patient for sleeplessness loss of appetite and nervous depression there was no cause of death to be found he would say the deceased had sunk deceased was not a temperate man which doubtless accelerated death deceased complained of dumb ague but witness had never been able to detect any positive disease he did not know that he had any family he regarded him as a person of unsound intellect who believed himself a member and the victim of some secret society if he were to hazard an opinion he would say deceased had died of fear  and the doctor would be right cried somerset and my dear challoner i am so relieved to hear of his demise that i will well after all he added poor devil he was well served  the door at this moment opened and desborough appeared upon the threshold he was wrapped in a long waterproof imperfectly supplied with buttons his boots were full of water his hat greasy with service and yet he wore the air of one exceeding well content with life he was hailed by the two others with exclamations of surprise and welcome  and did you try the detective business inquired paul  no returned harry oh yes by the way i did though twice and got caught out both times but i thought i should find mymy wife here he added with a kind of proud confusion  what are you married cried somerset  oh yes said harry quite a long time a month at least  money asked challoner  thats the worst of it desborough admitted we are deadly hard up but the primr godall is going to do something for us that is what brings us here  who was mrs desborough said challoner in the tone of a man of society  she was a miss luxmore returned harry you fellows will be sure to like her for she is much cleverer than i she tells wonderful stories too better than a book  and just then the door opened and mrs desborough entered somerset cried out aloud to recognise the young lady of the superfluous mansion and challoner fell back a step and dropped his cigar as he beheld the sorceress of chelsea  what cried harry do you both know my wife  i believe i have seen her said somerset a little wildly  i think i have met the gentleman said mrs desborough sweetly but i cannot imagine where it was  oh no cried somerset fervently i have no notioni cannot conceivewhere it could have been indeed he continued growing in emphasis i think it highly probable that its a mistake  and you challoner asked harry you seemed to recognise her too  these are both friends of yours harry said the lady delighted i am sure i do not remember to have met mr challoner  challoner was very red in the face perhaps from having groped after his cigar i do not remember to have had the pleasure he responded huskily  well and mr godall asked mrs desborough  are you the lady that has an appointment with old  began somerset and paused blushing because if so he resumed i was to announce you at once  and the shopman raised a curtain opened a door and passed into a small pavilion which had been added to the back of the house on the roof the rain resounded musically the walls were lined with maps and prints and a few works of reference upon a table was a largescale map of egypt and the soudan and another of tonkin on which by the aid of coloured pins the progress of the different wars was being followed day by day a light refreshing odour of the most delicate tobacco hung upon the air and a fire not of foul coal but of clearflaming resinous billets chattered upon silver dogs in this elegant and plain apartment mr godall sat in a morning muse placidly gazing at the fire and hearkening to the rain upon the roof  ha my dear mr somerset said he and have you since last night adopted any fresh political principle  the lady sir said somerset with another blush  you have seen her i believe returned mr godall and on somersets replying in the affirmative you will excuse me my dear sir he resumed if i offer you a hint i think it not improbable this lady may desire entirely to forget the past from one gentleman to another no more words are necessary  a moment after he had received mrs desborough with that grave and touching urbanity that so well became him  i am pleased madam to welcome you to my poor house he said and shall be still more so if what were else a barren courtesy and a pleasure personal to myself shall prove to be of serious benefit to you and mr desborough  your highness replied clara i must begin with thanks it is like what i have heard of you that you should thus take up the case of the unfortunate and as for my harry he is worthy of all that you can do she paused  but for yourself suggested mr godallit was thus you were about to continue i believe  you take the words out of my mouth she said for myself it is different  i am not here to be a judge of men replied the prince still less of women i am now a private person like yourself and many million others but i am one who still fights upon the side of quiet now madam you know better than i and god better than you what you have done to mankind in the past i pause not to inquire it is with the future i concern myself it is for the future i demand security i would not willingly put arms into the hands of a disloyal combatant and i dare not restore to wealth one of the levyers of a private and a barbarous war i speak with some severity and yet i pick my terms i tell myself continually that you are a woman and a voice continually reminds me of the children whose lives and limbs you have endangered a woman he repeated solemnlyand children possibly madam when you are yourself a mother you will feel the bite of that antithesis possibly when you kneel at night beside a cradle a fear will fall upon you heavier than any shame and when your child lies in the pain and danger of disease you shall hesitate to kneel before your maker  you look at the fault she said and not at the excuse has your own heart never leaped within you at some story of oppression but alas no for you were born upon a throne  i was born of woman said the prince i came forth from my mothers agony helpless as a wren like other nurselings this which you forgot i have still faithfully remembered is it not one of your english poets that looked abroad upon the earth and saw vast circumvallations innumerable troops manoeuvring warships at sea and a great dust of battles on shore and casting anxiously about for what should be the cause of so many and painful preparations spied at last in the centre of all a mother and her babe these madam are my politics and the verses which are by mr coventry patmore i have caused to be translated into the bohemian tongue yes these are my politics to change what we can to better what we can but still to bear in mind that man is but a devil weakly fettered by some generous beliefs and impositions and for no word however nobly sounding and no cause however just and pious to relax the stricture of these bonds  there was a silence of a moment  i fear madam resumed the prince that i but weary you my views are formal like myself and like myself they also begin to grow old but i must still trouble you for some reply  i can say but one thing said mrs desborough i love my husband  it is a good answer returned the prince and you name a good influence but one that need not be conterminous with life  i will not play at pride with such a man as you she answered what do you ask of me not protestations i am sure what shall i say i have done much that i cannot defend and that i would not do again can i say more yes i can say this i never abused myself with the muddleheaded fairy tales of politics i was at least prepared to meet reprisals while i was levying war myselfor levying murder if you choose the plainer termi never accused my adversaries of assassination i never felt or feigned a righteous horror when a price was put upon my life by those whom i attacked i never called the policeman a hireling i may have been a criminal in short but i never was a fool  enough madam returned the prince more than enough your words are most reviving to my spirits for in this age when even the assassin is a sentimentalist there is no virtue greater in my eyes than intellectual clarity suffer me then to ask you to retire for by the signal of that bell i perceive my old friend your mother to be close at hand with her i promise you to do my utmost  and as mrs desborough returned to the divan the prince opening a door upon the other side admitted mrs luxmore  madam and my very good friend said he is my face so much changed that you no longer recognise prince florizel in mr godall  to be sure she cried looking at him through her glasses i have always regarded your highness as a perfect man and in your altered circumstances of which i have already heard with deep regret i will beg you to consider my respect increased instead of lessened  i have found it so returned the prince with every class of my acquaintance but madam i pray you to be seated my business is of a delicate order and regards your daughter  in that case said mrs luxmore you may save yourself the trouble of speaking for i have fully made up my mind to have nothing to do with her i will not hear one word in her defence but as i value nothing so particularly as the virtue of justice i think it my duty to explain to you the grounds of my complaint she deserted me her natural protector for years she has consorted with the most disreputable persons and to fill the cup of her offence she has recently married i refuse to see her or the being to whom she has linked herself one hundred and twenty pounds a year i have always offered her i offer it again it is what i had myself when i was her age  very well madam said the prince and be that so but to touch upon another matter what was the income of the reverend bernard fanshawe  my father asked the spirited old lady i believe he had seven hundred pounds in the year   you were one i think of several pursued the prince  of four was the reply we were four daughters and painful as the admission is to make a more detestable family could scarce be found in england  dear me said the prince and you madam have an income of eight thousand  not more than five returned the old lady but where on earth are you conducting me  to an allowance of one thousand pounds a year replied florizel smiling for i must not suffer you to take your father for a rule he was poor you are rich he had many calls upon his poverty there are none upon your wealth and indeed madam if you will let me touch this matter with a needle there is but one point in common to your two positions that each had a daughter more remarkable for liveliness than duty  i have been entrapped into this house said the old lady getting to her feet but it shall not avail not all the tobacconists in europe  ah madam interrupted florizel before what is referred to as my fall you had not used such language and since you so much object to the simple industry by which i live let me give you a friendly hint if you will not consent to support your daughter i shall be constrained to place that lady behind my counter where i doubt not she would prove a great attraction and your soninlaw shall have a livery and run the errands with such young blood my business might be doubled and i might be bound in common gratitude to place the name of luxmore beside that of godall  your highness said the old lady i have been very rude and you are very cunning i suppose the minx is on the premises produce her  let us rather observe them unperceived said the prince and so saying he rose and quietly drew back the curtain  mrs desborough sat with her back to them on a chair somerset and harry were hanging on her words with extraordinary interest challoner alleging some affair had long ago withdrawn from the detested neighbourhood of the enchantress  at that moment mrs desborough was saying mr gladstone detected the features of his cowardly assailant a cry rose to his lips a cry of mingled triumph  that is mr somerset interrupted the spirited old lady in the highest note of her register mr somerset what have you done with my houseproperty  madam said the prince let it be mine to give the explanation and in the meanwhile welcome your daughter  well clara how do you do said mrs luxmore it appears i am to give you an allowance so much the better for you as for mr somerset i am very ready to have an explanation for the whole affair though costly was eminently humorous and at any rate she added nodding to paul he is a young gentleman for whom i have a great affection and his pictures were the funniest i ever saw  i have ordered a collation said the prince mr somerset as these are all your friends i propose if you please that you should join them at table i will take the shop     strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde     to   katharine de mattos    its ill to loose the bands that god decreed to bind   still will we be the children of the heather and the wind   far away from home o its still for you and me   that the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie     strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde  story of the door   mr utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile cold scanty and embarrassed in discourse backward in sentiment lean long dusty dreary and yet somehow lovable at friendly meetings and when the wine was to his taste something eminently human beaconed from his eye something indeed which never found its way into his talk but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the afterdinner face but more often and loudly in the acts of his life he was austere with himself drank gin when he was alone to mortify a taste for vintages and though he enjoyed the theatre had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years but he had an approved tolerance for others sometimes wondering almost with envy at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove i incline to cains heresy he used to say quaintly i let my brother go to the devil in his own way in this character it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men and to such as these so long as they came about his chambers he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour  no doubt the feat was easy to mr utterson for he was undemonstrative at the best and even his friendships seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of goodnature it is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle readymade from the hands of opportunity and that was the lawyers way his friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest his affections like ivy were the growth of time they implied no aptness in the object hence no doubt the bond that united him to mr richard enfield his distant kinsman the wellknown man about town it was a nut to crack for many what these two could see in each other or what subject they could find in common it was reported by those who encountered them in their sunday walks that they said nothing looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend for all that the two men put the greatest store by these excursions counted them the chief jewel of each week and not only set aside occasions of pleasure but even resisted the calls of business that they might enjoy them uninterrupted  it chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a bystreet in a busy quarter of london the street was small and what is called quiet but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays the inhabitants were all doing well it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still and laying out the surplus of their gains in coquetry so that the shopfronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation like rows of smiling saleswomen even on sunday when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood like a fire in a forest and with its freshly painted shutters wellpolished brasses and general cleanliness and gaiety of note instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger  two doors from one corner on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street it was two stories high showed no window nothing but a door on the lower story and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper and bore in every feature the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence the door which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker was blistered and distained tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels children kept shop upon the steps the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings and for close on a generation no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages  mr enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the bystreet but when they came abreast of the entry the former lifted up his cane and pointed  did you ever remark that door he asked and when his companion had replied in the affirmative it is connected in my mind added he with a very odd story  indeed said mr utterson with a slight change of voice and what was that  well it was this way returned mr enfield i was coming home from some place at the end of the world about three oclock of a black winter morning and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps street after street and all the folks asleepstreet after street all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a churchtill at last i got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman all at once i saw two figures one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street well sir the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner and then came the horrible part of the thing for the man trampled calmly over the childs body and left her screaming on the ground it sounds nothing to hear but it was hellish to see it wasnt like a man it was like some damned juggernaut i gave a viewholloa took to my heels collared my gentleman and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child he was perfectly cool and made no resistance but gave me one look so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running the people who had turned out were the girls own family and pretty soon the doctor for whom she had been sent put in his appearance well the child was not much the worse more frightened according to the sawbones and there you might have supposed would be an end to it but there was one curious circumstance i had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight so had the childs family which was only natural but the doctors case was what struck me he was the usual cutanddry apothecary of no particular age and colour with a strong edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe well sir he was like the rest of us every time he looked at my prisoner i saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him i knew what was in his mind just as he knew what was in mine and killing being out of the question we did the next best we told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of london to the other if he had any friends or any credit we undertook that he should lose them and all the time as we were pitching it in redhot we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies i never saw a circle of such hateful faces and there was the man in the middle with a kind of black sneering coolnessfrightened too i could see thatbut carrying it off sir really like satan if you choose to make capital out of this accident said he i am naturally helpless no gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene says he name your figure well we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the childs family he would have clearly liked to stick out but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief and at last he struck the next thing was to get the money and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the doorwhipped out a key went in and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on couttss drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that i cant mention though its one of the points of my story but it was a name at least very well known and often printed the figure was stiff but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine i took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal and that a man does not in real life walk into a cellardoor at four in the morning and come out of it with another mans cheque for close upon a hundred pounds but he was quite easy and sneering set your mind at rest says he i will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself so we all set off the doctor and the childs father and our friend and myself and passed the rest of the night in my chambers and next day when we had breakfasted went in a body to the bank i gave in the cheque myself and said i had every reason to believe it was a forgery not a bit of it the cheque was genuine  tuttut said mr utterson  i see you feel as i do said mr enfield yes its a bad story for my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with a really damnable man and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties celebrated too and what makes it worse one of your fellows who do what they call good blackmail i suppose an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth black mail house is what i call that place with the door in consequence though even that you know is far from explaining all he added and with the words fell into a vein of musing  from this he was recalled by mr utterson asking rather suddenly and you dont know if the drawer of the cheque lives there  a likely place isnt it returned mr enfield but i happened to have noticed his address he lives in some square or other  and you never asked aboutthe place with the door said mr utterson   no sir i had a delicacy was the reply i feel very strongly about putting questions it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment you start a question and its like starting a stone you sit quietly on the top of a hill and away the stone goes starting others and presently some bland old bird the last you would have thought of is knocked on the head in his own backgarden and the family have to change their name no sir i make it a rule of mine the more it looks like queer street the less i ask  a very good rule too said the lawyer  but i have studied the place for myself continued mr enfield it seems scarcely a house there is no other door and nobody goes in or out of that one but once in a great while the gentleman of my adventure there are three windows looking on the court on the first floor none below the windows are always shut but theyre clean and then there is a chimney which is generally smoking so somebody must live there yet its not so sure for the buildings are so packed together about that court that its hard to say where one ends and another begins  the pair walked on again for a while in silence and then enfield said mr utterson thats a good rule of yours  yes i think it is returned enfield  but for all that continued the lawyer theres one point i want to ask i want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child  well said mr enfield i cant see what harm it would do he was a man of the name of hyde  hm said mr utterson what sort of a man is he to see  he is not easy to describe there is something wrong with his appearance something displeasing something downright detestable i never saw a man i so disliked and yet i scarce know why he must be deformed somewhere he gives a strong feeling of deformity although i couldnt specify the point hes an extraordinarylooking man and yet i really can name nothing out of the way no sir i can make no hand of it i cant describe him and its not want of memory for i declare i can see him this moment  mr utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration you are sure he used a key he inquired at last  my dear sir began enfield surprised out of himself  yes i know said utterson i know it must seem strange the fact is if i do not ask you the name of the other party it is because i know it already you see richard your tale has gone home if you have been inexact in any point you had better correct it  i think you might have warned me returned the other with a touch of sullenness but i have been pedantically exact as you call it the fellow had a key and whats more he has it still i saw him use it not a week ago  mr utterson sighed deeply but said never a word and the young man presently resumed here is another lesson to say nothing said he i am ashamed of my long tongue let us make a bargain never to refer to this again  with all my heart said the lawyer i shake hands on that richard     search for mr hyde   that evening mr utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish it was his custom of a sunday when this meal was over to sit close by the fire a volume of some dry divinity on his readingdesk until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed on this night however as soon as the cloth was taken away he took up a candle and went into his businessroom there he opened his safe took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as dr jekylls will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents the will was holograph for mr utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it it provided not only that in case of the decease of henry jekyll md dcl lld frs c all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his friend and benefactor edward hyde but that in case of dr jekylls disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months the said edward hyde should step into the said henry jekylls shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctors household this document had long been the lawyers eyesore it offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life to whom the fanciful was the immodest and hitherto it was his ignorance of mr hyde that had swelled his indignation now by a sudden turn it was his knowledge it was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more it was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes and out of the shifting insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye there leaped up the sudden definite presentment of a fiend  i thought it was madness he said as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe and now i begin to fear it is disgrace  with that he blew out his candle put on a greatcoat and set forth in the direction of cavendish square that citadel of medicine where his friend the great dr lanyon had his house and received his crowding patients if any one knows it will be lanyon he had thought  the solemn butler knew and welcomed him he was subjected to no stage of delay but ushered direct from the door to the diningroom where dr lanyon sat alone over his wine this was a hearty healthy dapper redfaced gentleman with a shock of hair prematurely white and a boisterous and decided manner at sight of mr utterson he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both hands the geniality as was the way of the man was somewhat theatrical to the eye but it reposed on genuine feeling for these two were old friends old mates both at school and college both thorough respecters of themselves and of each other and what does not always follow men who thoroughly enjoyed each others company  after a little rambling talk the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied his mind  i suppose lanyon said he you and i must be the two oldest friends that henry jekyll has  i wish the friends were younger chuckled dr lanyon but i suppose we are and what of that i see little of him now  indeed said utterson i thought you had a bond of common interest  we had was the reply but it is more than ten years since henry jekyll became too fanciful for me he began to go wrong wrong in mind and though of course i continue to take an interest in him for old sakes sake as they say i see and i have seen devilish little of the man such unscientific balderdash added the doctor flushing suddenly purple would have estranged damon and pythias  this little spirt of temper was somewhat of a relief to mr utterson they have only differed on some point of science he thought and being a man of no scientific passions except in the matter of conveyancing he even added it is nothing worse than that he gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure and then approached the question he had come to put did you ever come across a protégé of hisone hyde he asked  hyde repeated lanyon no never heard of him since my time  that was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great dark bed on which he tossed to and fro until the small hours of the morning began to grow large it was a night of little ease to his toiling mind toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions  six oclock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to mr uttersons dwelling and still he was digging at the problem hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone but now his imagination also was engaged or rather enslaved and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room mr enfields tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures he would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city then of the figure of a man walking swiftly then of a child running from the doctors and then these met and that human juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams or else he would see a room in a rich house where his friend lay asleep dreaming and smiling at his dreams and then the door of that room would be opened the curtains of the bed plucked apart the sleeper recalled and lo there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given and even at that dead hour he must rise and do its bidding the figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night and if at any time he dozed over it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly even to dizziness through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city and at every streetcorner crush a child and leave her screaming and still the figure had no face by which he might know it even in his dreams it had no face or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyers mind a singularly strong almost an inordinate curiosity to behold the features of the real mr hyde if he could but once set eyes on him he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined he might see a reason for his friends strange preference or bondage call it which you please and even for the startling clauses of the will and at least it would be a face worth seeing the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy a face which had but to show itself to raise up in the mind of the unimpressionable enfield a spirit of enduring hatred  from that time forward mr utterson began to haunt the door in the bystreet of shops in the morning before office hours at noon when business was plenty and time scarce at night under the face of the fogged city moon by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post  if he be mr hyde he had thought i shall be mr seek  and at last his patience was rewarded it was a fine dry night frost in the air the streets as clean as a ballroom floor the lamps unshaken by any wind drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow by ten oclock when the shops were closed the bystreet was very solitary and in spite of the low growl of london from all round very silent small sounds carried far domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time mr utterson had been some minutes at his post when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near in the course of his nightly patrols he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person while he is still a great way off suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested and it was with a strong superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court  the steps drew swiftly nearer and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street the lawyer looking forth from the entry could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with he was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him even at that distance went somehow strongly against the watchers inclination but he made straight for the door crossing the roadway to save time and as he came he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home  mr utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed mr hyde i think  mr hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath but his fear was only momentary and though he did not look the lawyer in the face he answered coolly enough that is my name what do you want  i see you are going in returned the lawyer i am an old friend of dr jekyllsmr utterson of gaunt streetyou must have heard my name and meeting you so conveniently i thought you might admit me  you will not find dr jekyll he is from home replied mr hyde blowing in the key and then suddenly but still without looking up how did you know me he asked  on your side said mr utterson will you do me a favour  with pleasure replied the other what shall it be  will you let me see your face asked the lawyer  mr hyde appeared to hesitate and then as if upon some sudden reflection fronted about with an air of defiance and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds now i shall know you again said mr utterson it may be useful  yes returned mr hyde it is as well we have met and à propos you should have my address and he gave a number of a street in soho  good god thought mr utterson can he too have been thinking of the will but he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address  and now said the other how did you know me  by description was the reply  whose description  we have common friends said mr utterson  common friends echoed mr hyde a little hoarsely who are they  jekyll for instance said the lawyer  he never told you cried mr hyde with a flush of anger i did not think you would have lied  come said mr utterson that is not fitting language  the other snarled aloud into a savage laugh and the next moment with extraordinary quickness he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house  the lawyer stood awhile when mr hyde had left him the picture of disquietude then he began slowly to mount the street pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity the problem he was thus debating as he walked was one of a class that is rarely solved mr hyde was pale and dwarfish he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation he had a displeasing smile he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness and he spoke with a husky whispering and somewhat broken voice all these were points against him but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust loathing and fear with which mr utterson regarded him there must be something else said the perplexed gentleman there is something more if i could find a name for it god bless me the man seems hardly human something troglodytic shall we say or can it be the old story of dr fell or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through and transfigures its clay continent the last i think for o my poor old harry jekyll if ever i read satans signature upon a face it is on that of your new friend  round the corner from the bystreet there was a square of ancient handsome houses now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men mapengravers architects shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises one house however second from the corner was still occupied entire and at the door of this which wore a great air of wealth and comfort though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight mr utterson stopped and knocked a welldressed elderly servant opened the door  is dr jekyll at home poole asked the lawyer  i will see mr utterson said poole admitting the visitor as he spoke into a large lowroofed comfortable hall paved with flags warmed after the fashion of a country house by a bright open fire and furnished with costly cabinets of oak will you wait here by the fire sir or shall i give you a light in the diningroom  here thank you said the lawyer and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender this hall in which he was now left alone was a pet fancy of his friend the doctors and utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in london but tonight there was a shudder in his blood the face of hyde sat heavy on his memory he felt what was rare with him a nausea and distaste of life and in the gloom of his spirits he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof he was ashamed of his relief when poole presently returned to announce that dr jekyll was gone out  i saw mr hyde go in by the old dissectingroom door poole he said is that right when dr jekyll is from home  quite right mr utterson sir replied the servant mr hyde has a key  your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man poole resumed the other musingly  yes sir he do indeed said poole we have all orders to obey him  i do not think i ever met mr hyde asked utterson  o dear no sir he never dines here replied the butler indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory  well goodnight poole  goodnight mr utterson  and the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart poor harry jekyll he thought my mind misgives me he is in deep waters he was wild when he was young a long while ago to be sure but in the law of god there is no statute of limitations ay it must be that the ghost of some old sin the cancer of some concealed disgrace punishment coming pede claudo years after memory has forgotten and selflove condoned the fault and the lawyer scared by the thought brooded awhile on his own past groping in all the corners of memory lest by chance some jackinthebox of an old iniquity should leap to light there his past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing yet avoided and then by a return on his former subject he conceived a spark of hope this master hyde if he were studied thought he must have secrets of his own black secrets by the look of him secrets compared to which poor jekylls worst would be like sunshine things cannot continue as they are it turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to harrys bedside poor harry what a wakening and the danger of it for if this hyde suspects the existence of the will he may grow impatient to inherit ay i must put my shoulder to the wheelif jekyll will but let me he added if jekyll will only let me for once more he saw before his minds eye as clear as a transparency the strange clauses of the will     dr jekyll was quite at ease   a fortnight later by excellent good fortune the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies all intelligent reputable men and all judges of good wine and mr utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed this was no new arrangement but a thing that had befallen many scores of times where utterson was liked he was liked well hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer when the lighthearted and the loosetongued had already their foot on the threshold they liked to sit awhile in his unobtrusive company practising for solitude sobering their minds in the mans rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety to this rule dr jekyll was no exception and as he now sat on the opposite side of the firea large wellmade smoothfaced man of fifty with something of a slyish cast perhaps but every mark of capacity and kindnessyou could see by his looks that he cherished for mr utterson a sincere and warm affection  i have been wanting to speak to you jekyll began the latter you know that will of yours  a close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful but the doctor carried it off gaily my poor utterson said he you are unfortunate in such a client i never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will unless it were that hidebound pedant lanyon at what he called my scientific heresies oh i know hes a good fellowyou neednt frownan excellent fellow and i always mean to see more of him but a hidebound pedant for all that an ignorant blatant pedant i was never more disappointed in any man than lanyon  you know i never approved of it pursued utterson ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic  my will yes certainly i know that said the doctor a trifle sharply you have told me so  well i tell you so again continued the lawyer i have been learning something of young hyde  the large handsome face of dr jekyll grew pale to the very lips and there came a blackness about his eyes i do not care to hear more said he this is a matter i thought we had agreed to drop  what i heard was abominable said utterson  it can make no change you do not understand my position returned the doctor with a certain incoherency of manner i am painfully situated utterson my position is a very strangea very strange one it is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking  jekyll said utterson you know me i am a man to be trusted make a clean breast of this in confidence and i make no doubt i can get you out of it  my good utterson said the doctor this is very good of you this is downright good of you and i cannot find words to thank you in i believe you fully i would trust you before any man aliveay before myself if i could make the choice but indeed it isnt what you fancy it is not so bad as that and just to put your good heart at rest i will tell you one thing the moment i choose i can be rid of mr hyde i give you my hand upon that and i thank you again and again and i will just add one little word utterson that im sure youll take in good part this is a private matter and i beg of you to let it sleep  utterson reflected a little looking in the fire  i have no doubt you are perfectly right he said at last getting to his feet  well but since we have touched upon this business and for the last time i hope continued the doctor there is one point i should like you to understand i have really a very great interest in poor hyde i know you have seen him he told me so and i fear he was rude but i do sincerely take a great a very great interest in that young man and if i am taken away utterson i wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him i think you would if you knew all and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise  i cant pretend that i shall ever like him said the lawyer  i dont ask that pleaded jekyll laying his hand upon the others arm i only ask for justice i only ask you to help him for my sake when i am no longer here  utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh well said he i promise     the carew murder case   nearly a year later in the month of october 18 london was startled by a crime of singular ferocity rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim the details were few and startling a maidservant living alone in a house not far from the river had gone upstairs to bed about eleven although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours the early part of the night was cloudless and the lane which the maids window overlooked was brilliantly lit by the full moon it seems she was romantically given for she sat down upon her box which stood immediately under the window and fell into a dream of musing never she used to say with streaming tears when she narrated that experience never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world and as she so sat she became aware of an aged and beautiful gentleman with white hair drawing near along the lane and advancing to meet him another and very small gentleman to whom at first she paid less attention when they had come within speech which was just under the maids eyes the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness it did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance indeed from his pointing it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way but the moon shone on his face as he spoke and the girl was pleased to watch it it seemed to breathe such an innocent and oldworld kindness of disposition yet with something high too as of a wellfounded selfcontent presently her eye wandered to the other and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain mr hyde who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike he had in his hand a heavy cane with which he was trifling but he answered never a word and seemed to listen with an illcontained impatience and then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger stamping with his foot brandishing the cane and carrying on as the maid described it like a madman the old gentleman took a step back with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt and at that mr hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth and next moment with apelike fury he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway at the horror of these sights and sounds the maid fainted  it was two oclock when she came to herself and called for the police the murderer was gone long ago but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane incredibly mangled the stick with which the deed had been done although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutterthe other without doubt had been carried away by the murderer a purse and a gold watch were found upon the victim but no cards or papers except a sealed and stamped envelope which he had been probably carrying to the post and which bore the name and address of mr utterson  this was brought to the lawyer the next morning before he was out of bed and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances than he shot out a solemn lip i shall say nothing till i have seen the body said he this may be very serious have the kindness to wait while i dress and with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station whither the body had been carried as soon as he came into the cell he nodded  yes said he i recognise him i am sorry to say that this is sir danvers carew  good god sir exclaimed the officer is it possible and the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition this will make a deal of noise he said and perhaps you can help us to the man and he briefly narrated what the maid had seen and showed the broken stick  mr utterson had already quailed at the name of hyde but when the stick was laid before him he could doubt no longer broken and battered as it was he recognised it for one that he had himself presented many years before to henry jekyll  is this mr hyde a person of small stature he inquired  particularly small and particularly wickedlooking is what the maid calls him said the officer  mr utterson reflected and then raising his head if you will come with me in my cab he said i think i can take you to his house  it was by this time about nine in the morning and the first fog of the season a great chocolatecoloured pall lowered over heaven but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours so that as the cab crawled from street to street mr utterson beheld a marvellous number of degrees and hues of twilight for here it would be dark like the backend of evening and there would be a glow of a rich lurid brown like the light of some strange conflagration and here for a moment the fog would be quite broken up and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths the dismal quarter of soho seen under these changing glimpses with its muddy ways and slatternly passengers and its lamps which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness seemed in the lawyers eyes like a district of some city in a nightmare  the thoughts of his mind besides were of the gloomiest dye and when he glanced at the companion of his drive he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the laws officers which may at times assail the most honest  as the cab drew up before the address indicated the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street a ginpalace a low french eatinghouse a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads many ragged children huddled in the doorways and many women of many different nationalities passing out key in hand to have a morning glass and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part as brown as umber and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings this was the home of henry jekylls favourite of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling  an ivoryfaced and silveryhaired old woman opened the door she had an evil face smoothed by hypocrisy but her manners were excellent yes she said this was mr hydes but he was not at home he had been in that night very late but had gone away again in less than an hour there was nothing strange in that his habits were very irregular and he was often absent for instance it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday  very well then we wish to see his rooms said the lawyer and when the woman began to declare it was impossible i had better tell you who this person is he added this is inspector newcomen of scotland yard  a flash of odious joy appeared upon the womans face ah said she he is in trouble what has he done  mr utterson and the inspector exchanged glances he dont seem a very popular character observed the latter and now my good woman just let me and this gentleman have a look about us  in the whole extent of the house which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty mr hyde had only used a couple of rooms but these were furnished with luxury and good taste a closet was filled with wine the plate was of silver the napery elegant a good picture hung upon the walls a gift as utterson supposed from henry jekyll who was much of a connoisseur and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour at this moment however the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked clothes lay about the floor with their pockets inside out lockfast drawers stood open and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes as though many papers had been burned from these embers the inspector disinterred the buttend of a green chequebook which had resisted the action of the fire the other half of the stick was found behind the door and as this clinched his suspicions the officer declared himself delighted a visit to the bank where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderers credit completed his gratification  you may depend upon it sir he told mr utterson i have him in my hand he must have lost his head or he never would have left the stick or above all burned the chequebook why moneys life to the man we have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank and get out the handbills  this last however was not so easy of accomplishment for mr hyde had numbered few familiarseven the master of the servantmaid had only seen him twice his family could nowhere be traced he had never been photographed and the few who could describe him differed widely as common observers will only on one point were they agreed and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders     incident of the letter   it was late in the afternoon when mr utterson found his way to dr jekylls door where he was at once admitted by poole and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or the dissectingrooms the doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden it was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friends quarters and he eyed the dingy windowless structure with curiosity and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent the tables laden with chemical apparatus the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola at the farther end a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize and through this mr utterson was at last received into the doctors cabinet it was a large room fitted round with glass presses furnished among other things with a chevalglass and a businesstable and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron the fire burned in the grate a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly and there close up to the warmth sat dr jekyll looking deadly sick he did not rise to meet his visitor but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice  and now said mr utterson as soon as poole had left them you have heard the news  the doctor shuddered they were crying it in the square he said i heard them in my diningroom  one word said the lawyer carew was my client but so are you and i want to know what i am doing you have not been mad enough to hide this fellow  utterson i swear to god cried the doctor i swear to god i will never set eyes on him again i bind my honour to you that i am done with him in this world it is all at an end and indeed he does not want my help you do not know him as i do he is safe he is quite safe mark my words he will never more be heard of  the lawyer listened gloomily he did not like his friends feverish manner you seem pretty sure of him said he and for your sake i hope you may be right if it came to a trial your name might appear  i am quite sure of him replied jekyll i have grounds for certainty that i cannot share with any one but there is one thing on which you may advise me i havei have received a letter and i am at a loss whether i should show it to the police i should like to leave it in your hands utterson you would judge wisely i am sure i have so great a trust in you  you fear i suppose that it might lead to his detection asked the lawyer  no said the other i cannot say that i care what becomes of hyde i am quite done with him i was thinking of my own character which this hateful business has rather exposed  utterson ruminated awhile he was surprised at his friends selfishness and yet relieved by it well said he at last let me see the letter  the letter was written in an odd upright hand and signed edward hyde and it signified briefly enough that the writers benefactor dr jekyll whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities need labour under no alarm for his safety as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence the lawyer liked this letter well enough it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions  have you the envelope he asked  i burned it replied jekyll before i thought what i was about but it bore no postmark the note was handed in  shall i keep this and sleep upon it asked utterson  i wish you to judge for me entirely was the reply i have lost confidence in myself  well i shall consider returned the lawyerand now one word more it was hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance  the doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness he shut his mouth tight and nodded  i knew it said utterson he meant to murder you you have had a fine escape  i have had what is far more to the purpose returned the doctor solemnly i have had a lessono god utterson what a lesson i have had and he covered his face for a moment with his hands  on his way out the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with poole by the by said he there was a letter handed in today what was the messenger like but poole was positive nothing had come except by post and only circulars by that he added  this news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door possibly indeed it had been written in the cabinet and if that were so it must be differently judged and handled with the more caution the newsboys as he went were crying themselves hoarse along the footways special edition shocking murder of an mp that was the funeral oration of one friend and client and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal it was at least a ticklish decision that he had to make and selfreliant as he was by habit he began to cherish a longing for advice it was not to be had directly but perhaps he thought it might be fished for  presently after he sat on one side of his own hearth with mr guest his head clerk upon the other and midway between at a nicely calculated distance from the fire a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house the fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds the procession of the towns life was still rolling on through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind but the room was gay with firelight in the bottle the acids were long ago resolved the imperial dye had softened with time as the colour grows richer in stained windows and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of london insensibly the lawyer melted there was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than mr guest and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant guest had often been on business to the doctors he knew poole he could scarce have failed to hear of mr hydes familiarity about the house he might draw conclusions was it not as well then that he should see a letter which put that mystery to rights and above all since guest being a great student and critic of handwriting would consider the step natural and obliging the clerk besides was a man of counsel he would scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark and by that remark mr utterson might shape his future course  this is a sad business about sir danvers he said  yes sir indeed it has elicited a great deal of public feeling returned guest the man of course was mad  i should like to hear your views on that replied utterson i have a document here in his handwriting it is between ourselves for i scarce know what to do about it it is an ugly business at the best but there it is quite in your way a murderers autograph  guests eyes brightened and he sat down at once and studied it with passion no sir he said not mad but it is an odd hand  and by all accounts a very odd writer added the lawyer  just then the servant entered with a note  is that from dr jekyll sir inquired the clerk i thought i knew the writing anything private mr utterson  only an invitation to dinner why do you want to see it  one moment i thank you sir and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents thank you sir he said at last returning both its a very interesting autograph  there was a pause during which mr utterson struggled with himself why did you compare them guest he inquired suddenly  well sir returned the clerk theres a rather singular resemblance the two hands are in many points identical only differently sloped  rather quaint said utterson  it is as you say rather quaint returned guest  i wouldnt speak of this note you know said the master  no sir said the clerk i understand  but no sooner was mr utterson alone that night than he locked the note into his safe where it reposed from that time forward what he thought henry jekyll forge for a murderer and his blood ran cold in his veins     remarkable incident of dr lanyon   time ran on thousands of pounds were offered in reward for the death of sir danvers was resented as a public injury but mr hyde had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed much of his past was unearthed indeed and all disreputable tales came out of the mans cruelty at once so callous and violent of his vile life of his strange associates of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career but of his present whereabouts not a whisper from the time he had left the house in soho on the morning of the murder he was simply blotted out and gradually as time drew on mr utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm and to grow more at quiet with himself the death of sir danvers was to his way of thinking more than paid for by the disappearance of mr hyde now that that evil influence had been withdrawn a new life began for dr jekyll he came out of his seclusion renewed relations with his friends became once more their familiar guest and entertainer and whilst he had always been known for charities he was now no less distinguished for religion he was busy he was much in the open air he did good his face seemed to open and brighten as if with an inward consciousness of service and for more than two months the doctor was at peace  on the 8th of january utterson had dined at the doctors with a small party lanyon had been there and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends on the 12th and again on the 14th the door was shut against the lawyer the doctor was confined to the house poole said and saw no one on the 15th he tried again and was again refused and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits the fifth night he had in guest to dine with him and the sixth he betook himself to dr lanyons  there at least he was not denied admittance but when he came in he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctors appearance he had his deathwarrant written legibly upon his face the rosy man had grown pale his flesh had fallen away he was visibly balder and older and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyers notice as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deepseated terror of the mind it was unlikely that the doctor should fear death and yet that was what utterson was tempted to suspect yes he thought he is a doctor he must know his own state and that his days are counted and the knowledge is more than he can bear and yet when utterson remarked on his illlooks it was with an air of great firmness that lanyon declared himself a doomed man  i have had a shock he said and i shall never recover it is a question of weeks well life has been pleasant i liked it yes sir i used to like it i sometimes think if we knew all we should be more glad to get away  jekyll is ill too observed utterson have you seen him  but lanyons face changed and he held up a trembling hand i wish to see or hear no more of dr jekyll he said in a loud unsteady voice i am quite done with that person and i beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom i regard as dead  tuttut said mr utterson and then after a considerable pause cant i do anything he inquired we are three very old friends lanyon we shall not live to make others  nothing can be done returned lanyon ask himself  he will not see me said the lawyer  i am not surprised at that was the reply some day utterson after i am dead you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this i cannot tell you and in the meantime if you can sit and talk with me of other things for gods sake stay and do so but if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic then in gods name go for i cannot bear it  as soon as he got home utterson sat down and wrote to jekyll complaining of his exclusion from the house and asking the cause of this unhappy break with lanyon and the next day brought him a long answer often very pathetically worded and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift the quarrel with lanyon was incurable i do not blame our old friend jekyll wrote but i share his view that we must never meet i mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion you must not be surprised nor must you doubt my friendship if my door is often shut even to you you must suffer me to go my own dark way i have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that i cannot name if i am the chief of sinners i am the chief of sufferers also i could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning and you can but do one thing utterson to lighten this destiny and that is to respect my silence utterson was amazed the dark influence of hyde had been withdrawn the doctor had returned to his old tasks and amities a week ago the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age and now in a moment friendship and peace of mind and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked so great and unprepared a change pointed to madness but in view of lanyons manner and words there must lie for it some deeper ground  a week afterwards dr lanyon took to his bed and in something less than a fortnight he was dead the night after the funeral at which he had been sadly affected utterson locked the door of his businessroom and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend private for the hands of g j utterson alone and in case of his predecease to be destroyed unread so it was emphatically superscribed and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents i have buried one friend today he thought what if this should cost me another and then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty and broke the seal within there was another enclosure likewise sealed and marked upon the cover as not to be opened till the death or disappearance of dr henry jekyll utterson could not trust his eyes yes it was disappearance here again as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of henry jekyll bracketed but in the will that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man hyde it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible written by the hand of lanyon what should it mean a great curiosity came on the trustee to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe  it is one thing to mortify curiosity another to conquer it and it may be doubted if from that day forth utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness he thought of him kindly but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful he went to call indeed but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance perhaps in his heart he preferred to speak with poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage and to sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse poole had indeed no very pleasant news to communicate the doctor it appeared now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory where he would sometimes even sleep he was out of spirits he had grown very silent he did not read it seemed as if he had something on his mind utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits     incident at the window   it chanced on sunday when mr utterson was on his usual walk with mr enfield that their way lay once again through the bystreet and that when they came in front of the door both stopped to gaze on it  well said enfield that storys at an end at least we shall never see more of mr hyde  i hope not said utterson did i ever tell you that i once saw him and shared your feeling of repulsion  it was impossible to do the one without the other returned enfield and by the way what an ass you must have thought me not to know that this was a back way to dr jekylls it was partly your own fault that i found it out even when i did  so you found it out did you said utterson but if that be so we may step into the court and take a look at the windows to tell you the truth i am uneasy about poor jekyll and even outside i feel as if the presence of a friend might do him good  the court was very cool and a little damp and full of premature twilight although the sky high up overhead was still bright with sunset the middle one of the three windows was halfway open and sitting close beside it taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien like some disconsolate prisoner utterson saw dr jekyll  what jekyll he cried i trust you are better  i am very low utterson replied the doctor drearily very low it will not last long thank god  you stay too much indoors said the lawyer you should be out whipping up the circulation like mr enfield and me this is my cousinmr enfielddr jekyll come now get your hat and take a quick turn with us  you are very good sighed the other i should like to very much but no no no it is quite impossible i dare not but indeed utterson i am very glad to see you this is really a great pleasure i would ask you and mr enfield up but the place is really not fit  why then said the lawyer goodnaturedly the best thing we can do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are  that is just what i was about to venture to propose returned the doctor with a smile but the words were hardly uttered before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair as froze the very blood of the two gentleman below they saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down but that glimpse had been sufficient and they turned and left the court without a word in silence too the bystreet and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare where even upon a sunday there were still some stirrings of life that mr utterson at last turned and looked at his companion they were both pale and there was an answering horror in their eyes  god forgive us god forgive us said mr utterson  but mr enfield only nodded his head very seriously and walked on once more in silence     the last night   mr utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner when he was surprised to receive a visit from poole  bless me poole what brings you here he cried and then taking a second look at him what ails you he added is the doctor ill  mr utterson said the man there is something wrong  take a seat and here is a glass of wine for you said the lawyer now take your time and tell me plainly what you want  you know the doctors ways sir replied poole and how he shuts himself up well hes shut up again in the cabinet and i dont like it siri wish i may die if i like it mr utterson sir im afraid  now my good man said the lawyer be explicit what are you afraid of  ive been afraid for about a week returned poole doggedly disregarding the question and i can bear it no more  the mans appearance amply bore out his words his manner was altered for the worse and except for the moment when he had first announced his terror he had not once looked the lawyer in the face even now he sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee and his eyes directed to a corner of the floor i can bear it no more he repeated  come said the lawyer i see you have some good reason poole i see there is something seriously amiss try to tell me what it is  i think theres been foul play said poole hoarsely  foul play cried the lawyer a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence what foul play what does the man mean  i darent say sir was the answer but will you come along with me and see for yourself  mr uttersons only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butlers face and perhaps with no less that the wine was still untasted when he set it down to follow  it was a wild cold seasonable night of march with a pale moon lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her and a flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture the wind made talking difficult and flecked the blood into the face it seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers besides for mr utterson thought he had never seen that part of london so deserted he could have wished it otherwise never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellowcreatures for struggle as he might there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity the square when they got there was all full of wind and dust and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing poole who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead now pulled up in the middle of the pavement and in spite of the biting weather took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pockethandkerchief but for all the hurry of his coming these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away but the moisture of some strangling anguish for his face was white and his voice when he spoke harsh and broken  well sir he said here we are and god grant there be nothing wrong  amen poole said the lawyer  thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner the door was opened on the chain and a voice asked from within is that you poole  its all right said poole open the door  the hall when they entered it was brightly lighted up the fire was built high and about the hearth the whole of the servants men and women stood huddled together like a flock of sheep at the sight of mr utterson the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering and the cook crying out bless god its mr utterson ran forward as if to take him in her arms  what what are you all here said the lawyer peevishly very irregular very unseemly your master would be far from pleased  theyre all afraid said poole  blank silence followed no one protesting only the maid lifted up her voice and now wept loudly  hold your tongue poole said to her with a ferocity of accent that testified to his own jangled nerves and indeed when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation they had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation and now continued the butler addressing the knifeboy reach me a candle and well get this through hands at once and then he begged mr utterson to follow him and led the way to the backgarden  now sir said he you come as gently as you can i want you to hear and i dont want you to be heard and see here sir if by any chance he was to ask you in dont go  mr uttersons nerves at this unlookedfor termination gave a jerk that nearly threw him from his balance but he recollected his courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building and through the surgical theatre with its lumber of crates and bottles to the foot of the stair here poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen while he himself setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door  mr utterson sir asking to see you he called and even as he did so once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear  a voice answered from within tell him i cannot see any one it said complainingly  thank you sir said poole with a note of something like triumph in his voice and taking up his candle he led mr utterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor  sir he said looking mr utterson in the eyes was that my masters voice  it seems much changed replied the lawyer very pale but giving look for look  changed well yes i think so said the butler have i been twenty years in this mans house to be deceived about his voice no sir masters made away with he was made away with eight days ago when we heard him cry out upon the name of god and whos in there instead of him and why it stays there is a thing that cries to heaven mr utterson  this is a very strange tale poole this is rather a wild tale my man said mr utterson biting his finger suppose it were as you suppose supposing dr jekyll to have beenwell murdered what could induce the murderer to stay that wont hold water it doesnt commend itself to reason  well mr utterson you are a hard man to satisfy but ill do it yet said poole all this last week you must know him or it or whatever it is that lives in that cabinet has been crying night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind it was sometimes his waythe masters that isto write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stair weve had nothing else this week back nothing but papers and a closed door and the very meals left there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking well sir every day ay and twice and thrice in the same day there have been orders and complaints and i have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town every time i brought the stuff back there would be another paper telling me to return it because it was not pure and another order to a different firm this drug is wanted bitter bad sir whatever for  have you any of these papers asked mr utterson  poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note which the lawyer bending nearer to the candle carefully examined its contents ran thus dr jekyll presents his compliments to messrs maw he assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his present purpose in the year 18 dr j purchased a somewhat large quantity from messrs m he now begs them to search with the most sedulous care and should any of the same quality be left to forward it to him at once expense is no consideration the importance of this to dr j can hardly be exaggerated so far the letter had run composedly enough but here with a sudden splutter of the pen the writers emotion had broken loose for gods sake he had added find me some of the old  this is a strange note said mr utterson and then sharply how do you come to have it open  the man at maws was main angry sir and he threw it back to me like so much dirt returned poole  this is unquestionably the doctors hand do you know resumed the lawyer  i thought it looked like it said the servant rather sulkily and then with another voice but what matters handofwrite he said ive seen him  seen him repeated mr utterson well  thats it said poole it was this way i came suddenly into the theatre from the garden it seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or whatever it is for the cabinet door was open and there he was at the far end of the room digging among the crates he looked up when i came in gave a kind of cry and whipped upstairs into the cabinet it was but for one minute that i saw him but the hair stood up on my head like quills sir if that was my master why had he a mask upon his face if it was my master why did he cry out like a rat and run from me i have served him long enough and then  the man paused and passed his hand over his face  these are all very strange circumstances said mr utterson but i think i begin to see daylight your master poole is plainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer hence for aught i know the alteration of his voice hence the mask and his avoidance of his friends hence his eagerness to find this drug by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recoverygod grant that he be not deceived there is my explanation it is sad enough poole ay and appalling to consider but it is plain and natural hangs well together and delivers us from all exorbitant alarms  sir said the butler turning to a sort of mottled pallor that thing was not my master and theres the truth my masterhere he looked round him and began to whisperis a tall fine build of a man and this was more of a dwarf utterson attempted to protest o sir cried poole do you think i do not know my master after twenty years do you think i do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door where i saw him every morning of my life no sir that thing in the mask was never dr jekyllgod knows what it was but it was never dr jekyll and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done  poole replied the lawyer if you say that it will become my duty to make certain much as i desire to spare your masters feelings much as i am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive i shall consider it my duty to break in that door  ah mr utterson thats talking cried the butler  and now comes the second question resumed utterson who is going to do it  why you and me sir was the undaunted reply  that is very well said returned the lawyer and whatever comes of it i shall make it my business to see you are no loser  there is an axe in the theatre continued poole and you might take the kitchen poker for yourself  the lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand and balanced it do you know poole he said looking up that you and i are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril  you may say so sir indeed returned the butler  it is well then that we should be frank said the other we both think more than we have said let us make a clean breast this masked figure that you saw did you recognise it  well sir it went so quick and the creature was so doubled up that i could hardly swear to that was the answer but if you mean was it mr hydewhy yes i think it was you see it was much of the same bigness and it had the same quick light way with it and then who else could have got in by the laboratory door you have not forgot sir that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him but thats not all i dont know mr utterson if ever you met this mr hyde  yes said the lawyer i once spoke with him  then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something queer about that gentlemansomething that gave a man a turni dont know rightly how to say it sir beyond this that you felt it in your marrow kind of cold and thin  i own i felt something of what you describe said mr utterson  quite so sir returned poole well when that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet it went down my spine like ice oh i know its not evidence mr utterson im booklearned enough for that but a man has his feelings and i give you my bibleword it was mr hyde  ay ay said the lawyer my fears incline to the same point evil i fear foundedevil was sure to comeof that connection ay truly i believe you i believe poor harry is killed and i believe his murderer for what purpose god alone can tell is still lurking in his victims room well let our name be vengeance call bradshaw  the footman came at the summons very white and nervous  pull yourself together bradshaw said the lawyer this suspense i know is telling upon all of you but it is now our intention to make an end of it poole here and i are going to force our way into the cabinet if all is well my shoulders are broad enough to bear the blame meanwhile lest anything should really be amiss or any malefactor seek to escape by the back you and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory door we give you ten minutes to get to your stations  as bradshaw left the lawyer looked at his watch and now poole let us get to ours he said and taking the poker under his arm he led the way into the yard the scud had banked over the moon and it was now quite dark the wind which only broke in puffs and draughts into that deep well of building tossed the light of the candle to and fro about their steps until they came into the shelter of the theatre where they sat down silently to wait london hummed solemnly all around but nearer at hand the stillness was only broken by the sound of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor  so it will walk all day sir whispered poole ay and the better part of the night only when a new sample comes from the chemist theres a bit of a break ah its an illconscience thats such an enemy to rest ah sir theres blood foully shed in every step of it but hark again a little closerput your heart in your ears mr utterson and tell me is that the doctors foot  the steps fell lightly and oddly with a certain swing for all they went so slowly it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of henry jekyll utterson sighed is there never anything else he asked  poole nodded once he said once i heard it weeping  weeping how that said the lawyer conscious of a sudden chill of horror  weeping like a woman or a lost soul said the butler i came away with that upon my heart that i could have wept too  but now the ten minutes drew to an end poole disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw the candle was set upon the nearest table to light them to the attack and they drew near with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down up and down in the quiet of the night  jekyll cried utterson with a loud voice i demand to see you he paused a moment but there came no reply i give you fair warning our suspicions are aroused and i must and shall see you he resumed if not by fair means then by foulif not of your consent then by brute force  utterson said the voice for gods sake have mercy  ah thats not jekylls voiceits hydes cried utterson down with the door poole  poole swung the axe over his shoulder the blow shook the building and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges a dismal screech as of mere animal terror rang from the cabinet up went the axe again and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded four times the blow fell but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship and it was not until the fifth that the lock burst in sunder and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet  the besiegers appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had succeeded stood back a little and peered in there lay the cabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth the kettle singing its thin strain a drawer or two open papers neatly set forth on the businesstable and nearer the fire the things laid out for tea the quietest room you would have said and but for the glazed presses full of chemicals the most commonplace that night in london  right in the midst there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and still twitching they drew near on tiptoe turned it on its back and beheld the face of edward hyde he was dressed in clothes far too large for him clothes of the doctors bigness the cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life but life was quite gone and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a selfdestroyer  we have come too late he said sternly whether to save or punish hyde is gone to his account and it only remains for us to find the body of your master  the far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre which filled almost the whole ground story and was lighted from above and by the cabinet which formed an upper story at one end and looked upon the court a corridor joined the theatre to the door on the bystreet and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs there were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar all these they now thoroughly examined each closet needed but a glance for all were empty and all by the dust that fell from their doors had stood long unopened the cellar indeed was filled with crazy lumber mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was jekylls predecessor but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance nowhere was there any trace of henry jekyll dead or alive  poole stamped on the flags of the corridor he must be buried here he said hearkening to the sound  or he may have fled said utterson and he turned to examine the door in the bystreet it was locked and lying near by on the flags they found the key already stained with rust  this does not look like use observed the lawyer  use echoed poole do you not see sir it is broken much as if a man had stamped on it  ay continued utterson and the fractures too are rusty the two men looked at each other with a scare this is beyond me poole said the lawyer let us go back to the cabinet  they mounted the stair in silence and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet at one table there were traces of chemical work various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented  that is the same drug that i was always bringing him said poole and even as he spoke the kettle with a startling noise boiled over  this brought them to the fireside where the easychair was drawn cosily up and the teathings stood ready to the sitters elbow the very sugar in the cup there were several books on a shelf one lay beside the teathings open and utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work for which jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem annotated in his own hand with startling blasphemies  next in the course of their review of the chamber the searchers came to the chevalglass into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror but it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses and their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in  this glass have seen some strange things sir whispered poole  and surely none stranger than itself echoed the lawyer in the same tones for what did jekyllhe caught himself up at the word with a start and then conquering the weakness what could jekyll want with it he said  you may say that said poole  next they turned to the businesstable on the desk among the neat array of papers a large envelope was uppermost and bore in the doctors hand the name of mr utterson the lawyer unsealed it and several enclosures fell to the floor the first was a will drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance but in place of the name of edward hyde the lawyer with indescribable amazement read the name of gabriel john utterson he looked at poole and then back at the paper and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet  my head goes round he said he has been all these days in possession he had no cause to like me he must have raged to see himself displaced and he has not destroyed this document  he caught up the next paper it was a brief note in the doctors hand and dated at the top o poole the lawyer cried he was alive and here this day he cannot have been disposed of in so short a space he must be still alive he must have fled and then why fled and how and in that case can we venture to declare this suicide oh we must be careful i foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastrophe  why dont you read it sir asked poole  because i fear replied the lawyer solemnly god grant i have no cause for it and with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read as follows     my dear uttersonwhen this shall fall into your hands i shall    have disappeared under what circumstances i have not the penetration    to foresee but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless    situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early go then    and first read the narrative which lanyon warned me he was to place    in your hands and if you care to hear more turn to the confession    of your unworthy and unhappy friend       henry jekyll  there was a third enclosure asked utterson  here sir said poole and gave into his hands a considerable packet sealed in several places  the lawyer put it in his pocket i would say nothing of this paper if your master has fled or is dead we may at least save his credit it is now ten i must go home and read these documents in quiet but i shall be back before midnight when we shall send for the police  they went out locking the door of the theatre behind them and utterson once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained     dr lanyons narrative   on the ninth of january now four days ago i received by the evening delivery a registered envelope addressed in the hand of my colleague and old schoolcompanion henry jekyll i was a good deal surprised by this for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence i had seen the man dined with him indeed the night before and i could imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify the formality of registration the contents increased my wonder for this is how the letter ran        10th december 18     dear lanyonyou are one of my oldest friends and although we may    have differed at times on scientific questions i cannot remember at    least on my side any break in our affection there was never a day    when if you had said to me jekyll my life my honour my reason    depend upon you i would not have sacrificed my fortune or my left    hand to help you lanyon my life my honour my reason are all at    your mercy if you fail me tonight i am lost you might suppose    after this preface that i am going to ask you for something    dishonourable to grant judge for yourself     i want you to postpone all other engagements for tonightay even    if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor to take a cab    unless your carriage should be actually at the door and with this    letter in your hand for consultation to drive straight to my house    poole my butler has his orders you will find him waiting your    arrival with a locksmith the door of my cabinet is then to be    forced and you are to go in alone to open the glazed press letter    e on the left hand breaking the lock if it be shut and to draw    out with all its contents as they stand the fourth drawer from    the top or which is the same thing the third from the bottom in my    extreme distress of mind i have a morbid fear of misdirecting you    but even if i am in error you may know the right drawer by its    contents some powders a phial and a paper book this drawer i beg    of you to carry back with you to cavendish square exactly as it    stands     that is the first part of the service now for the second you    should be back if you set out at once on the receipt of this long    before midnight but i will leave you that amount of margin not only    in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented    nor foreseen but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to    be preferred for what will then remain to do at midnight then i    have to ask you to be alone in your consultingroom to admit with    your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my    name and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought    with you from my cabinet then you will have played your part and    earned my gratitude completely five minutes afterwards if you    insist upon an explanation you will have understood that these    arrangements are of capital importance and that by the neglect of    one of them fantastic as they must appear you might have charged    your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason     confident as i am that you will not trifle with this appeal my    heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a    possibility think of me at this hour in a strange place labouring    under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate and yet    well aware that if you will but punctually serve me my troubles    will roll away like a story that is told serve me my dear lanyon    and save      your friend         h j     psi had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon    my soul it is possible that the post office may fail me and this    letter not come into your hands until tomorrow morning in that    case dear lanyon do my errand when it shall be most convenient for    you in the course of the day and once more expect my messenger at    midnight it may then already be too late and if that night passes    without event you will know that you have seen the last of henry    jekyll  upon the reading of this letter i made sure my colleague was insane but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt i felt bound to do as he requested the less i understood of this farrago the less i was in a position to judge of its importance and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility i rose accordingly from table got into a hansom and drove straight to jekylls house the butler was awaiting my arrival he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter the tradesmen came while we were yet speaking and we moved in a body to old dr denmans surgical theatre from which as you are doubtless aware jekylls private cabinet is most conveniently entered the door was very strong the lock excellent the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage if force were to be used and the locksmith was near despair but this last was a handy fellow and after two hours work the door stood open the press marked e was unlocked and i took out the drawer had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet and returned with it to cavendish square  here i proceeded to examine its contents the powders were neatly enough made up but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist so that it was plain they were of jekylls private manufacture and when i opened one of the wrappers i found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour the phial to which i next turned my attention might have been about halffull of a bloodred liquor which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether at the other ingredients i could make no guess the book was an ordinary versionbook and contained little but a series of dates these covered a period of many years but i observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly here and there a brief remark was appended to a date usually no more than a single word double occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation total failure all this though it whetted my curiosity told me little that was definite here was a phial of some tincture a paper of some salt and a record of a series of experiments that had led like too many of jekylls investigations to no end of practical usefulness how could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour the sanity or the life of my flighty colleague if his messenger could go to one place why could he not go to another and even granting some impediment why was this gentleman to be received by me in secret the more i reflected the more convinced i grew that i was dealing with a case of cerebral disease and though i dismissed my servants to bed i loaded an old revolver that i might be found in some posture of selfdefence  twelve oclock had scarce rung out over london ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door i went myself at the summons and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico  are you come from dr jekyll i asked  he told me yes by a constrained gesture and when i had bidden him enter he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the darkness of the square there was a policeman not far off advancing with his bullseye open and at the sight i thought my visitor started and made greater haste  these particulars struck me i confess disagreeably and as i followed him into the bright light of the consultingroom i kept my hand ready on my weapon here at last i had a chance of clearly seeing him i had never set eyes on him before so much was certain he was small as i have said i was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution andlast but not leastwith the odd subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood this bore some resemblance to incipient rigor and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse at the time i set it down to some idiosyncratic personal distaste and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms but i have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred  this person who had thus from the first moment of his entrance struck in me what i can only describe as a disgustful curiosity was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable his clothes that is to say although they were of rich and sober fabric were enormously too large for him in every measurementthe trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the ground the waist of the coat below his haunches and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders strange to relate this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter rather as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced mesomething seizing surprising and revoltingthis fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it so that to my interest in the mans nature and character there was added a curiosity as to his origin his life his fortune and status in the world  these observations though they have taken so great a space to be set down in were yet the work of a few seconds my visitor was indeed on fire with sombre excitement  have you got it he cried have you got it and so lively was his impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake me  i put him back conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my blood come sir said i you forget that i have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance be seated if you please and i showed him an example and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient as the lateness of the hour the nature of my preoccupations and the horror i had of my visitor would suffer me to muster  i beg your pardon dr lanyon he replied civilly enough what you say is very well founded and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness i come here at the instance of your colleague dr henry jekyll on a piece of business of some moment and i understood  he paused and put his hand to his throat and i could see in spite of his collected manner that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteriai understood a drawer  but here i took pity on my visitors suspense and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity  there it is sir said i pointing to the drawer where it lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet  he sprang to it and then paused and laid his hand upon his heart i could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws and his face was so ghastly to see that i grew alarmed both for his life and reason  compose yourself said i  he turned a dreadful smile to me and as if with the decision of despair plucked away the sheet at sight of the contents he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that i sat petrified and the next moment in a voice that was already fairly well under control have you a graduated glass he asked  i rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he asked  he thanked me with a smiling nod measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders the mixture which was at first of a reddish hue began in proportion as the crystals melted to brighten in colour to effervesce audibly and to throw off small fumes of vapour suddenly and at the same moment the ebullition ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple which faded again more slowly to a watery green my visitor who had watched these metamorphoses with a keen eye smiled set down the glass upon the table and then turned and looked upon me with an air of scrutiny  and now said he to settle what remains will you be wise will you be guided will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go forth from your house without further parley or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you think before you answer for it shall be done as you decide as you decide you shall be left as you were before and neither richer nor wiser unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul or if you shall so prefer to choose a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you here in this room upon the instant and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of satan  sir said i affecting a coolness that i was far from truly possessing you speak enigmas and you will perhaps not wonder that i hear you with no very strong impression of belief but i have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before i see the end  it is well replied my visitor lanyon you remember your vows what follows is under the seal of our profession and now you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views you who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine you who have derided your superiorsbehold  he put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp a cry followed he reeled staggered clutched at the table and held on staring with injected eyes gasping with open mouth and as i looked there came i thought a changehe seemed to swellhis face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alterand the next moment i had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall my arm raised to shield me from that prodigy my mind submerged in terror  o god i screamed and o god again and again for there before my eyespale and shaken and half fainting and groping before him with his hands like a man restored from deaththere stood henry jekyll  what he told me in the next hour i cannot bring my mind to set on paper i saw what i saw i heard what i heard and my soul sickened at it and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes i ask myself if i believe it and i cannot answer my life is shaken to its roots sleep has left me the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and night i feel that my days are numbered and that i must die and yet i shall die incredulous as for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me even with tears of penitence i cannot even in memory dwell on it without a start of horror i will say but one thing utterson and that if you can bring your mind to credit it will be more than enough the creature who crept into my house that night was on jekylls own confession known by the name of hyde and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of carew       hastie lanyon     henry jekylls full statement of the case   i was born in the year 18 to a large fortune endowed besides with excellent parts inclined by nature to industry fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen and thus as might have been supposed with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future and indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition such as has made the happiness of many but such as i found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public hence it came about that i concealed my pleasures and that when i reached years of reflection and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world i stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as i was guilty of but from the high views that i had set before me i regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame it was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults that made me what i was and with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound mans dual nature in this case i was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress though so profound a doubledealer i was in no sense a hypocrite both sides of me were in dead earnest i was no more myself when i laid aside restraint and plunged in shame than when i laboured in the eye of day at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering and it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members with every day and from both sides of my intelligence the moral and the intellectual i thus drew steadily nearer to that truth by whose partial discovery i have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck that man is not truly one but truly two i say two because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point others will follow others will outstrip me on the same lines and i hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious incongruous and independent denizens i for my part from the nature of my life advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only it was on the moral side and in my own person that i learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man i saw that of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness even if i could rightly be said to be either it was only because i was radically both and from an early date even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle i had learned to dwell with pleasure as a beloved daydream on the thought of the separation of these elements if each i told myself could but be housed in separate identities life would be relieved of all that was unbearable the unjust might go his way delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path doing the good things in which he found his pleasure and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil it was the curse of mankind that these incongruous fagots were thus bound togetherthat in the agonised womb of consciousness these polar twins should be continuously struggling how then were they dissociated  i was so far in my reflections when as i have said a sidelight began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table i began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated the trembling immateriality the mistlike transience of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired certain agents i found to have the power to shake and to pluck that fleshy vestment even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion for two good reasons i will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession first because i have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on mans shoulders and when the attempt is made to cast it off it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure second because as my narrative will make alas too evident my discoveries were incomplete enough then that i not only recognised my natural body for the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy and a second form and countenance substituted none the less natural to me because they were the expression and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul  i hesitated long before i put this theory to the test of practice i knew well that i risked death for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity might by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which i looked to it to change but the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm i had long since prepared my tincture i purchased at once from a firm of wholesale chemists a large quantity of a particular salt which i knew from my experiments to be the last ingredient required and late one accursed night i compounded the elements watched them boil and smoke together in the glass and when the ebullition had subsided with a strong glow of courage drank off the potion  the most racking pangs succeeded a grinding in the bones deadly nausea and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death then these agonies began swiftly to subside and i came to myself as if out of a great sickness there was something strange in my sensations something indescribably new and from its very novelty incredibly sweet i felt younger lighter happier in body within i was conscious of a heady recklessness a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy a solution of the bonds of obligation an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul i knew myself at the first breath of this new life to be more wicked tenfold more wicked sold a slave to my original evil and the thought in that moment braced and delighted me like wine i stretched out my hands exulting in the freshness of these sensations and in the act i was suddenly aware that i had lost in stature  there was no mirror at that date in my room that which stands beside me as i write was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations the night however was far gone into the morningthe morning black as it was was nearly ripe for the conception of the daythe inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber and i determined flushed as i was with hope and triumph to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom i crossed the yard wherein the constellations looked down upon me i could have thought with wonder the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them i stole through the corridors a stranger in my own house and coming to my room i saw for the first time the appearance of edward hyde  i must here speak by theory alone saying not that which i know but that which i suppose to be most probable the evil side of my nature to which i had now transferred the stamping efficacy was less robust and less developed than the good which i had just deposed again in the course of my life which had been after all ninetenths a life of effort virtue and control it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted and hence as i think it came about that edward hyde was so much smaller slighter and younger than henry jekyll even as good shone upon the countenance of the one evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other evil besides which i must still believe to be the lethal side of man had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay and yet when i looked upon that ugly idol in the glass i was conscious of no repugnance rather of a leap of welcome this too was myself it seemed natural and human in my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit it seemed more express and single than the imperfect and divided countenance i had been hitherto accustomed to call mine and in so far i was doubtless right i have observed that when i bore the semblance of edward hyde none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh this as i take it was because all human beings as we meet them are commingled out of good and evil and edward hyde alone in the ranks of mankind was pure evil  i lingered but a moment at the mirror the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted it yet remained to be seen if i had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine and hurrying back to my cabinet i once more prepared and drank the cup once more suffered the pangs of dissolution and came to myself once more with the character the stature and the face of henry jekyll  that night i had come to the fatal cross roads had i approached my discovery in a more noble spirit had i risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations all must have been otherwise and from these agonies of death and birth i had come forth an angel instead of a fiend the drug had no discriminating action it was neither diabolical nor divine it but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition and like the captives of philippi that which stood within ran forth at that time my virtue slumbered my evil kept awake by ambition was alert and swift to seize the occasion and the thing that was projected was edward hyde hence although i had now two characters as well as two appearances one was wholly evil and the other was still the old henry jekyll that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement i had already learned to despair the movement was thus wholly toward the worse  even at that time i had not yet conquered my aversion to the dryness of a life of study i would still be merrily disposed at times and as my pleasures were to say the least undignified and i was not only well known and highly considered but growing towards the elderly man this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome it was on this side that my new power tempted me until i fell in slavery i had but to drink the cup to doff at once the body of the noted professor and to assume like a thick cloak that of edward hyde i smiled at the notion it seemed to me at the time to be humorous and i made my preparations with the most studious care i took and furnished that house in soho to which hyde was tracked by the police and engaged as housekeeper a creature whom i well knew to be silent and unscrupulous on the other side i announced to my servants that a mr hyde whom i described was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square and to parry mishaps i even called and made myself a familiar object in my second character i next drew up that will to which you so much objected so that if anything befell me in the person of doctor jekyll i could enter on that of edward hyde without pecuniary loss and thus fortified as i supposed on every side i began to profit by the strange immunities of my position  men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes while their own person and reputation sat under shelter i was the first that ever did so for his pleasures i was the first that could thus plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability and in a moment like a schoolboy strip off these leadings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty but for me in my impenetrable mantle the safety was complete think of iti did not even exist let me but escape into my laboratorydoor give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that i had always standing ready and whatever he had done edward hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror and there in his stead quietly at home trimming the midnight lamp in his study a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion would be henry jekyll  the pleasures which i made haste to seek in my disguise were as i have said undignified i would scarce use a harder term but in the hands of edward hyde they soon began to turn towards the monstrous when i would come back from these excursions i was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity this familiar that i called out of my own soul and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure was a being inherently malign and villainous his every act and thought centred on self drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another relentless like a man of stone henry jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of edward hyde but the situation was apart from ordinary laws and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience it was hyde after all and hyde alone that was guilty jekyll was no worse he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired he would even make haste where it was possible to undo the evil done by hyde and thus his conscience slumbered  into the details of the infamy at which i thus connived for even now i can scarce grant that i committed it i have no design of entering i mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which my chastisement approached i met with one accident which as it brought on no consequence i shall no more than mention an act of cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passerby whom i recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman the doctor and the childs family joined him there were moments when i feared for my life and at last in order to pacify their too just resentment edward hyde had to bring them to the door and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of henry jekyll but this danger was easily eliminated from the future by opening an account at another bank in the name of edward hyde himself and when by sloping my own hand backward i had supplied my double with a signature i thought i sat beyond the reach of fate  some two months before the murder of sir danvers i had been out for one of my adventures had returned at a late hour and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations it was in vain i looked about me in vain i saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the square in vain that i recognised the pattern of the bedcurtains and the design of the mahogany frame something still kept insisting that i was not where i was that i had not wakened where i seemed to be but in the little room in soho where i was accustomed to sleep in the body of edward hyde i smiled to myself and in my psychological way began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion occasionally even as i did so dropping back into a comfortable morning doze i was still so engaged when in one of my more wakeful moments my eye fell upon my hand now the hand of henry jekyll as you have often remarked was professional in shape and size it was large firm white and comely but the hand which i now saw clearly enough in the yellow light of a midlondon morning lying half shut on the bedclothes was lean corded knuckly of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair it was the hand of edward hyde  i must have stared upon it for near half a minute sunk as i was in the mere stupidity of wonder before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals and bounding from my bed i rushed to the mirror at the sight that met my eyes my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy yes i had gone to bed henry jekyll i had awakened edward hyde how was this to be explained i asked myself and then with another bound of terrorhow was it to be remedied it was well on in the morning the servants were up all my drugs were in the cabineta long journey down two pairs of stairs through the back passage across the open court and through the anatomical theatre from where i was then standing horrorstruck it might indeed be possible to cover my face but of what use was that when i was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature and then with an overpowering sweetness of relief it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self i had soon dressed as well as i was able in clothes of my own size had soon passed through the house where bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing mr hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array and ten minutes later dr jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down with a darkened brow to make a feint of breakfasting  small indeed was my appetite this inexplicable incident this reversal of my previous experience seemed like the babylonian finger on the wall to be spelling out the letters of my judgment and i began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence that part of me which i had the power of projecting had lately been much exercised and nourished it had seemed to me of late as though the body of edward hyde had grown in stature as though when i wore that form i were conscious of a more generous tide of blood and i began to spy a danger that if this were much prolonged the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown the power of voluntary change be forfeited and the character of edward hyde become irrevocably mine the power of the drug had not always been equally displayed once very early in my career it had totally failed me since then i had been obliged on more than one occasion to double and once with infinite risk of death to treble the amount and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment now however and in the light of that mornings accident i was led to remark that whereas in the beginning the difficulty had been to throw off the body of jekyll it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side all things therefore seemed to point to this that i was slowly losing hold of my original and better self and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse  between these two i now felt i had to choose my two natures had memory in common but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them jekyll who was composite now with the most sensitive apprehensions now with a greedy gusto projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of hyde but hyde was indifferent to jekyll or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit jekyll had more than a fathers interest hyde had more than a sons indifference to cast in my lot with jekyll was to die to those appetites which i had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper to cast it in with hyde was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations and to become at a blow and for ever despised and friendless the bargain might appear unequal but there was still another consideration in the scales for while jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost strange as my circumstances were the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner and it fell out with me as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows that i chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it  yes i preferred the elderly and discontented doctor surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty the comparative youth the light step leaping pulses and secret pleasures that i had enjoyed in the disguise of hyde i made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation for i neither gave up the house in soho nor destroyed the clothes of edward hyde which still lay ready in my cabinet for two months however i was true to my determination for two months i led a life of such severity as i had never before attained to and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience but time began at last to obliterate the freshness of my alarm the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course i began to be tortured with throes and longings as of hyde struggling after freedom and at last in an hour of moral weakness i once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught  i do not suppose that when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his vice he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that he runs through his brutish physical insensibility neither had i long as i had considered my position made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil which were the leading characters of edward hyde yet it was by these that i was punished my devil had been long caged he came out roaring i was conscious even when i took the draught of a more unbridled a more furious propensity to ill it must have been this i suppose that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which i listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim i declare at least before god no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation and that i struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything but i had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations and in my case to be tempted however slightly was to fall  instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged with a transport of glee i mauled the unresisting body tasting delight from every blow and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed that i was suddenly in the top fit of my delirium struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror a mist dispersed i saw my life to be forfeit and fled from the scene of these excesses at once glorying and trembling my lust of evil gratified and stimulated my love of life screwed to the topmost peg i ran to the house in soho and to make assurance doubly sure destroyed my papers thence i set out through the lamplit streets in the same divided ecstasy of mind gloating on my crime lightheadedly devising others in the future and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught and as he drank it pledged the dead man the pangs of transformation had not done tearing him before henry jekyll with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to god the veil of selfindulgence was rent from head to foot i saw my life as a whole i followed it up from the days of childhood when i had walked with my fathers hand and through the selfdenying toils of my professional life to arrive again and again with the same sense of unreality at the damned horrors of the evening i could have screamed aloud i sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against me and still between the petitions the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul as the acuteness of this remorse began to die away it was succeeded by a sense of joy the problem of my conduct was solved hyde was thenceforth impossible whether i would or not i was now confined to the better part of my existence and oh how i rejoiced to think it with what willing humility i embraced anew the restrictions of natural life with what sincere renunciation i locked the door by which i had so often gone and come and ground the key under my heel  the next day came the news that the murder had been overlooked that the guilt of hyde was patent to the world and that the victim was a man high in public estimation it was not only a crime it had been a tragic folly i think i was glad to know it i think i was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold jekyll was now my city of refuge let but hyde peep out an instant and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him  i resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past and i can say with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good you know yourself how earnestly in the last months of last year i laboured to relieve suffering you know that much was done for others and that the days passed quietly almost happily for myself nor can i truly say that i wearied of this beneficent and innocent life i think instead that i daily enjoyed it more completely but i was still cursed with my duality of purpose and as the first edge of my penitence wore off the lower side of me so long indulged so recently chained down began to growl for licence not that i dreamed of resuscitating hyde the bare idea of that would startle me to frenzy no it was in my own person that i was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience and it was as an ordinary secret sinner that i at last fell before the assaults of temptation  there comes an end to all things the most capacious measure is filled at last and this brief condescension to evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul and yet i was not alarmed the fall seemed natural like a return to the old days before i had made my discovery it was a fine clear january day wet under foot where the frost had melted but cloudless overhead and the regents park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours i sat in the sun on a bench the animal within me licking the chops of memory the spiritual side a little drowsed promising subsequent penitence but not yet moved to begin after all i reflected i was like my neighbours and then i smiled comparing myself with other men comparing my active goodwill with the lazy cruelty of their neglect and at the very moment of that vainglorious thought a qualm came over me a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering these passed away and left me faint and then as in its turn the faintness subsided i began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts a greater boldness a contempt of danger a solution of the bonds of obligation i looked down my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs the hand that lay on my knee was corded and hairy i was once more edward hyde a moment before i had been safe of all mens respect wealthy belovedthe cloth laying for me in the diningroom at home and now i was the common quarry of mankind hunted houseless a known murderer thrall to the gallows  my reason wavered but it did not fail me utterly i have more than once observed that in my second character my faculties seemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic thus it came about that where jekyll perhaps might have succumbed hyde rose to the importance of the moment my drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet how was i to reach them that was the problem that crushing my temples in my hands i set myself to solve the laboratory door i had closed if i sought to enter by the house my own servants would consign me to the gallows i saw i must employ another hand and thought of lanyon how was he to be reached how persuaded supposing that i escaped capture in the streets how was i to make my way into his presence and how should i an unknown and displeasing visitor prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague dr jekyll then i remembered that of my original character one part remained to me i could write my own hand and once i had conceived that kindling spark the way that i must follow became lighted up from end to end  thereupon i arranged my clothes as best i could and summoning a passing hansom drove to a hotel in portland street the name of which i chanced to remember at my appearance which was indeed comical enough however tragic a fate these garments covered the driver could not conceal his mirth i gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury and the smile withered from his facehappily for himyet more happily for myself for in another instant i had certainly dragged him from his perch at the inn as i entered i looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble not a look did they exchange in my presence but obsequiously took my orders led me to a private room and brought me wherewithal to write hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me shaken with inordinate anger strung to the pitch of murder lusting to inflict pain yet the creature was astute mastered his fury with a great effort of the will composed his two important letters one to lanyon and one to poole and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted sent them out with directions that they should be registered  thenceforward he sat all day over the fire in the private room gnawing his nails there he dined sitting alone with his fears the waiter visibly quailing before his eye and then when the night was fully come he set forth in the corner of a closed cab and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city he i sayi cannot say i that child of hell had nothing human nothing lived in him but fear and hatred and when at last thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious he discharged the cab and ventured on foot attired in his misfitting clothes an object marked out for observation into the midst of the nocturnal passengers these two base passions raged within him like a tempest he walked fast hunted by his fears chattering to himself skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight once a woman spoke to him offering i think a box of lights he smote her in the face and she fled  when i came to myself at lanyons the horror of my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat i do not know it was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which i looked back upon these hours a change had come over me it was no longer the fear of the gallows it was the horror of being hyde that racked me i received lanyons condemnation partly in a dream it was partly in a dream that i came home to my own house and got into bed i slept after the prostration of the day with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break i awoke in the morning shaken weakened but refreshed i still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me and i had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before but i was once more at home in my own house and close to my drugs and gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope  i was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast drinking the chill of the air with pleasure when i was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change and i had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet before i was once again raging and freezing with the passions of hyde it took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself and alas six hours after as i sat looking sadly in the fire the pangs returned and the drug had to be readministered in short from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug that i was able to wear the countenance of jekyll at all hours of the day and night i would be taken with the premonitory shudder above all if i slept or even dozed for a moment in my chair it was always as hyde that i awakened under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which i now condemned myself ay even beyond what i had thought possible to man i became in my own person a creature eaten up and emptied by fever languidly weak both in body and mind and solely occupied by one thought the horror of my other self but when i slept or when the virtue of the medicine wore off i would leap almost without transition for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror a soul boiling with causeless hatreds and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life the powers of hyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of jekyll and certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side with jekyll it was a thing of vital instinct he had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness and was coheir with him to death and beyond these links of community which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress he thought of hyde for all his energy of life as of something not only hellish but inorganic this was the shocking thing that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned that what was dead and had no shape should usurp the offices of life and this again that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife closer than an eye lay caged in his flesh where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born and at every hour of weakness and in the confidence of slumber prevailed against him and deposed him out of life the hatred of hyde for jekyll was of a different order his terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person but he loathed the necessity he loathed the despondency into which jekyll was now fallen and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded hence the apelike tricks that he would play me scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father and indeed had it not been for his fear of death he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin but his love of life is wonderful i go further i who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him when i recall the abjection and passion of this attachment and when i know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide i find it in my heart to pity him  it is useless and the time awfully fails me to prolong this description no one has ever suffered such torments let that suffice and yet even to these habit broughtno not alleviationbut a certain callousness of soul a certain acquiescence of despair and my punishment might have gone on for years but for the last calamity which has now fallen and which has finally severed me from my own face and nature my provision of the salt which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment began to run low i sent out for a fresh supply and mixed the draught the ebullition followed and the first change of colour not the second i drank it and it was without efficiency you will learn from poole how i have had london ransacked it was in vain and i am now persuaded that my first supply was impure and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught  about a week has passed and i am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders this then is the last time short of a miracle that henry jekyll can think his own thoughts or see his own face now how sadly altered in the glass nor must i delay too long to bring my writing to an end for if my narrative has hitherto escaped destruction it has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it hyde will tear it in pieces but if some time shall have elapsed after i have laid it by his wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his apelike spite and indeed the doom that is closing on us both has already changed and crushed him half an hour from now when i shall again and for ever reindue that hated personality i know how i shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair or continue with the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening to pace up and down this room my last earthly refuge and give ear to every sound of menace will hyde die upon the scaffold or will he find the courage to release himself at the last moment god knows i am careless this is my true hour of death and what is to follow concerns another than myself here then as i lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession i bring the life of that unhappy henry jekyll to an end     thrawn janet     thrawn janet   the reverend murdoch soulis was long minister of the moorland parish of balweary in the vale of dule a severe bleakfaced old man dreadful to his hearers he dwelt in the last years of his life without relative or servant or any human company in the small and lonely manse under the hanging shaw in spite of the iron composure of his features his eye was wild scared and uncertain and when he dwelt in private admonitions on the future of the impenitent it seemed as if his eye pierced through the storms of time to the terrors of eternity many young persons coming to prepare themselves against the season of the holy communion were dreadfully affected by his talk he had a sermon on 1st peter v and 8th the devil as a roaring lion on the sunday after every seventeenth of august and he was accustomed to surpass himself upon that text both by the appalling nature of the matter and the terror of his bearing in the pulpit the children were frightened into fits and the old looked more than usually oracular and were all that day full of those hints that hamlet deprecated the manse itself where it stood by the water of dule among some thick trees with the shaw overhanging it on the one side and on the other many cold moorish hilltops rising towards the sky had begun at a very early period of mr souliss ministry to be avoided in the dusk hours by all who valued themselves upon their prudence and guidmen sitting at the clachan alehouse shook their heads together at the thought of passing late by that uncanny neighbourhood there was one spot to be more particular which was regarded with especial awe the manse stood between the highroad and the water of dule with a gable to each its back was towards the kirktown of balweary nearly half a mile away in front of it a bare garden hedged with thorn occupied the land between the river and the road the house was two stories high with two large rooms on each it opened not directly on the garden but on a causewayed path or passage giving on the road on the one hand and closed on the other by the tall willows and elders that bordered on the stream and it was this strip of causeway that enjoyed among the young parishioners of balweary so infamous a reputation the minister walked there often after dark sometimes groaning aloud in the instancy of his unspoken prayers and when he was from home and the manse door was locked the more daring schoolboys ventured with beating hearts to follow my leader across that legendary spot  this atmosphere of terror surrounding as it did a man of god of spotless character and orthodoxy was a common cause of wonder and subject of inquiry among the few strangers who were led by chance or business into that unknown outlying country but many even of the people of the parish were ignorant of the strange events which had marked the first year of mr souliss ministrations and among those who were better informed some were naturally reticent and others shy of that particular topic now and again only one of the older folk would warm into courage over his third tumbler and recount the cause of the ministers strange looks and solitary life   fifty years syne when mr soulis cam first into baweary he was still a young mana callant the folk saidfu o booklearnin an grand at the exposition but as was natural in sae young a man wi nae leevin experience in religion the younger sort were greatly taken wi his gifts an his gab but auld concerned serious men and women were moved even to prayer for the young man whom they took to be a selfdeceiver an the parish that was like to be sae illsupplied it was before the days o the moderatesweary fa them but ill things are like guidthey baith come bit by bit a pickle at a time an there were folk even then that said the lord had left the college professors to their ain devices an the lads that went to study wi them wad hae done mair an better sittin in a peatbog like their forbears o the persecution wi a bible under their oxter an a speerit o prayer in their heart there was nae doubt onyway but that mr soulis had been ower lang at the college he was careful an troubled for mony things besides the ae thing needful he had a feck o books wi himmair than had ever been seen before in a that presbytery and a sair wark the carrier had wi them for they were a like to have smoored in the deils hag between this an kilmackerlie they were books o divinity to be sure or so they cad them but the serious were of opinion there was little service for sae mony when the hale o gods word would gang in the neuk o a plaid then he wad sit half the day an half the nicht forbye which was scant decentwritin nae less an first they were feared he wad read his sermons an syne it proved he was writin a book himsel which was surely no flttin for ane o his years an sma experience  onyway it behoved him to get an auld decent wife to keep the manse for him an see to his bit denners an he was recommended to an auld limmerjanet mclour they cad heran sae far left to himsel as to be ower persuaded there was mony advised him to the contrar for janet was mair than suspeckit by the best folk in baweary lang or that she had had a wean to a dragoon she hadna come forrit5 for maybe thretty year an bairns had seen her mumblin to hersel up on keys loan in the gloamin whilk was an unco time an place for a godfearin woman howsoever it was the laird himsel that had first tauld the minister o janet an in thae days he wad hae gane a far gate to pleesure the laird when folk tauld him that janet was sib to the deil it was a superstition by his way o it an when they cast up the bible to him an the witch o endor he wad threep it doun their thrapples that thir days were a gane by an the deil was mercifully restrained  weel when it got about the clachan that janet mclour was to be servant at the manse the folk were fair mad wi her an him thegither an some o the guid wives had nae better to dae than get round her doorcheeks and chairge her wi a that was kent again her frae the sodgers bairn to john tamsons twa kye she was nae great speaker folk usually let her gang her ain gate an she let them gang theirs wi neither fairguideen nor fairguidday but when she buckled to she had a tongue to deave the miller up she got an there wasna an auld story in baweary but she gart somebody lowp for it that day they couldna say ae thing but she could say twa to it till at the hinder end the guidwives up and claught hand o her an clawed the coats aff her back an pud her doun the clachan to the water o dule to see if she were a witch or no soom or droun the carline skirled till ye could hear her at the hangin shaw an she focht like ten there was mony a guidwife bure the mark o her neist day an mony a lang day after an just in the hottest o the collieshangie wha suld come up for his sins but the new minister  women said he and he had a grand voice i charge you in the lords name to let her go  janet ran to himshe was fair wud wi terroran clang to him an prayed him for christs sake save her frae the cummers an they for their pairt tauld him a that was kent an maybe mair  woman says he to janet is this true  as the lord sees me says she as the lord made me no a word ot forbye the bairn says she ive been a decent woman a my days  will you says mr soulis in the name of god and before me his unworthy minister renounce the devil and his works  weel it wad appear that when he askit that she gave a girn that fairly frichtit them that saw her an they could hear her teeth play dirl thegither in her chafts but there was naething fort but the ae way or the ither an janet lifted up her hand an renounced the deil before them a  and now says mr soulis to the guidwives home with ye one and all and pray to god for his forgiveness  an he gied janet his arm though she had little on her but a sark an took her up the clachan to her ain door like a leddy o the land an her screighin and laughin as was a scandal to be heard  there were mony grave folk lang ower their prayers that nicht but when the morn cam there was sic a fear fell upon a baweary that the bairns hid theirsels an even the menfolk stood an keekit frae their doors for there was janet comin doun the clachanher or her likeness nane could tellwi her neck thrawn an her heid on ae side like a body that has been hangit an a girn on her face like an unstreakit corp by an by they got used wi it an even speered at her to ken what was wrang but frae that day forth she couldna speak like a christian woman but slavered an played click wi her teeth like a pair o shears an frae that day forth the name o god cam never on her lips whiles she wad try to say it but it michtna be them that kenned best said least but they never gied that thing the name o janet mclour for the auld janet by their way ot was in muckle hell that day but the minister was neither to haud nor to bind he preached about naething but the folks cruelty that had gien her a stroke of the palsy he skelpit the bairns that meddled her an he had her up to the manse that same nicht an dwalled there a his lane wi her under the hangin shaw  weel time gaed by an the idler sort commenced to think mair lichtly o that black business the minister was weel thocht o he was aye late at the writing folk wad see his canle doon by the dule water after twal at een an he seemed pleased wi himsel an upsitten as at first though a body could see that he was dwining as for janet she cam an she gaed if she didna speak muckle afore it was reason she should speak less then she meddled naebody but she was an eldritch thing to see an nane wad hae mistrysted wi her for baweary glebe  about the end o july there cam a spell o weather the like ot never was in that countryside it was lown an het an heartless the herds couldna win up the black hill the bairns were ower weariet to play an yet it was gousty too wi claps o het wund that rummled in the glens and bits o shouers that slockened naething we aye thocht it but to thuner on the morn but the morn cam an the morns morning an it was aye the same uncanny weather sair on folks and bestial o a that were the waur nane suffered like mr soulis he could neither sleep nor eat he tauld his elders an when he wasna writin at his weary book he wad be stravaguin ower a the countryside like a man possessed when a body else was blithe to keep caller ben the house  abune hangin shaw in the bield o the black hill theres a bit enclosed grund wi an iron yett an it seems in the auld days that was the kirkyaird o baweary and consecrated by the papists before the blessed licht shone upon the kingdom it was a great howff o mr souliss onyway there he wad sit an consider his sermons an indeed its a bieldy bit weel as he cam ower the wast end o the black hill ae day he saw first twa an syne fower an syne seeven corbie craws fleein round an round abune the auld kirkyaird they flew laigh an heavy an squawked to ither as they gaed an it was clear to mr soulis that something had put them frae their ordinar he wasna easy fleyed an gaed straucht up to the was an what suld he find there but a man or the appearance o a man sittin in the inside upon a grave he was of a great stature an black as hell an his een were singular to see6 mr soulis had heard tell o black men monys the time but there was something unco about this black man that daunted him het as he was he took a kind o cauld grue in the marrow o his banes but up he spak for a that an says he my friend are you a stranger in this place the black man answered never a word he got upon his feet an begoud to hirsle to the wa on the far side but he aye lookit at the minister an the minister stood an lookit back till a in a meenit the black man was ower the wa an rinnin for the bield o the trees mr soulis he hardly kenned why ran after him but he was fair forjeskit wi his walk an the het unhalesome weather an rin as he likit he got nae mair than a glisk o the black man amang the birks till he won doun to the foot o the hillside an there he saw him ance mair gaun hapstepanlowp ower dule water to the manse  mr soulis wasna weel pleased that this fearsome gangrel suld mak sae free wi baweary manse an he ran the harder an wet shoon ower the burn an up the walk but the deil a black man was there to see he stepped out upon the road but there was naebody there he gaed a ower the gairden but na nae black man at the hinder end an a bit feared as was but natural he lifted the hasp an into the manse an there was janet mclour before his een wi her thrawn craig an nane sae pleased to see him an he aye minded sinsyne when first he set his een upon her he had the same cauld and deidly grue  janet says he have you seen a black man  a black man quo she save us a yere no wise minister theres nae black man in a baweary  but she didna speak plain ye maun understand but yamyammered like a powney wi the bit in its moo  weel says he janet if there was nae black man i have spoken with the accuser of the brethren  an he sat down like ane wi a fever an his teeth chittered in his heid  hoots says she think shame to yoursel minister an gied him a drap brandy that she keept aye by her  syne mr soulis gaed into his study amang a his books its a lang laigh mirk chalmer perishin cauld in winter an no very dry even in the tap o the simmer for the manse stands near the burn sae doun he sat an thocht o a that had come an gane since he was in baweary an his hame an the days when he was a bairn an ran daffin on the braes an that black man aye ran in his heid like the owercome o a sang aye the mair he thocht the mair he thocht o the black man he tried the prayer an the words wadna come to him an he tried they say to write at his book but he couldna mak nae mair o that there was whiles he thocht the black man was at his oxter an the swat stood upon him cauld as wellwater an there was ither whiles when he cam to himsel like a christened bairn an minded naething  the upshot was that he gaed to the window an stood glowrin at dule water the trees are unco thick an the water lies deep an black under the manse an there was janet washin the claes wi her coats kilted she had her back to the minister an he for his pairt hardly kenned what he was lookin at syne she turned round an shawed her face mr soulis had the same cauld grue as twice that day afore an it was borne in upon him what folk said that janet was deid lang syne an this was a bogle in her claycauld flesh he drew back a pickle and he scanned her narrowly she was tramptrampin in the claes croonin to hersel and eh gude guide us but it was a fearsome face whiles she sang louder but there was nae man born o woman that could tell the words o her sang an whiles she lookit sidelang doun but there was naething there for her to look at there gaed a scunner through the flesh upon his banes an that was heevens advertisement but mr soulis just blamed himsel he said to think sae ill o a puir auld afflicted wife that hadna a freend forbye himsel an he put up a bit prayer for him an her an drank a little caller waterfor his heart rose again the meatan gaed up to his naked bed in the gloamin  that was a nicht that has never been forgotten in baweary the nicht o the seeventeenth o august seeventeen huner an twal it had been het afore as i hae said but that nicht it was better than ever the sun gaed doun amang uncolookin clouds it fell as mirk as the pit no a star no a breath o wund ye couldna see your han afore your face an even the auld folk cuist the covers frae their beds an lay pechin for their breath wi a that he had upon his mind it was geyan unlikely mr soulis wad get muckle sleep he lay an he tummled the gude caller bed that he got into brunt his very banes whiles he slept an whiles he waukened whiles he heard the time o nicht an whiles a tyke yowlin up the muir as if somebody was deid whiles he thocht he heard bogles claverin in his lug an whiles he saw spunkies in the room he behoved he judged to be sick an sick he waslittle he jaloosed the sickness  at the hinder end he got a clearness in his mind sat up in his sark on the bedside an fell thinkin ance mair o the black man an janet he couldna weel tell howmaybe it was the cauld to his feetbut it cam in upon him wi a spate that there was some connection between thir twa an that either or baith o them were bogles an just at that moment in janets room which was neist to his there cam a stramp o feet as if men were warslin an then a loud bang an then a wund gaed reishling round the fower quarters o the house an then a was aince mair as seelent as the grave  mr soulis was feared for neither man nor deevil he got his tinderbox an lit a canle an made three steps ot ower to janets door it was on the hasp an he pushed it open an keekit bauldly in it was a big room as big as the ministers ain an plenished wi grand auld solid gear for he had naething else there was a fowerposted bed wi auld tapestry an a braw cabinet o aik that was fu o the ministers divinity books an put there to be out o the gate an a wheen duds o janets lying here an there about the floor but nae janet could mr soulis see nor ony sign o a contention in he gaed an theres few that wad hae followed him an lookit a round an listened but there was naething to be heard neither inside the manse nor in a baweary parish an naething to be seen but the muckle shadows turnin round the canle an then a at aince the ministers heart played dunt an stood stockstill an a cauld wund blew amang the hairs o his heid whaten a weary sicht was that for the puir mans een for there was janet hangin frae a nail beside the auld aik cabinet her heid aye lay on her shouther her een were steekit the tongue projected frae her mouth an her heels were twa feet clear abune the floor  god forgive us all thocht mr soulis poor janets dead  he cam a step nearer to the corp an then his heart fair whammled in his inside for by what cantrip it wad ill beseem a man to judge she was hingin frae a single nail an by a single wursted thread for darnin hose  its an awfu thing to be your lane at nicht wi siccan prodigies o darkness but mr soulis was strong in the lord he turned an gaed his ways oot o that room an lockit the door ahint him an step by step doon the stairs as heavy as leed an set doon the canle on the table at the stairfoot he couldna pray he couldna think he was dreepin wi caul swat an naething could he hear but the duntduntduntin o his ain heart he micht maybe hae stood there an hour or maybe twa he minded sae little when a o a sudden he heard a laigh uncanny steer upstairs a foot gaed to an fro in the chalmer whaur the corp was hingin syne the door was opened though he minded weel that he had lockit it an syne there was a step upon the landin an it seemed to him as if the corp was lookin ower the rail an doun upon him whaur he stood  he took up the canle again for he couldna want the licht an as saftly as ever he could gaed straucht out o the manse an to the far end o the causeway it was aye pitmirk the flame o the canle when he set it on the grund brunt steedy and clear as in a room naething moved but the dule water seepin an sabbin doun the glen an yon unhaly footstep that cam ploddin doun the stairs inside the manse he kenned the foot ower weel for it was janets an at ilka step that cam a wee thing nearer the cauld got deeper in his vitals he commended his soul to him that made an keepit him and o lord said he give me strength this night to war against the powers of evil  by this time the foot was comin through the passage for the door he could hear a hand skirt alang the wa as if the fearsome thing was feelin for its way the saughs tossed an maned thegither a lang sigh cam ower the hills the flame o the canle was blawn aboot an there stood the corp o thrawn janet wi her grogram goun an her black mutch wi the heid aye upon the shouther an the girn still upon the face otleevin ye wad hae saiddeid as mr soulis weel kennedupon the threshold o the manse  its a strange thing that the saul o man should be that thirled into his perishable body but the minister saw that an his heart didna break  she didna stand there lang she began to move again an cam slowly towards mr soulis whaur he stood under the saughs a the life o his body a the strength o his speerit were glowerin frae his een it seemed she was gaun to speak but wanted words an made a sign wi the left hand there cam a clap o wund like a cats fuff oot gaed the canle the saughs skreighed like folk and mr soulis kenned that live or die this was the end ot  witch beldame devil he cried i charge you by the power of god begoneif you be dead to the graveif you be damned to hell  an at that moment the lords ain hand out o the heevens struck the horror whaur it stood the auld deid desecrated corp o the witchwife sae lang keepit frae the grave an hirsled round by deils lowed up like a brunstane spunk an fell in ashes to the grund the thunder followed peal on dirlin peal the rairin rain upon the back o that an mr soulis lowped through the garden hedge an ran wi skelloch upon skelloch for the clachan  that same mornin john christie saw the black man pass the muckle cairn as it was chappin six before eicht he gaed by the changehouse at knockdow an no lang after sandy mlellan saw him gaun linkin doun the braes frae kilmackerlie theres little doubt but it was him that dwalled sae lang in janets body but he was awa at last an sinsyne the deil has never fashed us in baweary  but it was a sair dispensation for the minister lang lang he lay ravin in his bed an frae that hour to this he was the man ye ken the day   footnotes    5 to come forritto offer
