27192997	dreams  by jerome k jerome   the most extraordinary dream i ever had was one in which i fancied that as i was going into a theater the cloakroom attendant stopped me in the lobby and insisted on my leaving my legs behind me  i was not surprised indeed my acquaintanceship with theater harpies would prevent my feeling any surprise at such a demand even in my waking moments but i was i must honestly confess considerably annoyed it was not the payment of the cloakroom fee that i so much mindedi offered to give that to the man then and there it was the parting with my legs that i objected to  i said i had never heard of such a rule being attempted to be put in force at any respectable theater before and that i considered it a most absurd and vexatious regulation i also said i should write to the times about it  the man replied that he was very sorry but that those were his instructions people complained that they could not get to and from their seats comfortably because other peoples legs were always in the way and it had therefore been decided that in future everybody should leave their legs outside  it seemed to me that the management in making this order had clearly gone beyond their legal right and under ordinary circumstances i should have disputed it being present however more in the character of a guest than in that of a patron i hardly like to make a disturbance and so i sat down and meekly prepared to comply with the demand  i had never before known that the human leg did unscrew i had always thought it was a fixture but the man showed me how to undo them and i found that they came off quite easily  the discovery did not surprise me any more than the original request that i should take them off had done nothing does surprise one in a dream  i dreamed once that i was going to be hanged but i was not at all surprised about it nobody was my relations came to see me off i thought and to wish me goodby they all came and were all very pleasant but they were not in the least astonishednot one of them everybody appeared to regard the coming tragedy as one of the mostnaturallytobeexpected things in the world  they bore the calamity besides with an amount of stoicism that would have done credit to a spartan father there was no fuss no scene on the contrary an atmosphere of mild cheerfulness prevailed  yet they were very kind somebodyan uncle i thinkleft me a packet of sandwiches and a little something in a flask in case as he said i should feel peckish on the scaffold  it is those twinjailers of the daring thought knowledge and experience that teach us surprise we are surprised and incredulous when in novels and plays we come across good men and women because knowledge and experience have taught us how rare and problematical is the existence of such people in waking life my friends and relations would of course have been surprised at hearing that i had committed a murder and was in consequence about to be hanged because knowledge and experience would have taught them that in a country where the law is powerful and the police alert the christian citizen is usually pretty successful in withstanding the voice of temptation prompting him to commit crime of an illegal character  but into dreamland knowledge and experience do not enter they stay without together with the dull dead clay of which they form a part while the freed brain released from their narrowing tutelage steals softly past the ebon gate to wanton at its own sweet will among the mazy paths that wind through the garden of persephone  nothing that it meets with in that eternal land astonishes it because unfettered by the dense conviction of our waking mind that nought outside the ken of our own vision can in this universe be all things to it are possible and even probable in dreams we fly and wonder notexcept that we never flew before we go naked yet are not ashamed though we mildly wonder what the police are about that they do not stop us we converse with our dead and think it was unkind that they did not come back to us before in dreams there happens that which human language cannot tell in dreams we see the light that never was on sea or land we hear the sounds that never yet were heard by waking ears  it is only in sleep that true imagination ever stirs within us awake we never imagine anything we merely alter vary or transpose we give another twist to the kaleidoscope of the things we see around us and obtain another pattern but not one of us has ever added one tiniest piece of new glass to the toy  a dean swift sees one race of people smaller and another race of people larger than the race of people that live down his own streets and he also sees a land where the horses take the place of men a bulwer lytton lays the scene of one of his novels inside the earth instead of outside a rider haggard introduces us to a lady whose age is a few years more than the average woman would care to confess to and pictures crabs larger than the usual shilling or eighteenpenny size the number of so called imaginative writers who visit the moon is legion and for all the novelty that they find when they get there they might just as well have gone to putney others are continually drawing for us visions of the world one hundred or one thousand years hence there is always a depressing absence of human nature about the place so much so that one feels great consolation in the thought while reading that we ourselves shall be comfortably dead and buried before the picture can be realized in these prophesied utopias everybody is painfully good and clean and happy and all the work is done by electricity  there is somewhat too much electricity for my taste in these worlds to come one is reminded of those pictorial enamelpaint advertisements that one sees about so often now in which all the members of an extensive household are represented as gathered together in one room spreading enamelpaint over everything they can lay their hands upon the old man is on a stepladder daubing the walls and ceiling with cuckoosegg green while the parlormaid and the cook are on their knees painting the floor with sealingwax red the old lady is doing the picture frames in terra cotta the eldest daughter and her young man are making sly love in a corner over a pot of high art yellow with which so soon as they have finished wasting their time they will it is manifest proceed to elevate the piano younger brothers and sisters are busy freshening up the chairs and tables with strawberryjam pink and jubilee magenta every blessed thing in that room is being coated with enamel paint from the sofa to the fireirons from the sideboard to the eightday clock if there is any paint left over it will be used up for the family bible and the canary  it is claimed for this invention that a little child can make as much mess with it as can a grownup person and so all the children of the family are represented in the picture as hard at work enameling whatever few articles of furniture and household use the grasping selfishness of their elders has spared to them one is painting the toasting fork in a skimmilk blue while another is giving aesthetical value to the dutch oven by means of a new shade of art green the bootjack is being renovated in old gold and the baby is sitting on the floor smothering its own cradle with flushuponamaidens cheek peach color  one feels that the thing is being overdone that family before another month is gone will be among the strongest opponents of enamel paint that the century has produced enamel paint will be the ruin of that once happy home enamel paint has a cold glassy cynical appearance its presence everywhere about the place will begin to irritate the old man in the course of a week or so he will call it this damnd sticky stuff and will tell the wife that he wonders she didnt paint herself and the children with it while she was about it she will reply in an exasperatingly quiet tone of voice that she does like that perhaps he will say next that she did not warn him against it and tell him what an idiot he was making of himself spoiling the whole house with his foolish fads each one will persist that it was the other one who first suggested the absurdity and they will sit up in bed and quarrel about it every night for a month  the children having acquired a taste for smudging the concoction about and there being nothing else left untouched in the house will try to enamel the cat and then there will be bloodshed and broken windows and spoiled infants and sorrows and yells the smell of the paint will make everybody ill and the servants will give notice tradesmens boys will lean up against places that are not dry and get their clothes enameled and claim compensation and the baby will suck the paint off its cradle and have fits  but the person that will suffer most will of course be the eldest daughters young man the eldest daughters young man is always unfortunate he means well and he tries hard his great ambition is to make the family love him but fate is ever against him and he only succeeds in gaining their undisguised contempt the fact of his being gone on their emily is of itself naturally sufficient to stamp him as an imbecile in the eyes of emilys brothers and sisters the father finds him slow and thinks the girl might have done better while the best that his future motherinlaw his sole supporter can say for him is that he seems steady  there is only one thing that prompts the family to tolerate him and that is the reflection that he is going to take emily away from them  on that understanding they put up with him  the eldest daughters young man in this particular case will you may depend upon it choose that exact moment when the babys life is hovering in the balance and the cook is waiting for her wages with her box in the hall and a coalheaver is at the front door with a policeman making a row about the damage to his trousers to come in smiling with a specimen pot of some new high art squashedtomatoshade enamel paint and suggest that they should try it on the old mans pipe  then emily will go off into hysterics and emilys male progenitor will firmly but quietly lead that illstarred yet truehearted young man to the public side of the gardengate and the engagement will be off  too much of anything is a mistake as the man said when his wife presented him with four new healthy children in one day we should practice moderation in all matters a little enamel paint would have been good they might have enameled the house inside and out and have left the furniture alone or they might have colored the furniture and let the house be but an entirely and completely enameled homea home such as enamelpaint manufacturers love to picture on their advertisements over which the yearning eye wanders in vain seeking one single square inch of unenameled matteris i am convinced a mistake it may be a home that as the testimonials assure us will easily wash it may be an artistic home but the average man is not yet educated up to the appreciation of it the average man does not care for high art at a certain point the average man gets sick of high art  so in these coming utopias in which out unhappy grandchildren will have to drag out their colorless existence there will be too much electricity they will grow to loathe electricity  electricity is going to light them warm them carry them doctor them cook for them execute them if necessary they are going to be weaned on electricity rocked in their cradles by electricity slapped by electricity ruled and regulated and guided by electricity buried by electricity i may be wrong but i rather think they are going to be hatched by electricity  in the new world of our progressionist teachers it is electricity that is the real motivepower the men and women are only marionettesworked by electricity  but it was not to speak of the electricity in them but of the originality in them that i referred to these works of fiction there is no originality in them whatever human thought is incapable of originality no man ever yet imagined a new thingonly some variation or extension of an old thing  the sailor when he was asked what he would do with a fortune promptly replied  buy all the rum and baccy there is in the world  and what after that they asked him  eh  what would you buy after thatafter you had bought up all the rum and tobacco there was in the worldwhat would you buy then  after that oh um a long pause oh with inspiration why more baccy  rum and tobacco he knew something of and could therefore imagine about he did not know any other luxuries therefore he could not conceive of any others  so if you ask one of these utopiandreaming gentry what after they had secured for their world all the electricity there was in the universe and after every mortal thing in their ideal paradise was done and said and thought by electricity they could imagine as further necessary to human happiness they would probably muse for awhile and then reply more electricity  they know electricity they have seen the electric light and heard of electric boats and omnibuses they have possibly had an electric shock at a railway station for a penny  therefore knowing that electricity does three things they can go on and imagine electricity doing three hundred things and the very great ones among them can imagine it doing three thousand things but for them or anybody else to imagine a new force totally unconnected with and different from anything yet known in nature would be utterly impossible  human thought is not a firework ever shooting off fresh forms and shapes as it burns it is a tree growing very slowlyyou can watch it long and see no movementvery silently unnoticed it was planted in the world many thousand years ago a tiny sickly plant and men guarded it and tended it and gave up life and fame to aid its growth in the hot days of their youth they came to the gate of the garden and knocked begging to be let in and to be counted among the gardeners and their young companions without called to them to come back and play the man with bow and spear and win sweet smiles from rosy lips and take their part amid the feast and dance not stoop with wrinkled brows at weaklings work and the passers by mocked them and called shame and others cried out to stone them and still they stayed there laboring that the tree might grow a little and they died and were forgotten  and the tree grew fair and strong the storms of ignorance passed over it and harmed it not the fierce fires of superstition soared around it but men leaped into the flames and beat them back perishing and the tree grew with the sweat of their brow have men nourished its green leaves their tears have moistened the earth about it with their blood they have watered its roots  the seasons have come and passed and the tree has grown and flourished and its branches have spread far and high and ever fresh shoots are bursting forth and ever new leaves unfolding to the light but they are all part of the one treethe tree that was planted on the first birthday of the human race the stem that bears them springs from the gnarled old trunk that was green and soft when whitehaired time was a little child the sap that feeds them is drawn up through the roots that twine and twist about the bones of the ages that are dead  the human mind can no more produce an original thought than a tree can bear an original fruit as well might one cry for an original note in music as expect an original idea from a human brain  one wishes our friends the critics would grasp this simple truth and leave off clamoring for the impossible and being shocked because they do not get it when a new book is written the highclass critic opens it with feelings of faint hope tempered by strong conviction of coming disappointment as he pores over the pages his brow darkens with virtuous indignation and his lip curls with the godlike contempt that the exceptionally great critic ever feels for everybody in this world who is not yet dead buoyed up by a touching but totally fallacious belief that he is performing a public duty and that the rest of the community is waiting in breathless suspense to learn his opinion of the work in question before forming any judgment concerning it themselves he nevertheless wearily struggles through about a third of it then his longsuffering soul revolts and he flings it aside with a cry of despair  why there is no originality whatever in this he says this book is taken bodily from the old testament it is the story of adam and eve all over again the hero is a mere man with two arms two legs and a head so called why it is only mosess adam under another name and the heroine is nothing but a woman and she is described as beautiful and as having long hair the author may call her angelina or any other name he chooses but he has evidently whether he acknowledges it or not copied her direct from eve the characters are barefaced plagiarisms from the book of genesis oh to find an author with originality  one spring i went a walking tour in the country it was a glorious spring not the sort of spring they give us in these miserable times under this shameless governmenta mixture of east wind blizzard snow rain slush fog frost hail sleet and thunderstormsbut a sunny blueskyd joyous spring such as we used to have regularly every year when i was a young man and things were different  it was an exceptionally beautiful spring even for those golden days and as i wandered through the waking land and saw the dawning of the coming green and watched the blush upon the hawthorn hedge deepening each day beneath the kisses of the sun and looked up at the proud old mother trees dandling their myriad baby buds upon their strong fond arms holding them high for the soft west wind to caress as he passed laughing by and marked the primrose yellow creep across the carpet of the woods and saw the new flush of the field and saw the new light on the hills and heard the newfound gladness of the birds and heard from copse and farm and meadow the timid callings of the little newborn things wondering to find themselves alive and smelt the freshness of the earth and felt the promise in the air and felt a strong hand in the wind my spirit rose within me spring had come to me also and stirred me with a strange new life with a strange new hope i too was part of nature and it was spring tender leaves and blossoms were unfolding from my heart bright flowers of love and gratitude were opening round its roots i felt new strength in all my limbs new blood was pulsing through my veins nobler thoughts and nobler longings were throbbing through my brain  as i walked nature came and talked beside me and showed me the world and myself and the ways of god seemed clearer  it seemed to me a pity that all the beautiful and precious thoughts and ideas that were crowding in upon me should be lost to my fellowmen and so i pitched my tent at a little cottage and set to work to write them down then and there as they came to me  it has been complained of me i said to myself that i do not write literary and high class workat least not work that is exceptionally literary and highclass this reproach shall be removed i will write an article that shall be a classic i have worked for the ordinary everyday reader it is right that i should do something now to improve the literature of my beloved country  and i wrote a grand essaythough i say it who should not though i dont see why i shouldntall about spring and the way it made you feel and what it made you think it was simply crowded with elevated thoughts and highclass ideas and cultured wit was that essay there was only one fault about that essay it was too brilliant i wanted commonplace relief it would have exhausted the average reader so much cleverness would have wearied him  i wish i could remember some of the beautiful things in that essay and here set them down because then you would be able to see what they were like for yourselves and that would be so much more simpler than my explaining to you how beautiful they were unfortunately however i cannot now call to mind any of them  i was very proud of this essay and when i got back to town i called on a very superior friend of mine a critic and read it to him i do not care for him to see any of my usual work because he really is a very superior person indeed and the perusal of it appears to give him pains inside but this article i thought would do him good  what do you think of it i asked when i had finished  splendid he replied excellently arranged i never knew you were so well acquainted with the works of the old writers why there is scarcely a classic of any note that you have not quoted from but wherewhere he added musing did you get that last idea but two from its the only one i dont seem to remember it isnt a bit of your own is it  he said that if so he should advise me to leave it out not that it was altogether bad but that the interpolation of a modern thought among so unique a collection of passages from the ancients seemed to spoil the scheme  and he enumerated the various deadandburied gentlemen from whom he appeared to think i had collated my article  but i replied when i had recovered my astonishment sufficiently to speak it isnt a collection at all it is all original i wrote the thoughts down as they came to me i have never read any of these people you mention except shakespeare  of course shakespeare was bound to be among them i am getting to dislike that man so he is always being held up before us young authors as a model and i do hate models there was a model boy at our school i remember henry summers and it was just the same there it was continually look at henry summers he doesnt put the preposition before the verb and spell business biz or why cant you write like henry summers he doesnt get the ink all over the copybook and halfway up his back we got tired of this everlasting look at henry summers after a while and so one afternoon on the way home a few of us lured henry summers up a dark court and when he came out again he was not worth looking at  now it is perpetually look at shakespeare why dont you write like shakespeare shakespeare never made that joke why dont you joke like shakespeare  if you are in the playwriting line it is still worse for you why dont you write plays like shakespeares they indignantly say shakespeare never made his comic man a penny steamboat captain shakespeare never made his hero address the girl as ducky why dont you copy shakespeare if you do try to copy shakespeare they tell you that you must be a fool to attempt to imitate shakespeare  oh shouldnt i like to get shakespeare up our street and punch him  i cannot help that replied my critical friendto return to our previous questionthe germ of every thought and idea you have got in that article can be traced back to the writers i have named if you doubt it i will get down the books and show you the passages for yourself  but i declined the offer i said i would take his word for it and would rather not see the passages referred to i felt indignant if as i said these menthese platos and socrateses and ciceros and sophocleses and aristophaneses and aristotles and the rest of them had been taking advantage of my absence to go about the world spoiling my business for me i would rather not hear any more about them  and i put on my hat and came out and i have never tried to write anything original since  i dreamed a dream once it is the sort of thing a man would dream you cannot very well dream anything else i know but the phrase sounds poetical and biblical and so i use it i dreamed that i was in a strange countryindeed one might say an extraordinary country it was ruled entirely by critics  the people in this strange land had a very high opinion of criticsnearly as high an opinion of critics as the critics themselves had but not of course quitethat not being practicableand they had agreed to be guided in all things by the critics i stayed some years in that land but it was not a cheerful place to live in so i dreamed  there were authors in this country at first and they wrote books but the critics could find nothing original in the books whatever and said it was a pity that men who might be usefully employed hoeing potatoes should waste their time and the time of the critics which was of still more importance in stringing together a collection of platitudes familiar to every schoolboy and dishing up old plots and stories that had already been cooked and recooked for the public until everybody had been surfeited with them  and the writers read what the critics said and sighed and gave up writing books and went off and hoed potatoes as advised they had had no experience in hoeing potatoes and they hoed very badly and the people whose potatoes they hoed strongly recommended them to leave hoeing potatoes and to go back and write books but you cant do what everybody advises  there were artists also in this strange world at first and they painted pictures which the critics came and looked at through eyeglasses  nothing whatever original in them said the critics same old colors same old perspective and form same old sunset same old sea and land and sky and figures why do these poor men waste their time painting pictures when they might be so much more satisfactorily employed on ladders painting houses  nothing by the by you may have noticed troubles your critic more than the idea that the artist is wasting his time it is the waste of time that vexes the critic he has such an exalted idea of the value of other peoples time dear dear me he says to himself why in the time the man must have taken to paint this picture or to write this book he might have blacked fifteen thousand pairs of boots or have carried fifteen thousand hods of mortar up a ladder this is how the time of the world is lost  it never occurs to him that but for that picture or book the artist would in all probability have been mouching about with a pipe in his mouth getting into trouble  it reminds me of the way people used to talk to me when i was a boy i would be sitting as good as gold reading the pirates lair when some cultured relative would look over my shoulder and say bah what are you wasting your time with rubbish for why dont you go and do something useful and would take the book away from me upon which i would get up and go out to do something useful and would come home an hour afterward looking like a bit out of a battle picture having tumbled through the roof of farmer bates greenhouse and killed a cactus though totally unable to explain how i came to be on the roof of farmer bates greenhouse they had much better have left me alone lost in the pirates lair  the artists in this land of which i dreamed left off painting pictures after hearing what the critics said and purchased ladders and went off and painted houses  because you see this country of which i dreamed was not one of those vulgar ordinary countries such as exist in the waking world where people let the critics talk as much as ever they like and nobody pays the slightest attention to what they say here in this strange land the critics were taken seriously and their advice followed  as for the poets and sculptors they were very soon shut up the idea of any educated person wanting to read modern poetry when he could obtain homer or caring to look at any other statue while there was still some of the venus de medicis left was too absurd poets and sculptors were only wasting their time  what new occupation they were recommended to adopt i forget some calling they knew nothing whatever about and that they were totally unfitted for of course  the musicians tried their art for a little while but they too were of no use merely a repetition of the same notes in different combinations said the critics why will people waste their time writing unoriginal music when they might be sweeping crossings  one man had written a play i asked what the critics had said about him they showed me his tomb  then there being no more artists or litterateurs or dramatists or musicians left for their beloved critics to criticise the general public of this enlightened land said to themselves why should not our critics come and criticise us criticism is useful to a man have we not often been told so look how useful it has been to the artists and writerssaved the poor fellows from wasting their time why shouldnt we have some of its benefits  they suggested the idea to the critics and the critics thought it an excellent one and said they would undertake the job with pleasure one must say for the critics that they never shirk work they will sit and criticise for eighteen hours a day if necessary or even if quite unnecessary for the matter of that you cant give them too much to criticise they will criticise everything and everybody in this world they will criticise everything in the next world too when they get there i expect poor old pluto has a lively time with them all as it is  so when a man built a house or a farmyard hen laid an egg the critics were asked in to comment on it they found that none of the houses were original on every floor were passages that seemed mere copies from passages in other houses they were all built on the same hackneyed plan cellars underneath ground floor level with the street attic at the top no originality anywhere  so likewise with the eggs every egg suggested reminiscences of other eggs  it was heartrending work  the critics criticised all things when a young couple fell in love they each before thinking of marriage called upon the critics for a criticism of the other one  needless to say that in the result no marriage ever came of it  my dear young lady the critics would say after the inspection had taken place i can discover nothing new whatever about the young man you would simply be wasting your time in marrying him  or to the young man it would be  oh dear no nothing attractive about the girl at all who on earth gave you that notion simply a lovely face and figure angelic disposition beautiful mind stanch heart noble character why there must have been nearly a dozen such girls born into the world since its creation you would be only wasting your time loving her  they criticised the birds for their hackneyed style of singing and the flowers for their hackneyed scents and colors they complained of the weather that it lacked originalitytrue they had not lived out an english springand found fault with the sun because of the sameness of his methods  they criticised the babies when a fresh infant was published in a house the critics would call in a body to pass their judgment upon it and the young mother would bring it down for them to sample  did you ever see a child anything like that in this world before she would say holding it out to them isnt it a wonderful baby you never saw a child with legs like that i know nurse says hes the most extraordinary baby she ever attended bless him  but the critics did not think anything of it  tut tut they would reply there is nothing extraordinary about that childno originality whatever why its exactly like every other babybald head red face big mouth and stumpy nose why thats only a weak imitation of the baby next door its a plagiarism thats what that child is youve been wasting your time madam if you cant do anything more original than that we should advise you to give up the business altogether  that was the end of criticism in that strange land  oh look here weve had enough of you and your originality said the people to the critics after that why you are not original when one comes to think of it and your criticisms are not original youve all of you been saying exactly the same thing ever since the time of solomon we are going to drown you and have a little peace  what drown a critic cried the critics never heard of such a monstrous proceeding in our lives  no we flatter ourselves it is an original idea replied the public brutally you ought to be charmed with it out you come  so they took the critics out and drowned them and then passed a short act making criticism a capital offense  after that the art and literature of the country followed somewhat the methods of the quaint and curious school but the land notwithstanding was a much more cheerful place to live in i dreamed  but i never finished telling you about the dream in which i thought i left my legs behind me when i went into a certain theater  i dreamed that the ticket the man gave me for my legs was no 19 and i was worried all through the performance for fear no 61 should get hold of them and leave me his instead mine are rather a fine pair of legs and i am i confess a little proud of themat all events i prefer them to anybody elses besides number sixtyones might be a skinny pair and not fit me  it quite spoiled my evening fretting about this  another extraordinary dream i had was one in which i dreamed that i was engaged to be married to my aunt jane that was not however the extraordinary part of it i have often known people to dream things like that i knew a man who once dreamed that he was actually married to his own motherinlaw he told me that never in his life had he loved the alarm clock with more deep and grateful tenderness than he did that morning the dream almost reconciled him to being married to his real wife they lived quite happily together for a few days after that dream  no the extraordinary part of my dream was that i knew it was a dream what on earth will uncle say to this engagement i thought to myself in my dream theres bound to be a row about it we shall have a deal of trouble with uncle i feel sure and this thought quite troubled me until the sweet reflection came ah well its only a dream  and i made up my mind that i would wake up as soon as uncle found out about the engagement and leave him and aunt jane to fight the matter out between themselves  it is a very great comfort when the dream grows troubled and alarming to feel that it is only a dream and to know that we shall awake soon and be none the worse for it we can dream out the foolish perplexity with a smile then  sometimes the dream of life grows strangely troubled and perplexing and then he who meets dismay the bravest is he who feels that the fretful play is but a dreama brief uneasy dream of three score years and ten or thereabouts from which in a little while he will awakeat least he dreams so  how dull how impossible life would be without dreamswaking dreams i meanthe dreams that we call castles in the air built by the kindly hands of hope were it not for the mirage of the oasis drawing his footsteps ever onward the weary traveler would lie down in the desert sand and die it is the mirage of distant success of happiness that like the bunch of carrots fastened an inch beyond the donkeys nose seems always just within our reach if only we will gallop fast enough that makes us run so eagerly along the road of life  providence like a father with a tired child lures us ever along the way with tales and promises until at the frowning gate that ends the road we shrink back frightened then promises still more sweet he stoops and whispers in our ear and timid yet partly reassured and trying to hide our fears we gather up all that is left of our little stock of hope and trusting yet half afraid push out our groping feet into the darkness
