home   the ship glided slowly up the narrows and from its deck daren lane saw the noble black outline of the statue of liberty limned against the clear gold of sunset a familiar old pang in his breastlonging and homesickness and agony together with the physical burn of gassed lungsseemed to swell into a profound overwhelming emotion  my ownmy native land he whispered striving to wipe the dimness from his eyes was it only two years or twenty since he had left his country to go to war a sense of strangeness dawned upon him his homecoming so ceaselessly dreamed of by night and longed for by day was not going to be what his hopes had created but at that moment his joy was too great to harbor strange misgivings how impossible for any one to understand his feelings then except perhaps the comrades who had survived the same ordeal  the vessel glided on a fresh cool spring breeze with a scent of land fanned lanes hot brow it bore tidings from home almost he thought he smelled the blossoms in the orchard and the damp newly plowed earth and the smoke from the wood fire his mother used to bake over a hundred clamoring thoughts strove for dominance over his mindto enter and flash by and fade his sight however except for the blur that returned again and again held fast to the entrancing and thrilling scenethe broad glimmering suntrack of gold in the rippling channel leading his eye to the grand bulk of americas symbol of freedom and to the stately expanse of the hudson river dotted by moving ferryboats and tugs and to the magnificent broken skyline of new york city with its huge dark structures looming and its thousands of windows reflecting the fire of the sun  it was indeed a profound and stirring moment for daren lane but not quite full not allsatisfying the great city seemed to frown the low line of hills in the west shone dull gray and cold where were the screaming siren whistles the gay streaming flags the boats crowded with waving people that should have welcomed disabled soldiers who had fought for their country lane hoped he had long passed by bitterness but yet something rankled in the unhealed wound of his heart  some one put a hand in close clasp upon his arm then lane heard the scrape of a crutch on the deck and knew who stood beside him  well dare old boy does it look good to you asked a husky voice  yes blair but somehow not just what i expected replied lane turning to his comrade  uhuh i get you  blair maynard stood erect with the aid of a crutch there was even a hint of pride in the poise of his uncovered head and for once lane saw the thin white face softening and glowing maynards big brown eyes were full of tears  guess i left my nerve as well as my leg over there he said  blair its so good to get back that were off color returned lane on the level i could scream like a madman  id like to weep replied the other with a half laugh  wheres red he oughtnt miss this  poor devil he sneaked off from me somewhere rejoined maynard reds in pretty bad shape again the voyage has been hard on him i hope hell be well enough to get his discharge when we land ill take him home to middleville  middleville echoed lane musingly home blair does it hit youkind of queer do you long yet dread to get home  maynard had no reply for that query but his look was expressive  ive not heard from helen for over a year went on lane more as if speaking to himself  my god dare exclaimed his companion with sudden fire are you still thinking of her  wewe are engaged returned lane slowly at least we were but ive had no word that she  dare your childlike faith is due for a jar interrupted his comrade with bitter scorn come down to earth youre a crippled soldiercoming homeand damn lucky at that  blair what do you knowthat i do not know for long ive suspected youre wise toto things at home you know i havent heard much in all these long months my mother wrote but seldom lorna my kid sister forgot me i guess helen always was a poor correspondent dal answered my letters but she never told me anything about home when we first got to france i heard often from margie henderson and mel idencrazy kind of letterslovesick over soldiers but nothing for a long time now  at first they wrote ha ha burst out maynard sure they wrote lovesick letters they sent socks and cigarettes and candy and books and they all wanted us to hurry back to marry them thenwhen the months had gone by and the novelty had worn offwhen we went against the hell of real warsick or worn out sleepless and miserable crippled or half demented with terror and dread and longing for homethen by god they quit  oh no blairnot all of them remonstrated lane unsteadily  well old man im sore and youre about the only guy i can let out on explained maynard heavily one thing im glad ofwell face it together daren we were kids togetherdo you rememberplaying on the commonsstraddling the old watergates over the brooksstealing cider from the country pressesbarefoot boys going to school together we played postoffice with the girls and indians with the boys we made puppy love to dal and mel and helen and margieall of them then somehow the happy thoughtless years of youth passed it seems strange and sudden nowbut the war came we enlisted we had the same idealyou and iwe went to franceand you know what we did there together now were on this shipgetting into port of the good old usgood as bad as she isgoing home together thank god for that i want to be buried in woodlawn home home we feel its meaning but dare well have no homeno place we are oldwe are throughwe have servedwe are done what we dreamed of as glory will be cold ashes to our lips bitter as gall you always were a dreamer an idealist a believer in god truth hope and womanhood in spite of the war these somehow survive in you but dare old friend steel yourself now against disappointment and disillusion  used as lane was to his comrades outbursts this one struck singularly home to lanes heart and made him mute the chill of his earlier misgiving returned augmented by a strange uneasiness a premonition of the unknown and dreadful future but he threw it off faith would not die in lane it could not die utterly because of what he felt in himself yetwhat was in store for him why was his hope so unquenchable there could be no resurgam for daren lane resignation should have brought him peacepeacewhen every nerve in his shellshocked body racked himwhen he could not subdue a mounting hope that all would be well at homewhen he quivered at thought of mother sister sweetheart  the ship glided on under the shadow of americas emblema bronze woman of noble proportions holding out a light to ships that came in the nighta welcome to all the world daren lane held to his maimed comrade while they stood bareheaded and erect for that moment when the ship passed the statue lane knew what blair felt but nothing of what that feeling was could ever be spoken the deck of the ship was now crowded with passengers yet they were seemingly dead to anything more than a safe arrival at their destination they were not crippled american soldiers except these two there were none in service uniforms there across the windy space of water loomed the manyeyed buildings suggestive of the great city a low roar of traffic came on the breeze passengers and crew of the liner were glad to dock before dark they took no notice of the rigid erect soldiers lane arm in arm with blair face to the front stood absorbed in his sense of a nameless sublimity for them while passing the statue of liberty the spirit of the first man who ever breathed of freedom for the human race burned as a white flame in the heart of lane and his comrade but it was not so much that spirit which held them erect aloof proud it was a supreme consciousness of immeasurable sacrifice for an ideal that existed only in the breasts of men and women kindred to theman unutterable and nevertobespoken glory of the duty done for others but that they owed themselves they had sustained immense loss of health and happiness the future seemed like the gray cold gloomy expanse of the river and there could never be any reward except this white fire of their souls nameless but it was the increasing purpose that ran through the ages  the ship docked at dark lane left blair at the rail gloomily gazing down at the confusion and bustle on the wharf and went below to search for their comrade red payson he found him in his stateroom half crouched on the berth apparently oblivious to the important moment it required a little effort to rouse payson he was a slight boy not over twentytwo sallowfaced and freckled with hair that gave him the only name his comrades knew him by lane packed the boys few possessions and talked vehemently all the time red braced up ready to go but he had little to say and that with the weary nonchalance habitual with him lane helped him up on deck and the exertion slight as it was brought home to lane that he needed help himself they found maynard waiting  well here we arethe three musketeers said lane in a voice he tried to make cheerful  wheres the band inquired maynard sardonically  gay old new yorkand me broke exclaimed red payson as if to himself  then the three stood by the rail at the gangplank waiting for the hurried stream of passengers to disembark down on the wharf under the glaring white lights swarmed a crowd from which rose a babel of voices a whistle blew sharply at intervals the whirr and honk of taxicabs and the jangle of trolley cars sounded beyond the wide dark portal of the dockhouse the murky water below splashed between ship and pier deep voices rang out and merry laughs and shrill glad cries of welcome the bright light shone down upon a motley darkgarbed mass moving slowly the spirit of the occasion was manifest  when the three disabled soldiers the last passengers to disembark slowly and laboriously descended to the wharf no one offered to help them no one waited with a smile and handclasp of welcome no one saw them except a burly policeman who evidently had charge of the traffic at the door he poked his club into the ribs of the onelegged slowly shuffling maynard and said with cheerful gruffness step lively buddy step lively  lane with his two comrades spent three days at a barrackshospital for soldiers in bedford park it was a long flimsy structure bare except for rows of cots along each wall and stoves at middle and each end the place was overcrowded with disabled service men all worse off than lane and his comrades lane felt that he really was keeping a sicker man than himself from what attention the hospital afforded so he was glad at the end of the third day to find they could be discharged from the army  this enforced stay when he knew he was on his way home had seemed almost unbearable to lane he felt that he had the strength to get home and that was about all he began to expectorate bloodno unusual thing for himbut this time to such extent that he feared the return of hemorrhage the nights seemed sleepless burning black voids and the days were hideous with noise and distraction he wanted to think about the fact that he was homean astounding and unbelievable thing once he went down to the city and walked on broadway and fifth avenue taxing his endurance to the limit but he had become used to pain and exhaustion so long as he could keep up he did not mind  that day three powerful impressions were forced upon lane never to be effaced first he found that the change in him was vast and incalculable and vague he could divine but not understand secondly the men of the service disabled or not were old stories to new yorkers lane saw soldiers begging from pedestrians he muttered to himself by god ill starve to death before i ever do that he could not detect any aloofness on the part of passersby they were just inattentive lane remembered with sudden shock how differently soldiers had been regarded two or three years ago he had read lengthy newspaper accounts of the wild and magnificent welcome accorded to the first soldiers to return to new york how strange the contrast but that was long agopast historyburied under the immense and hurried and inscrutable changes of a nation lane divined that as he felt the mighty resistless throb of the great city his third and strongest impression concerned the women he met and passed on the streets their lips and cheeks were rouged their dresses were cut too low at the neck but even this fashion was not nearly so striking as the short skirts cut off at the knees and in many cases above at first this roused a strange amaze in lane whats the idea i wonder he mused but in the end it disgusted him he reflected that for two swift years he had been out of the track of events away from centers of population paris itself had held no attraction for him dreamer and brooder he had failed to see the material things but this third impression troubled him more than the other two and stirred thoughts he tried to dispel returning to the barracks he learned that he and his friends would be free on the morrow and long into the night he rejoiced in the knowledge free the grinding incomprehensible juggernaut and himself were at the parting of the ways before he went to sleep he remembered a forgotten prayer his mother had taught him his ordeal was over what had happened did not matter the hell was past and he must bury memory whether or not he had a month or a year to live it must be lived without memories of his ordeal  next day at the railroad station even at the moment of departure lane and blair maynard had their problem with red payson he did not want to go to blairs home  but hell red you havent any homeany place to go blurted out maynard  so they argued with him and implored him and reasoned with him since his discharge from the hospital in france payson had always been cool weary abstracted difficult to reach and here at the last he grew strangely aloof and stubborn every word that bore relation to his own welfare seemed only to alienate him the more lane sensed this  see here red he said hasnt it occurred to you that blair and i need you  need me what he exclaimed with perceptible change of tone though it was incredulous  sure interposed blair  redlisten continued lane speaking low and with difficulty blair and i have been through thethe whole show together and weve been in the hospitals with you for months weve all gotsort of to rely on each other lets stick it out to the end i guessyou knowwe may not have a long time  lanes voice trailed off then the stony face of the listener changed for a fleeting second  boys ill go over with you he said  and then the maimed blair awkward with his crutch and bag insisted on helping lane get red aboard the train red could just about walk sombrely they clambered up the steps into the pullman  middleville was a prosperous and thriving inland town of twenty thousand inhabitants identical with many towns of about the same size in the middle and eastern united states  lane had been born there and had lived there all his life seldom having been away up to the advent of the war so that the memories of home and town and place which he carried away from america with him had never had any chance up to the time of his departure to change from the vivid exaggerated image of boyhood since he had left middleville he had seen great cities palaces castles edifices he had crossed great rivers he had traveled thousands of miles he had looked down some of the famous thoroughfares of the world  was this then the reason that middleville upon his arrival seemed so strange sordid shrunken so vastly changed he stared even while he helped payson off the trainstared at the little brick station at once so familiar and yet so strange that had held a place of dignity in the picture of his memory the moment was one of shock  then he was distracted from his pondering by tearful and joyful cries and deeper voices of men he looked up to recognize blairs mother father sister and men and women whose faces appeared familiar but whose names he could not recall his acute faculty of perception took quick note of a change in blairs mother lane turned his gaze away the agony of joy and sorrowthe light of her facewas more than lane could stand he looked at the sister margareta tall fair girl she had paint on her cheeks she did not see lane her strained gaze held a beautiful and piercing intentness then her eyes opened wide her hand went to cover her mouth and she cried out oh blairpoor boy brother  only lane heard her the others were crying out themselves as blairs grayhaired mother received him into her arms she seemed a proud woman broken and unsteady red paysons grip on lanes arm told what that scene meant to him how pitiful the vain effort of blairs people to hide their horror presently mother and sister and women relatives fell aside to let the soldier boy meet his father this was something that rang the bells in lanes heart men were different and blair faced his father differently the wild boy had come homethe scapegoat of many middleville escapades had returnedthe neerdowell sought his fathers house he had come home to die it was there in blairs white facethe dreadful truth he wore a ribbon on his breast and he leaned on a crutch for the instant as father and son faced each other there was something in blairs poise his look of an eagle that carried home a poignant sense of his greatness lane thrilled with it and a lump constricted his throat then with blairs ringing dad and the fathers deep and broken my son my son the two embraced  in a stifling moment more it seemed attention turned on red payson who stood nearest blairs folk were eager kind softspoken and warm in their welcome  then it came lanes turn and what they said or did he scarcely knew until margaret kissed him oh dare im so glad to see you home tears were standing in her clear blue eyes youre changed butnotnot so much as blair  lane responded as best he could and presently he found himself standing at the curb watching the car move away  come out tomorrow called back blair  the maynards car was carrying his comrades away his first feeling was one of gladnessthe next of relief he could be alone nowalone to find out what had happened to him and to this strange middleville an old negro wearing a blue uniform accosted lane shook hands with him asked him if he had any baggage yas sir i sho knowed you mistah dare lane but you looks powerful bad  lane crossed the station platform and the railroad yard and tracks to make a short cut in the direction of his home he shrank from meeting any one he had not sent word just when he would arrive though he had written his mother from new york that it would be soon he was glad that no one belonging to him had been at the station he wanted to see his mother in his home walking fast exhausted him and he had to rest how dead his legs felt in fact he felt queer all over the old burn and gnaw in his breast had expanded to a heavy full suffocating sensation yet his blood seemed to race suddenly an overwhelming emotion of rapture flooded over him home at last he did not think of any one he was walking across the railroad yards where as a boy he had been wont to steal rides on freight trains soon he reached the bridge in the gathering twilight he halted to clutch at the railing and look out across where the waters metwhere sycamore creek flowed into middleville river the roar of water falling over the dam came melodiously and stirringly to his ears and as he looked again he was assailed by that strange sense of littleness of shrunkenness which had struck him so forcibly at the station he listened to the murmur of running water then while the sweetness of joy pervaded him there seemed to rise from below or across the river or from somewhere the same strange misgiving a keener dread a chill that was not in the air a fatal portent of the future why should this come to mock him at such a sacred and beautiful moment  passersby stared at lane and some of them whispered and one hesitated as if impelled to speak wheeling away lane crossed the bridge turned up river street soon turned off again into a darker street and reaching high school park he sat down to rest again he was almost spent the park was quiet and lonely the bare trees showed their skeleton outlines against the cold sky it was march and the air was raw and chilly this park that had once been a wonderful place now appeared so small everything he saw was familiar yet grotesque in the way it had become dwarfed across the street from where he sat lights shone in the windows of a house he knew the place who lived there one of the girlshe had forgotten which from somewhere the discordance of a victrola jarred on lanes sensitive ears  lifting his bag he proceeded on his way halting every little while to catch his breath when he turned a corner into a side street recognizing every tree and gate and house there came a gathering and swelling of his emotions and he began to weaken and shake he was afraid he could not make it half way up the street but he kept on the torture now was more a mingled rapture and grief than the physical protest of his racked body at last he saw the modest little houseand then he stood at the gate quivering home a light in the window of his old room a terrible and tremendous storm of feeling forced him to lean on the gate how many endless hours had the pictured memory of that house haunted him there was the beloved room where he had lived and slept and read and cherished over his books and over his compositions a secret hope and ambition to make of himself an author how strange to remember that but it was true his day labor at mantons office for all the years since he had graduated from high school had been only a means to an end no one had dreamed of his dream then the war had come and now his hope if not his faith was dead never before had the realization been so galling so bitter endlessly and eternally he must be concerned with himself he had driven that habit of thought away a million times but it would return all he had prayed for was to get homeonly to reach home aliveto see his mother and his sister lornaand helenand then but he was here now and all that prayer was falsehood just to get home was not enough he had been cheated of career love happiness  it required extreme effort to cross the little yard to mount the porch in a moment more he would see his mother he heard her within somewhere at the back of the house wherefore he tiptoed round to the kitchen door here he paused quaking a cold sweat broke out all over him why was this return so dreadful he pressed a shaking hand over his heart how surely he knew he could not deceive his mother the moment she saw him after the first flash of joy she would see the wreck of the boy she had let go to war lane choked over his emotion but he could not spare her opening the door he entered  there she stood at the stove and she looked up at the sound he made yes but stranger than all other changes was the change in her she was not the mother of his boyhood nor was the change alone age or grief or wasted cheek the moment tore cruelly at lanes heart she did not recognize him swiftly but when she did  oh god daren my boy she whispered  mother     chapter ii   his mother divined what he knew and her embrace was so close almost fierce in its tenderness her voice so broken that lane could only hide his face over her and shut his eyes and shudder in an ecstasy god alone had omniscience to tell what his soul needed but something of it was embodied in home and mother  that first acute moment past he released her and she clung to his hands her face upturned her eyes full of pain and joy and womans searching power while she broke into almost incoherent speech and he responded in feeling though he caught little of the content of her words and scarcely knew what he was saying  then he reeled a little and the kitchen dimmed in his sight sinking into a chair and leaning on the table he fought his weakness he came close to fainting but he held on to his sense aware of his mother fluttering over him gradually the spell passed  mothermaybe im starved he said smiling at her  that practical speech released the strain and inspired his mother to action she began to bustle round the kitchen talking all the while lane watched her and listened and spoke occasionally once he asked about his sister lorna but his mother either did not hear or chose not to reply all she said was music to his ears yet not quite what his heart longed for he began to distrust this strange longing there was something wrong with his mind his faculties seemed too sensitive every word his mother uttered was news surprising unusual as if it emanated from a homeworld that had changed and presently she dropped into complaint at the hard times and the cost of everything  mother he interrupted i didnt blow my money ive saved nearly a years pay its yours  but daren youll need money she protested  not much and maybeill be strong enough to go to workpresently he said hopefully do you think manton will take me backhalf days at first  i have my doubts daren she replied soberly hattie wilson has your old job and i hear theyre pleased with her few of the boys got their places back  hattie wilson exclaimed lane why she was a kid in the eighth grade when i left home  yes my son but that was nearly three years ago and the children have sprung up like weeds wild weeds  well that tousleheaded wilson kid mused lane an uneasy conviction of having been forgotten dawned upon lane he remembered blair maynards bitter prophecy which he had been unable to accept  anyway daren are you able to work asked his mother  sure he replied lying cheerfully with a smile on his face not hard work just yet but i can do something  his mother did not share his enthusiasm she went on preparing the supper  how do you manage to get along inquired lane  lord only knows she replied sombrely it has been very hard when you left home i had only the interest on your fathers life insurance i sold the farm  oh no exclaimed lane with a rush of boyhood memories  i had to she went on i made that money help out for a long time then ii mortgaged this place things cost so terribly and lorna had to have so much more but shes just left school and gone to work that helps  lorna left school ejaculated lane incredulously why mother she was only a child thirteen years old when i left shell miss her education ill send her back  well son i doubt if you can make lorna do anything she doesnt want to do returned his mother she wanted to quit schoolto earn money whatever she was when you left home shes grown up now youll not know her  know lorna why mother dear i carried lornas picture all through the war  you wont know her returned mrs lane positively my boy these years so short to you have been ages here at home you will find your sisterdifferent from the little girl you left youll find all the girls you knew changedchanged i have given up trying to understand whats come over the world  howabout helen inquired lane with strange reluctance and shyness  helen who asked his mother  helen wrapp of course replied lane quickly in his surprise the girl i was engaged to when i left  ohi had forgotten she sighed  hasnt helen been here to see you  let me seewell now you tax mei think she did come onceright after you left  do youever see her he asked with slow heave of breast  yes now and then as she rides by in an automobile but she never sees me daren i dont know what youryourthat engagement means to you but i must tell youhelen wrapp doesnt conduct herself as if she were engaged still i dont know whats in the heads of girls today i can only compare the present with the past  lane did not inquire further and his mother did not offer more comment at the moment he heard a motor car out in front of the house a girls shrill voice in laughter the slamming of a cardoorthen light quick footsteps on the porch lane could look from where he sat to the front dooronly a few yards down the short hall the door opened a girl entered  thats lorna said lanes mother he grew aware that she bent a curious gaze upon his face  lane rose to his feet with his heart pounding and a strange sense of expectancy his little sister never during the endless months of drudgery strife and conflict and agony had he forgotten lorna not duty nor patriotism had forced him to enlist in the army before the draft it had been an ideal which he imagined he shared with the millions of american boys who entered the service too deep ever to be spoken of the barbarous and simian hun with his black record against belgian and french women should never set foot on american soil  in the lamplight lane saw this sister throw coat and hat on the banister come down the hall and enter the kitchen she seemed tall but her short skirt counteracted that effect her bobbed hair curly and rebellious of a rich brownred color framed a pretty face lane surely remembered but yet not the same he had carried away memory of a childs face and this was a womans it was bright piquant with darkly glancing eyes and vivid cheeks and carmine lips  oh hot dog if it isnt dare she squealed and with radiant look she ran into his arms  the moment or moments of that meeting between brother and sister passed leaving lane conscious of hearty welcome and a sense of unreality he could not at once adjust his mental faculties to an incomprehensible difference affecting everything  they sat down to supper and lane sick dazed weak found eating his first meal at home as different as everything else from what he had expected there had been no lack of warmth or love in lornas welcome but he suffered disappointment again for the hundredth time he put it aside and blamed his morbid condition nothing must inhibit his gladness  lorna gave lane no chance to question her she was eager voluble curious and most disconcertingly oblivious of a possible sensitiveness in lane  dare you look like a dead one she said did you get shot bayoneted gassed shellshocked and all the rest did you go over the top did you kill any germans gee did you get to ride in a warplane come across now and tell me  i guess abouteverything happened to meexcept going west returned lane but i dont want to talk about that im too glad to be home  whats that on your breast she queried suddenly pointing at the croix de guerre he wore  that lorna thats my medal  gee let me see she got up and came round to peer down closely to finger the decoration french i never saw one before daren havent you an american medal too  no  why not  my dear sister thats hard to say because i didnt deserve it most likely  she leaned back to gaze more thoughtfully at him  what did you get this for  its a long story some day ill tell you  are you proud of it  for answer he only smiled at her  its so long since the war ive forgotten so many things she said wonderingly then she smiled sweetly dare im proud of you  that was a moment in which his former emotion seemed to stir for her evidently she had lost track of something once memorable she was groping back for childish impressions it was the only indication of softness he had felt in her how impossible to believe lorna was only fifteen he could form no permanent conception of her but in that moment he sensed something akin to a sisters sympathy some vague and indefinable thought in her too big for her to grasp he never felt it again the serious sweet mood vanished  hot dog ive a brother with the croix de guerre ill swell up over that ill crow over some of these janes  thus she talked on while eating her supper and lane tried to eat while he watched her presently he moved his chair near to the stove lorna did not wait upon her mother it was the mother who did the waiting as silently she moved from table to stove  lornas waist was cut so low that it showed the swell of her breast the red color of her cheeks high up near her temples was not altogether the rosy line of health and youth her eyebrows were only faint thin curved lines oriental in effect she appeared to be unusually welldeveloped in body for so young a girl and the air of sophistication of experience that seemed a part of her manner completely mystified lane if it had not been for the slangy speech and the false color in her face he would have been amused at what he might have termed his little sisters posing as a woman of the world but in the light of these he grew doubtful of his impression lastly he saw that she wore her stockings rolled below her knees and that the edge of her short skirt permitted several inches of her bare legs to be seen and at that he did not know what to think he was stunned  daren you served a while under captain thesel in the war she said  yes i guess i did replied lane with sombre memory resurging  do you know he lives here  i knew him here in middleville several years before the war  hes danced with me at the armory some swell dancer he and dick swann and hardy maclean sometimes drop in at the armory on saturday nights captain thesel is chasing mrs clemhorn now theyre always together daren did he ever have it in for you  he never liked me we never got along here in middleville and naturally in the service when he was a captain and i only a privatewe didnt get along any better  well ive heard captain thesel was to blame forfor what was said about you last summer when he came home  and what was that lorna queried lane curiously puzzled at her and darkly conscious of the ill omen that had preceded him home  youll not hear it from me declared lorna spiritedly but that croix de guerre doesnt agree with it ill tell the world  a little frown puckered her smooth brow and there was a gleam in her eye  seems to me i heard some of the kids talking last summer she mused ponderingly vane thesel was stuck on mel iden and dot dalrymple both before the war dot handed him a lemon hes still trying to rush dot and the gossip is hed go after mel even now on the sly if shed stand for it  why on the sly inquired lane before i left home mel iden was about the prettiest and most popular girl in middleville her people were poor and ordinary perhaps but she was the equal of any one  thesel couldnt rush mel now and get away with it unless on the qt replied lorna havent you heard about mel  no you see the fact is my few correspondents rather neglected to send me news said lane  the significance of this was lost upon his sister she giggled hot dog youve got some kicks coming ill say  is that so returned lane with irritation a few more or less wont matter lorna do you know helen wrapp  that redheaded dame burst out lorna with heat i should smile i do shes one who doesnt shake a shimmy on tea believe me  lane was somewhat at a loss to understand his sisters intimation but as it was vulgarly inimical and seemed to hold some subtle personal scorn or jealousy he shrank from questioning her this talk with his sister was the most unreal happening he had ever experienced he could not adjust himself to its verity  helen wrapp is nutty about dick swann went on lorna she drives down to the office after  lorna do you know helen and i are engaged interrupted lane  hot dog was that young ladys exposition of utter amaze she stared at her brother  we were engaged continued lane she wore my ring when i enlisted she wanted me to marry her before i left but i wouldnt do that  lorna promptly recovered from her amaze well its a damn lucky thing you didnt take her up on that marriage stuff  there was a glint of dark youthful passion in lornas face lane felt rise in him a desire to bid her sharply to omit slang and profanity from the conversation but the desire faded before his bewilderment all had suffered change what had he come home to there was no clear answer but whatever it was he felt it to be enormous and staggering and he meant to find out weary as was his mind it grasped peculiar significances and deep portents  lorna where do you work he began shifting his interest  at swanns she replied  in the officeat the foundry he asked  no mr swanns at the head of the leather works  what do you do  i type letters she answered and rose to make him a little bow that held the movement and the suggestion of a dancer  youve learned stenography he asked in surprise  im learning shorthand replied lorna you see i had only a few weeks in business school before dick got me the job  dick swann do you work for him  no for the superintendent mr fryer but i go to dicks office to do letters for him some of the time  she appeared frank and nonchalant evidently a little proud of her important position she posed before lane and pirouetted with fancy little steps  say dare wont you teach me a new danceright from paris she interposed something that will put the shimmy and toddle out of biz  lorna i dont know what the shimmy and toddle are ive only heard of them  buried alive ill say she retorted  lane bit his tongue to keep back a hot reprimand he looked at his mother who was clearing off the supper table she looked sad the light had left her worn face lane did not feel sure of his ground here so he controlled his feelings and directed his interest toward more news  of course dick swann was in the service he asked  no he didnt go replied lorna  the information struck lane singularly dick swann had always been a prominent figure in the middleville battery in those seemingly long past years since before the war  why didnt dick go into the service why didnt the draft get him  he had poor eyesight and his father needed him at the iron works  poor eyesight ejaculated lane he was the best shot in the batterythe best hunter among the boys well thats funny  daren there are people who called dick swann a slacker returned lorna as if forced to give this information but i never saw that it hurt him hes rich now his uncle left him a million and his father will leave him another and ill say its the money people want these days  the materialism so pregnant in lornas half bitter reply checked lanes further questioning he edged closer to the stove feeling a little cold a shadow drifted across the warmth and glow of his mind at home now he was to be confronted with a monstrous and insupportable truththe craven cowardice of the man who had been eligible to service in army or navy and who had evaded it in camp and trench and dugout he had heard of the army of slackers and of all the vile and stark profanity which the war gave birth to on the lips of miserable and maimed soldiers that flung on the slackers was the worst  ive got a date to go to the movies said lorna and she bounced out of the kitchen into the hall singing               oh by heck              you never saw a wreck              like the wreck she made of me  she went upstairs while lane sat there trying to adapt himself to a new and unintelligible environment his mother began washing the dishes lane felt her gaze upon his face and he struggled against all the weaknesses that beset him  mother doesnt lorna help you with the house work he asked  she used to but not any more  do you let her go out at night to the moviesdances and all that  mrs lane made a gesture of helplessness lorna goes out all the time shes never here she stays out until midnightone oclocklater shes popular with the boys i couldnt stop her even if i wanted to girls cant be stopped these days i do all i can for hermake her dressesslave for herhoping shell find a good husband but the young men are not marrying  good heavens are you already looking for a husband for lorna broke out lane  you dont understand dare youve been away so long wait till youve seen what girlsare nowadays then youll not wonder that id like to see lorna settled  mother youre right he said gravely ive been away solong but im back home now ill soon get on to things and ill help you ill take lorna in hand ill relieve you of a whole lot  you were always a good boy daren to me and lorna murmured mrs lane almost in tears its cheered me to get you home yet oh if you were well and strong  never mind mother ill get better he replied rising to take up his bag i guess now id better go to bed im just about all in wonder how blair and red are  his mother followed him up the narrow stairway talking trying to pretend she did not see his dragging steps his clutch on the banisters  your rooms just as you left it she said opening the door then on the threshold she kissed him my son i thank god you have come home alive you give me hope inin spite of all if you need me call good night  lane was alone in the little room that had lived in waking and dreaming thought except to appear strangely smaller it had not changed his bed and deskthe old bureauthe few picturesthe bookcase he had built himselfthese were identical with images in his memory  a sweet and wonderful emotion of peace pervaded his soulfulfilment at last of the soldiers endless longing for home bed quiet rest  if i have to diei can do it now without hate of all around me he whispered in the passion of his spirit  but as he sat upon his bed trying with shaking and clumsy hands to undress himself that exalted mood flashed by some of the dearest memories of his life were associated with this little room here he had dreamed here he had read and studied here he had fought out some of the poignant battles of youth so much of life seemed behind him at last he got undressed and extinguishing the light he crawled into bed  the darkness was welcome and the quiet was exquisitely soothing he lay there staring into the blackness feeling his body sink slowly as if weighted how cool and soft the touch of sheets then the river of throbbing fire that was his blood seemed to move again and the dull ache deep in the bones possessed his nerves in his breast there began a vibrating as if thousands of tiny bubbles were being pricked to bursting in his lungs and the itch to cough came back to his throat and all his flesh seemed in contention with a slowly ebbing force sleep might come perhaps after pain had lulled his heart beat unsteadily and weakly sometimes with a strange little flutter how many weary interminable hours had he endured but tonight he was too far spent too far gone for long wakefulness he drifted away and sank as if into black oblivion where there sounded the dreadful roll of drums and images moved under gray clouds and men were running like phantoms he awoke from nightmares wet with cold sweat and lay staring again at the blackness once more alive to recurrent pain pain that was an old old story yet ever acute and insistent and merciless  the night wore on hour by hour the courthouse clock rang out one single deep mellow clang one oclock lane thrilled to the sound it brought back the school days the vacation days the indian summer days when the hills were golden and the purple haze hung over the landthe days that were to be no more for daren lane  in the distance somewhere a motorcar hummed and came closer louder down the street to slow its sound with sliding creak and jar outside in front of the house lane heard laughter and voices of a party of young people footsteps heavy and light came up the walk and on to the porch lorna was returning rather late from the motionpicture thought lane and he raised his head from the pillow to lean toward the open window listening  come across kiddo said a boys voice husky and low  lane heard a kissthen another  cheese it you boob  gee your gettin snippy say will you ride out to fleshers tomorrow night  nothing doing ive got a date good night  the hall door below opened and shut footsteps thumped off the porch and out to the street lane heard the giggle of girls the snap of a cardoor the creaking of wheels and then a low hum dying away  lorna came slowly up stairs to enter her room moving quietly and lane lay on his bed wideeyed staring into the blackness my little sister he whispered to himself and the words that had meant so much seemed a mockery     chapter iii   lane saw the casement of his window grow gray with the glimmering light of dawn after that he slept several hours when he awoke it was nine oclock the long night with its morbid dreams and thoughts had passed and in the sunshine of day he saw things differently  to move to get up was not an easy task it took stern will and all the strength of muscle he had left and when he finally achieved it there was a clammy dew of pain upon his face with slow guarded movements he began to dress himself any sudden or violent action might burst the delicate gassed spots in his lungs or throw out of place one of the lower vertebrae of his spine the former meant death and the latter bent his body like a letter s and caused such excruciating agony that it was worse than death these were his two everpresent perils the other aches and pains he could endure  he shaved and put on clean things and his best coat and surveyed himself in the little mirror he saw a thin face white as marble but he was not ashamed of it his story was there to read if any one had kind enough eyes to see what would helen think of himand margaret maynardand daland mel iden bitter curiosity seemed his strongest feeling concerning his fiancee he would hold her as engaged to him until she informed him she was not as for the others thought of them quickened his interest especially in mel what had happened to her  it was going to be wonderful to meet themand to meet everybody he had once known wonderful because he would see what the war had done to them and they would see what it had done to him a peculiar significance lay between his sister and helenall these girls and the fact of his having gone to war  they may not think of it but i know he muttered to himself and he sat down upon his bed to plan how best to meet them and others he did not know what he was going to encounter but he fortified himself against calamity strange portent of this had crossed the sea to haunt him as soon as he was sure of what had happened in middleville of the attitude people would have toward a crippled soldier and of what he could do with the month or year that might be left him to live then he would know his own mind all he sensed now was that there had been some monstrous inexplicable alteration in hope love life his ordeal of physical strife loneliness longing was now over for he was back home but he divined that his greater ordeal lay before him here in this little house and out there in middleville all the subtlety intelligence and bitter vision developed by the war sharpened here to confront him with terrible possibilities had his countrymen his people his friends his sweetheart all failed him was there justice in blair maynards scorn lanes faith cried out in revolt he augmented all possible catastrophe and then could not believe that he had sacrificed himself in vain he knew himself in him was embodied all the potentiality for hope of the future and it was with the front and stride of a soldier facing the mystery the ingratitude the ignorance and hell of war that he left his room and went down stairs to meet the evils in store  his mother was not in the kitchen the door stood open he heard her outside talking to a neighbor woman over the fence  daren looks dreadful his mother was saying in low voice he could hardly walk it breaks my heart im glad to have him alongbut to see him waste away day by day like mary deans boy she broke off  too bad its a pity replied the neighbor sadnow it comes home to us my son ted came in last night and said hed talked with a boy whod seen young maynard and the strange soldier who was with him they must be worse off than darenblair maynard with only one leg and  mother where are you im hungry called lane interrupting that conversation  she came hurriedly in at once fearful he might have heard and solicitous for his welfare  daren you look better in daylightnot so white she said you sit down now and let me get your breakfast  lane managed to eat a little this morning which fact delighted his mother  im going to see dr bronson said lane presently then ill go to mantons and round town a little and if i dont tire out ill call on helen of course lorna has gone to work  oh yes she leaves at half after eight  mother i was awake last night when she got home went on lane seriously it was one oclock she came in a car i heard girls tittering and some boy came up on the porch with lorna and kissed her well that might not mean muchbut something about their talk the way it was donemakes me pretty sick did you know this sort of thing was going on  yes and ive talked with mothers who have girls lornas age theyve all run wild the last year or so dances and rides last summer i was worried half to death but we mothers dont think the girls are really bad theyre just crazy for fun excitement boys times and pleasures have changed the girls say the mothers dont understand maybe we dont i try to be patient i trust lorna i cant see through it all  dont worry mother said lane patting her hand ill see through it for you and if lorna iswell running too muchwild as you saidill stop her  his mother shook her head  one thing we mothers all agree on these girls of this generation say fourteen to sixteen cant be stopped  then that is a serious matter it must be a peculiarity of the day maybe the war left this condition  the war changed all things my son replied his mother sadly  lane walked thoughtfully down the street toward doctor bronsons office as long as he walked slowly he managed not to give any hint of his weakness the sun was shining with steely brightness and the march wind was living up to its fame he longed for summer and hot days in quiet woods or fields where daisies bloomed would he live to see the indian summer days the smoky haze the purple asters  lane was admitted at once into the office of doctor bronson a little gray slight man with shrewd kind eyes and a thoughtful brow for years he had been a friend as well as physician to the lanes and he had always liked daren his surprise was great and his welcome warm but a moment later he gazed at lane with piercing eyes  look here boy did you go to the bad over there he demanded  how do you mean doctor  did you let downdebase yourself morally  no but i went to the bad physically and spiritually  i see that i dont like the color of your face well well daren it was hell wasnt it did you kill a couple of huns for me  questions like this latter one always alienated lane in some unaccountable way it must have been revealed in his face  never mind daren i see that you did im glad youre back alive now what can i do for you  ive been discharged from three hospitals in the last two monthsnot because i was well but because i was in better shape than some other poor devil those doctors in the service grew hardthey had to be hardbut they saw the worst the agony of the war i always felt sorry for them they never seemed to eat or sleep or rest they had no time to save a man it was cut him up or tie him upthen on to the next now doc i want you to look me over andwelltell me what to expect  all right replied doctor bronson gruffly  and i want you to promise not to tell mother or any one will you  yes i promise now come in here and get off some of your clothes  doctor its pretty tough on me to get in and out of my clothes  ill help you now tell me what the germans did to you  lane laughed grimly doctor do you remember i was in your sunday school class  yes i remember that whats it got to do with germans  nothing it struck me funny thats all well to get it over i was injured several times at the training camp  anything serious  no i guess not anyway i forgot about them doctor i was shot four times once clear through ill show you got a bad bayonet jab that doesnt seem to heal well then i had a dose of both gaseschlorine and mustardand both all but killed me last ive a weak place in my spine theres a vertebra that slips out of place occasionally the least movement may do it i cant guard against it the last time it slipped out i was washing my teeth im in mortal dread of this for it twists me out of shape and hurts horribly im afraid itll give me paralysis  humph it would but it can be fixed so thats all they did to you  underneath the dry humor of the little doctor lane thought he detected something akin to anger  yes thats all they did to my body replied lane  doctor bronson during a careful and thorough examination of lanes heart lungs blood pressure and abdominal region did not speak once but when he turned him over to see and feel the hole in lanes back he exclaimed my god boy what made thisa shell i can put my fist in it  thats the bayonet jab  doctor bronson cursed in a most undignified and unprofessional manner then without further comment he went on and completed the examination  thatll do he said and lent a hand while lane put on his clothes it was then he noticed lanes medal  ha the croix de guerre daren i was a friend of your fathers i know how that medal would have made him feel tell me what you did to get it  nothing much replied lane stirred it was in the argonne when we took to open fighting in fact i got most of my hurts there i carried a badly wounded french officer back off the field he was a heavy man thats where i injured my spine i had to run with him and worse luck he was dead when i got him back but i didnt know that  so the french decorated you hey asked the doctor leaning back with hands on hips and keenly eyeing lane  yes  why did not the american army give you equal honor  well for one thing it was never reported and besides it wasnt anything any other fellow wouldnt do  doctor bronson dropped his head and paced to and fro then the doorbell rang in the reception room  daren lane began the doctor suddenly stopping before lane id hesitate to ask most men if they wanted the truth to many men id lie but i know a few words from me cant faze you  no doctor one way or another it is all the same to me  well boy i can fix up that vertebra so it wont slip out again but if theres anything in the world to save your life i dont know what it is  thank you doctor itssomething to knowwhat to expect returned lane with a smile  you might live a yearand you might not you might improve god only knows miracles do happen anyway come back to see me  lane shook hands with him and went out passing another patient in the reception room then as lane opened the door and stepped out upon the porch he almost collided with a girl who evidently had been about to come in  i beg your he began and stopped he knew this girl but the strained tragic shadow of her eyes was strikingly unfamiliar the transparent white skin let the blue tracery of veins show on the instant her lips trembled and parted  oh darendont you know me she asked  mel iden he burst out know you i should smile i do but itit was so sudden and youre olderdifferent somehow mel youre sweeterwhy youre beautiful  he clasped her hands and held on to them until he felt her rather nervously trying to withdraw them  oh daren im glad to see you homealivewhole she said almost in a whisper are youwell  no mel im in pretty bad shape he replied lucky to get home aliveto see you all  im sorry youre so white youre wonderfully changed daren  so are you but ill say im happy its not painted face and plucked eyebrows mel whats happened to you  she suddenly espied the decoration on his coat the blood rose and stained her clear cheek with a gesture of exquisite grace and sensibility that thrilled lane she touched the medal oh the croix de guerre daren you were a hero  no mel just a soldier  she looked up into his face with eyes that fascinated lane so beautiful were theythe blue of cornflowersand lighted then with strange rapt glow  just a soldier she murmured but lane heard in that all the sweetness and understanding possible for any womans heart she amazed himheld him spellbound here was the sympathyand something elsea nameless needfor which he yearned the moment was fraught with incomprehensible forces lanes sore heart responded to her rapt look to the sudden strange passion of her pale face swiftly he divined that mel iden gloried in the presence of a maimed and proven soldier  mel ill come to see you he said breaking the spell do you still live out on the hill road i remember the four big white oaks  no daren ive left home she said with slow change as if his words recalled something she had forgotten all the radiance vanished leaving her singularly white  left home what for he asked bluntly  father turned me out she replied with face averted the soft roundness of her throat swelled lane saw her full breast heave under her coat  whatre you saying mel iden he demanded as quickly as he could find his voice  then she turned bravely to meet his gaze and lane had never seen as sad eyes as looked into his  daren havent you heardabout me she asked with tremulous lips  no whats wrong  ii cant let you call on me  why not are you marriedjealous husband  no im not marriedbut ii have a baby she whispered  mel gasped lane a war baby  yes  lane was so shocked he could not collect his scattered wits let alone think of the right thing to say if there were any right thing mel this is aa terrible surprise oh im sorry how the war played hell with all of us but for youmel ideni cant believe it  daren so terribly true she said dont i look it  mel you lookohheartbroken  yes i am brokenhearted she replied and drooped her head  forgive me mel i hardly know what im saying but listenim coming to see you  no she said  that trenchant word was thoughtprovoking a glimmer of understanding began to dawn in lane already an immense pity had flooded his soul and a profound sense of the mystery and tragedy of mel iden she had always been unusual aloof proud unattainable a girl with a heart of golden fire and now she had a nameless child and was an outcast from her fathers house the fact the fatality of it stunned lane  daren i must go in to see dr bronson she said im glad youre home im proud of you im happy for your mother and lorna you must watch lornatry to restrain her shes going wrong all the young girls are going wrong oh its a more dreadful time now than before or during the war the letdown has been terrible goodbye daren  in other days mantons building on main street had appeared a pretentious one to lanes untraveled eyes it was an old threestory redbrickfront edifice squatted between higher and more modern structures when he climbed the dirty dark stairway up to the second floor a throng of memories returned with the sensations of creaky steps musty smell and dim light when he pushed open a door on which manton  co showed in black letters he caught his breath longlong past was it possible that he had been penned up for three years in this stifling place  manton carried on various lines of business and for middleville he was held to be something of a merchant and broker lane was wholly familiar with the halls the several lettered doors the large unpartitioned office at the back of the building here his slow progress was intercepted by a slip of a girl who asked him what he wanted before answering lane took stock of the girl she might have been all of fifteenno older she had curly bobbed hair and a face that would have been comely but for the powder and rouge she was chewing gum and she ogled lane  i want to see mr manton lane said  what name please  daren lane  she tripped off toward the door leading to mantons private offices and lanes gaze curiously following her found her costume to be startling even to his expectant eyes then she disappeared lanes gaze sought the corner and desk that once upon a time had been his a blond young lady also with bobbed hair was operating a typewriter at his desk she glanced up and espying lane she suddenly stopped her work she recognized him but if she were hattie wilson it was certain that lane did not recognize her then the office girl returned  step this way please mr smith will see you  how singularly it struck lane that not once in three years had he thought of smith but when he saw him the intervening months were as nothing lean spare pallid with baggy eyes and the nose of a drinker smith had not changed  how do lane so youre back welcome to our city he said extending a nerveless hand that felt to lane like a dead fish  hello mr smith yes im back returned lane taking the chair smith indicated and then he met the inevitable questions as best he could in order not to appear curt or uncivil  id like to see mr manton to ask for my old job interposed lane presently  hes busy now lane but maybe hell see you ill find out  smith got up and went out lane sat there with a vague sense of absurdity in the situation the click of a typewriter sounded from behind him he wanted to hurry out he wanted to think of other things and twice he drove away memory of the girl he had just left at doctor bronsons office presently smith returned slipping along in his shiny black suit flatfooted and slightly bowed with his set dull expression  lane mr manton asks you to please excuse him hes extremely busy said smith i told him that you wanted your old job back and he instructed me to tell you he had been put to the trouble of breaking in a girl to take your place she now does the work you used to havevery satisfactorily mr manton thinks and at less pay so of course a change is impossible  i see returned lane slowly as he rose to go i had an idea that might be the case im finding thingsa little different  no doubt lane you fellows who went away left us to make the best of it  yes smith we fellows went away replied lane with satire and im finding out the fact wasnt greatly appreciated good day  on the way out the little office girl opened the door for him and ogled him again and stood a moment on the threshold ponderingly lane made his way down to the street a rush of cool spring air seemed to refresh him and with it came a realization that he never would have been able to stay cooped up in mantons place even if his services had been greatly desired he could not have given them for long he could not have stood that place this was a new phase of his mental condition work almost anywhere in middleville would be like that in mantons could he stand work at all not only in a physical sense but in application of mind he began to worry about that  some one hailed lane and he turned to recognize an old acquaintancematt jones they walked along the street together meeting other men who knew lane some of whom greeted him heartily then during an ensuing hour he went into familiar stores and the postoffice the hotel and finally the bradford inn meeting many people whom he had known well the sum of all their greetings left him in cold amaze at length lane grasped the subtle importthat people were tired of any one or anything which reminded them of the war he tried to drive that thought from lodgment in his mind but it stuck and slowly he gathered the forces of his spirit to make good the resolve with which he had faced this dayto withstand an appalling truth  at the inn he sat before an open fire and pondered between brief conversations of men who accosted him on the one hand it was extremely trying and on the other a fascinating and grim studyto meet people and find that he could read their minds had the war given him some magic sixth sense some clairvoyant power some gift of vision he could not tell yet what had come to him but there was something  business men halting to chat with lane a few moments helped along his readjustment to the truth of the strange present almost all kinds of business were booming most people had money to spend and there was a multitude made rich by the war who were throwing money to the four winds prices of every commodity were at their highest peak and supply could not equal demand an orgy of spending was in full swing and all men in business especially the profiteers were making the most of the unprecedented opportunity  after he had rested lane boarded a street car and rode out to the suburbs of middleville where the maynards lived although they had lost their money they still lived in the substantial mansion that was all which was left them of prosperous days house and grounds now appeared sadly run down  a maid answered lanes ring and let him in lane found himself rather nervously expecting to see mrs maynard the old house brought back to him the fact that he had never liked her but he wanted to see margaret it turned out however that mother and daughter were out  come up old top called blairs voice from the hall above  so lane went up to blairs room which he remembered almost as well as his own though now it was in disorder blair was in his shirt sleeves he looked both gay and spent red payson was in bed and his face bore the hectic flush of fever  aw hes only had too much to eat declared blair in answer to lanes solicitation  hows that red asked lane sitting down on the bed beside payson  its nothing dare im just all in replied red with a weary smile  i telephoned doc bronson to come out said blair and look us over that made red as sore as a pup isnt he the limit by thunder you cant do anything for some people  blairs tone and words of apparent vexation were at variance with the kindness of his eyes as they rested upon his sick comrade  i just came from bronsons observed lane hes been our doctor for as long as i can remember  both lanes comrades searched his face with questioning eyes and while lane returned that gaze there was a little constrained silence  bronson examined meand said id live to be eighty added lane with dry humor  youre a liar burst out blair  on red paysons worn face a faint smile appeared carry on dare  then blair fell to questioning lane as to all the news he had heard and people he had met  so manton turned you down cold said blair ponderingly  i didnt get to see him replied lane he sent out word that my old job was held by a girl who did my work better and at less pay  the blood leaped to blairs white cheek  whatd you say he queried  nothing much i just trailed out but the truth is blairi couldnt have stood that placenot for a day  i get you rejoined blair that isnt the point though i always wondered if wed find our old jobs open to us of course i couldnt fill mine now it was an outside joblots of walking  so the conversation seesawed back and forth with red payson listening in languid interest  have you seen any of the girls asked blair  i met mel iden replied lane  you did what did she  mel told me what explained some of your hints  ahuh poor mel howd she look  greatly changed replied lane thoughtfully how do you remember mel  well she was prettysoulful facewonderful smilethat sort of thing  shes beautiful now and sad  i shouldnt wonder and she told you right out about the baby  no that came out when she said i couldnt call on her and i wanted to know why  but youll go anyhow  yes  so will i returned blair with spirit dare ive known for over a year about mels disgrace you used to like her and i hated to tell you if it had been helen id have told you in a minute but mel well i suppose we must expect queer things i got a jolt this morning i was pumping my sister margie about everybody and of course mels name came up you remember margie and mel were as thick as two peas in a pod looks like mels fall has hurt margie but i dont just get margie yet she might be another fellows sisterfor all the strangeness of her  i hardly knew my kid sister responded lane  ahuh the plot thickens well i couldnt get much out of marg she used to babble everything but what little she told me made up inin shock for what it lacked in volume  tell me said lane as his friend paused  nothing doing  and turning to the sick boy on the bed he remarked red you neednt let thisthis gab of ours bother you this is home talk between a couple of boobs whore burying their illusions in the grave you didnt leave a sister or a lot of old schoolgirl sweethearts behind to  what the hell do you know about whom i left behind retorted red with a swift blaze of strange passion  oh say redii beg your pardon i was only kidding responded blair in surprise and contrition you never told me a word about yourself  for answer red payson rolled over wearily and turned his back  blair ill beat it and let red go to sleep said lane taking up his hat red goodbye this time i hope youll be better soon  imsorry lane came in muffled tones from payson  cut that out boy youve nothing to be sorry for forget it and cheer up  blair hobbled downstairs after lane dont go just yet dare  they found seats in the parlor that appeared to be the same shabby genteel place where lane had used to call upon blairs sister  what ails red queried lane bluntly  lord only knows hes a queer duck once in a while he lets out a crack like that theres a lot to red  blair his heart is broken said lane tragically  well exclaimed blair with quick almost haughty uplift of head he seemed to resent lanes surprise and intimation it was a rebuke that made lane shrink  i never thought of reds being hurtyou knowor as having lost oh he just seemed like so many other boys ruined in health i  all right cut the sentiment interrupted blair the fact is red is more of a problem than we had any idea hed be and dare listen to thisim ashamed to have to tell you mother raised old harry with me this morning for fetching red home she couldnt see it my way she said there were hospitals for sick soldiers who hadnt homes i lost my temper and i said the hell of it mother is that theres nothing of the kind  she said we couldnt keep him here i tried to coax her margie helped but nothing doing  blair had spoken hurriedly with again a stain of red in his white cheek and a break in his voice  thatstough replied lane haltingly he could choke back speech but not the something in his voice he would rather not have heard ill tell you what as soon as red is well enough well move him over to my house im sure mother will let him share my room theres only lornaand ill pay reds board you have quite a family  hell daredont apologize to me for my mother burst out blair bitterly  blair i believe you realize what we are up againstand i dont rejoined lane with level gaze upon his friend  dare cant you see were up against worse than the argonneworse because back here at homethat beautiful glorious thoughtideaspirit we had is gone dead  no i cant see returned lane stubbornly  well i guess thats one reason we all loved you dareyou couldnt see but ill bet you my crutch helen makes you see her father made a pile out of the war shes a warrich snob now and going the pace  blair she may make me see her faithlessnessand perhaps some strange unrestsome change thats seemed to come over everything but she cant prove to me the death of anything outside of herself she cant prove that any more than mel idens confession proved her a wanton it didnt not to me why when mel put her hand on my breaston this medaland looked at mei had such a thrill as i never had before in all my life never blair its not dead that beautiful thing you mentionedthat spiritthat fire which burned so gloriouslyit is not dead  not in youold pard replied blair unsteadily im always ashamed before your faith and by god ill say youre my only anchor  blair lets play the game out to the end said lane  i get you dare for margie for lorna for meleven if they have  yes answered lane as blair faltered     chapter iv   as lane sped out elm street in a taxicab he remembered that his last ride in such a conveyance had been with helen when he took her home from a party she was then about seventeen years old and that night she had coaxed him to marry her before he left to go to war had her feminine instinct been infallibly right would marrying her have saved her from what blair had so forcibly suggested  elm street was a newly developed part of middleville high on one of its hills and manifestly a restricted section lane had found the number of helens home in the telephone book when the chauffeur stopped before a new and imposing pile of red brick lane understood an acquaintances reference to the war rich it was a mansion but somehow not a home it flaunted something indefinable  lane instructed the driver to wait a few moments and if he did not come out to go back to town and return in about an hour the house stood rather far from the street and as lane mounted the terrace he observed four motor cars parked in the driveway also his sensitive ears caught the sound of a phonograph  a maid answered his ring lane asked for both mrs wrapp and helen they were at home the maid informed him and ushered lane into a gray and silver reception room lane had no card but gave his name as he gazed around the room he tried to fit the delicate decorative scheme to mrs wrapp he smiled at the idea but he remembered that she had always liked him in spite of the fact that she did not favor his attention to helen like many mothers of girls she wanted a rich marriage for her daughter manifestly now she had money but had happiness come with prosperity  then mrs wrapp came down rising he turned to see a large woman elaborately gowned she had a heavy rather goodnatured face on which was a smile of greeting  daren lane she exclaimed with fervor and to his surprise she kissed him there was no doubt of her pleasure lanes thin armor melted he had not anticipated such welcome oh im glad to see you soldier boy but youre a man now daren youre white and thin handsomer though sit down and talk to me a little  her kindness made his task easy  ive called to pay my respects to youand to see helen he said  of course but talk to me first she returned with a smile youll find me better company than that crowd upstairs tell me about yourself oh i know soldiers hate to talk about themselves and the war never mind the war are you well did you get hurt you look soso frail daren  there was something simple and motherly about her that became her and warmed lanes cold heart he remembered that she had always preferred boys to girls and regretted she had not been the mother of boys so lane talked to her glad to find that the most ordinary news of the service and his comrades interested her very much the instant she espied his croix de guerre he seemed lifted higher in her estimation yet she had the delicacy not to question him about that in fact after ten minutes with her lane had to reproach himself for the hostility with which he had come at length she rose with evident reluctance  you want to see helen shall i send her down here or will you go up to her studio  i think id like to go up replied lane  if i were you i would advised mrs wrapp id like your opinionof well what youll see since you left home daren weve been turned topsyturvy im oldfashioned i cant get used to these goingson these young people get my goat as helen expresses it  im hopelessly behind the times ive seen that already rejoined lane  daren i respect you for it there was a time when i objected to your courting helen but i couldnt see into the future im sorry now she broke her engagement to you  ithank you mrs wrapp said lane with agitation but of course helen was right she was too young and even if she had beenbeen true to mei would have freed her upon my return  indeed and why daren  because ill never be well again he replied sadly  boy dont say that she appealed with a hand going to his shoulder  in the poignancy of the moment lane lost his reserve and told her the truth of his condition even going so far as to place her hand so she felt the great bayonet hole in his back her silence then was more expressive than any speech she had the look of a woman in whom conscience was a reality and lane divined that she felt she and her daughter and all other women of this distraught land owed him and his comrades a debt which could never be paid for once she expressed dignity and sweetness and genuine sorrow  you shock me daren but words are useless i hope and pray youre wrong but right or wrongyoure a real americanlike our splendid forefathers thank god that spirit still survives it is our only hope  lane crossed to the window and looked out slowly conscious of resurging selfcontrol it was well that he had met mrs wrapp first for she gave him what he needed his bleeding vanity his pride trampled in the dirt his betrayed faith his unquenchable spirit of hope for some farfuture goodthese were not secrets he could hide from every one  daren said mrs wrapp as he again turned to her if i were in my daughters place id beg you to take me back and if you would id never leave your side for an hour until you were well oror gone but girls now are possessed of some infernal frenzy god only knows how far they go but im one mother who is no fool i see little sign of real love in helen or any of her friends and the men who lounge around after her walk upstairsback to the end of the long hallopen the door and go in youll find helen and some of her associates youll find the men young sleek soft wellfedwithout any of the scars or ravages of war they didnt go to war they live for their bodies and i hate these slackers so does helens father and for three years our house has been a rendezvous for them weve prospered but that has been bitter fruit  strong elemental passions lane had seen and felt in people during the short twentyfour hours since his return home all of them had stung and astounded him flung into his face the hard brutal facts of the materialism of the present surely it was an abnormal condition and yet from the last quarter where he might have expected to find uplift and the crystallizing of his attitude toward the world and the sharpening of his intelligencefrom the hard grim mother of the girl who had jilted him these had come it was in keeping with all the other mystery  on second thought ill go up with you continued mrs wrapp as he moved in the direction she had indicated come  the wide hall the winding stairway with its soft carpet the narrower hallway abovethese made a long journey for lane but at the end when mrs wrapp stopped with hand on the farthest door lane felt knit like cold steel  the discordant music and the soft shuffling of feet ceased laughter and murmur of voices began  come daren whispered mrs wrapp as if thrilled certainly her eyes gleamed then quickly she threw the door open wide and called out  helen heres daren lane home from the war wearing the croix de guerre  mrs wrapp pushed lane forward and stood there a moment in the sudden silence then stepping back she went out and closed the door  lane saw a large welllighted room with colorful bizarre decorations and a bare shiny floor the first person his glance encountered was a young girl strikingly beautiful facing him with red lips parted she had violet eyes that seemed to have a startled expression as they met lanes next lane saw a slim young man standing close to this girl in the act of withdrawing his arm from around her waist apparently with his free hand he had either been lowering a smoking cigarette from her lips or had been raising it there this hand too dropped down lane did not recognize the fellows smooth smug face with its tiny curled mustache and its heated swollen lines  look whos here shouted a gay vibrant voice if it isnt old dare lane  that voice drew lanes fixed gaze and he saw a group in the far corner of the room one man was standing another was sitting beside a lounge upon which lay a young woman amid a pile of pillows she rose lazily and as she slid off the lounge lane saw her skirt come down and cover her bare knees her red hair bobbed and curly marked her for recognition it was helen but lane doubted if he would have at once recognized any other feature the handsome insolence of her face was belied by a singularly eager and curious expression her eyes almost green in line swept lane up and down and came back to his face while she extended her hands in greeting  helen how are you said lane with a cool intent mastery of himself bowing over her hands surprised to see me  well ill say so daren youve changed she replied and the latter part of her speech flashed swiftly  rather he said laconically what would you expect so have you changed  there came a moments pause helen was not embarrassed or agitated but something about lane or the situation apparently made her slow or stiff  daren youof course you remember hardy mackay and dick swann she said  lane turned to greet onetime schoolmates and rivals of his mackay was tall homely with a face that lacked force light blue eyes and thick sandy hair brushed high swann was slight elegant faultlessly groomed and he had a dark sallow face heavy lips heavy eyelids eyes rather prominent and of a winedark hue to lane he did not have a clean virile look  in their greetings lane sensed some indefinable quality of surprise or suspense swann rather awkwardly put out his hand but lane ignored it the blood stained swanns sallow face and he drew himself up  and daren here are other friends of mine said helen and she turned him round bessy this is daren lane miss bessy bell as lane acknowledged the introduction he felt that he was looking at the prettiest girl he had ever seenthe girl whose violet eyes had met his when he entered the room  mr daren lane im very happy to meet some one from over there she said with the ease and selfpossession of a woman of the world but when she smiled a beautiful wonderful light seemed to shine from eyes and face and lipsa smile of youth  helen introduced her companion as roy vancey then she led lane to the far corner to another couple manifestly disturbed from their rather close and familiar position in a window seat these also were strangers to lane they did not get up and they were not interested in fact lane was quick to catch an impression from all possibly excepting miss bell that the courtesy of drawing rooms such as he had been familiar with as a young man was wanting in this atmosphere lane wondered if it was antagonism toward him helen drew lane back toward her other friends to the lounge where she seated herself if the situation had disturbed her equilibrium in the least the moment had passed she did not care what lane thought of her guests or what they thought of him but she seemed curious about him bessy bell came and sat beside her watching lane  daren do you dance queried helen you used to be good but dancing is not the same its all foxtrot toddle shimmy nowadays  im afraid my dancing days are over replied lane  how so i see you came back with two legs and arms  yes but i was shot twice through one legits about all i can do to walk now  following his easy laugh a little silence ensued helens green eyes seemed to narrow and concentrate on lane dick swann inhaled a deep draught of his cigarette then let the smoke curl up from his lips to enter his nostrils mackay rather uneasily shifted his feet and bessy bell gazed with wonderful violet eyes at lane  oh you were shot she whispered  yes replied lane and looked directly at her prompted by her singular tone a glance was enough to show lane that this very young girl was an entirely new type to him she seemed to vibrate with intensity all the graceful lines of her body seemed strangely instinct with pulsing life she was bottled lightning in a flash lane sensed what made her different from the fifteenyearolds he remembered before the war it was what made his sister lorna different he felt it in helens scrutiny of him in the speculation of her eyes then bessy bell leaned toward lane and softly reverently touched the medal upon his breast  the croix de guerre she said in awe thats the french badge of honor it means you must have done something great you must havekilled germans  bessy sank back upon the lounge clasping her hands and her eyes appeared to darken to turn purple with quickening thought and emotion her exclamation brought the third girl of the party over to the lounge she was all eyes her apathy had vanished she did not see the sulky young fellow who had followed her  lane could have laughed aloud he read the shallow souls of these older girls they could not help their instincts and he had learned that it was instinctive with women to become emotional over soldiers bessy bell was a child heroworship shone from her speaking eyes whatever other young men might be to her no one of them could compare with a soldier  the situation had its pathos its tragedy and its gratification for lane he saw clearly and felt with the acuteness of a woman helen had jilted him for such young men as these so in the feeling of the moment it cost him nothing to thrill and fascinate these girls with the story of how he had been shot through the leg it pleased him to see helens green eyes dilate to see bessy bell shudder presently lane turned to speak to the supercilious swann  i didnt have the luck to run across you in france he queried  no i didnt go replied swann  how was that didnt the draft get you  yes but my eyes were bad and my father needed me at the works we had a big army contract in steel  oh i see returned lane with a subtle alteration of manner he could not did not want to control but it was unmistakable in its detachment next his gaze on mackay did not require the accompaniment of a query  i was under weight they wouldnt accept me he explained  bessy bell looked at mackay disdainfully why didnt you drink a bucketful of watersame as billy means did he got in  helen laughed gayly what mac drink water hed be ill come lets dance dick put on that new one daren you can watch us dance  swann did as he was bidden and as a loud violent discordance blared out of the machine he threw away his cigarette and turned to helen she seemed to leap at him she had a pantherish grace swann drew her closely to him with his arm all the way round her while her arm encircled his neck they began a fast swaying walk in which swann appeared to be forcing the girl over backwards they swayed and turned and glided they made strange abrupt movements in accordance with the jerky tune they halted at the end of a walk to make little steps forward and back then they began to bounce and sway together in a motion that lane instantly recognized as a toddle lane remembered the onestep the foxtrot and other new dances of an earlier day when the craze for new dancing had become general but this sort of gyration was vastly something else it disgusted lane he felt the blood surge to his face he watched helen wrapp in the arms of swann and he realized whatever had been the state of his heart on his return home he did not love her now even if the war had not disrupted his mind in an unaccountable way even if he had loved helen wrapp right up to that moment such singular abandonment to a distorted strange music to the close and unmistakably sensual embrace of a manthat spectacle would have killed his love  lane turned his gaze away the young fellow vancey was pulling at bessy bell and she shook his hand off no roy i dont want to dance lane heard above the jarring stringing notes mackay was smoking and looked on as if bored in a moment more the victrola rasped out its last note  helens face was flushed and moist her bosom heaved her gown hung closely to her lissom and rather full form a singular expression of excitement of titillation almost wild a softer expression almost dreamy died out of her face lane saw swann lead helen up to a small table beside the victrola here stood a large pitcher of lemonade and a number of glasses swann filled a glass half full from the pitcher and then deliberately pulling a silver flask from his hip pocket he poured some of its dark red contents into the glass helen took it from him and turned to lane with a halfmocking glance  daren i remember you never drank she said maybe the war made a man of you will you have a sip of lemonade with a shot in it  no thank you replied lane  didnt you drink over there she queried  only when i had to he rejoined shortly  all of the four dancers partook of a drink of lemonade strengthened by something from swanns flask lane was quick to observe that when it was pressed upon bessy bell she refused to take it i hate booze she said with a grimace his further impression of bessy bell then was that she had just fallen in with this older crowd and sophisticated though she was had not yet been corrupted the divination of this heightened his interest  well daren you old prune whatd you think of the toddle asked helen as she took a cigarette offered by swann and tipped it between her red lips  is that what you danced  ill say so and dick and i are considered pretty spiffy  i dont think much of it helen replied lane deliberately if you care toto do that sort of thing id imagine youd rather do it alone  oh lord you talk like mother she exclaimed  lane youre out of date said swann with a little sneer  lane took a long steady glance at swann but did not reply  daren everybody has been dancing jazz its the rage the old dances were slow the new ones have pep and snap  so i see they have more than that returned lane but pray never mind me im out of date go ahead and dance if youd rather ill leave and call on you some other time  no you stay she replied ill chase this bunch pretty soon  well you wont chase me ill go spoke up swann sullenly with a fling of his cigarette  you neednt hurt yourself returned helen sarcastically  so long people said swann to the others but it was perfectly obvious that he did not include lane it was also obvious at least to lane that swann showed something of intolerance and mastery in the dark sullen glance he bestowed upon helen she followed him across the room and out into the hall from whence her guarded voice sounded unintelligibly but lanes keen ear despite the starting of the victrola caught swanns equally low yet clearer reply you cant kid me im on youll vamp lane if he lets you go to it  as helen came back into the room mackay ran for her and locking her in the same embraceeven a tighter one than swannshe fell into the strange steps that had so shocked lane moreover he was manifestly a skilful dancer and showed the thin lithe supple body of one trained down by this or some other violent exercise  lane did not watch the dancers this time again bessy bell refused to get up from the lounge the youth was insistent he pawed at her and manifestly she did not like that for her face flamed and she snapped stop ityou bonehead cant you see i want to sit here by mr lane  the youth slouched away fuming to himself  whereupon lane got up and seated himself beside bessy so that he need not shout to be heard  that was nice of you miss bellbut rather hard on the youngster said lane  he makes me sick all he wants to do is lollygag besides after what you said to helen about the jazz i wouldnt dance in front of you on a bet  she was forceful frank naive she was impressed by his nearness but lane saw that it was the fact of his being a soldier with a record not his mere physical propinquity that affected her she seemed both bold and shy but she did not show any modesty her short skirt came above her bare knees and she did not try to hide them from lanes sight at fifteen like his sister lorna this girl had the development of a young woman she breathed health and something elusive that lane could not catch if it had not been for her apparent lack of shame and her rouged lips and cheeks and her plucked eyebrows she would have been exceedingly alluring but no beauty however striking could under these circumstances stir lanes heart he was fascinated puzzled intensely curious  why wouldnt you dance jazz in front of me he inquired with a smile  well for one thing im not stuck on it and for another ill say you said a mouthful  is that all he asked as if disappointed  no id respect what you saidbecause of where youve been and what youve done  it was a reply that surprised lane  im out of date you know  she put a finger on the medal on his breast and said you could never be out of date  the music and the sliding shuffle ceased  now beat it said helen i want to talk to daren she gayly shoved the young people ahead of her in a mass and called to bessy here you kid vamp lay off daren  bessy leaned to whisper in his ear make a date with me quick  surely ill hunt you up goodbye  she was the only one who made any pretension of saying goodbye to lane they all crowded out before helen with mackay in the rear from the hall lane heard him say to helen dickll sure go to the mat with you for this  presently helen returned to shut the door behind her and her walk toward lane had a suggestion of the oriental dancer for lane her face was a study this seemed a woman beyond his comprehension she was the helen wrapp he had known and loved plus an age of change a measureless experience with that swaying sinuous pantherish grace with her green eyes narrowed and gleaming half mocking half serious she glided up to him close closer until she pressed against him and her face was uplifted under his then she waited with her eyes gazing into his slumberous green depths slowly lighting they seemed to lane her presence thus her brazen challenge affected him powerfully but he had no thrill  arent you going to kiss me she asked  helen why didnt you write me you had broken our engagement he counterqueried  the question disconcerted her somewhat drawing back from close contact with him she took hold of his sleeves and assumed a naive air of groping in memory she used her eyes in a way that lane could not associate with the past he knew she was a flirtnot above trying her arts on the man she had jilted  why didnt i write you of course i did  well if you did i never got the letter and if you were on the level youd admit you never wrote  howd you find out then she inquired curiously  i never knew for sure until your mother verified it  are you curious to know why i did break it off  not in the least  this reply shot the fire into her face yet she still persisted in the expression of her sentimental motive she began to finger the medal on his breast  so mr soldier hero you didnt care  nonot after i had been here ten minutes he replied bluntly  she whirled from him swiftly her body instinct with passion her expression one of surprise and fury  what do you mean by that  nothing i care to explain except i discovered my love for you was deadperhaps had been dead for a long time  but you never discovered it until you saw meherewith swanndancing drinking smoking  no to be honest the shock of that enlightened me  daren lane im just what you men have made me she burst out passionately  you are mistaken i beg to be excluded from any complicity in thein whatever youve been made he said bitterly i have been true to you in deed and in thought all this time  you must be a queer soldier she exclaimed incredulously  i figure there were a couple of million soldiers like me queer or not he retorted  she gazed at him with something akin to hate in her eyes then putting her hands to her full hips she began that swaying dancing walk to and fro before the window she was deeply hurt lane had meant to get under her skin with a few just words of scorn and he had imagined his insinuation as to the change in her had hurt her feelings suddenly he divined it was not that at allhe had only wounded her vanity  helen lets not talk of the past he said its over even if you had been true to me and i loved you stilli would have been compelled to break our engagement  you would and why  i am a physical wreckand a mental one too i fear helen ive come home to die  daren she cried poignantly  then he told her in brief brutal words of the wounds and ravages war had dealt him and what doctor bronsons verdict had been lane felt shame in being so little as to want to shock and hurt her if that were possible  oh im sorry she burst out your motheryour sister oh that damned horrible war what has it not done to us daren you looked white and weak but i never thought you weregoing to die how dreadful  something of her girlishness returned to her in this moment of sincerity the past was not wholly dead memories lingered she looked at lane wideeyed in distress caught between strange longforgotten emotions  helen its not dreadful to have to die replied lane that is not the dreadful part in coming home  what is dreadful then she asked very low  lane felt a great heave of his breastthe irrepressible reaction of a profound and terrible emotion always held in abeyance until now and a fierce pang that was physical as well as emotional tore through him his throat constricted and ached to a familiar sensationthe welling up of blood from his lungs the handkerchief he put to his lips came away stained red helen saw it and with dilated eyes moved instinctively as if to touch him hold him in her pity  never mind helen he said huskily thats nothing well i was about to tell you what is so dreadfulfor me its to reach home grateful to god i was spared to get homeresigned to the ruin of my lifecontent to die for whom i foughtmy mother my sister you and all our women for i fought for nothing elseand find my mother aged and bewildered and sad my sister a painted little hussyand youa strange creature i despise and all everybody everything changedchanged in some horrible way which proves my sacrifice in vain it is not death that is dreadful but the uselessness the hopelessness of the ideal i cherished  helen fell on the couch and burying her face in the pillows she began to sob lane looked down at her at her glistening auburn hair and slender white ringed hand clutching the cushions at her lissom shaking form at the shapely legs in the rolleddown silk stockingsand he felt a melancholy happiness in the proof that he had reached her shallow heart and in the fact that this was the moment of loss  goodbyehelen he said  darendontgo she begged  but he had to go for other reasons beside the one that this was the end of all intimate relation between him and helen he had overtaxed his strength and the burning pang in his breast was one he must heed on the hall stairway a dizzy spell came over him he held on to the banister until the weakness passed fortunately there was no one to observe him somehow the sumptuous spacious hall seemed drearily empty was this a home for that twentyyearold girl upstairs lane opened the door and went out he was relieved to find the taxi waiting to the driver he gave the address of his home and said go slow and dont give me a jar  but lane reached home and got into the house where he sat at the table with his mother and lorna making a pretense of eating and went upstairs and into his bed without any recurrence of the symptoms that had alarmed him in the darkness of his room he gradually relaxed to rest and rest was the only medicine for him it had put off hour by hour and day by day the inevitable  if it comesall rightim ready he whispered to himself but in spite of all ive been throughand have come home toi dont want to die  there was no use in trying to sleep but in this hour he did not want oblivion he wanted endless time to think and slowly with infinite care and infallible memory he went over every detail of what he had seen and heard since his arrival home in the headlong stream of consciousness of the past hours he met with circumstances that he lingered over and tried to understand to no avail yet when all lay clearly before his mental gaze he felt a sad and tremendous fascination in the spectacle  for many weeks he had lived on the fancy of getting home of being honored and loved of being given some little meed of praise and gratitude in the short while he had to live alas this fancy had been a dream of his egotism his old world was gone there was nothing left the day of the soldier had passeduntil some future need of him stirred the emotions of a selfish people this new world moved on unmindful through its travail and incalculable change to unknown ends he daren lane had been left alone on the vast and naked shores of lethe  lane made not one passionate protest at the injustice of his fate labor agony war had taught him wisdom and vision he began to realize that no greater change could there be than this of his mind his soul but in the darkness there an irresistible grief assailed him he wept as never before in all his life and he tasted the bitter salt of his own tears he wept for his mother aged and bowed by trouble bewildered ready to give up the strugglehis little sister now forced into erotic girlhood blind wilful bold on the wrong path doomed beyond his power or any earthly powerthe men he had met warped by the war materialistic lost in the maze of selfpreservation and selfaggrandizement dead to chivalry and the honor of womenmel iden strangest and saddest of mysteriesa girl who had been noble aloof proud with a heart of golden fire now disgraced ruined the mother of a warbaby and yet strangest of all not vile not bad not lost but groping like he was down those vast and naked shores of life he wept for the hardfaced mrs wrapp whose ideal had been wealth and who had found prosperity bitter ashes at her lips yet who preserved in this modern maelstrom some sense of its falseness its baseness he wept for helen playmate of the years never to return sweetheart of his youth betrayer of his manhood the young woman of the present blase unsexed seeking provocative all perhaps as she had said that men had made hera travesty on splendid girlhood he wept for her friends embodying in them all of their classfor little bessy bell with her exquisite golden beauty her wonderful smile that was a light of joya child of fifteen with character and mind not yet sullied not yet wholly victim to the unstable spirit of the day  and traveling in this army that seemed to march before lanes eyes were the slackers like mackay and swann representative of that horde of cowards who in one way or another had avoided the servicethe young men who put comfort ease safety pleasure before all elsewho had no ideal of womanhoodwho could not have protected womenwho would not fight to save women from the apish hunswho remained behind to fall in the wreck of the wars degeneration and to dance to drink to smoke to ride the women to their debasement  and for the first and the last time lane wept for himself pitifully as a child lost and helpless as a strong man facing irreparable loss as a boy who had dreamed beautiful dreams who had loved and given and trusted who had suffered insupportable agonies of body and soul who had fought like a lion for what he represented to himself who had killed and killedand whose reward was change indifference betrayal and death  that dark hour passed lane lay spent in the blackness of his room his heart had broken but his spirit was as unquenchable as the fire of the sun if he had a year a month a week a day longer to live he could never live it untrue to himself life had marked him to be a sufferer a victim but nothing could kill his soul and his soul was his faithsomething he understood as faith in god or nature or lifein the reason for his beingin his vision of the future  how then to spend this last remnant of his life no one would guess what passed through his lonely soul no one would care but out of the suffering that now seemed to give him spirit and wisdom and charity there dawned a longing to help to save he would return good for evil all had failed him but he would fail no one  then he had a strange intense desire to understand the present only a day homeand what colossal enigma the war had been chaos was this its aftermath had people been rocked on their foundations what were they doinghow livinghow changing he would see and be grateful for a little time to prove his faith he knew he would find the same thing in others that existed in himself  he would help his mother and cheer her and try to revive something of hope in her he would bend a keen and patient eye upon lorna and take the place of her father and be kind loving yet blunt to her and show her the inevitable end of this dancing dallying road perhaps he could influence helen he would see the little soldierworshipping bessy bell and if by talking hours and hours by telling the whole of his awful experience of war he could take up some of the time so fraught with peril for her he would welcome the ordeal of memory and mel idenhow thought of her seemed tinged with strange regret once she and he had been dear friends and because of a falsehood told by helen that friendship had not been what it might have been suppose mel instead of helen had loved him and been engaged to him would he have been jilted and would mel have been lost no it was a subtle thingthat answer of his spirit it did not agree with mel idens frank confession  it might be difficult he reflected to approach mel but he would find a way he would rest a few daysthen find where she lived and go to see her could he help her and he had an infinite exaltation in his power to help any one who had suffered lane recalled mels pale sweet face the shadowed eyes the sad tremulous lips and this image of her seemed the most lasting of the impressions of the day     chapter v   the arbiters of social fate in middleville assembled at mrs maynards on a monday afternoon presumably to partake of tea seldom however did they meet without adding zest to the occasion by a pricking down of names  mrs wrapp was the leading spirit of this selfappointed tribunala circumstance of expanding resentment to mrs maynard who had once held the reins with aristocratic hands mrs kingsley the third member of the great triangle claimed an ancestor on the mayflower which was in her estimation a guerdon of blue blood her elaborate and exclusive entertainments could never be rivalled by those of mrs wrapp she was a widow with one child the daughter elinor a girl of nineteen  mrs maynard was tall pale and worldly traces of lost beauty flashed in her rare smiles when frank maynard had failed in business she had shrouded her soul in bitterness and she saw the slow cruel years whiten his head and bend his shoulders with the cold eye of a woman who had no forgiveness for failure after mr maynards reverse all that kept the pair together were the son blair and the sweet fairhaired delicate margaret a girl of eighteen whom the father loved and for whom the mother had large ambitions they still managed in ways mysterious to the curious to keep their fine residence in the river park suburb of middleville  on this april afternoon the tea was neglected in the cups and there was nothing of the usual mild gossip the discussion involved daren lane and when two of those social arbiters settled back in their chairs the open sesame of middlevilles select affairs had been denied to him  why did he do it asked mrs kingsley  he must have been under the influence of liquor replied mrs maynard who had her own reasons for being relieved at the disgrace of daren lane  no jane youre wrong spoke up mrs wrapp who whatever else she might be was blunt and fairminded lane wasnt drunk he never drank before the war i knew him well he and helen had a puppylove affairthey were engaged before lane went to war well the day after his return he called on us and if i never liked him before i liked him then hes come back to die he was ill for two weeksand then he crawled out of bed again i met him down town one day he really looked better and told me with a sad smile that he had his ups and downs no lane wasnt drunk at fanchon smiths dance the other night i was there and i was with mrs smith when lane came up to us if ever i saw a cool smooth handsome devil it was lane well he said what he said i thought mrs smith would faint it is my idea lane had a deep motive back of his remark about fanchons dress and her dancing the fact is lane was sick at what he sawsick and angry and he wanted fanchons mother and me to know what he thought  it was an insult declared mrs maynard vehemently  it made mrs smith ill added mrs kingsley she told me fanchon tormented the life out of her trying to learn what lane said mrs smith would not tell but fanchon came to me and i told her such a perfectly furious girl shell not wear that dress or dance that dance very soon again the story is all over town  friends there are two sides to every question interposed the forceful mrs wrapp if lane cared to be popular he would have used more tact but i dont think his remark was an insult it was pretty raw i admit but the dress was indecent and the dance was rotten helen told me fanchon was half shot so how could she be insulted  mrs maynard and mrs kingsley as usual received mrs wrapps caustic and rather crude opinions with as good grace as they could muster plain it was that they felt themselves a shade removed from this younger and newer member of society but they could not show direct antagonism to her influence any more than they could understand the common sense and justice of her arguments  no one will ever invite him again declared mrs maynard  hes done in middleville echoed mrs kingsley and that perhaps was a gauntlet thrown  rot exclaimed mrs wrapp with more force than elegance ill invite daren lane to my house you women dont get the point daren lane is a soldier come home to die he gave himself and he returns to find allall this sickeningoh what shall i call it what does he care whether or not we invite him cant you see that  theres a good deal in what you say returned mrs kingsley influenced by the stronger spirit maybe lane hated the new styles i dont blame him much theres something wrong with our young people the girls are crazy the boys are wild few of them are marryingor even getting engaged theyll do anything the times are different and we mothers dont know our daughters  well i know mine returned mrs maynard loftily what you say may be true generally but there are exceptions my daughter has been too well brought up  yes margie is wellbred retorted mrs wrapp well admit she hasnt gone to extremes as most of our girls have but i want to observe to you that she has been a wallflower for a year  it certainly is a problem sighed mrs kingsley i feel helplessout of it elinor does precisely what she wants to do she wears outlandish clothes she smokes andim afraid drinks and dancesdreadfully just like the other girlsno better no worse but with all that i think shes good i feel the same as jane feels about that in spite of thisthis modern stuff i believe all the girls are fundamentally the same as ten years ago  well thats where you mothers get in wrong declared mrs wrapp with her vigorous bluntness its your pride just because theyre your daughters they are above reproach what have you to say about the war babies in town did you ever hear of that ten years ago you bet you didnt these girls are a speedy set some of them are just wild for the sake of wildness most of them have to stand for things or be left out altogether  what in the world can we do queried mrs maynard divided between distress and chagrin  the good lord only knows responded mrs wrapp herein losing her assurance marriage would save most of them but helen doesnt want to marry she wants to paint pictures and be free  perhaps marriage is a solution rejoined mrs maynard thoughtfully  whom on earth can we marry them to asked mrs kingsley most of the older men the bachelors whore eligible havent any use for these girls except to play with them true these young boys only think of little but dances carrides and sneaking off alone to spoonthey get engaged to this girl and that one but nothing comes of it  youre wrong never in my time have i seen girls find lovers and husbands as easily as now declared mrs wrapp nor get rid of them so quickly jane you can marry margaret shes pretty and sweet even if you have spoiled her the years are slipping by margaret ought to marry shes not strong enough to work marriage for her would make things so much easier for you  with that parting dig mrs wrapp rose to go whereupon she and mrs kingsley with gracious words of invitation and farewell took themselves off leaving mrs maynard contending with an outraged spirit certain terse remarks of the crude and practical mrs wrapp had forced to her mind a question that of late had assumed cardinal importance and now had been brought to an issue by a proposal for margarets hand her daughter was a great expense really more than could longer be borne in these times of enormous prices and shrunken income a husband had been found for margaret and the matter could be adjusted easily enough if the girl did not meet it with the incomprehensible obstinacy peculiar to her of late  mrs maynard found the fair object of her hopes seated in the middle of her room with the bright contents of numerous boxes and drawers strewn in glittering heaps around her  margaret what on earth are you doing there she demanded  im looking for a little picture holt dalrymple gave me when we went to school together responded margaret  arent you ever going to grow up youll be hunting for your dolls next  i will if i like said the daughter in a tone that did not manifest a seraphic mood  dont you feel well inquired the mother solicitously margaret was frail and subject to headaches that made her violent  oh im well enough  my dear rejoined mrs maynard changing the topic im sorry to tell you daren lane has lost his standing in middleville  the hum and the honk of a motorcar sounded in the street  poor daren whats he done any old day hell care  mrs maynard was looking out of the window here comes a crowd of girls helen wrapp has a new suit well ill go down and after they leave i want a serious talk with you  not if i see you first muttered margaret under her breath as her mother walked out  presently following gay talk and laughter down stairs a bevy of margarets friends entered her boudoir  hello old socks was helens greeting you look punk  marg wheres the doll your mother tipped us off was elinors greeting  wheres the eats was flossie dickersons greeting she was a brighteyed girl with freckles on her smiling face and the expression of a daring vivacious and happy spiritand acknowledged to be the best dancer and most popular girl in middleville her dress while not to be compared with her friends costumes in costliness yet was extreme in the prevailing style  glad to see you old dear was darkeyed darkhaired dorothy dalrymples greeting her rich color bore no hint of the artificial she sank down on her knees beside margaret  the other girls draped themselves comfortably round the room and flossie with a yum yum began to dig into a box of candy on margarets couch they all talked at once hear the latest marg  look at helens spiffy suit  oh money money what it will buy  moneyll never buy me ill say  marg whos been fermentin round lately girls get wise to the flowers  hot dog see marg blush that comes from being so pale what are rouge and lipstick and powder for but to hide truth from our masculine pursuers  floss you havent blushed for a million years  it was dorothy dalrymple who silenced the idle badinage  marg you rummaging in the past she cried  yes and i love it replied margaret i havent looked over this stuff for years just to remember the things i did here dal is a picture you once drew of our old teacher miss hill  dorothy whom the girls nicknamed dal gazed at the drawing with amaze and regret  she was a terror continued margaret but dal you never had any reason to draw such a horrible picture of her you were her pet  i wasnt declared dorothy  maybe you never knew miss hill adored you dal interposed elinor she was always holding you up as a paragon not in your lessonsfor you were a boneheadbut for deportment you were the class  dal you were too good for this earth then let alone these days said margaret  miss hill mused elinor gazing at the caricature thats not a bad drawing i remember miss hill never had any use for me small wonder she was an honesttogod teacher i think she wanted us to be good wonder how she got along with the kids that came after us  i saw amanda hill the other day spoke up flossie she looked worn out she was nice to me ill bet my shirt shed like to have us back bad as we were these kids of today my gawd theyre the limit they paralyze me i thought i was pretty fast but compared to these youngsters im tied to a post my kid sister joycerose clymerbessy bell some kids believe me and take it from me girls these dimplekneed chickens are vamping the older boys  theyre all stuck on bessy said helen  margaret squealed in delight girls look here valentines did you ever look at them and whats this wonders of naturecomposition by margaret maynard heavens did i write that and whats this sear and yellow document  a slivery peal of laughter burst from margaret  dal heres one of your masterpieces composed when you were thirteen and mooney over daren lane  i never i didnt write it denied dorothy with color in her dark cheeks  yes you did its signedyours forever dot dalrymple  besides i remember now daren gave it to me said he wanted to prove he could have other girls if he couldnt have me  how chivalrous exclaimed dorothy joining in the laugh  ah heres what ive been hunting declared margaret waving aloft a small picture its a photograph of holt taken five years ago only the other evening he swore i hadnt kept itdared me to produce it hell want it nowfor some other girl but nix its mine dal isnt he a handsome boy here  with sisterly impartiality dorothy declared she could not in the wildest flight of her imagination see her brother as handsome  holt used to be goodlooking said she but he outgrew it that south carolina training camp and the flu changed his looks as well as his disposition  holt is changed mused margaret gazing down at the picture and the glow faded from her face  dare lane is handsome even if he is a wreck said elinor with sudden enthusiasm friday night when he beat it from fanchons party he sure looked splendid  elinor was a staunch admirer of lanes and she was the inveterate torment of her girl friends she gave helen a sly glance helens green eyes narrowed and gleamed  yes dares handsomer than ever she said and to give the devil his due hes finer than ever too damn fine for this crowd but whats the use she broke off  yes poor dare lane sighed elinor dare deserves much from all of us not to mention you he has made me think thank heaven i found i hadnt forgotten how  el no one would notice it returned helen sarcastically  its easy to see where you get off retorted elinor  then a silence ensued strange in view of the late banter and quick sallies a silence breathing of restraint the color died wholly from margarets face and a subtle indefinable almost imperceptible change came over dorothy  you bet dare is handsome spoke up flossie as if to break the embarrassment hes so white since he came home his eyes are so dark and flashing then the way he holds his headthe look of him no wonder these damned slackers seem cheap compared to him id fall for dare lane in a minute even if he is half dead  the restraint passed and when floss dickerson came out with eulogy for any man his status was settled for good and all margaret plunged once more into her treasures of early schooldays floss and elinor made merry over some verses margaret had handed up with a blush helen apparently lapsed into a brooding abstraction and presently dorothy excused herself and kissing margaret goodbye left for home  the instant she had gone margarets gay and reminiscent mood underwent a change  girls i want to know what daren lane did or said on friday night at fanchons spoke up margaret you know mother dragged me home said i was tired but i wasnt it was only because im a wallflower so i missed what happened but ive heard talk enough to make me crazy to know about this scandal kit benson was here and she hinted things i met bessy bell she asked me if i knew shes wild about daren that yellowlegged broiler he doesnt even know her my brother blair would not tell me anything hes strong for daren but mother told me daren had lost his standing in middleville she always hated daren afraid id fall in love with him the idea i liked him and i like him better nowpoor fellow and last when el mentioned daren did you see dals face i never saw dal look like that  neither did i replied elinor  well i have spoke up helen with all of her mothers bluntness dal always was lovesick over daren when she was a mere kid she never got over it and never will  still water runs deep sapiently remarked elinor theres a good deal in dal shes fine as silk of course we all remember how jealous she was of other girls when daren went with her but i think now its because shes sorry for daren so am i he was such a fool fanchon swears no nice girl in middleville will ever dance that new camelwalk dance in public again  what did daren say demanded margaret with eyes lighting  i was standing with helen and fanchon when daren came up he lookedi dont know howjust wonderful we all knew something was doing daren bowed to fanchon and said to her in a perfectly clear voice that everybody heard id like to try your camelwalk im out of practice and not strong but i can go once around im sure will you  youre on dare replied fanchon  then he asked do you like it  ill say so darecrazy about it  of course you know why its dancedand how its interpreted by men said daren  what do you mean asked fanchon growing red and flustered  then daren said ill tell your mother if she lets you dance with that understandingall right he bent over mrs smith and said something mrs wrapp heard it and so did mrs mackay who looked pretty sick mrs smith nearly fainted but she recovered enough to order daren to leave  do you know what daren said demanded margaret in a frenzy of excitement  no none of the girls know we can only imagine that makes it worse if fanchon knows she wont tell but it is gossip all over town well hear it soon all the girls in town are imagining its spread like wildfire and what do you think margie in churchon sundaydoctor wallace spoke of it he mentioned no names but he said that as the indecent dress and obscene dance of the young women could no longer be influenced by the home or the church it was well that one young man had the daring to fling the truth into the faces of their mothers  oh it was rotten of daren replied margaret with tears in her eyes she was ashamed indignant incredulous for him to do a thing like that hes always been the very prince of gentlemen what on earth possessed him heaven knows the dances are vile but that doesnt excuse daren lane what do i care what doctor wallace said never in a thousand years will mrs smith or mother or any one forgive him fanchon smith is a little snob i always hated her shes spiteful and catty shes a flirt all the way she would dance any old thing but thats not the point darens disgraced himself it was rottenof him andill neverforgivehim either  dont cry margie said elinor it always makes your eyes red and gives you a headache poor daren made a blunder but some of us will stick to him dont take it so badly  margie it was rotten of daren one way you look at itour way added flossie but you have to hand it to him for that stunt  helen wrapp preserved her sombre mood silent and brooding  margie went on elinor theres a lot back of this if dare lane could do that there must be some reason for it maybe we all needed a jolt well weve got it lets stand by daren i will helen will floss will you will and surely dal will  if you ask me ill say dare lane ought to hand something to the men burst out floss dickerson with fire in her eyes  you said a mouthful kiddo responded helen with her narrow contracted gaze upon margaret daren gave me the once overand then the icepick  wonder what he gave poor melwhen he heard about her murmured elinor thoughtfully  mel iden ought to be roasted retorted helen she was always so darned superior and all the time  helen dont you say a word against mel iden burst out margaret hotly she was my dearest friend she was lovely her ruin was a horrible shock but it wasnt because she was bad mel had some fanatical notion about soldiers giving allgoing away to be slaughtered she said to me a womans body is so little to give  yes i know mel was cracked replied helen but she neednt have been a damn fool she didnt need to have had that baby  helen your idea of sin is to be found out said elinor with satire  again floss dickerson dropped her trenchant personality into the breach  aw come off she ejaculated let somebody roast the men once will you im the little jane that knows believe me all this talk about the girls going to hell makes me sick we may be goingand going in limousinesbut its the men whore stepping on the gas  floss i love to hear you elocute drawled helen go to it for gods sake roast the men  you always have to horn in retorted floss let me get this off my chest will you we girls are getting talked about theres no use denying it any but a blind girl could see it and its because we do what the men want every girl wants to go outto be attractiveto have fellows but the price is getting high they say in middleville that im rushed more than any other girl well if i am i know what it costs if i didnt petif i didnt mush if i didnt park my corsets at dancesif i didnt drink and smoke and wiggle like a jellyfish id be a dead onean egg and dont you overlook that if any one says i want to do these things hes a fool but i do love to have good times and little by little ive been drawn on and on ive had my troubles staving off these fellows most of them get half drunk some of the girls do too i never went that far i always kept my head i never went the limit but you can bet your sweet life it wasnt their fault i didnt fall for them ill say ive had to walk home from more than one auto ride theres something in the gag i know shes a good girl because i met her walking home from an auto ride thats one thing i intend to cut out this summerthe auto rides nothing doing for little flossie  oh cant we talk of something else complained margaret wearily with her hands pressing against her temples     chapter vi   mrs maynard slowly went upstairs and along the hall to her daughters room margaret sat listlessly by a window the girls had gone  you were going for a long walk said mrs maynard  im tired replied margaret there was a shadow in her eyes  the mother had never understood her daughter and of late a subtle change in margaret had made her more of a puzzle  margaret i want to talk seriously with you she began  well  didnt i tell you i wanted you to break off youryour friendship with holt dalrymple  yes replied margaret with a flush i did notwant to  well the thing which concerns you now ishe cant be regarded as a possibility for you  possibility echoed margaret  just that exactly im not sure of your thoughts on the matter but its time i knew them holt is a neerdowell hes gone to the bad like so many of these army boys no nice girl will ever associate with him again  then im not nice for i will declared margaret spiritedly  you will persist in your friendship for him in the face of my objection  certainly i will if i have any say about it but i know holt ii guess he has taken to drinkand carrying on so you neednt worry much about our friendship  mrs maynard hesitated she had become accustomed to margarets little bursts of fury and she expected one here but none came margaret appeared unnaturally calm she sat still with her face turned to the window mrs maynard was a little afraid of this cold quiet girl  margaret you cant help seeing now that your mothers judgment was right holt dalrymple once may have been very interesting and attractive for a friend but as a prospective husband he was impossible the worst i hear of him is that he drinks and gambles i know you liked him and i dont want to be unjust but he has kept other and better young men away from you  margarets hand clenched and her face sank against the windowpane  we need say no more about him went on mrs maynard margaret youve been brought up in luxury if your father happened to die nowhes far from wellwed be left penniless weve lived up every dollar we have our poor crippled blair to care for you know you must marry well ive brought you up with that end in view and its imperative you marry soon  why must a girl marry murmured margaret wistfulness in her voice id rather go to work margaret you are a maynard replied her mother haughtily pray spare me any of this new woman talk about libertyequal rightscareers and all that life hasnt changed for the conservative families of blood try to understand margaret that you must marry and marry well youre nobody without money in society there are hundreds of girls like you though few so attractive thats all the more reason you should take the best chance you have before its lost if you dont marry people will say you cant theyll say youre fading growing old even if you grow prettier every day of your life and in the end theyll make you a miserable old maid then youll be glad to marry anybody if you marry now you can help your father who needs help badly enough you can help poor blair you can be a leader in society you can have a house here a cottage at the seashore and one in the mountains everything a girls heart yearns forservants horses autos gowns diamonds  everything except love interrupted margaret bitterly  mrs maynard actually flushed but she kept her temper  its desirable that you love your husband any sensible woman can learn to care for a man love as you dream about it is merely aa dream if women waited for that they would never get married  which would be preferable to living without love  but margaret what would become of the world if there were fewer marriagesheaven knows theyre few enough nowadaysthere would be fewer familiesand in the end fewer childrenless and less  theyd be better children said margaret calmly  eventually the race would die out  and thatd be a good thingif the people cant love each other  how sillyexasperating ejaculated mrs maynard you dont mean such nonsense what any girl wants is a home of her own a man to fuss over i didnt marry for love as you dream it my husband attended to his business and ive looked after his household youve had every advantage i flatter myself our marriage has been a success  margarets eyes gleamed like pointed flames  i differ with you your married life hasnt been successful any more than its been happy you never cared for father you havent been kind to him since his failure  mrs maynard waved her hand imperiously in angry amaze  i wont stop im not a baby or a doll went on margaret passionately if im old enough to marry im old enough to talk i can think cant i you never told me anything but i could see ever since i can remember you and father have had one continual wrangle about moneybillsexpenses perhaps id have been better off without all the advantages and luxury its because of these things you want to throw me at some man id far rather go to work the same as blaid did instead of college  whatever on earth has come over you gasped mrs maynard bewildered by the revolt of this once meek daughter  maybe im learning a little sense maybe i got some of it from daren lane flashed back margaret  mother whatever ive learned lately has been learned away from home youve no more idea whats going on in the world today than if you were actually dead i never was bright like mel iden but im no fool i see and hear and i read girls arent pieces of furniture to be handed out to some rich men girls are waking up they can do things they can be independent and being independent doesnt mean a girls not going to marry for she can waitwait for the right manfor love you say i dream well why didnt you wake me up long agowith the truth i had my dreams about love and marriage and ive learned that love and marriage are vastly different from what most mothers make them out to be or let a girl think  margaret ill not have you talk in this strange way you owe me respect if not obedience said mrs maynard her voice trembling  oh well i wont say any more replied margaret but cant you spare me couldnt we live within our means  after all these yearsto skimp along i couldnt endure it  whom have you in mind for me toto marry asked the girl coldly curious  mr swann has asked your hand in marriage for his son richard he wants richard to settle down richard is wild like all these young men and i havewell i encouraged the plan  mother cried margaret springing up  margaret you will see  i despise dick swann  why asked her mother  i just do i never liked him in school he used to do such mean things hes selfish he let holt and daren suffer for his tricks  margaret you talk like a child  listen mother she threw her arms round mrs maynard and kissed her and spoke pleadingly oh dont make me hate myself it seems ive grown so much older in the last year or soand lately since this marriage talk came up ive thought of things as never before because iveive learned about them i see so differently i cantcant love dick swann i cant bear to have him touch me hes rude he takes liberties hes too free with his hands why itd be wrong to marry him what difference can a marriage service make in a girls feelings mother let me say no  lord spare me from bringing up another girl exclaimed mrs maynard margaret i cant make you marry richard swann im simply trying to tell you what any sensible girl would see she had to do you think it overboth sides of the questionbefore you absolutely decide  mrs maynard was glad to end the discussion and to get away in margarets appeal she heard a yielding a final obedience to her wish and she thought she had better let well enough alone the look in margarets clear blue eyes made her shrink it would haunt her but she felt no remorse any mother would have done the same there was always the danger of that old love affair there was new danger in these strange wild fancies of modern girls there was never any telling what margaret might do but once married she would be safe and her position assured     chapter vii   daren lane left riverside park and walked in the meadows until he came to a boulder under a huge chestnut tree here he sat down he could not walk far these days many a time in the indian summers long past he had gathered chestnuts there with dal with mel iden with helen he would never do it again  the april day had been warm and fresh with the opening of a late spring the sun was now goldrimming the low hills in the west the sky was pale blue the spring flowers whitened the meadow twilight began to deepen the evening star twinkled out of the sky the hush of the gloaming hour stole over the land  four weeks homeand nothing done so little time left he muttered  two weeks of that period he had been unable to leave his bed the rest of the time he had dragged himself around trying to live up to his resolve to get at the meaning of the present to turn his sister lorna from the path of dalliance and he had failed in all  his sister presented the problem that most distressed lane she had her good qualities and through them could be reached but she was thoughtless vacillating and wilful she had made him promises only to break them lane had caught her in falsehoods and upon being called to account she had told him that if he didnt like it he could lump it of late she had grown away from what affection she had shown at first she could not bear interference with her pleasures and seemed uncontrollable lane felt baffled this thing was a juggernaut impossible to stop  lane had scraped acquaintance with harry hale one of lornas admirers a boy of eighteen who lived with his widowed mother on the edge of the town he appeared to be an industrious intelligent quiet fellow not much given to the prevailing habits of the young people in his humble worship of lorna he was like a dog lorna went to the motion pictures with him occasionally when she had no other opportunity for excitement lane gathered that lorna really liked this boy and when with him seemed more natural more what a fifteenyearold girl used to be and somehow it was upon this boy that lane placed a forlorn hope  no more automobiles honked in front of the home to call lorna out she met her friends away from the house and returning at night she walked the last few blocks it was this fact that awoke lanes serious suspicions  another problem lay upon lanes heart if not so distressing as lornas still one that added to his sorrow and his perplexity he had gone once to call on mel iden mel iden was all soul whatever had been the facts of her downfalland reflection on that hurt lane so strangely he could not bear itit had not been on her part a matter of sex she was far above wantonness  through long hours in the dark of night when lanes pain kept him sleepless he had pondered over the mystery of mel iden until it cleared she typified the mother of the race in all periods of the progress of the race war had brought out this instinct in womento give themselves for the future it was a provision of nature inscrutable and terrible how immeasurable the distance between mel iden and those women who practised birth control as the war had brought out hideous greed and baseness so had it propelled forward and upward the noblest attributes of life mel iden was a builder not a destroyer she had been sexless and selfless unconsciously during the fever and emotion of the training of american men for service abroad and the poignancy of their departure to fight and perhaps never return mel iden had answered to this mysterious instinct of nature then with the emotion past and face to face with staggering consequences she had reacted to conscious instincts she had proved the purity of her surrender she was all mother and lane began to see her moving in a crystal beautiful light  for what seemed a long time lane remained motionless there in the silence of the meadow then at length he arose and retraced his slow steps back to town darkness overtook him on the bridge that spanned middleville river he leaned over the railing and peered down into the shadows a soft murmur of rushing water came up how like strange distant voices calling him to go back or go on or warning him or giving mystic portent of something that would happen to him there a cold chill crept over him and he seemed enveloped in a sombre menace of the future but he shook it off he had many battles to fight not the least of which was with morbid imagination  when he reached the center of town he entered the lobby of the bradford inn he hoped to meet blair maynard there a company of welldressed youths and men filled the place most of whom appeared to be making a merry uproar  lane observed two men who evidently were the focus of attention one was a stranger very likely a traveling man and at the moment he presented a picture of mingled consternation and anger he was brushing off his clothes while glaring at a little stout redfaced man who appeared about to be stricken by apoplexy this latter was a colonel pepper whose acquaintance lane had recently made he was fond of cards and sport and appeared to be a favorite with the young men about town moreover he had made himself particularly agreeable to lane in fact to the extent of lanes embarrassment at this moment the stranger lost his consternation wholly in wrath and made a threatening movement toward pepper lane stepped between them just in time to save pepper a blow  i know what hes done i apologize for him said lane to the stranger hes made a good many people victims of the same indignity its a weaknessa disease he cant help himself pray overlook it  the stranger appeared impressed with lanes presence probably with his uniform and slowly shook himself and fell back to glower at pepper and curse under his breath still uncertain of himself  lane grasped colonel pepper and led him out of the lobby  pepper youre going to get in an awful mess with that stunt of yours he declared severely if you cant help it you ought at least pick on your friends or the town peoplenot strangers  haveadrink sputtered pepper with his hand at his hip  no thanks  haveacigar  lane laughed he had been informed that colonel peppers failing always took this form of remorse and certainly he would have tried it upon his latest victim had not lane interfered  colonel youre hopeless said lane as they walked out i hope somebody will always be around to protect you id carry a body guard say have you seen blair maynard or holt dalrymple tonight  not blair but holt was here early with the boys replied pepper theyve gone to the club rooms to have a little game im going to sit in lately i had to put up a holler if the boys quit cards howm i to make a living  had holt been drinking  not tonight but hes been hitting the bottle pretty hard of late  suddenly lane buttonholed the little man and peered down earnestly at him pepper ive been trying to straighten holt up hes going to the bad but hes a good kid its only the company the fact isthiss strictly confidential mind youholts sister begged me to try to stop his drinking and gambling i think i can do it too with a little help now pepper im asking you to help me  ahuh well lets go in the writing room where we can talk said the other and he took hold of lanes arm when they were seated in a secluded corner he lighted a cigar and faced lane with shrewd kindly eyes son i like you and blair as well as i hate these slackers swann and mackay and their crowd i could tell you a heap and maybe help you though i think young holt is not a bad egg is his sister the dark one who steps so straight and holds herself so well  yes that sounds like dorothy replied lane  shes about the only one i know who doesnt paint her face and i never saw her atwell never mind where but the fact i mean makes her stand out in this middleville crowd like a light in the dark lane have you got on yet to the speed of the young people of this old burg  im getting on to my sorrow said lane  ahuh you mean youre getting wise to your kid sister  yes im sorry to say what do you know pepper  now son wait im coming to that maybe but i want to know some things first is it truewhat i hear about your health bad shape you knowall cut up in the war worse than young maynard  peppers hand was close on lanes he had forgotten his cigar his eyes were earnest  true laughed lane grimly yes its true i wont last long pepper according to doctor bronson thats why i want to make hay while the sun shines  ahuh pepper cleared his throat forgive this boy is it also true you were engaged to marry that helen wrappand she threw you down while you were over there  yes thats perfectly true replied lane soberly  god i guess maybe the soldier wasnt up against it ejaculated pepper with a gesture of mingled awe and wonder and scorn  what was the soldier up against pepper queried lane frankly i dont know  lane the government jollied and forced the boys into the army replied pepper the country went wild with patriotism the soldiers were heroes the women threw themselves away on anything inside a uniform make the world safe for democracydown the hunsave france and englandideals freedom gods country and all that well the first few soldiers to return from france got a grand reception were made heroes of they were lucky to get back while the sentiment was hot but that didnt last now a year and more after the war where does the soldier get off lane therere over six hundred thousand of you disabled veterans and for all i can read and find out the government has done next to nothing new york is full of begging soldierson the streets think of it and the poor devils are dying everywhere my god think of whats in the mind of one crippled soldier let alone over half a million i just have a dim idea of what id felt you must know or you will know lane for you seem a thoughtful lofty sort of chap just the kind to make a good soldier because you had ideals and nerve well a selfish and weak administration could hardly be expected to keep extravagant promises to patriots but that the american public as a body should now be sick of the sight of a crippled soldierand that his sweetheart should turn him downthis is the hideous blot the ineradicable shame the stinking truth the damned mystery  when pepper ended his speech which grew more vehement toward the close lane could only stare at him in amaze  see here lane added the other hastily pardon me for blowing up i just couldnt help it i took a shine to youand to see you like thisbrings back the resentment ive had all along im blunt but its just as well for you to be put wise quick youll find friends like me who will stand by you if you let them but youll also find that most of this rotten world has gone back on you  then pepper made a sharp passionate gesture that broke his cigar against the arm of his chair and he cursed low and deep presently he addressed lane again whatever comes of any disclosures i makewhatever you doyoull not give me away  certainly not you can trust me pepper returned lane  son im a wise old guy theres not much that goes on in middleville i dont get on to and ill make your hair curl but ill confine myself to what comes closest home to you i get you lane youre game youre through you have come back from war to find a hell of a mess your own sisteryour sweetheartyour friends brother and your soldier pards sisteron the primrose path and you with your last breath trying to turn them back ill say its a damn fine stunt im an old gambler lane ive lived in many towns and mixed in tough crowds of crooked men and rotten women but im here to confess that this afterthewar stuff of middlevilles better class has knocked out about all the faith i had left in human nature then you came along to teach me a lesson  well pepper thats strong talk returned lane but cut it and hurry toto what comes home to me whats the matter with these middleville girls  lane any intelligent man who knows things and who can think for himself will tell you thisthat to judge from the dress dance talk conduct of these young girlsmost of them have apparently gone wrong  you include our nice girlsfrom what we used to call middlevilles best families  i dont only include them i throw the emphasis on them the girls you know best  lane straightened up to look at his companion pepper certainly was not drunk  do you knowanything about lorna  nothing specifically to prove anything shes in the thick of this thing in middleville only a few nights ago i saw her at a roadhouse out on the state road with a crowd of youngsters they were having a high old time ill say they danced jazz and i saw lorna drink lemonade into which liquor had been poured from a hippocket flask  lane put his head on his hands as if to rest it or still the throbbing there  who took lorna to this place he asked presently breathing heavily  i dont know but it was dick swann who poured the drink out of the flask between you and me lane that young millionaire is going a pace hereabouts listen he went on lowering his voice and glancing round to see there was no one to overhear him theres a gambling club in middleville i go there my rooms are in the same building ive made a peephole through the attic floor next to my room do i see more things than cards and bottles do i if the fathers of middleville could see what ive seen theyd go out to the asylum im not supposed to know its more than a place to gamble and nobody knows i know dick swann and hardy mackay are at the head of this club swann is the genius and the support of it hes rich and a high roller if i ever saw one among themselves these young gentlemen call it the strong arm club study over that lane do you get it i know you do and that saves me talking until i see red  pepper have you seen my sisterthere queried lane tensely  yes  with whom  ill not say lane theres no need for that ill give you a key to my rooms and you can go therein the afternoonsand paste yourself to my peephole and watch honest to god i believe it means bloodshed but i cant help that something must be done im not much good but i can see that  colonel pepper wiped his moist face he was now quite pale and his hands shook  i never had a wife or a sweetheart he went on but once i had a little sister thank heaven she didnt live her girlhood in times like these  lane again bowed his head on his hands and wrestled with the might of reality  im going to take you to these clubrooms tonight went on pepper itll cause a hell of a row but once you get in therell be no help for them swann and his chums will have to stand for it  did you ever take an outsider in asked lane  several times traveling men i met here good fellows that liked a game of cards swann made no kick at that hes keen to gamble and when hes drinking the skys the limit  wouldnt it be wiser just to show me these rooms and let me watch from your placeuntil i find my sister there queried lane  i dont know replied pepper thoughtfully i think if i were you id butt in tonight with me you can drag young dalrymple home before he gets drunk  pepper ill break up thisthis club declared lane  ill say you will and im for you strong if it was only the booze and cards id not have squealed thats my living but by god i cant stand for thethe other stuff any longer come on now and ill put you on to a slick stunt thatll take your breath away  he led the way out of the hotel in his excitement walking rather fast  go slow pepper said lane were not going over the top  pepper gave him a quick comprehending look  good lord lane youre not asas bad as all that  lane nodded then at slower pace they went out and down the bright main street for two blocks and then to the right on west street which was quite comparable to the other thoroughfare as a business district at the end of the street the buildings were the oldest in middleville and entirely familiar to lane  give whites the once over said pepper indicating a brightly lighted store across the street that place is new to you isnt it  yes i dont remember white or that there was a confectionery den along here  den is right its some den believe me whites a newcomera young sport thick with swann for all i know swann is backing him anyway he has a swell joint and a good trade people kick about his high prices ice cream candy soda soft drinks and all that rot but if he knows who you are you can get a shot itll strike you funny later to see he waits on the customers himself but when you get wise itll not be so funny hes got a tea parlor upstairsand they say its some swell place with a rest room or ladies dressing room back now from this back room the girls can get into the clubrooms of the boys and go out on the other side of the block in one way and out the otherat night not necessary in the afternoon come on now well go round the block  a short walk round the block brought them into a shaded wide street with one of middlevilles parks on the left a row of luxuriant elm trees helped the effect of gloom the nearest electric light was across on the far corner with trees obscuring it to some extent at the corner where pepper halted there was an outside stairway running up the oldfashioned building the ground floor shops bore the signs of a florist and a milliner above was a photograph gallery and the two upper stories were apparently unoccupied to the left of the two stores another stairway led up into the center of the building pepper led lane up this stairway a long dark climb of three stories that taxed lanes endurance  sure is a junk heap this old block observed pepper as he fumbled in the dim light with his keys at length he opened a door turned on a light and led lane into his apartment i have three rooms here and the back one opens into a kind of areaway from which i get into an abandoned storeroom or i guess its an attic tomorrow afternoon about three you meet me here and ill take you in there and let you have a look through the peephole i made its no use tonight because therell be only boys at the club and im going to take you right in  he switched off the light drew lane out and locked the door im the only person who lives on this floor therere three holes to this burrow and one of them is at the end of this hall the exit where the girls slip out is on the floor below through a hallway to that outside stairs oh ill say its a coney island maze this building but just what these young rakes want come on and be careful itll be dark and the stairs are steep  at the end of the short hall pepper opened a door and led lane down steep steps in thick darkness to another hall dimly lighted by a window opening upon the street  youll have to make a bluff at playing poker unless my butting in with you causes a row said pepper as he walked along presently he came to a door upon which he knocked several times but before it was opened footsteps and voices sounded down the hall in the opposite direction from which pepper had escorted lane  guess theyre just coming hard luck said pepper fraid youll not get in now  lane counted five dark forms against the background of dim light he saw the red glow of a cigarette then the door upon which pepper had knocked opened to let out a flare pepper gave lane a shove across the threshold and followed him lane did not recognize the young man who had opened the door the room was large with old walls and high ceiling a round table with chairs and a sideboard it had no windows the door on the other side was closed  pepper whos this youre ringin in on me demanded the young fellow  a pard of mine now dont be peeved sammy replied pepper if theres any kick ill take the blame  then the five young men glided swiftly into the room the last one was dick swann in the act of closing the door behind him he saw lane and started violently back his face turned white his action his look silenced the talk  lane what do you want he jerked out  lane eyed him without replying he thought he read more in swanns face and voice than any of the amazed onlookers  dick i fetched lane up for a little game put in pepper with composure  swann jerked as violently out of his stiffened posture as he had frozen into it his face changedshowed comprehensionreliefthen flamed with anger  pepper its a damn highhanded imposition for you to bring strangers here he burst out  well im sorry you take it that way replied pepper with deprecatory spreading of his hands he was quite cool and his little eyes held a singular gleam you never kicked before when i brought a stranger  swann fiercely threw down his cigarette  hell i told you never to bring any middleville man in here  ahuh i forgot youll have to excuse me returned pepper not with any particular regret  whats the matter with my money queried lane ironically at last removing his steady gaze from swann to the others mackay was there and holt dalrymple the boy in whom lane had lately interested himself holt resembled his sister in his dark rich coloring but his face wore a shade of sullen depression the other two young men lane had seen in middleville but they were unknown to him  pepper you beat it with your new pard snarled swarm and youll not get in here again take that from me  the mandate nettled pepper who evidently felt more deeply over this situation than had appeared on the surface  sure ill beat it returned he resentfully but see here swann be careful how you shoot off your dirty mouth its not beyond me to hand a little tip to my friend chief of police bell  you damned squealer shouted swann go aheaddo your worst youll find i pull a stroke now get out of here  with a violent action he shoved the little man out into the hall then turning to lane he pointed with shaking hand to the door  lane you couldnt be a guest of mine  swann i certainly wouldnt be retorted lane in tones that rang pepper didnt tell me you were the proprietor of thisthis joint  get out of here or ill throw you out yelled swann now beside himself with rage and he made a threatening move toward lane  dont lay a hand on me replied lane i dont want my uniform soiled  with that lane turned to dalrymple and said quietly holt i came here to find you not to play cards that was a stall come away with me you were not cut out for a card sharp or a booze fighter whats got into you that you can gamble and drink with slackers  dalrymple jammed his hat on and stepped toward the door dare you said a lot ill beat it with youand ill never come back  you bet your sweet life you wont shouted swann  hold on there dalrymple interposed mackay stepping out come across with that eightysix bucks you owe me  ii havent got it mackay rejoined the boy flushing deeply  lane ripped open his coat and jerked out his pocketbook and tore bills out of it there hardy mackay he said with deliberate scorn throwing the money on the table there are your eightysix dollarsearned in france i should think itd burn your fingers  he drew holt out into the hall where pepper waited some one slammed the door and began to curse  that ends that said colonel pepper as the three moved down the dim hall  it ends us pepper but you couldnt stop those guys with a crowbar retorted dalrymple  lane linked arms with the boy and changed the conversation while they walked back to the inn here colonel pepper left them and lane talked to holt for an hour the more he questioned holt the better he liked him and yet the more surprised was he at the sordid fact of the boys inclination toward loose living there was something perhaps that holt would not confess his health had been impaired in the service but not seriously he was getting stronger all the time his old job was waiting for him his mother and sister had enough to live on but if he had been working he could have helped them in a way to afford him great satisfaction  holt listen finally said lane with more earnestness were friendsall boys of the service are friends we might even become great pards if we had time  whats time got to do with it queried the younger man im sure id like itand know itd help me  im shot to pieces holt i wont last long  aw lane dont say that  its true and if im to help you at all it must be now you havent told me everything boynow have you  holt dropped his head  ill sayi havent he replied haltingly lanethe trouble isim clean gone on margie maynard but her mother hates the sight of me she wont stand for me  oho so thats it ejaculated lane a light breaking in upon him well ill be darned it is serious holt does margie love you  sure she does weve always cared dont you remember how margie and i and dal and you used to go to school together and come home together and play on saturdays ever since then but lately margie and i arewe gotpretty badly mixed up  yes i remember those days replied lane dreamily and suddenly he recalled dals dark eyes somehow haunting he had to make an effort to get back to the issue at hand  if margie loves youwhy its all right go back to work and marry her  lane it cant be all right mrs maynard has handed me the mitt replied holt bitterly and margie hasnt the courage to run off with me her mother is throwing margie at swannbecause hes rich  oh lord noholtyou cant mean it exclaimed lane aghast  ill say i do mean it i know it returned holt moodily so i let gofell into the dumpsdidnt care a d what became of me  lane was genuinely shocked what a tangle he had fallen upon once again there seemed to confront him a colossal juggernaut a moving crushing intangible thing beyond his power to cope with  now what can i do queried holt in sudden hope his friend might see a way out  despairingly lane racked his brain for some word of advice or assurance if not of solution but he found none then his spirit mounted and with it passion  holt dont be a miserable coward he began in fierce scorn youre a soldier man and youve got your life to live the sun will risethe days will be long and pleasantyou can workdo something you can fish the streams in summer and climb the hills in autumn you can enjoy bah dont tell me one shallow girl means the world if margie hasnt courage enough to run off and marry youlet her go but you can never tell maybe margie will stick to you ill help you margie and i have always been friends and ill try to influence her then think of your mother and sister work for them forget yourselfyour little miserable selfish desires my god boy but its a strange life the wars left us to face i hate it so do you hate it swann and mackay giving nothing and getting all so it looks but its falsefalse god did not intend men to live solely for their bodies a balance must be struck they have got to pay their time will come as for you the harder this job is the fiercer you should be ive got to die holt but if i could live id show these slackers these fickle wild girls what theyre doing you can do it holt its the greatest part any man could be called upon to play it will prove the difference between you and them  holt dalrymple crushed lanes hand in both his own on his face was a glowhis dark eyes flashed lanethatll be about all he burst out with a kind of breathlessness then his head high he stalked out  the next day was bad lane suffered from both overexertion and intensity of emotion he remained at home all day in bed most of the time at supper time he went downstairs to find lorna pirouetting in a new dress more abbreviated at top and bottom than any costume he had seen her wear the effect struck him at an inopportune time he told her flatly that she looked like a french grisette of the music halls and ought to be ashamed to be seen in such attire  daren i dont think youre a good judge of clothes these days she observed complacently the boys will say i look spiffy in this  so many times lornas trenchant remarks silenced lane she hit the nail on the head practical logical inevitable were some of her speeches she knew what men wanted that was the pith of her meaning what else mattered  but lorna suppose you dont look nice he questioned  i do look nice she retorted  you dont look anything of the kind  whats nice its only a word it doesnt mean much in my young life  where are you going tonight he asked sitting down to the table  to the armorybasketball gameand dance afterward  with whom  with harry i suppose that pleases you big brother  yes it does i like him i wish hed take you out oftener  take me hot dog hed kill himself to take me all the time but harrys slow he bores me then he hasnt got a car  lorna you may as well know now that im going to stop your car rides said lane losing his patience  you are not she retorted and in the glint of the eyes meeting his lane saw his defeat his patience was exhausted his fear almost verified he did not mince words with his mother standing openmouthed and shocked lane gave his sister to understand what he thought of automobile rides and that as far as she was concerned they had to be stopped if she would not stop them out of respect to her mother and to him then he would resort to other measures lorna bounced up in a fury and in the sharp quarrel that followed lane realized he was dealing with flint full of fire lorna left without finishing her supper  daren thats not the way said his mother shaking her head  what is the way mother he asked throwing up his hands  i dont know unless its to see her way responded the mother sometimes i feel soso oldfashioned and ignorant before lorna maybe she is right how can we tell what makes all the young girls like that  what indeed wondered lane the question had been hammering at his mind for over a month he went back to bed weary and dejected suffering spasms of pain like blades through his lungs and grateful for the darkness almost he wished it was all overthis ordeal how puny his efforts relentlessly life marched on at midnight he was still fighting his pangs still unconquered in the night his dark room was not empty there were faces shadows moving images and pictures scenes of the war limned against the blackness at last he rested grew as free from pain as he ever grew and slept in the morning it was another day and the past was as if it were not  may the first dawned ideally springlike warm fresh fragrant with birds singing sky a clear blue and trees budding green and white  lane yielded to an impulse that had grown stronger of late his steps drew him to the little drab house where mel iden lived with her aunt on the way which led past a hedge lane gathered a bunch of violets  in the spring a young mans fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love he mused its good even for me to be alive this morning these violets the birds the fresh smells the bursting green oh well regrets are idle but just to thinki had to go through all ive knownright down to this momentto realize how stingingly sweet life is  mel answered his knock and sight of her face seemed to lift his heart with an unwonted throb had he unconsciously needed that the thought made his greeting and the tender of the violets awkward for him  violets oh and spring daren it was good of you to gather them for me i remember but i told you not to come again  yes i know you did he replied but ive disobeyed you i wanted to see you mel i didnt know how badly until i got here  you should not want to see me at all people will talk  so you care what people say of you he questioned feigning surprise  of me no i was thinking of you  you fear the poison tongues for me well they cannot harm me im beyond tongues or minds like those  she regarded him earnestly with serious gravity and slowly dawning apprehension then turning to arrange the violets in a tiny vase she shook her head  daren youre beyond me too i feel aa change in you have you had another sick spell  only for a day off and on im really pretty well today but i have changed i feel that yet i dont know how  lane could talk to her she stirred him drew him out of himself he felt a strange desire for her sympathy and a keen curiosity concerning her opinions  i thought maybe youd been ill again or perhaps upset by the consequences of youryour action at fanchon smiths party  who told you of that he asked in surprise  dal she was here yesterday she will come in spite of me  so will i interposed lane  she shook her head no its different for a man ive missed the girls no one but dal ever comes i thought margie would be true to meno matter what had befallen dal comes and oh daren she is good she helps me so she told me what you did at fanchons party  she did well whats your verdict he queried grimly that break queered me in middleville  i agree with what doctor wallace said to his congregation returned mel  as lane met the blue fire of her eyes he experienced another singularly deep and profound thrill as if the very depths of him had been stirred he seemed to have suddenly discovered mel iden  doctor wallace did back me up said lane with a smile but no one else did  dont be so sure of that harsh conditions require harsh measures dal said you killed the camelwalk dance in middleville  it surely was a disgusting sight returned lane with a grimace mel i just saw red that night  daren she asked wistfully following her own train of thought do you know that most of the girls consider me an outcast fanchon rides past me with her head up in the air helen wrapp cuts me margie looks to see if her mother is watching when she bows to me isnt it strange daren how things turn out maybe my old friends are right but i dont feel that i am what they think i am i would do what i didover and over  her eyes darkened under his gaze and a slow crimson tide stained her white face  i understand you mel he said swiftly you must forgive me that i didnt understand at once and i think you are infinitely better finer purer than these selfsame girls who scorn you  daren youunderstand she faltered  and just as swiftly he told her the revelation that thinking had brought to him  when he had finished she looked at him for a long while yes daren she finally said you understand and you have made me understand i always feltand her hand went to her heartbut my mind did not grasp oh daren how i thank you and she held her hands out to him  lane grasped the outstretched hands and loosed the leaping thought her words and action created  mel let me give your boy a fathera name  no blow could have made her shrink so palpably it passedthat shame her lips parted and other emotions claimed her  darenyou wouldmarry me she gasped  i am asking you to be my wife for your childs sake he replied  her head bowed she sank against him trembling her hands clung tightly to his lane divined something of her agitation from the feel of her slender form and then again that deep and profound thrill ran over him it was followed by an instinct to wrap her in his arms to hold her to share her trouble and to protect her  strong reserve force suddenly came to mel she drew away from lane still quivering but composed  daren all my life ill thank you and bless you for that offer she said very low but of course it is impossible  she disengaged her hands and turning away looked out of the window lane rather weakly sat down what had come over him his blood seemed bursting in his veins then he gazed round the dingy little parlor and at this girl of twenty whose beauty did not harmonize with her surroundings fairhaired whitefaced violeteyed she emanated tragedy he watched her profile clear cut as a cameo fine brow straight nose sensitive lips strong chin she was biting those tremulous lips and when she turned again to him they were red the shortbowed upper lip full and sweet the lower with its sensitive droop at the corner eloquent of sorrowall at once lane realized he wanted to kiss that mouth more than he had ever wanted anything the moment was sudden and terrible for it meant lovelove such as he had never known  daren she said turning tell me how you got the croix de guerre  by the look of her and the hand that moved toward his breast lane felt his power over her he began his story and it was as if he heard some one else talking when he had finished she asked the french army honored you why not the american  it was never reported  how strange who was your officer  youll laugh when you hear he replied without hint of laugh himself heavens how things come about my officer was from middleville  daren who she asked quickly her eyes darkening with thought  captain vane thesel  how singular to lane the fact she did not laugh she only stared then it seemed part of her warmth and glow her subtle response to his emotion slowly receded he felt what he could not see  oh he vane thesel she said without wonder or surprise or displeasure or any expression lane anticipated  her strange detachment stirred a hideous thoughtcould thesel have been but lane killed the culmination of that thought not however before dark fiery jealousy touched him with fangs new to his endurance  to drive it away lane launched into more narrative of the war and as he talked he gradually forgot himself it might be hateful to rake up the burning threads of memory for the curious and the soulless but to tell mel iden it was a keen strange delight he watched the changes of her expression he learned to bring out the horror sadness glory that abided in her heart and at last he cut himself off abruptly but i must save something for another day  that broke the spell  no you must never come back  he picked up his hat and his stick  mel would you shut the door in my face  no darenbut ill not open it she replied resolutely  why  you must not come  for my sakeor yours  both our sakes  he backed out on the little porch and looked at her as she stood there beyond him indeed were his emotions then sad as she seemed he wanted to make her suffer morean inexplicable and shameful desire  mel you and i are alike he said  oh no daren you are noble and i am  mel in my dreams i see myself standingplodding along the dark shores of a riverthat river of tears which runs down the vast naked stretch of our inner lives i see you now on the opposite shore let us reach our hands acrossfor the babys sake  daren it is a beautiful thought but itit cant be she whispered  then let me come to see you when i needwhen im down he begged  no  mel what harm can it dojust to let me come  nodont ask me daren i am no stone  youll be sorry when im out there inwoodlawn that wont be long  that broke her courage and her restraint  come then she whispered in tears     chapter viii   lanes intentions and his spirit were too great for his endurance it was some time before he got downtown again and upon entering the inn he was told some one had just called him on the telephone  hello this is lane he answered who called me  its blair came the reply how are you old top  not so well ive been down and out  sorry suppose thats why you havent called me up for so long  well buddy i cant lay it all to that and howre you  the answer did not come so lane repeated his query  well im still hobbling round on one leg replied blair  thats good tell me about reddie  again the reply was long in coming  havent you heardabout red  no  havent seen the newspapers lately  i never read the papers blair  righto but i had to buck up now dare  all right shoot it quick returned lane feeling his breast contract and his skin tighten with a chill  red payson has gone west  blair you dont meandead exclaimed lane  yes reddies goneand i guess its just as well poor devil  how when  two days ago according to papers he died in washington dc fell down in the vestibule of one of the government officeswhere he was waiting fell with another hemorrhageand died right thereon the floorquick  mygod gasped lane  yes its tough you see dare i couldnt keep reddie here heaven knows i tried but he wouldnt stay im afraid he heard my mother complaining say dare suppose i have somebody drive me in town to see you  id like that blair  youre on and say ive another idea tonights the junior promdid you know that  no i didnt  well it is suppose we go up my sister can get me cards i tell you dare id like to see whats going on in that bunch ive heard a lot and seen some things  did you hear how i mussed up fanchon smiths party  you bet i did thats one reason i want to see some of this dancing will you go  yes i can stand it if you can  all right buddy ill meet you at the inneight oclock  lane slowly made his way to a secluded corner of the lobby where he sat down red payson dead lane felt that he should not have been surprised or shocked but he was both the strange cold sensation gradually wore away and with it the slight trembling of his limbs a mournful procession of thoughts and images returned to his mind and he sat and brooded  at the hour of his appointment with his friend lane went to the front of the lobby blair was on time he hobbled in erect and martial of bearing despite the crutch and his dark citizens suit emphasized the whiteness of his face being home had softened blair a little yet the pride and tragic bitterness were there but when blair espied lane a warmth burned out of the havoc in his face lanes conscience gave him a twinge it dawned upon him that neither his spells of illness nor his distress over his sister lorna nor his obsession to see and understand what the young people were doing could hold him wholly excusable for having neglected his comrade  their handclasp was close almost fierce and neither spoke at once but they looked intently into each others faces emotion stormed lanes heart he realized that blair loved him and that he loved blairand that between them was a measureless bond a something only separation could make tangible but little of what they felt came out in their greetings  dare why the devil dont you can that uniform demanded blair cheerfully people might recognize youve been over there  well blair i expected youd have a cork leg by this time said lane  nothing doing returned the other i want to be perpetually reminded that i was in the war this forget the war propaganda we see and hear all over acts kind of queer on a soldier lets find a bench away from these people  after they were comfortably seated blair went on do you know dare i dont miss my leg so much when im crutching around but when i try to sit down or get up by heck sometimes i forget its gone and sometimes i want to scratch my lost foot isnt that hell  ill say so buddy returned lane with a laugh  read this said blair taking a paper from his pocket and indicating a column  whereupon lane read a brief associated press dispatch from washington dc stating that one payson disabled soldier of twentyfive suffering with tuberculosis caused by gassed lungs had come to washington to make in person a protest and appeal that had been unanswered in letters he wanted money from the government to enable him to travel west to a dry climate where doctors assured him he might get well he made his statement to several clerks and officials and waited all day in the vestibule of the department suddenly he was seized with a hemorrhage and falling on the floor died before aid could be summoned  without a word lane handed the paper back to his friend  red was a queer duck said blair rather hoarsely you remember when i phoned you last over two weeks ago well just after that red got bad on my hands he wouldnt accept charity he said and he wanted to beat it he got wise to my mother he wouldnt give up trying to get money from the governmentback money owed him he sworeand the idea of being turned down at home seemed to obsess him i talked and cussed myself weak no good red beat it soon after thatbeat it from middleville on a freight train and i never heard a word from him not a word  blair cant you see it reds way queried lane sadly  yes i can responded blair but hell he might have gotten well doc bronson said red had a chance i could have borrowed enough money to get him out west red wouldnt take it  and he ran offexposed himself to cold and starvationoverexertion and anger added lane  exactly brought on that hemorrhage and croaked all for nothing  no blair all for a principle observed lane red was fired out of the hospital without a dollar there was something terribly wrong  wrong god almighty burst out blair with hard passion let me read you something in this same paper with shaking hands he unfolded it searched until he found what he wanted and began to read  if the actual needs of disabled veterans require the expenditure of much money then unquestionably a majority of the taxpayers of the country will favor spending it despite the insistent demand for economy in washington that is arising from every part of the country no member of house or senate will have occasion to fear that he is running counter to popular opinion when eventually he votes to take generous care of disabled soldiers  blairs trembling voice ceased and then twisting the newspaper into a rope he turned to lane dare can you understand that red payson was a bullheaded boy not over bright but you and i have some intelligence i hope we can allow for the immense confusion at washingtonthe senselessness of red tapethe callosity of politicians but when we remember the eloquent calls to us boysthe wonderfully worded appeals to our patriotism love of country and homethe painted posters bearing the picture of a beautiful american girlor a young mother with a babyremembering these deep passionate calls to the best in us can you understand that sort of talk now  blair i think i can replied lane thenbefore and after the draftthe whole country was at a white heat of all that the approach of war rouses fear selfpreservation love of country hate of the huns inspired patriotism and in most everybody the will to fight and to sacrifice the war was a long hideous soulracking nervedestroying time when it ended and the wild period of joy and relief had its run then all that pertained to the war sickened and wearied and disgusted the majority of people its forget the war you and payson and i got home a year too late  thenits justmonstrous said blair heavily  thats all blair just monstrous but we cant beat our spirits out against this wall no one can understand ushow alone we are lets forget thatthis wallthis thing called government shall we spend what time we have to live always in a thunderous atmosphere of mindhating pondering bitter  no ill make a compact with you returned blair with flashing eyes never to speak again of thatso long as we live  never to a living soul rejoined lane with a ring in his voice  they shook hands much the same as when they had met half an hour earlier  so exclaimed blair with a deep breath and now dare tell me how you made out with helen you cut me short over the phone  blair that day coming into new york on the ship you didnt put it half strong enough replied lane then he told blair about the call he had made upon helen and what had transpired at her studio  blair did not voice the scorn that his eyes expressed and in fact most of his talking was confined to asking questions lane found it easy enough to unburden himself though he did not mention his calls on mel iden or colonel peppers disclosures  well i guess its high time we were meandering up to the hall said blair consulting his watch im curious about this prom think were in for a jolt its four years since i went to a prom now both of us dare have a sister wholl be there besides all our old friends and were not dancing but i want to look on theyve got an outoftown orchestra cominga jazz orchestra therell probably be a hot time in the old town tonight  lorna did not tell me replied lane as they got up to go but i suppose shed rather i didnt know weve clashed a good deal lately  dare i hear lots of talk said blair margaret is chummy with me and some of her friends are always out at the house i hear dick swann is rushing lorna think hes doing it on the qt  i know he is blair but i cant catch them together returned lane lorna is working now swann got her the job  looks bad to me replied blair soberly swann is cutting a swath i hear his old man is sore on him id take lorna out of that office quick  maybe you would declared lane grimly for all the influence or power i have over lorna i might as well not exist  they walked silently along the street for a little while lane had to accommodate his step to the slower movement of his crippled friend blairs crutch tapped over the stone pavement and clicked over the curbs they crossed the railroad tracks and turned off the main street to go down a couple of blocks  shades of the past exclaimed blair as they reached a big brick building welllighted in front by a sizzling electric lamp the night was rather warm and clouds of insects were wheeling round the light the moths and the flame added blair satirically well dare old bunkie brace up and well go over the top this ought to be fun for us  i dont see it replied lane ill be about as welcome as a bull in a china shop  oh i didnt mean any one would throw fits over us responded blair but we ought to get some fun out of the fact  what fact queried lane puzzled  rather farfetched maybe but ill get a kick out of looking onwatching these swell slackers with the girls we fought for  wonder why they didnt give the dance at the armory where theyd not have to climb stairs and have more room queried lane as they went in under the big light  dare youre far back in the past said blair sardonically the armory is on the ground floorone big hallopen you know the assembly hall is a regular maze for rooms and stairways  blair labored up the stairway with lanes help at last they reached the floor from which had blared the strains of jazz wide doors were open through which lane caught the flash of many colors blair produced his tickets at the door there did not appear to be any one to take them  lane experienced an indefinable thrill at the scene the air seemed to reek with a mixed perfume and cigarette smoketo resound with highkeyed youthful laughter wild and sweet and vacant above the strange discordant music then the flashing changing whirling colors of the dancers struck lane as oriental erotic bizarregorgeous golds and greens and reds striped by the conventional black suddenly the blare ceased and the shrill trilling laughter had dominance the rapid circling of forms came to a sudden stop and the dancers streamed in all directions over the floor  dare theyve called time said blair lets get inside the ropes so we can see better  the hall was not large but it was long and shaped like a letter l with pillars running down the center countless threads of manycolored strings of paper had been stretched from pillars to walls hanging down almost within reach of the dancers flags and gay bunting helped in the riotous effect of decoration the blackfaced orchestra held forth on a raised platform at the point where the hall looked two ways recesses alcoves and open doors to other rooms which the young couples were piling over each other to reach gave lane some inkling of what blair had hinted  now were out in the limelight announced blair as he halted lets stand here and run the gauntlet until the next dancethen we can find seats  almost at once a stream of gay couples enveloped them in passing bright flashing vivid faces and bare shoulders arms and breasts appeared above the short bodices of the girls few of them were gowned in white the colors seemed too garish for anything but musical comedy but the freshness the vividness of these girls seemed exhilarating the murmur the merriment touched a forgotten chord in lanes heart for a moment it seemed sweet to be there once more in a gathering where pleasure was the pursuit it breathed of what seemed long ago in a past that was infinitely more precious to remember because he had no future of hope or of ambition or dream something had happened to him that now made the sensations of the moment stingingly bittersweet the freshness and fragrance the color and excitement the beauty and gayety were not for him youth was dead he could never enter the lists with these young men many no younger than he for the favor and smile of a girl resignation had not been so difficult in the spiritual moment of realization and resolve but to be presented with one concrete and stunning actuality after another each with its mocking mighthavebeen had grown to be a terrible ordeal  lane looked for faces he knew on each side of the pillar where he and blair stood the stream of color and gayety flowed helen and margaret maynard went by on the far edge of that stream across the hall he caught a glimpse of the flashing golden beauty of bessy bell then near at hand he recognized fanchon smith a petite smugfaced little brunette with naked shoulders bulging out of a piebald gown she espied lane and her face froze then there were familiar faces near and far to which lane could not attach names  all at once he became aware that other of his senses besides sight were being stimulated he had been hearing without distinguishing what he heard and curiously he listened still with that strange knock of memory at his heart everybody was talking some low some high all in the spirit of the hour and in one moment he had heard that which killed the false enchantment  not a chance  hot dogshes some jane  now to the clinch  whatll we do till the next spiel  have a shot  boys its only the shank of the evening leave something peppy for the finish  mame you look like a million dollars in that rag  she shakes a mean shimmy believe me  that egg not on your life  cut the next with ned well sneak down and take a ride in my car  oh spiffy  lanes acutely strained attention was diverted by blairs voice  look whos with my sister margie  lane turned to look through an open space in the dispersing stream blairs sister was passing with dick swann elegantly and fastidiously attired the young millionaire appeared to be attentive to his partner margaret stood out rather strikingly from the other girls near her by reason of the simplicity and modesty of her dress she did not look so much bored as discontented lane saw her eyes rove to and fro from the entrance of the hall when she espied lane she nodded and spoke with a smile and made an evident move toward him but was restrained by swann he led her past lane and blair without so much as glancing in their direction lane heard blair swear  dare if my mother throws marg at thatslacker ill block the deal if its the last thing i ever do he declared violently  and ill help you replied lane instantly  i know margie hates him  blair your sister is in love with holt dalrymple  no not really thought that was only a boyandgirl affair aha the nigger music again lets find a seat dare  saxophone trombone piccolo snaredrum and other barbaric instruments opened with a brazen defiance of music and a vibrant assurance of quick raw strong sounds lane himself felt the stirring effect upon his nerves he had difficulty in keeping still from the lines of chairs along the walls and from doors and alcoves rushed the gaycolored throng to leap to close to step to rock and sway until the floor was full of a moving mass of life  the first halfdozen couples lane studied all danced more or less as helen and swann had that day in helens studio then by way of a remarkable contrast there passed two young people who danced decently lane descried his sister lorna in the throng and when she and her partner came round in the giddy circle lane saw that she wiggled and toddled like the others lane as she passed him caught a glance of her eyes flashing reproachful furious directed at some one across her partners shoulder lane followed that glance and saw swann apparently he did not notice lorna and was absorbed in the dance with his own partner helen wrapp this byplay further excited lanes curiosity on the whole it was an ungraceful violent mob almost totally lacking in restraint whirling kicking swaying clasping instinctively physical crude vulgar and wild down the line of chairs from his position lane saw the chaperones of the prom no doubt mothers of some of these girls lane wondered at them with sincere and persistent amaze if they were respectable and had even a slight degree of intelligence how could they look on at this dance with complacence perhaps after all the young people were not wholly to blame for an abnormal expression of instinctive action  that dance had its several encores and finally ended  margaret and holt made their way up to lane and blair the girl was now radiant it took no second glance for lane to see how matters stood with her at that moment  say beat it you two suddenly spoke up blair there comes swann hes looking for you chase yourselves now margholt leave that slacker to us  margaret gave a start a gasp she looked hard at her brother blair wore a cool smile underneath which there was sterner hidden meaning then margaret looked at lane with slow deep blush making her really beautiful  margie were for you two strong said lane with a smile go hide from swann  but ii came with him she faltered  then let him find youin other words let him get you alls fair in love and war  lane had his reward in the sweet amaze and confusion of her face as she turned away holt rushed her off amid the straggling couples  dare youre a wiz declared blair margies strong for holtim glad if we could only put swann out of the running  its a cinch returned lane with sudden heat  pard you dont know my mother if she has picked out swann for margieall ive got to say isgood night  even if we prove swann  no matter what we prove interrupted blair no matter what so long as hes out of jail my mother is money mad shed sell margie to the devil himself for gold positionthe means to queen it over these other mothers of girls  blair youreyoure a little off your nut arent you  not on your life that talk four years ago might have been irrational but nownot on your life the world has come to an end oh lord look whos coming lane did you ever in your life see such a peach as that  bessy bell had appeared coming toward them with a callow youth near her own age her dress was some soft pale blue material that was neither gaudy nor fantastical but it was far from modest lane had to echo blairs eulogy of this young specimen of the new america she simply verified and stabilized the assertion that physically the newer generations of girls were markedly more beautiful than those of any generation before  bessy either forgot to introduce her escort or did not care to she nodded a dismissal to him spoke sweetly to blair and then took the empty chair next to lane  youre having a rotten time she said leaning close to him she seemed all fragrance and airy grace and impelling life  lane had to smile how do you know  i can tell by your face now arent you  well to be honest miss bessy  for tripes sake dont be so formal she interrupted call me bessy  oh very well bessy theres no use to lie to you im not very happy at what i see here  whats the matter with itwith us she queried quickly everybodys doing it  that is no excuse besides thats not so everybody is notnot  well not what  not doing it whatever you meant by that returned lane with a laugh  tell me straight out what you think of us she shot at lane with a purple flash of her eyes  she irritated lane stirred him somehow yet she seemed wholesome full of quick response she was daring sophisticated provocative therefore lane retorted in brief blunt speech what he thought of the majority of the girls present  bessy bell did not look insulted she did not blush she did not show shame her eyes darkened her rosy mouth lost something of its soft curves  daren lane were not all rotten she said  i did not say or imply you all were he replied  she gazed up at him thoughtfully earnestly with an unconscious frank interest curiosity and reverence  you strike me funny she mused i never met a soldier like you  bessy how many soldiers have you met who have come back from france  not many only blair and you and captain thesel though i really didnt meet him he came up to me at the armory and spoke to me and tonight he cut in on roys dance roy was sore  three well thats not many replied lane not enough to get a line on two million is it  captain thesel is just like all the other fellows but youre not a bit like them  is that a compliment or otherwise  ill say its a compliment she replied with arch eyes on his  thank you  well you dont deserve it you promised to make a date with me why havent you  why child ii dont know what to say returned lane utterly disconcerted yet he liked this amazing girl i suppose i forgot but ive been ill for one reason  im sorry she said giving his arm a squeeze i heard you were badly hurt wont you tell me about youryour hurts  some day if opportunity affords i cant here thats certain  opportunity what do you want havent i handed myself out on a silver platter  lane could find no ready retort for this query he gazed at her marveling at the apparently measureless distance between her exquisite physical beauty and the spiritual beauty that should have been harmonious with it still he felt baffled by this young girl she seemed to resemble lorna yet was different in a way he could not grasp lorna had coarsened in fibre this girl was fine despite her coarse speech she did not repel  mr lane will you dance with me she asked almost wistfully she liked him and was not ashamed of it but she seemed pondering over what to make of himhow far to go  bessy i dare not exert myself to that extent he replied gently you forget i am a disabled soldier  forget that not a chance she flashed but i hoped you might dance with me oncejust a little  no i might keel over  she shivered and her eyes dilated you mean it as a joke but its no joke i read about your comradethat poor red payson  then both devil of humor and woman of fire shone in her glance daren if you did keel overyoud die in my armsnot on the floor  then another partner came up to claim her as the orchestra blurted forth and bessy leaned to the dancers clasp she shouted audaciously at lane dont forget that silver platter  lane turned to blair to find that worthy shaking his handsome head  did you hear what she said asked lane close to blairs ear  every word replied blair some kid shes like the girl in the motionpictures she comes along she meets the fellow she looks at himshe says good daythen wham into his arms my god lane is that kid good or bad  good exclaimed lane instantly  bah  goodstill returned lane but alas she is brazen unconscious of it but shes no fool that kid lorna is an absolute silly bullheaded fool i wish bessy bell was my sisteror i mean that lorna was like her  here comes swann without margie looks sore as a pup the  shut up blair i want to listen to this jazz  lane shut his eyes during the next number and listened without the disconcerting spectacle in his sight he put all the intensity of which he was capable into his attention his knowledge of music was not extensive but on the other hand it was enough to enable him to analyze this jazz neither music nor ragtime it seemed utterly barbarian in character it appealed only to primitive physical sensual instincts it could not be danced to sanely and gracefully when he opened his eyes again to see once more the disorder of dancers in spirit and action he seemed to have his analysis absolutely verified  these dances were short the encores very brief and the intermissions long perhaps the dancers needed to get their breath and rearrange their apparel  after this number lane left blair talking to friends and made his way across the hall to where he espied lorna she did not see him she looked ashamed hurt almost sullen her young friend harry was bending over talking earnestly lane caught the words lorna dear that swanns only stringing yourushing you on the sly he wont dance with you herenot while hes with that swell crowd  its a lie burst out lorna she was almost in tears  lane took her arm making her start  well kids youre having some time arent you he said cheerfully  sureare gulped harry  lorna repressed her grief but not her sullen resentment  lane pretended not to notice anything unusual and after a few casual remarks and queries he left them strolling from place to place mingling with the gay groups in the more secluded alcoves and recesses where couples appeared oblivious to eyes in the check room where a sign read check your corsets out in the wide landing where the stairway came up lane passed missing little that might have been seen or heard he did not mind that two of the chaperones stared at him in supercilious curiosity as if speculating on a possible faux pas of his at this dance both boys and girls he had met since his return to middleville and some he had known before encountered him face to face and cut him dead he heard sarcastic remarks he was an outsider a dead one a has been and a lemon but margaret was gracious to him and flossie dickerson made no bones of her regard dorothy he was relieved and glad to see was not present  lane had no particular object in mind he just wanted to rub elbows with this throng of young people this was the joy of life he had imagined he had missed while in france how much vain longing he had missed nothing he had boundlessly gained  out on this floor a railing ran round the curve of the stairway girls were sitting on it smoking cigarettes and kicking their slippershod feet their partners were lounging close lane passed by and walking to a window in the shadow he stood there presently one of the boys threw away his cigarette and said come on ironsides i gotta dance youre a rotten dancer but i love you  they ran back into the hall the young fellow who was left indolently attempted to kiss his partner who blew smoke in his face then at a louder blast of jazz they bounced away the next moment a third couple appeared probably from another door down the hall they did not observe lane the girl was slim dainty gorgeously arrayed and her keen fair face bore traces of paint wet by perspiration her companion was captain vane thesel in citizens garb wellbuilt ruddyfaced with tiny curled moustache  hurry kid he said breathlessly as he pulled at her well run down and take a spin  spiffy but lets wait till after the next she replied its harolds and i came with him  tell him it was up to him to find you  but he might get wise to a car ride  hed do the same come on returned thesel who all the time was leading her down the stairway step by step  they disappeared from the open window lane saw them go down the street and get into a car and ride away he glanced at his watch muttering this is a new stunt for dances i just wonder he watched broodingly and sombrely it was not his sister but it might just as well have been two dances and a long intermission ended before lane saw the big auto return he watched the couple get out and hurry up to disappear at the entrance then lane changed his position and stood directly at the head of the stairway under the light he had no interest in captain vane thesel he just wanted to get a close look at the girl  presently he heard steps heavy and light and a mans deep voice a girls low thrill of laughter they turned the curve in the stairway and did not see lane until they had mounted to the top  with cool steady gaze lane studied the girl her clear eyes met his if there was anything unmistakable in lanes look at her it was not from any deception on his part he tried to look into her soul her smilea strange indolent little smile remnant of excitementfaded from her face she stared and she put an instinctive hand up to her somewhat dishevelled hair then she passed on with her companion  of all the nerve she exclaimed whos that soldier boob  lane could not catch the low reply he lingered there a while longer and then returned to the hall much surprised to find it so dark he could scarcely distinguish the dancers the lights had been lowered if the dance had been violent and strange before this procedure it was now a riot in the semidarkness the dancers cut loose the paper strings had been loosened and had fallen down to become tangled with the flying feet and legs confetti swarmed like dark snowdrops in the hot air lane actually smelled the heat of bodiesa strangely stirring and yet noxious sensation a rushing murmuring shrill soundvoices laughter cries and the sliding of feet and brushing of gownsfilled the hallominous to lanes oversensitive faculties swelling unnaturally the expression of unrestrained physical abandon lane walked along the edge of this circling wrestling melee down to the corner where the orchestra held forth they seemed actuated by the same frenzy which possessed the dancers the piccolo player lay on his back on top of the piano piping his shrill notes at the ceiling and lane made sure this player was drunk on the moment then the jazz came to an end with a crash the lights flashed up the dancers clapped and stamped their pleasure  lane wound his way back to blair  ive had enough blair he said im all in lets go  righto replied blair with evident relief he reached a hand to lane to raise himself an action he rarely resorted to and awkwardly got his crutch in place they started out with lane accommodating his pace to his crippled comrade thus it happened that the two ran a gauntlet with watching young people on each side out to the open part of the hall there directly in front they encountered captain vane thesel with helen wrapp on his arm her red hair her green eyes and carmined lips the white of her voluptuous neck and arms united in a singular effect of allurement that lane felt with scorn and melancholy  helen nodded to blair and lane and evidently dragged at her escorts arm to hold him from passing on  look whos here daren old boyand blair she called and she held the officer back the malice in her green glance did not escape lane as he bowed to her she gloried in that situation captain thesel had to face them  it was blairs hand that stiffened lane they halted erect like statues with eyes that failed to see thesel he did not exist for them with a flush of annoyance he spoke and breaking from helen passed on a sudden silence in the groups nearby gave evidence that the incident had been observed then whispers rose  boys arent you dancing asked helen with a mocking sweetness let me teach you the new steps  thanks helen replied lane in sudden weariness but i couldnt go it  why did you come to blow us up again lose your nerve  yes i lost it tonightand something more  blair you shouldnt have left one of your legs in france she said turning to blair she had always hated blair a fact omnipresent now in her green eyes  blair had left courtesy and endurance in france as was evinced by the way he bent closer to helen to speak low with terrible passion  if i had it to do over againid see you and your kindyour dirtcheap crowd of painted hussies where you belongin the clutch of the huns     chapter ix   miss amanda hill teacher in the middleville high school sat wearily at her desk she was tired as tired as she had ever been on any day of the fifteen long years in which she had wrestled with the problems of school life her hair was iron gray and she bent a worn sad severe face over a mass of notes before her  at that moment she was laboring under a perplexing question that was not by any means a new one only this time it had presented itself in a less insidious manner than usual leaving no loophole for charitable imagination presently she looked up and rapped on her desk  these young ladies will remain after school is dismissed she said in her authoritative voice bessy bellrose clymergail matthewshelen tremaineruth winthrop also any other girls who are honest enough to admit knowledge of the notes found in rose clymers desk  the hush that fell over the schoolroom was broken by the gong in the main hall sounding throughout the building then followed the noise of shutting books and closing desks and the bustle and shuffling of anticipated dismissal  in a front seat sat a girl who did not arise with the others and as one by one several girls passed her desk with hurried step and embarrassed snicker she looked at them with purple blazing eyes  miss hill attended to her usual task with the papers of the days lessons and the marking of the morrows work before she glanced up at the five girls she had detained they sat in widely separated sections of the room rose clymer pretty fragile curlyhaired occupied the front seat of the end row her face had no color and her small mouth was set in painful lines four seats across from her bessy bell leaned on her desk with defiant calmness and traces of scorn still in her expressive eyes gail matthews looked frightened and helen tremaine was crying ruth winthrop bent forward with her face buried in her arms  girls began miss hill presently i know you regard me as a cross old schoolteacher  she had spoken impulsively a rare thing with her and occasioned in this instance by the painful consciousness of how she was judged when she was really so kindly disposed toward the wayward girls  girls ive tried to get into close touch with you to sympathize to be lenient but somehow ive failed she went on certainly i have failed to stop this notewriting and lately it has becomebeyond me to understand now wont you help me to get at the bottom of the matter helen it was you who told me these notes were in roses desk have you any knowledge of more  yesm said helen raising her red face iveive oneiwas afraid to ggive up  bring it to me  helen rose and came forward with an expressive little fist and opening it laid a crumpled paper upon miss hills desk as helen returned to her seat she met bessy bells fiery glance and it seemed to wither her  the teacher smoothed out the paper and began to read good heavens she breathed in amaze and pain then she turned to helen this verse is in your handwriting  yesmbut ii only copied it responded the culprit  who gave you the original  rose  where did she get it  ii dont knowmiss hill really and trutruly i dont faltered helen beginning to cry again  gail and ruth also disclaimed any knowledge of the verse except that it had been put into their hands by rose they had read it copied it written notes about it and discussed it  you three girls may go home now said miss hill sadly  the girls hastily filed out and passed the scornful bessy bell with averted heads  rose can you explain the notes found in your possession asked the teacher  yes miss hill they were written to me by different boys and girls replied rose  why do you seem to have all these writings addressed to you  i didnt get any more than any other girl but i wasnt afraid to keep mine  do you know where these verses came from before helen had them  yes miss hill  then you know who wrote them  yes  who  i wont tell replied rose deliberately she looked straight into her teachers eyes  you refuse when ive assured you ill be lenient demanded miss hill  im no tattletale roses answer was sullen  rose i ask you again a great deal depends on your answer will you tell me  the girls lip curled then she laughed in a way that made miss hill think of her as older but she kept silent  rose youre expelled until further notice miss hills voice trembled with disappointment and anger you may go now  rose gathered up her books and went into the cloakroom the door in the outer hall opened and closed  miss hill it wasnt fair exclaimed bessy bell hotly it wasnt fair rose is no worse than the other girls shes not as bad for she isnt sly and deceitful there were a dozen girls who lied when they went out helen lied ruth lied gail lied but rose told the truth so far as she went and she wouldnt tell all because she wanted to shield me  why did she want to shield you  because i wrote the verses  you mean you copied them  i composed them bessy replied coolly her blue eyes fearlessly met miss hills gaze  bessy bell ejaculated the teacher  the girl stood before her desk and from the tip of her dainty boot to the crown of her golden hair breathed forth a strange wilful and rebellious fire  miss hills lips framed to ask a certain question of bessy but she refrained and substituted another  bessy how old are you  fifteen last april  have you any intelligent idea ofdo you knowbessy how did you write those verses asked miss hill in bewilderment  i know a good deal and ive imagination replied bessy candidly  thats evident returned the teacher how long has this noteand versewriting been going on  for a year at least among us  then you caught the habit from girls gone higher up  certainly  bessys trenchant brevity was not lost upon miss hill  weve always gotten alongyou and i said miss hill feeling her way with this strange girl  its because youre kind and square and i like you  something told the teacher she had never been paid a higher compliment  bessy how much will you tell me  miss hill im in for it and ill tell you everything if only you wont punish rose replied the girl impulsively roses my best friend her fathers a mean drunken brute im afraid of what hell do if he finds out rose has a hard time  you say rose is no more guilty than the other girls  rose clymer never had an idea of her own shes just sweet and willing i hate deceitful girls every one of them wrote notes to the boysthe same kind of notesand some of them tried to write poetry most of them had a copy of the piece i wrote they had great fun over itgetting the boys to guess what girl wrote it ive written a dozen pieces before this and theyve all had them  well that explains the verses now i read in these notes about meetings with the boys  that refers to mornings before school and after school and evenings when its nice weather and the literary society  you mean the girls literary guild with rooms at the atheneum  yes but miss hill the literary part of it is bunk we meet there to dance the boys bring the girls cigarettes they smoke and sometimes the boys have something with them to drink  thesethese girlshardly in their teenssmoke and drink gasped miss hill  ill say they do replied bessy bell  whatdoes the bellgarter mean went on the teacher presently  one of the boys stole my garter and fastened a little bell to it now its going the rounds every girl who could has worn it  whats the old bench  down in the basement here at school theres a bench under the stairway in the dark the boys and girls have signals one boy will get permission to go out at a certain time and a girl from his room or another room will go out too its all arranged beforehand they meet down on the old bench  what for  they meet to spoon  i find the names hardy mackay captain thesel dick swann among these notes what can these young society men be to my pupils  some of the jealous girls have been tattling to each other and mentioning names  bessy do you imply these girls who talk have had thethe interest or attention of these young gentlemen named  yes  in what way  i mean theyve had dates to meet in the parkand other places then they go joy riding  bessy have you  yesbut only just lately  thank you bessy for youryour frankness replied miss hill drawing a long breath ill have another talk with you after i see your mother you may go now  it was an indication of miss hills mental perturbation that for once she broke her methodical routine for many years she had carried a lunchbasket to and from school for so many in fact that now on saturdays when she went to town without it she carried her left hand forward in the same position that had grown habitual to her while holding it but this afternoon as she went out she forgot the basket entirely  ill go to mrs bell soliloquized the worried schoolteacher but how to explain what i cant understand some people would call this thing just natural depravity but i love these girls as i think back every year in the early summer ive always had something of this sort of thing to puzzle over but the last few years its grown worse the war made a difference and since the warhow strange the girls are they seem to feel more theyre bolder they break out oftener they dress so immodestly yet theyre less deceitful they have no shame i can blind myself no longer to that and this last is damning proof ofof wildness some of them have taken the fatal step yetyet i seem to feel somehow bessy bell isnt bad i wonder if my hope isnt responsible for that feeling im oldfashioned this modern girl is beyond me how clearly she spoke shes a wonderful fearless terrible girl i never saw a girl so alive i cantcant understand her  in the swift swinging from one consideration of the perplexing question to another miss hills mind naturally reverted to her errand and to her possible reception mrs bell was a proud woman she had married against the wishes of her blueblooded family so rumor had it and her husband was now chief of police in middleville mrs bell had some money of her own and was slowly recovering her old position in society  it was not without misgivings that miss hill presented herself at mrs bells door and gave her card to a servant the teacher had often made thankless and misunderstood calls upon the mothers of her pupils she was admitted and shown to a living room where a woman of fair features and noble proportions greeted her  bessys teacher i presume she queried graciously yet with just that slight touch of hauteur which made miss hill feel her position  i am bessys teacher she replied with dignity can you spare me a few minutes  assuredly please be seated ive heard bessy speak of you by the way the child hasnt come home yet how late she always is  miss hill realized with a protest at the unfairness of the situation that to face this elegant lady so smiling so suave so worldly so graciously superior and to tell her some unpleasant truths about her daughter was a task by no means easy and one almost sure to prove futile but miss hill never shirked her duty and after all her motive was a hope to help bessy  mrs bell ive come on a matter of importance began miss hill but it is so delicate a one i dont know how to broach it i believe plain speaking best  here miss hill went into detail sparing not to call a spade a spade but she held back the names of the young society gentlemen mentioned in the notes miss hill was not sure of her ground there and her revelation was grave enough for any intelligent mother  really miss hill you amaze me exclaimed mrs bell bessie has fallen into bad company oh these public schools i never attended one but ive heard what they are  the public schools are not to blame replied miss hill bluntly  mrs bell gave her visitor a rather supercilious stare  may i ask you to explain  im afraid i cant explain replied miss hill conscious of a little heat ive proofs of the condition but as i cant understand it how can i explain i have my own peculiar ideas only lately ive begun to doubt them a year or so ago i would have said girls had their own way too muchtoo much time to themselvestoo much freedom but now i seem to feel life isnt like what it was a few years ago girls are bound to learn and they never learn at home thats sure the last thing a mother will do is to tell her daughter what she ought to know theres always been a shadow between most mothers and daughters and in these days of jazz it has become a wall perhaps thats why girls dont confide in their mothers mrs bell i considered it my duty to acquaint you with the truth about these verses and notes and what they imply would you care to read some of them  thank you but they wouldnt interest me in the least replied mrs bell coldly i wouldnt insult bessy or her girl friends i imagine its all some risque suggestion overheard and made much of or a few verses mischievously plagiarized im no prude miss hill i know enough not to be strict which is apparently the fault of the school system as for my own daughter i understand her perfectly and trust her implicitly i know the blood in her and i shall remove her from public school and place her in a private institution under a tutor where shell no longer be exposed to contaminating influences i thank you for your intention which im sure is kindand will you please excuse me i must dress for my bridge party good afternoon miss hill  the schoolteacher plodded homeward her eyes downcast and sad the snub given her by the mother had not hurt her as had the failure to help the daughter  i knew iti knew it ill never try again that womans mind is a wilderness where her girl is concerned how brainless these mothers are yet if id ever had a girli wonderwould i have been blind ones own bloodthat must be the reason pride could i have believed of my girl what i admitted of hers perhaps not till too late that would be so human but oh the mysterythe sadness of itthe fatality  rose clymer left the high school with the settled indifferent bitterness of one used to trouble every desire she followed turn what way she would every impulse reaching to grasp some girlish gleam of happiness resulted in the inevitable rebuke and this time it had been disgrace but rose felt she did not care if she could only deceive her father no cheerful task was it to face him shivering at the thought she resolved to elude the punishment he was sure to inflict if he learned why she had been expelled  she had no twinge of conscience she was used to slights and unkindness and did not now reflect upon the justice of her dismissal what little pleasure she got came from friendships with boys and these her father had forbidden her to have in the bitter web of her thought ran the threads that if she had pretty clothes like helen and a rich mother like bessy and a father who was not a drunkard her lot in life would have been happy  rose lived with her stepfather in three dingy rooms in the mill section of middleville she never left the wide avenues and lawns and stately residences which she had to pass on her way to and from school without contrasting them with the dirty alleys and grimy walls and squalid quarters of the workingclass she had grown up in that class but in her mind there was always a faint vague recollection of a time when her surroundings had been bright and cheerful where there had been a mother who had taught her to love beautiful things today she climbed the rickety stairs to her home and pushed open the latchless door with a revolt brooding in her mind  a man in his shirt sleeves sat by the little window  why fatherhome so early she asked  yes lass home early he replied wearily im losing my place again  he had straggling gray hair bleared eyes with an opaque glazy look and a bluish cast of countenance his chin was buried in the collar of his open shirt his shoulders sagged and he breathed heavily  one glance assured rose her father was not very much under the influence of drink and fear left her when even halfsober he was kind  so youve lost your place she asked  yes old swann is layin off  this was an untruth rose knew because the mills had never been so full and men never so in demand besides her father was an expert at his trade and could always have work  im sorry she said slowly ive been thinking lately that ill give up school and go to work in an office uptown or a department store  rose thatd be good of you he replied you could help along a lot i dont do my work so well no more but your poor mother wont rest in her grave she was so proud of you always dreamin  the lamp rose lighted showed comfortless rooms with but few articles of furniture it was with the deft fingers of long practice that the girl spread the faded tablecloth laid the dishes ground the coffee peeled the potatoes and cut the bread then presently she called her father to the meal he ate in silence having relapsed once more into the dull gloom natural to him when he had finished he took up his hat and with slow steps left the room  no more study for me mused rose and she felt both glad and sorry what will bessy say she wont like it i wonder what old hill did to her let her off easy i wont get to see bessy so much now no more afternoons in the park but ill have the evenings best of all some nice clothes to wear i might some day have a lovely gown like that miss maynard wore the night of the prom  rose washed and dried the dishes put them away and cleaned up the little kitchen in a way that spoke well for her and she did it cheerfully for in the interest of this new idea of work she forgot her trouble and discontent taking up the lamp she went to her room it contained a narrow bed a bureau a small wardrobe and a rug the walls held several pictures and some touches of color in the way of ribbons bright posters and an orangeandblue banner a photograph of bessy bell stood on the bureau and the girls beauty seemed like a light in the dingy room  rose looked in the mirror and smiled and tossed her curly head she studied the oval face framed in its mass of curls the steady grayblue eyes the soft wistful tenderly curved lips yes im pretty she said and im going to buy nice things to wear  suddenly she heard a pattering on the roof  rain what do you know about that ive got to stay in if i spoil that relic of a hat ill never have the nerve to go ask for a job  she prepared for bed and placing the lamp on the edge of the bureau she lay down to become absorbed in a paperbacked novel the millclock was striking ten when she finished there was a dreamy light in her eyes and a glow upon her face  how grand to be as beautiful as she was and turn out to be an heiress with blue blood and a lovely mother and handsome lovers dying for her  then she flung the novel against the wall  its only a book its not true  rose blew out the lamp and went to sleep  during the night she dreamed that the principal of the high school had called to see her father and she awoke trembling  the room was dark as pitch the rain pattered on the roof the wind moaned softly under the eaves a rat somewhere in the wall made a creaking noise rose hated to awaken in the middle of the night she listened for her fathers breathing and failing to hear it knew he had not yet come home often she was left alone until dawn she tried bravely to go to sleep again but found it impossible she lay there listening sensitive to every little sound the silence was almost more dreadful than the stealthy unknown noises of the night vague shapes seemed to hover over her bed somehow tonight she dreaded them more she was sixteen years old yet there abided with her the terror of the child in the dark  she cried out in her heartwhy was she alone it was so dark so silent mother mother she would nevernever say her prayers again  the brazentongued mill clock clanged the hour of two when shuffling uncertain footsteps sounded on the hollow stairs rose raised her head to listen with slow weary dragging steps her father came in then she lay back on the pillow with a sigh of relief     chapter x   in the following week rose learned that work was not to be had for the asking her love of pretty things and a desire to be independent of her father had occupied her mind to the exclusion of a consideration of what might be demanded of a girl seeking a position she had no knowledge of stenography or bookkeeping her handwriting was poor moreover references from former employers were required and as she had never been employed she was asked for recommendations from the principal of her school these of course she could not supply the stores of the better class had nothing to offer her except to put her name on the waitinglist  finally rose secured a place in a secondrate establishment on main street the work was hard it necessitated long hours and continual standing on her feet rose was not rugged enough to accustom herself to the work all at once and she was discharged this disheartened her but she kept on trying to find other employment  one day in the shopping district some one accosted her she looked up to see a young man slim elegant with a curl of his lips she remembered he raised his hat  how do you do mr swann she answered  rose are you on the way home  yes  lets go down this side street he said throwing away his cigarette ive been looking for you  they turned the corner rose felt strange to be walking alone with him but she was not embarrassed he had danced with her once and she knew his friend hardy mackay  whatre you crying about he said  im not  you have been then what for  oh nothing  come tell me  iive been disappointed  what about he was persistent and rose felt that he must be used to having his own way  it was about a job i didnt get replied rose trying to laugh  so youre looking for a job heard youd been fired by old hill gail told me i had her out last night in my new car  i could go back to school miss hill sent for me was bessy with you and gail  no gail and i were alone we had a dandy time rose will you meet me some night and take a ride itll be fine and cool  thank you mr swann its very kind of you to ask me  well will you go he queried impatiently  no she replied simply  why not  i dont want to  well thats plain enough he said changing his tone say rose youre in clarks store arent you  i was but i lost the place  hows that  i couldnt stand on my feet all day i fainted then he fired me  so youre hunting for another job inquired swann thoughtfully  yes  sorry its too bad a sweet kid like you has to work youre not strong rose well ill turn off at this corner you wont meet me tonight  no thanks  swann pulled a gold case from his pocket and extracting a cigarette tilted it in his lips as he struck a match his face wore a careless smile rose did not like he was amiable but he seemed so sure so satisfied almost as if he believed she would change her mind  rose youre turning me down cold then  take it any way you like mr swann she replied good day  rose forgot him almost the instant her back was turned he had only annoyed her and she had her stepfather to face with news of her discharge from the store her fears were verified he treated her brutally next day rose went to work in a laundry  and then very soon it seemed her school days the merry times with the boys and bessyall were far back in the past she did not meet any one who knew her nor hear from any one they had forgotten her at night after coming home from the laundry and doing the housework she was so tired that she was glad to crawl into bed  but one night a boy brought her a note it was from dick swann he asked her to go to mendlesons hall to see the movingpictures she could meet him uptown at the entrance rose told the boy to tell swann she would not come  this invitation made her thoughtful if swann had been ashamed to be seen with her he would not have invited her to go there mendlesons was a nice place all the nice people of middleville went there rose found herself thinking of the lights the music the welldressed crowd and then the pictures she loved movingpictures especially those with swift horses and cowboys and a girl who could ride all at once a wave of the old thrilling excitement rushed over her almost she regretted having sent back a refusal but she would not go with swann and it was not because she knew what kind of a young man he waswhat he wanted rose refused from dislike not scruples  then came a saturday night which seemed a climax of her troubles she was told not to come back to work until further notice and that was as bad as being discharged how could she tell her stepfather of late he had been hard with her she dared not tell him the money she earned was little enough but during his idleness it had served to keep them  rose had scarcely gone a block when she encountered dick swann he stopped herturned to walk with her it was a melancholy gift of roses that she could tell when men were even in the slightest under the influence of drink swann was not careless now or indifferent he seemed excited and gay  rose youre just the girl im looking for he said i really was going to your home got that job yet  no she replied  ive got one for you its at the telephone exchange they need an operator my dad owns the telephone company ive got a pull ill get you the place you can learn it easy nice jobshort hoursyou sit down all the timegood pay what do you say rose  ii dont knowwhat to say she faltered thanks for thinking of me  ive had you in mind for a month rose you take this job take it whether youve any use for me or not im not rotten enough to put this in your way just to make you under obligations to me  ill think about it ii do need a place my fathers out of work and heshes not easy to get along with  i tell you what rose you meet me tonight well take a spin in my car itll be fine down the river road then we can talk it over will you  rose looked at him and thought how strange it was that she did not like him any better now when she ought to  why have you tried toto rush me she asked  i like you rose  but you dont want me to meet yougo with you when ii cant feel as you do  sure i want you to rose nobody ever likes me right off maybe you will after you know me the job is yours dont make any date with me for that i say heres your chance to have a ride to win a friend take it or not its up to you i wont say another word  roses hungry lonely heart warmed toward swann he seemed like a ray of light in the gloom  ill meet you she said  they arranged the hour and then she went on her way home  the big car sped through river park rose shivered a little as she peered into the darkness of the grove then the car shot under the last electric light out into the country with the level road white in the moonlight and the river gleaming below there was a steady even rush of wind the car hummed and droned and sang and mingled with the dry scent of dust was the sweet fragrance of newmown hay far off a light twinkled or it might have been a star  swann put his arm around rose she did not shrinkshe did not repulse himshe did not move something strange happened in her mind or heart it was that moment she fell  and she fell wideeyed knowing what she was doing not in a fervor of excitement without pleasure or passion bitterly sure that it was better to be with some one she could not like than to be alone forever the wrong to herself lay only in the fact that she could not care     chapter xi   toward the end of june lanes long vigil of watchfulness from the vantagepoint at colonel peppers apartment resulted in a confirmation of his worst fears  one afternoon and evening of a warm close day in early summer he lay and crouched on the attic floor above the clubrooms from three oclock until one the next morning from time to time he had changed his position to rest but at the expiration of that protracted period of spying he was so exhausted from the physical strain and mental shock that he was unable to go home all the rest of the night he lay upon colonel peppers couch wide awake consumed by pain and distress about daylight he fell into a sleep fitful and full of nightmares to be awakened around nine oclock by pepper the old gambler evinced considerable alarm until lane explained how he happened to be there and then his feeling changed to solicitude  lane you look awful he said  if i look the way i feel its no wonder youre shocked returned lane  ahuh whatd you see queried the other curiously  when  why you numskull while you were peepin all that time  lane sombrely shook his head i couldnt tellwhat i saw i want to forget maybe in twentyfour hours ill believe it was a nightmare  humph well im here to tell you what ive seen wasnt any nightmare returned pepper with his shrewd gaze on lane but we neednt discuss that if it made an old bum like me sick what might not it do to a sensitive highminded chap like you the question is are you going to bust up that club  i am declared lane grimly  good but howwhen whats the sense in lettin them carry on any longer  i had to fight myself last night to keep from breaking in on them but i want to catch this fellow swann with my sister she wasnt there  lane dont wait for that returned pepper nervously you might never catch him and if you did  his little plump wellcaredfor hand shook as he extended it  i dont know what ill do i dont know said lane darkly more to himself  lane thisthis worry will knock you out  no matter all i ask is to stand uplong enoughto do what i want to do  go home and get some breakfastand take care of yourself replied pepper gruffly damn me if im not sorry i gave swanns secret away  oh no youre not said lane quickly but id have found it out by this time  pepper paced up and down the faded carpet his hands behind his back a plodding burdened figure  have you anydoubts left he asked suddenly  doubts echoed lane vaguely  yesdoubts youre like most of these mothers and fathers you couldnt believe you made excuses for the smokesaying there was no fire  no more doubts alas my god i saw burst out lane  all right buck up now its something to be sure youve overdone your strength you look  pepper do me a favor interposed lane as he made for the door get me an axe and leave it here in your rooms in case i want to break in on those fellows some timequickill have it ready  sure ill get you anything and i want to be around when you butt in on them  thats up to you goodbye now ill run in tomorrow if im up to it  lane went home his mind in a tumult his mother had just discovered that he had not slept in his bed and was greatly relieved to see him breakfast was waiting and after partaking of it lane felt somewhat better his mother appeared more than usually sombre worry was killing her  lorna did not sleep at home last night she said presently as if reluctantly forced to impart this information  where was she he queried blankly  she said she would stay with a friend  what friend  some girl oh its all right i suppose shes stayed away before with girl friends but what worried me  well queried lane as she paused  lorna was angry again last night and she told me if you didnt stop your nagging shed go away from home and stay said she could afford to pay her board  she told me that too replied lane slowly andim afraid she meant it  leave her alone daren  poor mother im afraid im aa worry to you as well as lorna he said gently with a hand going to her worn cheek she said nothing although her glance rested upon him with sad affection  lane clambered wearily up to his little room it had always been a refuge he leaned a moment against the wall and felt in his extremity like an animal in a trap a thousand pricking rushing sensations seemed to be on the way to his head that confusion that sensation as if his blood vessels would burst yielded to his will he sat down on his bed only the physical pains and weariness and the heartsickness abided with him these had been nothing to daunt his spirit but today was different the dark vivid terrible picture in his mind unrolled like a page yesterday was different today he seemed a changed man confronted by imperious demands time was driving onward fast  as if impelled by a dark and sinister force he slowly leaned down to pull his bag from under the bed he opened it and drew out his colts automatic gun though the june day was warm this big worn metal weapon had a cold touch he did not feel that he wanted to handle it but he did it seemed heavy a thing of subtle latent energy with singular fascination for him it brought up a dark flowing tide of memory lane shut his eyes and saw the tide flow by with its conflict and horror the feel of his gun and the recall of what it had meant to him in terrible hours drove away a wavering of will and a still voice that tried to pierce his consciousness it fixed his sinister intention he threw the gun on the bed and rising began to pace the floor  if i told what i sawno jury on earth would convict me he soliloquized but ill kill himand keep my mouth shut  plan after plan he had pondered in mindand talked over with blairsomething to thwart richard swannto give margaret the chance for happiness and love her heart cravedto put out of lornas way the evil influence that had threatened her now the solution came to him sooner or later he would catch swann with his sister in an automobile or at the club rooms or at some other questionable place he knew lorna was meeting swann he had tried to find them all to no avail what he might have done heretofore was no longer significant he knew what he meant to do now  but all at once lane was confronted with remembrance of another thing he had resolved uponequally as strong as his determination to save lornaand it was his intention to persuade mel iden to marry him  he loved his sister but not as he loved mel iden whatever had happened to lorna or might happen she would be equal to it she had the boldness the cool calculating selfishness of the general run of modern girls her reactions were vastly different front mel idens lane had lost hope of saving lornas soul he meant only to remove a baneful power from her path so that she might lean to the boy who wanted to marry her when in his sinister intent he divined the passionate hate of the soldier for the slacker he refused to listen to his conscience the way out in lornas case he had discovered but what relation had this new factor of his dilemma to mel iden he could never marry her after he had killed swann  lane went to bed and when he rested his spent body he pondered over every phase of the case reason and intelligence had their say he knew he had become morbid sick rancorous base obsessed with this iniquity and his passion to stamp on it as if it were a venomous serpent he would have liked to do some magnificent and awful deed that would show this little narrow sordid world at home the truth and burn forever on their memories the spirit of a soldier he had made a sacrifice that few understood he had no reward except a consciousness that grew more luminous and glorious in its lonely light as time went on he had endured the uttermost agonies of hell a thousand times worse than death and he had come home with love with his faith still true to what had he returned  no need for reason or intelligence to knock at the gates of his passion the war had left havoc the physical the sensual the violent the simianthese instincts engendering the day of the beast had come to dominate the people he had fought for why not go out and deliberately kill a man a libertine a slacker he would still be acting on the same principle that imbued him during the war  his thoughts drifted to mel iden strange how he loved her why because she was a lonely soul like himselfbecause she was true to her womanhoodbecause she had fallen for the same principle for which he had sacrificed allbecause she had been abandoned by family and friendsbecause she had become beautiful strange mystic tragic because despite the unnamed child the scarlet letter upon her breast she seemed to him infinitely purer than the girl who had jilted him  lane now surrendered to the enchantment of emotion embodied in the very name of mel iden he had long resisted a sweet melancholy current he had driven mel from his mind by bitter reflection on the conduct of the people who had ostracized her thought of her now of what he meant to do of the mounting love he had so strangely come to feel for her was his only source of happiness she would never know his secret love he could never tell her that but it was something to hold to his heart besides that unquenchable faith in himself in some unseen genius for faroff good  the next day lane having ascertained where joshua iden was employed betook himself that way just at the noon hour iden like so many other middleville citizens gained a livelihood by working for the rich swann in his best days he had been a master mechanic of the railroad shops at sixty he was foreman of one of the steel mills  as it chanced iden had finished his noonday meal and was resting in the shade apart from other laborers there lane remembered him in spite of the fact that the three years had aged and bowed him and lined his face  mr iden do you remember me asked lane he caught the slight averting of idens eyes from his uniform and divined how the father of mel iden hated soldiers but nothing could daunt lane  yes lane i remember you returned iden he returned lanes handclasp but not cordially  lane had mapped out in his mind this little interview taking off his hat he carefully lowered himself until his back was propped against the tree and looked frankly at iden  its warm and i tire so easily the damned huns cut me to pieces not much like i was when i used to call on mel  iden lowered his shadowed face after a moment he said no youre changed lane i heard you were gassed too  oh everything came my way mr iden and the finish isnt far off  iden shifted his legs uneasily then sat more erect and for the first time really looked at lane it was the glance of a man who had strong aversion to the class lane represented but who was fairminded and just and not without sympathy  thats too bad lane youre a young man the war hit us all i guess he said and at the last sighed heavily  its been a long pullblair maynard and i were the first to enlist and we left middleville almost immediately went on lane  he desired to plant in idens mind the fact that he had left middleville long before the wild era of soldierandgirl attraction which had created such havoc acutely sensitive as lane was he could not be sure of an alteration in idens aloofness yet there was some slight change then he talked frankly about specific phases of the war finally when he saw that he had won interest and sympathy from iden he abruptly launched his purpose  mr iden i came to ask if you will give your consent to my marrying mel  the older man shrank back as if he had been struck he stared his lower jaw dropped a dark flush reddened his cheek  what lane you must be drunk he ejaculated thickly  no i never was more earnest in my life i want to marry mel iden  why rasped out the father hoarsely  i understand mel replied lane and swiftly he told his convictions as to the meaning and cause of her sacrifice mel is good she never was bad these rotten people who see dishonor and disgrace in her have no minds no hearts mel is far above these painted barekneed girls who scorn her and i want to show them what i think of her i want to give her boy a nameso hell have a chance in the world ill not live long this is just a little thing i can do to make it easier for mel  lane you cant be the father of her child burst out iden  no i wish i were i was never anything to mel but a friend she was only a girlseventeen when i left home  so help me god muttered iden and he covered his face with his hands  say yes mr iden and ill go to mel this afternoon  no let me think lane if youre not drunk youre crazy  not at all why mr iden im perfectly rational why id glory in making that splendid girl a little happier if its possible  i drove mymy girl from her motherher home said iden slowly  yes and it was a hard cruel act replied lane sharply you were wrong you  the mill whistle cut short lanes further speech when its shrill clarion ended iden got up and shook himself as if to reestablish himself in the present  lane you come to my house tonight he said ive got to go back to work but ill thinkand we can talk it over i still live where you used to come as a boy how strange life is good day lane  lane felt more than satisfied with the result of that interview joshua iden would go home and tell mels mother and that would surely make the victory easier she would be touched in her mothers heart she would understand mel now and divine lanes mission and she would plead with her husband to consent and to bring mel back home lane was counting on that he must never even hint such a hope but nevertheless he had it he believed in it joshua iden would have the scales torn from his eyes he would never have it said that a dying soldier who owed neither him nor his daughter anything had shown more charity than he  therefore lane went early to the iden homestead a picturesque cottage across the river from riverside park the only change lane noted was a larger growth of trees and a fuller foliage it was warm twilight the frogs had begun to trill sweet and melodious sound to lane striking melancholy chords of memory joshua iden was walking on his lawn his coat off his gray head uncovered mrs iden sat on the lowroofed porch lane expected to see a sad change in her something the same as he had found in his own mother but he was hardly prepared for the frail whitehaired woman unlike the image he carried in his mind  daren lane you should have come to see me long ago was her greeting and in her voice so like mels lane recognized her some fitting reply came to him and presently the moment seemed easier for all she asked about his mother and lorna and then about blair maynard but she did not speak of his own health or condition and presently lane thought it best to come to the issue at hand  mr iden have you made up your mind toto give me what i want  yes i have lane replied iden simply youve made me see what mels mother always believed though she couldnt make it clear to me i have much to forgive that girl yet if you who owe her nothingwho have wasted your life in vain sacrificeif you can ask her to be your wife i can ask her to come back home  that was a splendid allsatisfying moment for lane by his own grief he measured his reward what had counted with joshua iden had been his faith in mels innate goodness then lane turned to the mother in the dusk he could see the working of her sad face  god bless you my boy she said you feel with a womans heart i thank you joshua has already sent word for mel to come home she will be back tomorrow you must come here to see her but daren she will never marry you  she will replied lane  you do not know mel even if you had only a day to live she would not let you wrong yourself  but when she learns how much it means to me the army ruined mel as it ruined hundreds of thousands of other girls she will let one soldier make it up to her she will let me go to my death with less bitterness  oh my poor boy i dont knowi cant tell she replied brokenly by gods goodness you have brought about one miracle who knows you might change mel for you have brought something great back from the war  mrs iden i will persuade her to marry me said lane and then mr iden we must see what is best for her and the boyin the future  aye son one lesson learned makes other lessons easy i will take mel and her mother far away from middlevillewhere no one ever heard of us  good you can all touch happiness again and now if you and mrs iden will excuse mei will go  lane bade the couple good night and slowly as might have a lame man he made his way through the gloaming out to the road and down to the bridge where as always he lingered to catch the mystic whispers of the river waters meant only for his ear stronger tonight he was closer to that nameless thing the shadows of dusk the dark murmuring river held an account with him sometime to be paid how blessed to fall to float down to that merciful oblivion     chapter xii   several days passed before lane felt himself equal to the momentous interview with mel iden after his call upon mels father and mother he was overcome by one of his sick weak spells that happily had been infrequent of late this one confined him to his room he had about fought and won it out when the old injury at the base of his spine reminded him that misfortunes did not come singly quite unexpectedly as he bent over with less than his usual caution the vertebra slipped out and lane found his body twisted like a letter s and the old pain was no less terrible for its familiarity  he got back to his bed and called his mother she sent for doctor bronson he came at once and though solicitous and kind he lectured lane for neglecting the osteopathic treatment he had advised and he sent his chauffeur for an osteopath  lane said the little physician peering severely down upon him i didnt think youd last as long as this  im tough doctorhard to kill returned lane making a wry face but i couldnt stand this pain long  itll be easier presently we can fix that spine some good treatments to strengthen ligaments and a brace to wearwe can fix that lane youve wonderful vitality  a doctor in france told me that  except for your mental condition youre in better shape now than when you came home doctor bronson peered at lane from under his shaggy brows walked to the window looked out and returned evidently deep in thought  boy whats on your mind he queried suddenly  oh lord listen to him sighed lane then he laughed my dear doctor i have nothing on my mindabsolutely nothing this world is a beautiful place middleville is fine clean progressive people are kindthoughtfulgood what could i have on my mind  you cant fool me you think the opposite of what you say lane your heart is breaking  no doctor it broke long ago  you believe so but it didnt you cant give up lane i want to tell you something im a prohibitionist myself and i respect the law but there are rare cases where whiskey will effect a cure i say that as a physician and i am convinced now that your case is one where whiskey might give you a fighting chance  doctor whatre you saying ejaculated lane wideeyed with incredulity  doctor bronson enlarged upon and emphasized his statement  i might live whispered lane my god but that is ridiculous im shot to pieces im really tired of living and i certainly wouldnt become a drunkard to save my life  at this juncture the osteopath entered putting an end to that intimate conversation doctor bronson explained the case to his colleague and fifteen minutes later lanes body was again straight also he was wringing wet with cold sweat and quivering in every muscle  gentlemenyour cure isworse thanthe disease he panted  manifestly doctor bransons interest in lane had advanced beyond the professional his tone was one of friendship when he said boy it beats hell what you can stand i dont know about you stop your worry now isnt there something you care for  yes replied lane  think of that or it or her then to the exclusion of all else and give nature a chance  doctor i cant control my thoughts  a fellow like you can do anything snapped bronson there are such men now and then human nature is strange and manifold all great men do not have statues erected in their honor most of them are unknown unsung lane you could do anythingdo you hear meanything  lane felt surprise at the force and passion of the practical little physician but he was not greatly impressed and he was glad when the two men went away he felt the insidious approach of one of his states of depressionthe black moodthe hopeless despairthe hell on earth this spell had not visited him often of late and now manifestly meant to make up for that forbearance lane put forth his intelligence his courage his spiritall in vain the onslaught of gloom and anguish was irresistible then thought of mel iden sustained himheld back this madness for the moment  every hour he lived made her dearer yet farther away it was the unattainableness of her the impossibility of a fruition of love that slowly and surely removed her on the other hand the image of her sweet face of her form of her beauty of her movementsevery recall of these physical things enhanced her charm and his love he had cherished a delusion that it was mel idens spirit alone the wonderful soul of her that had stormed his heart and won it but he found to his consternation that however he revered her soul it was the woman also who now allured him that moment of revelation to lane was a catastrophe was there no peace on earth for him what had he done to be so tortured he had a secret he must hide from mel iden he was human he was alone he needed love but this seemed madness and at the moment of full realization doctor bronsons strange words of possibility returned to haunt and flay him he might live a fierce thrill like a flame leaped from his heart along his veins and a shudder cold as ice followed it love would kill his resignation love would add to his despair mel iden could never love him he did not want her love and yet to live on and on with such love as would swell and mount from his agony with the barrier between them growing more terrible every day was more than he cared to face he would rather die  and so at length lanes black demon of despair overthrew even his thoughts of mel and fettered him there in darkness and strife of soul he was an atom under the grinding monstrous wheels of his morbid mood  sometime after endless moments or hours of lying there with crushed breast with locked thoughts hideous and forlorn with slow burn of pang and beat of heart lane heard a heavy thump on the porch outside on the hall inside on the stairs thumpthump slow and heavy it roused him it drove away the drowsy thick and thunderous atmosphere of mind it had a familiar sound blairs crutch  presently there was a knock on the door of his room and blair entered blair as always bright of eye smiling of lip erect proud selfsufficient inscrutable and sure lanes black demon stole away lane saw that blair was whiter thinner frailer a little farther on that road from which there could be no turning  hello old scout greeted blair as he sat down on the bed beside lane i need you more than any onebut it kills me to see you  same here blair replied lane comprehendingly  gosh we oughtnt be so finicky about each others looks exclaimed blair with a smile  but neither lane nor blair made further reference to the subject  each from the other assimilated some force from voice and look and presence something wanting in their contact with others these two had measured all emotions spanned in little time the extremes of life plumbed the depths and now saw each other on the heights in the presence of blair lane felt an exaltation the more blair seemed to fade away from life the more luminous and beautiful the light of his countenance for lane the crippled and dying blair was a deed of valor done a wrong expiated for the sake of others a magnificent nobility in contrast to the baseness and greed and cowardice of the selfpreservation that had doomed him lane had only to look at blair to feel something elevating in himself to know beyond all doubt that the goodness the truth the progress of man in nature and of god in his soul must grow on forever  mel iden had been in her home four days when lane first saw her there  it was a day late in june when the rich thick amber light of afternoon seemed to float in the air warm summer lay on the land the bees were humming in the rose vines over the porch mrs iden who evidently heard lanes step appeared in the path and nodding her gladness at sight of him she pointed to the open door  lane halted on the threshold the golden light of the day seemed to have entered the room and found mel it warmed the pallor of her skin and the whiteness of her dress when he had seen her before she had worn something plain and dark could a white gown and the golden glow of june effect such transformation she came slowly toward him and took his hand  daren i am home was all she could say  long hours before lane had braced himself for this ordeal it was himself he had feared not mel he played the part he had created for her imagination behind his composure his grave kind earnestness hid the subdued and scorned and unwelcome love that had come to him he held it down surrounded encompassed clamped so that he dared look into her eyes listen to her voice watch the sweet and tragic tremulousness of her lips  yes mel where you should be replied lane  it was youyour offer to marry methat melted fathers heart  mel all he needed was to be made think returned lane and that was how i made him do it  oh daren i thank you for mothers sake for minei cant tell you how much  mel please dont thank me he answered you understand and thats enough now say youll marry me mel  mel did not answer but in the look of her eyes dark humid with mysterious depths below the veil lane saw the truth he felt it in the clasp of her hands he divined it in all that so subtly emanated from the womanliness of her mel had come to love him  and all that he had endured seemed to rise and envelop heart and soul in a strange cold stillness  mel will you marry me he repeated almost dully  slowly mel withdrew her hands the query seemed to make her mistress of herself  no daren i cannot she replied and turned away to look out of a window with unseeing eyes let us talk of other things my father says he will move awaytaking me andandall of usas soon as he sells the home  no mel if youll forgive me well not talk of something else lane informed her we can argue without quarreling come over here and sit down  she came slowly as if impelled and she stood before him to lane it seemed as if she were both supplicating and inexorable  do you remember the last time we sat together on this couch she asked  no mel i dont  it was four years agoand more i was sixteen you tried to kiss me and were angry because i wouldnt let you  well wasnt i rude he exclaimed facetiously then he grew serious mel do you remember it was helens lying that came between you and meas boy and girl friends  i never knew helen wrapp what was it  its not worth recalling and would hurt younow he replied but it served to draw me helens way we were engaged when she was seventeen then came the war and the other night she laughed in my face because i was a wreck mel its beyond understanding how things work out helen has chosen the fleshpots of egypt you have chosen a lonelier and higher path and here i am in your little parlor asking you to marry me  no no no daren dont i beg of youdont talk to me this way she besought him  mel its a difference of opinion that makes arguments wars and other things he said with a cruelty in strange antithesis to the pity and tenderness he likewise felt he could hurt her he had power over her what a pang shot through his heart there would be an irresistible delight in playing on the emotions of this woman he could no more help it than the shame that surged over him at consciousness of his littleness he already loved her she was all he had left to love he would end in a day or a week or a month by worshipping her through her he was going to suffer peace would now never abide in his soul  daren you were never like thisas a boy she said in wondering distress  like what  youre hard you used to be soso gentle and nice  hard i yes mel perhaps i amhard as war hard as modern life hard as my old friends my little sister he broke off  daren do not mock me she entreated i should not have said hard but youre strange to mea something terrible flashes from you yet its only in glimpses forgive me daren i didnt mean hard  lane drew her down upon the couch so that she faced him and he did not release her hand  mel im softer than a jellyfish he said ive no bone no fiber no stamina no substance im more unstable than water im so soft im weak i cant stand pain i lie awake in the dead hours of night and i cry like a baby like a fool i weep for myself for my mother for lorna for you  hush she put a soft hand over his lips  very well ill not be bitter he went on with mounting pulse with thrill and rush of inexplicable feeling as if at last had come the person who would not be deaf to his voice mel im still the boy your schoolmate who used to pull the bow off your braid i am that boy still in heart with all the war upon my head with the years between then and now im young and old ive lived the whole gamutthe fresh call of war to youth glorious but god as false as stairs of sandthe change of blood hard long brutal debasing labor of hands of body of mind to learn to killto survive and killand go on to kill ive seen the marching of thousands of soldiersthe long strange tramp tramp tramp the beat beat beat the roll of drums the call of bugles the boom of cannon in the dark the lightnings of hell flaring across the midnight skies the thunder and chaos and torture and death and pestilence and decaythe hell of war it is not sublime there is no glory the sublimity is in mans acceptance of war not for hate or gain but love love of country home familylove of womeni fought for womenfor helen whom i imagined my ideal breaking her heart over me on the battlefield not that helen failed me but failed the ideal for which i fought my little sister lorna i fought for her and i fought for a dream that existed only in my heart lornaalas i fought for other women all womenand you mel iden and in you in your sacrifice and your strength to endure i find something healing to my sore heart i find my ideal embodied in you i find hope and faith for the future embodied in you i find  oh daren you shame me utterly she protested freeing her hands in gesture of entreaty i am outcast  to a false and rotten society yesyou are he returned but mel that society is a mass of maggots it is such women as you such men as blair who carry the spirit onward so much for that i have spoken to try to show you where i hold you i do not call youryour trouble a blunder or downfall or dishonor i call it a misfortune becausebecause  because there was not love she supplemented as he halted at fault yes that is where i wronged myself my soul i obeyed nature and nature is strong raw inevitable she seeks only her end which is concerned with the species for nature the individual perishes nature cannot be god for god has created a soul in woman and through the ages woman has advanced to hold her womanhood sacred but ever the primitive lurks in the blood and the primitive is nature soul and nature are not compatible a womans soul sanctions only love that is the only progress there ever was in life nature and war made me traitor to my soul  yes yes mel its trueand cruel what you say returned lane all the more reason why you should do what i ask i am home after the war all that was vain is vain i forget it when i can i havenot a great while left there are a few things even i can do before that time one of themthe biggest to meconcerns you you are in trouble you have a boy who can be spared much unhappiness in life if you were marriedif the boy had my namehow different the future perhaps there can be some measure of happiness for you for him there is every hope you will leave middleville you will go far away somewhere you are young you have a good education you can teach school or help your parents while the boy is growing up time is kind you will forget marry me mel for his sake  she had both hands pressed to her breast as if to stay an uncontrollable feeling her eyes dilated and wide expressed a blending of emotions  no no no she cried  lane went on just the same with other words in other vein reiterating the same importunity it was a tragic game in which he divined he must lose but the playing of it had inexplicably bittersweet pain he knew now that mel loved him no greater proof needed he than the perception of her reaction to one word on his lipswife she quivered to that like a tautly strung lyre touched by a skilful hand it fascinated her but the temptation to accept his offer for the sake of her boys future was counteracted by the very strength of her feeling for lane she would not marry him because she loved him  lane read this truth and it wrung a deeper reverence from him and he saw too the one way in which he could break her spirit make her surrender if he could stoop to it if he could take her in his arms and hold her tight and kiss her dumb and blind and make her understand his own love for her his need of her she would accede with the wondrous generosity of a womans heart but he could not do it  in the end out of sheer pity that overcame the strange delight he had in torturing her he desisted in his appeals and demands and subtle arguments the long strain left him spent and with the sudden letdown of his energy the surrender to her stronger will he fell prey at once to the sadness that more and more was encompassing him he felt an old and broken man  to this sudden change in lane mel responded with mute anxiety and fear the alteration of his spirit stunned her as he bade her goodbye she clung to him  daren forgive me she implored you dont understand oh its hard  never mind mel i guess it was just one of my dreams dont cry goodbye  but youll come again she entreated almost wildly  lane shook his head he did not trust himself to look at her then  daren you cant mean that she cried its too late for me iioh you to uplift methen to cast me down daren come back  in his heart he did not deny that cry of hers he knew he would come back knew it with stinging shame but he could not tell her it had all turned out so differently from what he had dreamed if he had not loved her he would not have felt defeat to have made her his wife would have been to protect her to possess her even after he was dead  at the last she let him go he felt her watching him and he carried her lingering clasp away with him to burn and to thrill and to haunt and yet to comfort him in lonely hours  but the next day the old spirit resurged anew and unreconciled to defeat he turned to what was left him foolish and futile hopes to bank on the single grain of good in his wayward sisters heart to trust the might of his spiritto beat down the influence of an intolerant and depraved young millionaireverily he was mad yet he believed and as a final resort he held death in his hand richard swann swaggered by lane that night in the billiard room of the bradford inn and stared sneeringly at him  ive got a date he gayly said to his sycophantic friends in a tone that would reach lanes ears  the summer night came when lane drove a hired car out the river road keeping ever in sight a red light in front of him he broke the law and endangered his life by traveling with darkened lamps  there was a crescent moon clear and exquisitely delicate in the darkening blue sky the gleaming river shone winding away under the dusky wooded hills the white road stretched ahead dimming in the distance a night for romance and lovefor a maiden at a stile and a lover who hung rapt and humble upon her whispers but that red eye before him held no romance it leered as the luxurious sedan swayed from side to side a diabolical thing with speed  lane was driving out the state highway mile after mile he calculated that in less than ten minutes swann had taken a girl from a bustling corner of middleville out into the open country in pleasant weather when the roads were good cars like swanns swerved off into the bypaths into the edge of woods in bad weather they parked along the highway darkened their lights and pulled their blinds for this great factories turned out automobiles and there might have pealed out to a nation and to god the dolorous cry of a hundred thousand ruined girls but who would hear and on the lips of girls of the present there was only the wild cry for excitement for the nameless and unknown there was a girl in swanns car and lane believed it was his sister night after night he had watched once he had actually seen lorna ride off with swann and tonight from a vantage point under the maples when he had a car ready to follow he had made sure he had seen them again  the red eye squared off at right angles to the highway and disappeared lane came to a byroad a lane lined with trees he stopped his car and got out it did not appear that he would have to walk far and he was right for presently a black object loomed against the gray obscurity it was an automobile without lights in the shadow of trees  lane halted he carried a flashlight in his left hand his gun in his right for a moment he deliberated this being abroad in the dark on an errand fraught with peril for some one had a familiar and deadly tang he was at home in this atmosphere hell itself had yawned at his feet many and many a time he was a different man here he deliberated because it was wise to forestall events he did not want to kill swann then unless in selfdefense he waited until that peculiarly quick and tight and cold settling of his nerves told of brain control over heart yet he was conscious of subdued hate of a righteous and terrible wrath held in abeyance for the sake of his sisters name and he regretted that he had imperiously demanded of himself this assurance of lornas wantonness  then he stole forward closer and closer he heard a low voice of dalliance a titter highpitched and sweetsweet and wild that was not lornas laugh the car was not swanns  lane swerved to the left and in the gloom of trees passed by noiselessly soon he encountered another caran open car with shields upas silent as if empty but the very silence of it was potent of life it cried out to the night and to lane but it was not the car he had followed  again he slipped by stealthily yet scornful of his caution who cared he might have shouted his mission to the heavens lane passed on all he caught from the second car was a faint fragrance of smoke wafted on the gentle summer breeze  another black object loomed upa larger carthe sedan lane recognized he did not bolt or hurry his footsteps made no sound crouching a little he slipped round the car to one side at the instant he reached for the handle of the door a pang shook him alas that he should be compelled to spy on lorna his little sister he saw her as a curlyheaded child adoring him perhaps it might not be lorna after all but it was for her sake that he was doing this the softer moment passed and the soldier intervened  with one swift turn and jerk he opened the doorthen flashed his light a scream rent the air in the glaring circle of light lane saw red hairgreen eyes transfixed in fearwhite shoulderswhite armswhite ringed hands suddenly flung upward helen the blood left his heart in a rush swann blinked in the light bewildered and startled  swann youll have to excuse me said lane coolly i thought you had my sister with you ive spotted her twice with you in this car it may not interest you or youryour guest but ill add that youre damned lucky not to have lorna here tonight  then he snapped off his flashlight and slamming the car door he wheeled away     chapter xiii   lane left his room and went into the shady woods where he thought the july heat would be less unendurable where the fever in his blood might abate but though it was cool and pleasant there he experienced no relief wherever he went he carried the burden of his pangs and his grim giant of unrest trod in his shadow  he could not stay long in the woods he betook himself to the hills and meadows action was beneficial for him though he soon exhausted himself he would have liked to fight out his battle that day should he go on spending his days and nights in a slowly increasing torment the longer he fought the less chance he had of victory victory there could be none what victory could be won over a strange ineradicable susceptibility to the sweetness charm mystery of a woman he plodded the fragrant fields with bent head in despair loneliness hurt him as much as anything and a new pang the fiercest and most insupportable had been added to his miseries jealousy thought of the father of mel idens child haunted him flayed him made him feel himself ignoble and base there was no help for that and this fiend of jealousy added fuel to his love only long passionate iteration of his assurance of principle and generosity subdued that frenzy and at length gave him composure perhaps this had some semblance to victory  lane returned to town weaker in one way than when he had left yet stronger in another upon the outskirts of middleville he crossed the river road and sat down upon a stone wall the afternoon was far spent and the sun blazing red lane wiped his moist face and fanned himself with his hat behind him the shade of a wooded garden or park looked inviting back in the foliage he espied the vinecovered roof of an old summer house  a fresh young voice burst upon his meditations hello daren lane  lane turned in surprise to behold a girl in white standing in the shade of trees beyond the wall somewhere he had seen that beautiful golden head the dark blue almost purple eyes  good afternoon you startled me said lane  i called you twice  indeed i beg pardon i didnt hear  dont you remember me her tone was one of pique and doubt  then he remembered her oh of course bessy bell you must forgive me ive been ill and upset lately these bad spells of mine magnify time it seems long since the junior prom  oh youre ill she returned compassionately you do look pale andwont you come in its dusty and hot there come ill take you where its nice and cool  thank you ill be glad to  she led him to a green fragrant nook where a bench with cushions stood halfhidden under heavy foliage lane caught a glimpse of a winding flagged path and in the distance a cottage among the trees  bessy do you live here he asked its pretty  yes this is my home its too damn far from town ill say im buried alive she replied passionately  the bald speech struck lane forcibly all at once he remembered bessy bell and his former interest she was a type of the heretofore inexplicable modern girl lane looked at her seeing her suddenly with a clearer vision bessy bell had a physical perfection a loveliness that needed neither spirit nor animation but life had given this girl so much more than beauty a softness of light seemed to shine round her golden head smiles played in secret behind her red lips ready to break forth and there was a haunting hint of a dimple in her round cheek on her lay the sweetness of youth subtly dawning into womanhood the flashing eyes were keen with intellect with fire full of promise and mystic charm and her beautiful supple body so plainly visible seemed quivering with sheer restless joy of movement and feeling a trace of artificial color on her face and the indelicacy of her dress but slightly counteracted lanes first impression  you promised to call me up and make a date she said and sat down close to him  yes i meant it too but bessy i was ill and then i forgot you didnt miss much  hot dog hear the man daren id throw the whole bunch down to be with you she exclaimed  at the end of that speech she paled slightly and her breath came quickly she looked bold provocative expectant yet sincere child or woman she had to be taken seriously here indeed was the mystery that had baffled lane he realized his opportunity like a flash all his former thought and conjecture about this girl returned to him  you would well im highly flattered why may i ask  because ive fallen for you she replied leaning close to him thats the main reason i guess but another is i want you to tell me all about yourselfin the war you know  id be glad toif we get to be real friends he said thoughtfully i dont understand you  and ill say i dont just get you she retorted what do you want have you forgotten the silver platter  she turned away with a restless quivering she had shown no shyness she was bold intense absolutely without fear and however stimulating or attractive the situation evidently was it was neither new nor novel to her some strange leaven worked deep in her lane could put no other interpretation on her words and actions than that she expected him to kiss her  bessy bell look at me said lane earnestly youve said a mouthful as the slang word goes im sort of surprised you remember bessy youre not a girl whose head is full of excelsior youve got brains you can think now if you really like meand i believe youtry to understand this ive been away so long all is changed i dont know how to take girls im illand unhappy but if i could be your friend and could help you a littleplease youwhy itd be good for me  daren they tell me youre going to die she returned breathlessly her glance was brooding dark pregnant with purple fire  bessy dont believe all you hear im notnot so far gone yet  they say youre game too  i hope so bessy  oh you make me think you must believe me a pill i wanted you toto fall for me hard that bunch of sapheads have spoiled me ill say daren im sick of them all they want to do is mush i like tennis riding golf i want to do things but its too hot or this or that yet theyll break their necks to carry a girl off to some roadhouse and dancedance till youre melted then they stop along the river to go bathing ive been twice you see i have to sneak away or lie to mother and say ive gone to gails or somewhere  bathing at night queried lane curiously  sure thing its spiffy in the dark  of course you took your bathing suits  hot dog that would be telling  lane dropped his head and studied the dust at his feet his heart beat thick and heavy through this girl the truth was going to be revealed to him it seemed on the moment that he could not look into her eyes she scattered his wits he tried to erase from his mind every impression of her so that he might begin anew to understand her and the very first succeeding this erasure was a singular idea that she was the opposite of romantic  bessy can you understand that it is hard for a soldier to talk of what has happened to him  ill say i can she replied  youre sorry for me he went on gently  sorry give me a chance to prove what i am daren lane  very well then i will well make a fiftyfifty bargain do you regard a promise sacred  i think i do some of the girls quarrel with me because i get sore and swear theyre not square as i try to be i hate a liar and a quitter  come thenshake hands on our bargain  she seemed thrilled excited the clasp of her little hand showed force of character she looked wonderingly up at him her appeal then was one of exquisite youth and beauty something of the baffling suggestion of an amorous expectation and response left her this child would give what she received  first then its for me to know a lot about you went on lane will you tell me  sure id trust you with anything she replied impulsively  how long have you been going with boys  oh for two years i guess i had a passionate love affair when i was thirteen she replied with the nonchalance and sophistication of experience  it was impossible for lane to take this latter remark for anything but the glib boldness of an erotic child but he was not making any assurances to himself that he was right bessy bell was fifteen years old according to time but she had the physical development of eighteen and a mental range beyond his ken the lawlessness unleashed by the war seemed embodied in this girl  with an older boy queried lane  no he was a kid of my own age i guess i outgrew ted she replied dreamily but he still tries to rush me  with whom do you go to the secret clubroomsabove whites ice cream parlor asked lane abruptly  bessy never flicked an eyelash hot dog so youre wise to that i thought it was a secret i told rose clymer those fellows werent on the level who told you i was there your sister lorna  no no one told me never mind that who took you there you neednt be afraid to trust me im going to entrust my secrets to you by and bye  i went with roy vancey the boy who was with me at helens the day i met you  bessy how often have you been to those clubrooms  three times  were you ever there alone without any girls  no i had my chance dick swann tried his damnedest to get me to go but ive no use for him  why  i just dont like him daren she replied evasively i love to have fun but i havent yet been so hard up i had to go out with some one i didnt like  has swann had my sister lorna at the club  her replies had been prompt and frank at this sudden query she seemed checked lane read in bessy bell then more of the truth of her than he had yet divined falsehood was naturally abhorrent to her to lie to her parents or teachers savored of fun and was part of the game she did not want to lie to lane but in her code she could not betray another girl especially to that girls brother  daren i promised id tell you all about myself she said  i shouldnt have asked you to give away one of your friends he returned some other time ill talk to you about lorna tell you what i know and ask you to help me save her  save her what do you mean daren she interrupted with surprise  bessy ive paid you the compliment of believing you have intelligence hasnt it occurred to you that lornaor other of her friends or yoursmight be going straight to ruin  ruin no that hadnt occurred to me i heard doctor wallace make a crack like yours mother hauled me to church the sunday after you broke up fanchon smiths dance doctor wallace didnt impress me these old people make me sick anyhow they dont understand but daren i think i get your drift so snow some more  all in a moment it seemed to lane this girl passed from surprise to gravity then to contempt and finally to humor she was fascinating  to go back to the club resumed lane bessy what did you do there  oh we toddled and shimmied cut up had an immense time ill say  what do you mean by cut up  why we just ran wild you know fool stunts once roy was sore because i kicked cigarettes out of bobs mouth but the boob was tickled stiff when i kicked for him jealous its all right with any one of the boys what you do for him but if you do the same for another boygood night  bessy had no divination of the fact that her words for lane had a clarifying significance  i suppose you played what we used to call kissing games queried lane  a sweet high trill of laughter escaped bessys red lips  daren you are funny those games are as dead as caesar this bunch of boys and girls paired off by themselves to spoon as for myself i dont mind spooning if i like the fellowand he hasnt been drinking but otherwise i hate it all the same i got what was coming to me from some of the boys of the strong arm club  why do they give it that name asked lane remembering colonel peppers remarks  why if a girl doesnt come across she gets the strong arm i had to fight like the devil that last afternoon i went there  did you fight bessy  ill say i did roy vancey is sore as a pup he hasnt been near me or called me up since  bessy will you promise to stay away from that placeand not to go joyriding with any of those boysday or nightif i meet you and tell you all about my experience in the war ill do my best to keep the time you spend with me from being tedious  its another bargain she returned deliberately if you just dont spend enough time with me to make me stuck on youthen throw me down on the level now daren  ill meet you as often as you want and ill be your friend as long as you prove to me i can be of any help or pleasure or good to you  hot dog but youre taking some job daren wont it be just spiffy well meet here afternoons and evenings when mothers out shes nutty on bridge she makes me promise i wont leave the yard so ill not have to lie to meet you daren that day at helens the minute i saw you i knew you were going to have something to do with my future  bessy a little while ago i made sure you had no romance in you replied lane with a smile now as weve gotten serious lets think hard about the future what do you want most do you care for study for books have you any gift for music do you ever think of fitting yourself for useful work or is your mind full of this jazz stuff do you just want to go from day to day like a butterfly from flower to flower just this boy and that onenot caring much whichall this frivolity you hinted of and worse living this precious time of your youth all for excitement what is it you want most  she responded with a thoughtfulness that inspired lanes hope for her this girl could be reached she was like lorna in many ways but different in mentality bessy watched the gyrations of her shapely little foot she could not keep still even in abstraction  a girl must have a good time she replied presently ive done things i hated because i couldnt bear to be left out of the fun but i like most to read and dream music makes me strange inside and to want to do great things only there are no great things to do ive never been nutty about a career like helen is and i always hated work i guessto tell on the levelwhat i want most is to be loved  with that she raised her eyes to lanes he tried to read her mind and realized that if he failed it was not because she was not baring it dropping his own gaze he pondered the girls response to his earnestness was intensely thoughtprovoking no matter how immodestly she was dressed or what she had confessed to or whether she had really expected and desired dalliance on his parthere was the truth as to her hidden yearning the seething and terrible renaissance of the modern girl seemed remarkably exemplified in bessy bell yet underneath it all hid the fundamental instinct of all women of all ages bessy wanted most to be loved was that the secret of her departure from the oldfashioned canons of modesty and reserve  bessy went on lane presently ive heard my sister speak of rose clymer is she a friend of yours too  you bet and shes the square kid  lorna told me shed been expelled from school  yes she refused to tattle  tattle what  i wrote some verses which one of the girls copied miss hill found them and raised the roof she kept us all in after school she let some of the girls off but she expelled rose and sent me home then she called on mama i dont know what she said but mama didnt let me go back ive had a hateful old tutor for a month in the fall im going to private school  and rose  rose went to work she had a hard time i never heard from her for weeks but shes a telephone operator at the exchange now she called me up one day lately and told me i hope to see her soon  about those verses bessy how did miss hill find out who wrote them  i told her then she sent me home  have you any more verses you wrote  yes a lot of them if you lend me your pencil ill write out the verse that gave miss hill heart disease  bessy took up a book that had been lying on the seat and tearing out the flyleaf she began to write her slim shapely hand flew it fascinated lane  there she said ending with a flourish and a smile  but lane foreshadowing the import of the verse took the page with reluctance then he read it verses of this significance were new to him relief came to lane in the divination that bessy could not have had experience of what she had written there was worldliness in the verse but innocence in her eyes  well bessy my heart isnt much stronger than miss hills he said finally  her merry laughter rang out  bessy what will you do for me  anything  bring me every scrap of verse you have every note youve got from boys and girls  shall i get them now  yes if its safe of course youve hidden them  mamas out i wont be a minute  away she flew under the trees out through the rose bushes a white graceful flitting figure she vanished presently she came bounding into sight again and handed lane a bundle of notes  did you keep back any he asked as he tried to find pockets enough for the collection  not one  ill go home and read them all then ill meet you here tonight at eight oclock  butive a date ill break it though  with whom  gail and a couple of boyskids  does your mother know  id tell her about gail but thats all we go for ice creamthen meet the boys and take a walk  bessy youre not going to do that sort of thing any more  lane bent over her took her hands she instinctively rebelled then slowly yielded  thats part of our bargain she asked  yes it certainly is  then i wont ever again  bessy i trust you do you understand me  ii think so  daren will you care for meif imif i do as you want me to  i do now he replied and ill care a thousand times more when you prove youre really above these things bessy ill care for you as a friendas a brotheras a man who has almost lost his faith and who sees in you some hope to keep his spirit alive im unhappy bessy perhaps you can help memake me a little happier anyway i trust you goodbye now tonight at eight oclock  lane went home to his room and earnestly gave himself up to the perusal of the writings bessy bell had given him he experienced shocks of pain and wonder between which he had to laugh all the fiendish wit of youthful ingenuity flashed forth from this verse there was a parody on tennysons break break break featuring colonel peppers famous and deplorable habit miss hill came in for a great share of opprobrium one verse if it had ever come under the eyes of the good schoolteacher would have broken her heart  lane read all bessys verses and then the packet of notes written by bessys girl friends the truth was unbelievable yet here were the proofs over bessy and her friends lane saw the dim dark shape of a ghastly phantom reaching out enfolding clutching he went downstairs to the kitchen and here he burned the writings  it ought to be told he muttered but whos going to tell it whod believe me the truth would not be comprehended by the mothers of middleville and whos to blame  it would not do lane reflected to place the blame wholly upon blind fathers and mothers though indeed they were culpable and in consideration of the subject lane excluded all except the better class of middleville it was no difficult task to understand lack of moral sense in children who were poor and unfortunate who had to work and get what pleasures they had in the streets but how about the best families where there were luxurious homes books education amusement kindness loveall the supposed stimuli needed for the proper guidance of changeful vagrant minds these good influences had failed there was a greater moral abandonment than would ever be known  before the war bessy bell would have presented the perfect type of the beautiful highly sensitive delicately organized girl so peculiarly and distinctively american she would have ripened before her time perhaps she would not have been greatly different in feeling from the oldfashioned girl only different in that she had restraint no deceit  but after the warnowwhat was bessy bell what actuated her what was the secret spring of her abnormal tendencies were they abnormal bessy was wild to abandon herself to she knew not what some glint of intelligence some force of character as exceptional in her as it was wanting in lorna some heritage of innate sacredness of person had kept bessy from the abyss she had absorbed in mind all the impurities of the day but had miraculously escaped them in body if her parents could have known bessy as lane now realized her they would have been horrified but lanes horror was fading bessy was illuminating the darkness of his mind  to understand more clearly what the war had done to bessy bell and to the millions of american girls like her it was necessary for lane to understand what the war had done to soldiers to men and to the world  lane could grasp some infinitesimal truth of the sublime and horrible change war had wrought in the souls of soldiers that change was too great for any mind but the omniscient to grasp in its entirety war had killed in some soldiers a belief in christ in others it had created one war had unleashed the old hidden primitive instincts of manhood likewise it had fired hearts to hate of hate and love of love to the supreme ideal consciousness could conceive war had brought out the monstrous in men and as well the godlike some soldiers had become cowards others heroes there were thousands of soldiers who became lions to fight hyenas to snarl beasts to debase hogs to wallow there were equally as many who were forced to fight who could not kill whose gentleness augmented under the brutal

pressed its materialism the spiritual progress of a thousand years seemed in a day to have been destroyed selfpreservation was the first law of nature and all the standards of life were abased following the terrible fever of patriotism and sacrifice and fear came the inevitable selfishness and greed and frenzy the primitive in man stalked forth the world became a place of strife  what then reflected lane could have been the effect of war upon women the mothers of the race of men the creatures whom emotions governed the beings who had the sex of tigresses the female of the species what had the war done to the generation of its periodto helen to mel iden to lorna to bessy bell had it made them what men wanted  at eight oclock that night lane kept his tryst with bessy the serene mellow light of the moon shone down upon the garden the shade appeared spotted with patches of moonlight the summer breeze rustled the leaves the insects murmured their night song romance and beauty still lived no war could kill them bessy came gliding under the trees white and graceful like a nymph fearless full of her dream ripe to be made what a man would make of her  lane talked to bessy of the war words came like magic to his lips he told her of the thunder and fire and blood and heroism of fight and agony and death he told her of himselfof his service in the hours that tried his soul bessy passed from fascinated intensity to rapture and terror she clung to lane she kissed him she wept  he told her how his ideal had been to fight for helen for lorna for her and all american girls and then he talked about what he had come home toof the shockthe realizationthe disappointment and grief he spoke of his sister lornahow he had tried so hard to make her see and had failed he importuned bessy to help him as only a girl could and lastly he brought the conversation back to her and told her bluntly what he thought of the vile verses how she dragged her girlhood pride in the filth and made of herself a byword for vicious boys he told her the truth of what real men thought and felt of women every man had a mother no war no unrest no style no fad no letdown of morals could change the truth from the dark ages women had climbed on the slow realization of freedom honor chastity as the future of nations depended upon women so did their salvation women could never again be barbarians all this modern license was a parody of love it must inevitably end in the degradation and unhappiness of those of the generation who persisted on that downward path hard indeed it would be to encounter the ridicule of girls and the indifference of boys but only through the intelligence and courage of one could there ever be any hope for the many  lane sat there under the moonlit maples and talked until he was hoarse he could not rouse a sense of shame in bessy because that had been atrophied but as he closely watched her he realized that his victory would come through the emotion he was able to arouse in her and the ultimate appeal to the clear logic of her mind  when the time came for him to go she stood before him in the clear moonlight  ive never been so excited so scared and sick so miserable and thoughtful in all my life before she said daren i know now what a soldier is what youve seenwhat youve done oh it was grand and youre going to be mymy friend daren i thought it was great to be bad i thought men liked a girl to be bad the girls nicknamed me angel bell but not because i was an angel ill tell the world now im going to try to be the girl you want me to be     chapter xiv   the time came when daren had to make a painful choice his sister lorna grew weary of his importunities and distrustful of his espionage one night she became violent and flatly told him she would not stay in the house another day with him in it then she ran out slamming the door behind her lane remained awake all night in the hope that she would return but she did not and then he knew he must make a choice  he made it lorna must not be driven from her home lane divided his money with his mother and packed his few effects mrs lane was distracted over the situation she tried to convince lane there was some kind of a law to keep a young girl home she pleaded and begged him to remain she dwelt on his ill health but lane was obdurate and not the least of his hurts was the last onea divination that in spite of his mothers distress there was a feeling of relief of which she was unconscious he assured her that he would come to see her often during the afternoons and would care as best he could for his health then he left saying he would send an expressman for the things he had packed  broodingly lane plodded down the street he had feared that sooner or later he would be forced to leave home and he had shrunk from the ordeal but now that it was over he felt a kind of relief and told himself that it was of no consequence what happened to him all that mattered was for him to achieve the few tasks he had set himself  then he thought of mel iden she had been driven from home and would know what it meant to him the longing to see her increased every disappointment left him more in need of sympathy and now it seemed he would be ashamed to go to mel iden or blair maynard such news could not long be kept from them middleville was a beehive of gossips lane had a moment of blank despair a feeling of utter sick dazed wonder at life and human nature then he lifted his head and went on  lanes first impulse was to ask colonel pepper if he could share his lodgings but upon reflection he decided otherwise he engaged a small room in a boarding house his meals which did not seem of much importance he could get anywhere  this change of residence brought lane downtown and naturally increased his activities he did not husband his strength as before nor have the leisure for bad spells home had been a place of rest he could not rest in a drab little bare room he now occupied  he became a watcher except during the stolen hours with bessy bell then he tried to be a teacher but he learned more than he thought he no longer concentrated his vigilance on his sister having failed to force that issue he bided his time sensing with melancholy portent the certainty that he would soon be confronted with the stark and hateful actuality thus he wore somewhat away from his grim resolve to kill swann that adventure on the country road when he had discovered swann with helen instead of lorna had somehow been a boon nevertheless he spied upon lorna in the summer evenings when it was possible to follow her and he dogged swanns winding and devious path as far as possible apparently swann had checked his irregularities as far as lorna was concerned still lane trusted nothing he became an almost impassive destiny with the iron consequences in his hands  days passed every other afternoon and night he spent hours with bessy bell and found a mounting happiness in the change in her a deep and ever deeper insight into the causes that had developed her the balance of his waking hours which were many he passed on the streets in the ice cream parlors and confectionery dens at the motionpicture theatres he went many and odd times to colonel peppers apartment and took a peep into the clubrooms some of these visits were fruitful but he did not see whom he expected to see there at night he haunted the parks watching and listening often he hired a cheap car and drove it down the river highway where he would note the cars he passed or met sometimes he would stop to get out and make one of his scouting detours or he would follow a car to some distant roadhouse or go to the outlying summer pavilions where popular dances were given more than once late at night he was an unseen and unbidden guest at one of the gay bathing parties strange and startling incidents seemed to gravitate toward lane he might have been predestined for this accumulation of facts how vain it seethed for wild young men and women to think they hid their tracks some trails could not be hidden  toward the end of that protracted period of surveillance lane knew that he had become infamous in the eyes of most of that younger set he had been seen too often alone watching with no apparent excuse for his presence and from here and there through bessy and colonel pepper and blair who faithfully hunted him up lane learned of the unfavorable light in which he was held society in the persons of the younger matrons took exception to lanes queer conduct and hinted of mental unbalance the young rakes and libertines avoided him and there was not a slacker among them who could meet his eye across cafe or billiard room  yet despite the peculiar species of ignominy and disgrace that middleville gossips heaped upon lanes head and the slow steady decline of his speaking acquaintance with the elite there were some who always greeted him and spoke if he gave them a chance helen wrapp never failed of a green flashing glance of mockery and enticement she smiled she beckoned she once called him to her car and asked him to ride with her to come to see her margaret maynard rose above dread of her mother and greeted lane graciously when occasion offered dorothy dalrymple and elinor always evinced such unhesitating intention of friendship that lane grew to avoid meeting them and twice when he had come face to face with mel iden her look her smile had been such that he had plunged away somewhere throbbing and thrilling to grow blind and sick and numb it was the failure of his hopes and the suffering he endured and the vain longings she inspired that heightened his love she wrote him after the last time they had passed on the streeta note that stormed lanes heart he did not answer he divined that his increasing loneliness and the sure slow decline of his health and the heartless intolerance of the same class that had ostracized her were added burdens to mel idens faithful heart he had seen it in her face read it in her note and the time would come sooner or later when he could go to her and make her marry him     chapter xv   to be a mystery is overpoweringly sweet to any girl and bessy bell was being that her sudden desire for solitude had worried her mother and her distant superiority had incited the vexation of her friends when they exerted themselves to win bessy back to her old self she looked dreamily beyond them and became more aloof doctor bronson in reply to mrs bells appeal to him looked the young woman over asked her a few questions marveled at the imperious artifice with which she evaded him and throwing up his hands said bessy was beyond him  the dark fever rising from the school yards and the playgrounds and the streets subtly poisoning the blood of bessy bell slowly lost its heat and power for the time being bessy lived in the full secret expression of her girlish adoration she was worshipping a hero she was glorifying in her sacrifice she was faithful to a man she was being a woman at first she grew pale tense quiet and seemed to be going into a decline then that stage passed and the roseleaf flush returned to her cheeks the purple fire deepened in her eyes the quivering life in all her supple young body  night after night loneliness had no fears for her if she heard a whistle on the avenue the honk of a carthe familiar old signals of the boys and girls she smiled her disdain and curling comfortably in her great chair bent her lovely head over her books  in the beginning her dreams were all of daren lane of the strangeness and glory of this soldier who spent so many secret hours with her and when the time came that she did not see him so often her dreams were just as full but gradually as the days went by other figures than lanes were limned upon her fancyvague figures of heroes knights soldiers he still dominated her romances though less personally she built around him every day brought her new strange desires  one evening in august when bessy sat alone the telephone bell rang sharply she ran to take down the receiver  hello hello that you bessy came the hurried call in a girls voice  rose oh how are you  fine but say angel i cant take time to talk something doing are you alone  yes all alone old girl  listen then and get this im here you know telephone girl at the exchange just heard your father on the wire some one has betrayed the secret of the club theres a warrant out for the arrest of the boys for gambling you know theres a political vice drive on some time tonight theyll be raided but early bess are you getting this  sure hurryhurry replied bessy in excitement  i tried to get dick on the wire but couldnt same with two more of the boys but i did get wise to this gail and lorna have a date at the club tonight never mind how i found out dick has thrown me down for gail im sore as a pup but i dont want your father to pinch those girls now bess im tied here but you get a move on dont waste time you can save them you must do something if you cant find somebody go straight to the club you know where the key for the outside entrance is kept hurry and itll be safe goodbye  bessy stood statuelike for a moment her big eyes glowing changing darkening with rapid thought then she flew upstairs to her room snatched a veil and a soft hat and putting these on as she went she flew out of the house without putting out the lights or locking the door  it was a dark windy night slightly cool for august and a fine misty rain was blowing bessys footsteps pattered softly as she ran block after block and she did not slacken her pace till she reached the house where daren lane had his room in answer to her ring a woman appeared who told her mr lane was out  this was a severe disappointment to bessy and left her an alternative that required more than courage but she did not vacillate she sped swiftly on in the dark for the electric lights were few and far between until the black of the gloomy building where the boys had their club loomed up on the corner bessy saw a man standing with his back to a telegraph pole this occasioned her much concern perhaps he might be watching the building but he had not seen her of that she was certain the possibility that he might be a spy made her task all the harder  bessy returned the way she come crossed at the next corner hurried round the block and up to the outside stairway that was her objective point  by feeling along the brick wall she brought up with a sudden bump at the back of the stairway then she deliberated if she went around to the front so as to get access to the steps she might pass in range of the loiterer whom she mistrusted that risk she would not incur examining the wall that enclosed the boxlike stairway as best she could in the dark she found it rickety full of holes and cracks and she decided she would climb it a sheer perpendicular board wall some twelve or fifteen feet high shrouded in pitchy darkness and apparently within earshot of a police spy did not daunt bessy bell slipping her strong fingers in crevices and her slim toes in cracks she climbed up and up till she got hold of the railing post on the first platform here she had great difficulty to keep from falling but lifting and squirming her supple body by a desperate effort she got her knees on the platform and then pulled herself to safety once on the stairs she ran up the remaining few steps to the landing where she rested panting and triumphant  as she was about to go on she heard footsteps which froze her a man was crossing the street he came from the direction of the corner where she had seen the supposed spy presently she saw him stop under one of the trees to scratch a match and in the round glow of light she saw him puff at a cigar then he passed on with uncertain steps as of one slightly under the influence of drink  bessys heart warmed to life and began to beat again then she sought for the key she had been told where it was but did not remember slipping her hand under the railing close to the wall she felt a string and pulling at it suddenly found the key in her hand she glided into the dim hall feeling along the wall for a door until she found it with trembling fingers she inserted the key in the lock and the door swung inward silently bessy went in leaving the key on the outside  dark as it had been without it was light compared to the ebon blackness within bessy felt ice form in the marrow of her bones the darkness was tangible it seemed to envelop her in heavy folds the sudden natural impulse to fly out of the thick creeping gloom down the stairway to the light strung her muscles for instant action but checked by the swiftly following thought of her purpose they relaxed and she took not a backward step  rose did her part and ill do mine she cogitated ive got to save them but what to doi may have to wait i knowin the big roomthe closet behind the curtain i can find that even in this dark and once in there i wont be afraid  bessy fired by this inspiration groped along the wall through the room to the large chamber stumbled over chairs and a couch and at last got her hands on the drapery she readily found the knob turned it opened the door and stepped in  i hope they wont be long she thought i hope the girls come first i dont want to burst into a room full of boys wont daren be surprised when i tell himmaybe angry but its bound to come out all right and father will never know     chapter xvi   early one august evening lane went out to find a cool misty rain blowing down from the hills at the inn he encountered colonel pepper who wore a most woebegone and ludicrous expression he pounced at once upon lane  daren what do you think he wailed miserably  i dont think i know youve gone and done itpulled that stunt of yours again returned lane  yesbut oh so much worse this time  worse how could it be worse unless you mean some one punched your head  no that would have been nothing daren thisthis time iit was a lady gasped pepper  oh say now peppernot really queried lane incredulously  it was and a lady ii admire very much  who  miss amanda hill  the schoolteacher nice little woman like that pepper why couldnt you pick on one of these middleville gossips or society dames  lordi didnt know who she wasuntil afterand i couldnt have helped it anyway he replied mopping his red face wheni saw herand she recognized mei nearly died it was at whites confectionery den and im afraid some people saw me  well you old duffer and you say you admire this lady very much  indeed i do i call on her  colonel your name is dennis replied lane with merciless humor it serves you right  the little man evidently found relief in his confession and in lanes censure  im cured forever he declared vehemently and say lane ive been looking for you have you been at my rooms latelyyou knowto take a peep  i have not replied lane turning sharply a slight chill went over him i thought that club stuff was off  offnothing whispered colonel pepper drawing lane aside swann and his strongarm gang just got foxy they quit for a while now theyre rushing the girls in theresay from four to fiveand in the evenings a little while not too late oh theyre the slick bunch picking out the ice cream soda hour when everybodys downtown you run up to my rooms right now and ill gamble  ill go interrupted lane grimly  not fifteen minutes before he had seen his sister lorna and a chum gail williams go into whites place lanes pulse quickened as he started to go he ran into blair maynard who grasped at him whats hurry old scout  blair im never in a hurry if you want me but the fact is ive got rather urgent business how about tomorrow  sure meet you here i just wanted to unload on you dare looks as if my mother has hatched it up between margie and our esteemed countryman richard swann  it was not often that lane cursed but he did so now  but blair didnt you tell your mother what this fellow is remonstrated lane  well ill say i did replied blair sardonically cut no ice whatever she didnt believe she didnt care for any proofs all rich young men had their irregularities good god doesnt it make you sick  but how about holt dalrymple  holts turned over a new leaf hes working hard and i think he has taken a tumble to himself listen to this he met margie with dick swann out at one of the lake danceswatkins lake and he cut her dead im sorry for margie she sure is rank poison these days well speak of the devil  holt dalrymple collided with them at the entrance of the inn the haggard sullen heated look that had characterized him was gone he was sunburned and his dark eyes were bright he greeted his friends warmly they chatted for a moment then lane grew thoughtful all the while gazing at holt  whats the idea queried that worthy presently anything wrong with me  boy youre just great seeing you has done me good you ask whats the idea holt would you do me a favor  would i listen to the guy returned young dalrymple daren id do any old thing for you  do you happen to know bessy bell went on lane  dalrymple quickened with surprise yes i know her some little peach i almost ran into her down on west street a few minutes ago she wore a white veil she didnt see me or recognize me but i sure knew her she was almost running i bet a million to myself she had a date at the club  you lose holt replied lane shortly bessy bell is one middleville kid who has come clean through this mess  say dare i like to hear you talk responded blair half in jest and half in earnest but arent you getting a trifle unbalanced thats how my mother apologizes for me  cut the joshing boys listen returned lane and dont ever tell this to a soul i interested myself in bessy bell ive met her more times than i can count i wanted to see if it was possible to turn one of these girls around i failed on my sister lorna but bessy bell is true blue she had all this modern tommyrot she had everything else too brains sweetness common sense romance all i tried to do was to make her forget the tommyrot and i think i did  well ill be darned ejaculated blair dare that was ripping fine of you whatll you do next i wonder  come on with your favor added holt with a keen bright smile  would you be willing to see bessy occasionallyand sort of be nice to heryou know asked lane earnestly i cant keep up my attention to her much longer she might miss me take it from me holt back of all this modern stuffdeep in bessy and in every girl who has not been debasedis the simple and good desire to be liked  daren ill do that little thing believe me returned holt warmly  shaking hands with his friends lane left them and went on his way whites place was full as a beehive as he passed lane found himself looking for bessy bells golden head though he knew he would not see it he wondered if holt had really met her veiled and in a hurry that had a strange look but no shadow of distrust of bessy came to lane in a few moments he reached the dark stairway leading to colonel peppers apartment lane forgot he was weak but at the top with his breast laboring he remembered well enough he went into the colonels rooms and through them without making a light and when he reached the place where he had spied upon the club he was wet with sweat and shaking with excitement carefully so as not to make noise he stole to the peephole and applied his eye  he saw a gleam of light on shiny waxed floor and then moving to get the limit of his narrow vision he descried swann evidently just arrived with him was gail williams a slip of a child not over fifteenlooking up at him as if excited and pleased next lane espied his sister lorna with a tall wellbuilt man although his back was toward lane he could not mistake the soldierly bearing of captain vane thesel lorna looked perturbed and sulky and once turning her face toward swann she seemed resentful captain thesel had his hand at her elbow and appeared to be talking earnestly  lane left his post taking care to make no noise but once back in the colonels rooms he hurried feeling in the dark corner where he had kept the axe ready for just such an emergency as this he grasped it and rushed out tiptoeing down the hall he found the narrow door stole down the black stairway and entered the main hall here he paused suddenly checked in his hurry  this wont do he thought and shook his head much as id like to kill those two dogs i canti cant ill smash their faces thoughand if i ever catch  breaking the thought off abruptly he passed down the dim hallway to the door of the clubrooms he raised the axe and was about to smash the lock when he espied a key in the keyhole the door was not locked lane set down the axe and noiselessly turned the knob and peeped in the first room was dark but the door on the opposite side was ajar and through it lane saw the larger lighted room and the shiny floor moving figures crossed the space removing the key lane slipped inside the room and locked the door then he tiptoed to the opposite door  thesel and lorna were now so close that lane could hear them  but i thought i had a date with dick protested lorna her face was red and she stamped her foot  see here kiddo if youre as thick as that ill have to put you wise answered thesel goodhumoredly as he tilted back his cigarette to blow smoke at the ceiling dick is through with you  oh is he choked lorna  say cap i heard a noise suddenly called out swann rather nervously  there was a moments silence lane too had heard a noise but could not be sure whether it was inside the building or not  swann hurried over to join thesel they looked blankly at each other the air might have been charged both girls showed alarm  then lane with his hand on the gun in his pocket strode out to confront them  ohh gasped lorna as if appalled at sight of her brothers face  fellows ill have to break up your little party said lane coolly  thesel turned ghastly white while swann grew livid with rage he seemed to expand his hand went back to his right hip  when lane got within six feet of them swann drew a small automatic pistol but before he could raise it lane had leaped into startling activity with terrific swing he brought his gun down on swanns face then as swiftly he turned on thesel swann had hardly hit the floor a sodden heap when thesel with bloody visage reeled and fell like a log lane bent over them ready to beat either back but both were unconscious  darenfor gods sakedont murder them whispered lorna hoarsely  lanes humanity was in abeyance then but his selfcontrol did not desert him  you girls must hurry out of here he ordered  oh gail is fainting cried lorna  the little williams girl was indeed swaying and sinking down lane grasped her and shook her brace up if you keel over now youll be found out sure its all right youll not be hurt there  a heavy thumping on the door by which lane had entered and a loud authoritative voice from the hall silenced him  open up here youre pinched  that voice lane recognized as belonging to chief of police bell for a moment fraught with suspense lane was at a loss to know what to do  open up weve got the place surrounded open up or well smash the door in  lane whispered to the girls is there a place to hide you  the williams girl was beyond answering but lorna despite her terror had not lost her wits  yestheres a closethid by a curtainhere she whispered pointing  lane half carried gail lorna brushed aside a heavy curtain and opened a door lane pushed both girls into the black void and closed the door after them  once moreopen up bellowed the officer in the hall accompanying his demand with a thump on the door lane made sure some one had found his axe he did not care how much smashing the policemen did all that concerned lane then was how to avert discovery from the girls it looked hopeless then as there came sudden splintering blows on the door lane espied swanns cigarettes and matches on the music box lane seldom smoked but while the officers were breaking in the door lane leisurely lighted a cigarette and when two of them came in he faced them coolly  the first was chief bell a large handsome man in blue uniform the second one was a patrolman neither carried a weapon in sight bell swept the big room in one flashing blue glancetook in lane and the prone figures on the floor  well ill be damned he ejaculated what am i up against  hello chief replied lane coolly dont get fussed up now this is no murder case  lane whats this mean burst out bell  lane was rather well acquainted with chief bell and in a way there was friendship between them bell for one had always been sturdily loyal to the soldiers  well chief i was having a little friendly game with mr swann and captain thesel drawled lane we got into an argument and as both were such ferocious fighters i grew afraid theyd hurt me badso i had to soak them  dont kid me spoke up bell derisively little gamehell wheres the cards chips table  chief i didnt say we played the game tonight  lane youre a liar replied bell thoughtfully im sure of that but youve got me buffaloed he knelt on the floor beside the fallen men and examined each swanns shirt as well as face was bloody for a crippled soldier youve got some punch left whatd you hit them with  ill tell you chief i fetched an axe with me to do the dirty job but i decided i should use a dangerous weapon only on men so i soaked them with a lollypop  lane are you really nutty demanded bell curiously  no more than you i hit them with something hard so it would leave a mark  you left one ill say thesel will lose that eyeits gone nowand swann is also disfigured for life what a damned shame  chief are you sure its any kind of a shame  lanes query appeared to provoke thought bell replaced the little automatic pistol he had picked up beside swann and rising he looked at lane  swann was a slacker thesel was your captain in the war have these facts anything to do with your motive  no chief replied lane in sarcasm but when i got into action i think the facts you mentioned sort of rejuvenated a disabled soldier  lane you beat me declared bell shaking his head why i had you figured as a pretty good chap but youve done some queer things in middleville  chief if youre an honest officer youll admit middleville needs some queer things done  bell gazed doubtfully at lane  smith search the rooms he ordered addressing his patrolman  we were alone here spoke up lane and i advise you to hurry those wounded veterans to a hospital in the rear  swann showed signs of recovering consciousness bell bent over him a moment lane had only one hopethat the patrolman would miss the door but he brushed aside the curtain then he grunted  see here chiefa doorand somebodys holding it from the inside he declared  wait smith ordered bell striding forward but before he got halfway across the room the door opened a girl stepped out and shut it back of her lane sustained a singular shock that girl was bessy bell  hello dadits bessy she said clearly she was pale but did not seem frightened  chief bell halted in the middle of a stride and staggered a little as his foot came down a low curse of utter amaze escaped his lips suddenly he became tensely animated  howd you come here he demanded towering over her  i walked  whatd you come for  to warn daren lane that you were going to raid these clubrooms tonight  who told you  i wont tell i got it over the phone i ran over here i knew where the key was ive been here beforeafternoonsdancing i let myself in but when theythey came i got frightened and hid in the closet  chief bell seemed about to give way to passion but he controlled it after that moment he changed subtly  is daren lane your friend he demanded  yes the best and truest any girl ever had dad you know mother told you i had changed lately i have and its through daren  whered you see him  he has been coming out to the house in the afternoons  well im damned muttered the chief and wheeled away sight of his gaping patrolman seemed to galvanize him into further realization of the situation smith beat it out and draw the other men round in front give me time enough to get bessy out send hurry call for ambulance and smith keep your mouth shut ill make it all right if mrs bell hears of this my life will be a hell on earth  mums the word chief im a married man myself he replied and hurried out  lane was watching bessy what a wonderful girl modern tendencies might have corrupted the girls of the day but for sheer nerve wit and courage they were immeasurably superior to those of former generations bessy faced her father calmly lied magnificently gazed down at the ghastly bloody faces with scarcely a shudder and gave lane a smile from her purple eyes as if to cheer him to assure him she could save the situation it struck lane that chief bell looked as if he might be following a similar line of thought  bessy put on your hat ordered bell and here  tuck that veil around there now you beat it for home lane go with her to the stairs take a good look in the street bessy go home the back way and lane you hurry back  lane followed bessy out and caught up with her in the hall she clasped his arm  some adventure ill say she burst out in breathless whisper it was great until i recognized your voice then all inside me went flooey  bessy youre the finest little girl in the world returned lane stirred to emotion  here daren cut that you didnt raise me on soft soap and mush if you get to praising me ill fall so far ill never light now dare go back and fool dad you must save the girls it doesnt matter about me hes my dad  ill do my best replied lane  they reached the landing of the outside stairway peering down lane did not see any one  i guess the coast is clear now beat it bessy  she lifted the white veil and raised her face in the dim gray light lane saw it as never before  kiss me daren she whispered  lane had never kissed her for an instant he was confused  whylittle girl he exclaimed  hurry she whispered imperiously  some instinct beyond lanes ken prompted him to do what she asked  goodbye my little princess he whispered dont ever forget me  never daren goodbye she slipped down the stairway and in a moment more vanished in the gray gloom of the misty night  only then did lane understand what she with her womans intuition had divinedthat they would never be together again the realization gave him a pang bessy was his only victory  slowly lane made his way back to the clubrooms he had begun to weaken under the strain and felt the approach of something akin to collapse when he reached the large room he found swann half conscious and thesel showing signs of coming to  lane come here said the chief drawing lane away from the writhing forms on the floor youre under arrest  yes sir whats the charge  lets see thats the puzzler replied the chief scratching his head suppose we say gambling and fighting  fine granted lane with a smile  when the ambulance comes you get out of sight until we pack these fellows out ill leave the door openso if theres any reason you want to come backwhy  chief bell half averted his face seemingly not embarrassed but rather pondering in thought thanks chief you understand me perfectly responded lane ill appear at police headquarters in half an hour  the officer laughed and returning to the injured men he knelt beside them swann sat up moaning blood had blinded his sight he did not see lane pass sounds of an ambulance bell had caught lanes quick ear finding the washroom he went in and locking the door leaned there to wait in a very few moments the injured swann and thesel had been carried out lane waited five minutes after the sound of wheels had died away then he hurried out and opened the door of the closet  lorna almost fell over him in her eagerness if she had been frightened she had recovered gail staggered out pale and sick looking  oh daren can you get us out whispered lorna breathlessly  hurry and dont talk replied lane  he led them out into the hall and down to the stairway where he had taken bessy as before all appeared quiet below  i guess its safe girls let this be a lesson to you  never any more for mine whimpered gail  but lorna was of more tempered metal  believe me daren im glad you knocked the lamps out of those swell boobs she whispered passionately dick swann used me like dirt the next guy like him who tries to get gay with me will have some fall ill tell the world me for harry theres nothing in this qt stuff and say what do you know about bessy bell she came here to save us hot dog but shes a peach  lane admonished the girls to hurry and watched them until they reached the street and turned the corner out of sight     chapter xvii   the reaction from that night landed lane in the hospital where during long weeks when he did have a lucid interval he saw that his life was despaired of and felt that he was glad of it  but he did not die as before the weak places in his lungs healed over and he began to mend and gradually his periods of rationality increased until he wholly gained his mental poise it was however a long time before he was strong enough to leave the hospital  during the worst of his illness his mother came often to see him after he grew better she came but seldom blair and colonel pepper were the only others who visited lane and as soon as his memory returned and interest revived he learned much peculiarly significant to him  the secret of the clubrooms so far as girls were concerned never became fully known to middleville gossips strange and contrary rumors were rife for a long time but the real truth never leaked out there was never any warrant sworn for lanes arrest what the general public had heard and believed was the story concocted by thesel and swann who claimed that lane over a gambling table had been seized by one of the frenzied fits common to deranged soldiers and had attacked them thesel lost his left eye and swann carried a hideous red scar from brow to cheek neither the clubroom scandal nor his disfigurement for life in any wise prevented mrs maynard from announcing the engagement of her daughter margaret to richard swann the most amazing news was to hear that helen wrapp had married a rich young politician named hartley who was running for the office of magistrate according to blair daren lane had divided middleville into two dissenting factions a large one who banned him in disgrace and a small one who lifted their voices in his behalf of all the endless bits of news little and big the one that broke happily on lanes ears was the word of a nurse who told him that during his severe illness a girl had called on the telephone every day to inquire for him she never gave her name but lane knew it was mel and the mere thought of her made him quiver  by the time lane was strong enough to leave the hospital an early winter had set in the hospital expenses had reduced his finances so materially that he could not afford the lodgings he had occupied before his illness he realized fully that he should leave middleville for a dry warm climate if he wanted to live a while longer but he was not greatly concerned about this there would be time enough to consider the future after he had fulfilled the one hope and ambition he had left  rooms were at a premium lane was forced to apply in the sordid quarter of middleville and the place he eventually found was a small bare hall bedroom in a large ramshackle old house of questionable repute but beggars could not be choosers there was no heat in this room and lane decided that what time he spent in it must be in bed he would not give any one his address  once installed here lane waited only a few days to assure himself that he was strong enough to carry out the plan upon which he had set his heart  late that afternoon he went to the town hall and had a marriage license made out for himself and mel iden upon returning he found that snow had begun to fall heavily already the streets were white suddenly the thought of the nearness of christmas shocked him how time sped by  that night he dressed himself carefully wearing the service uniform he had so well preserved and sallied forth to the most fashionable restaurant in middleville where in the glare and gayety he had his dinner lane recognized many of the dining dancing throng but showed no sign of it he became aware that his presence had excited comment how remote he seemed to feel himself from that eating drinking dancing crowd so far removed that even the jazz music no longer affronted him rather surprised he was to find he really enjoyed his dinner from the restaurant he engaged a taxi  the bright lights the falling snow the mantle of white on everything with their promise of the holiday season pleased lane with the memory of what great fun he used to have at christmastime  when he arrived at mels home the snow was falling thickly in heavy flakes through the pall he caught a faint light which grew brighter as he plodded toward the cottage he stamped on the porch and flapped his arms to remove the generous covering of snow that had adhered to him and as he was about to knock the door opened and mel stood in the sudden brightness  hello mel how are yousome snow eh was his cheery greeting and he went in and shut the door behind him  why darenyouyou  iwhat arent you glad to see me  lane had not prepared himself for anything he knew he could win now and all he had allowed himself was gladness but being face to face with mel made it different it had been long since he last saw her that interval had been generous to look at her now no one could have guessed her story warmth and richness of color had come back to her and vividly they expressed her joy at sight of him  gladive been livingon my hopesthat you  her faltering speech trailed off here as lane took one long stride toward her  lane put a firm hand to each of her cheeks and tilting a suddenly rosy face he kissed her full on the lips then he turned away without looking at her and stepped to the little open grate where a small red fire glowed mel gasped there behind him and then became perfectly still  nice fire mel he spoke out naturally as if nothing unusual had happened but the thin hands he extended to the warmth of the coals trembled like aspen leaves in the wind how silent she was it thrilled him what strange sweet revel in the moment  when he turned it seemed he saw her eyes her lips her whole face luminous the next instant she came out of her spell and lane divined if he let her wholly recover he would have a woman to deal with  daren whats wrong with you she inquired  why mel he ejaculated in feigned reproach  you dont look irrational but you act so she said studying him more closely the hand that had been pressed to her breast dropped down  had my last crazy spell two weeks ago he replied  until tonight  you mean my kissing you well i refuse to apologize you see i was not prepared to find you so improved why mel youre changed youre justjust lovely  again the rich color stained her cheeks  thank you daren she said i have changed you did it ive gotten well andalmost happy but lets not talk of myself youtheres so much  mel i dont want to talk about myself either he declared when a mans got only a day or so longer  hushoror she threatened with a slight distension of nostrils and a paling of cheek  or what demanded lane  or ill do to you what you did to me  oh youd kiss me to shut my lips  yes i would  fine mel come on but youd have to keep steadily busy all evening for ive come to talk mel came closer to him with a catch in her breathing a loving radiance in her eyes daren youre strangenot like your old self youre too gaytoo happy oh id be glad if you were sincere but you have something on your mind  lane knew when to unmask a battery  no its in my pocket he flashed and with a quick motion he tore out the marriage license and thrust it upon her as her dark eyes took in the meaning of the paper and her expression changed lane gazed down upon her with a commingling of emotions  oh darennono she cried in a wildness of amaze and pain  then lane clasped her close with a force too sudden to be gentle and with his free hand he lifted her face  look here look at me he said sternly every time you say no or shake your headill do this  and he kissed her twice as he had upon his entrance  mel raised her head and gazed up at him wideeyed openmouthed as if both appalled and enthralled  daren ii dont understand you she said unsteadily you frighten me let me goplease daren this issoso unlike you you insult me  mel i cant see it that way he replied im only asking you to come out and marry me tonight  that galvanized her and she tried to slip from his embrace  i told you nonono she cried desperately  thats three said lane and he took them mercilessly you will marry me he said sternly  oh daren i canti dare not ah  you will go right nowmarry me tonight  please be kind daren i dont know how you  mel wherere your coat and hat and overshoes he questioned urgently  i told youno she flashed passionately  lane made good his threat and this last onslaught left her spent and white  you must like my kisses mel iden he said  i implore youdaren  i implore you to marry me  dear friend listen to reason she begged you dont love me youve just a chivalrous notion you can help meand my boyby giving us your name its noble daren thank you but  take care warned lane bending low over her i can make good my word all night  boy youve gone crazy she whispered sadly  well now you may be talking sense he laughed but thats neither here nor there mel i may die any day now  oh my goddont say that she cried as if pierced by a blade  yes mel make me happy just for that little while  happy she whispered  yes ive failed here in every way ive lost all and this thing would make the bitterness endurable  id die for you she returned but marry youdarendearestit will make you the laughingstock of middleville  whatever it makes me i shall be proud  oh i cannot i dare not she burst out  you seem to forget the penalty for these unflattering negatives of yours he returned coolly bending to her lips  this time she did not writhe or quiver or breathe lane felt surrender in her and when he lifted his face from hers he was sure despite the fact that he had inflexibly clamped his will to one purpose holding his emotion in abeyance that brief instant seemed to be the fullest of his life  mel put your arm round my neck he commanded  mel obeyed  now the other  again she complied  lift your facelook at me  she essayed to do this also but failed her head sank on his breast he had won lane held her a moment closely and then a great and overwhelming pity and tenderness his first emotions flooded his soul he closed his eyes dimly vaguely they seemed to create vision of long future time and he divined that good and happiness would come to mel iden some day through the pain he had given her  where did you say your things are he asked its a bad night  theyre inthe hall came in muffled tones from his shoulder ill get them  but she made no effort to remove her arms from round his neck or to lift her head from his breast lane had lost now that singular exaltation of will and power to hold down his emotions her nearness stormed his heart his test came then when he denied utterance to the love that answered hers  nomelyou stay here he said freeing himself ill get them  opening the hall door he saw the hatrack where as a boy he had hung his cap it now held garments over which lane fumbled mel came into the hall  daren youll not know which are mine she said  lane watched her how the shapely hands trembled her face shone white against her dark furs lane helped her put on the overshoes  nowjust a word to mother she said  lane caught her hand and held it following her to the end of the hall where she opened a door and peeped into the sittingroom  mother is dad home she asked  nohes out and such a bad night whos with you mel  daren lane  oh is he up again im glad bring him in why mel youve your hat and coat on  yes mother dear were going out for a while  on such a night what for  daren and i are going toto be married goodbye no more till we come back  as one in a dream lane led mel out in the whirling white pall of snow it seemed to envelop them it was mysterious and friendly and silent  they crossed the bridge and lane again listened for the river voices that always haunted here were they only murmurings of swift waters beyond the bridge lay the railroad station a few dim lights shone through the white gloom lane found a taxi  they were silent during the ride through the lonely streets when the taxi stopped at the address given the driver lane whispered a word to mel jumped out and ran up the steps of a house and rang the bell  is doctor mccullen at home he inquired of the maid who answered the ring he was informed the minister had just gone to his room  will you ask him to come down upon a matter of importance  the maid invited him inside in a few moments a tall severelooking man wearing a long dressingcoat entered the parlor  doctor mccullen i regret disturbing you but my business is urgent i want to be married at once the lady is outside in a car may i bring her in  ah i seem to remember you isnt your name lane  yes  who is the woman you want to marry  miss iden  miss iden you mean joshua idens daughter  i do  the minister showed a grave surprise arent you rather late in making amends no i will not marry you until i investigate the matter he replied coldly  you need not trouble yourself replied lane curtly and went out  the instant opposition stimulated lane and he asked the driver john do you know where we can find a preacher yis sor mr peters of the methodist church lives round the corner answered the man  drive on then  lane got inside the taxi and slammed the door mel he refused to marry us  mel was silent but the pressure of her hand answered him  daren the car has stopped said mel presently  lane got out walked up the steps and pulled the bell he was admitted he had no better luck here lane felt that his lips shut tight and his face set mel said nothing and sat by him very quiet the taxi rolled on and stopped again and lane had audience with another minister he was repulsed here also  were trying a magistrate said lane when the car stopped again  but daren this is where gerald hartley lives not him daren surely you wouldnt go to him  why not inquired lane  it hasnt been two months since he married helen wrapp hadnt you heard  id forgotten said lane  besides daren hehe once asked me to marry himbefore the war  lane hesitated yes he now remembered that in the days before the war the young lawyer had been mels persistent admirer but a reckless mood had begun to manifest itself in lane during the last hour and it must have communicated its spirit to mel for she made no further protest the world was against them they were driving to the home of the man she had refused to marry who had eventually married a girl who had jilted lane in an ordinary moment they would never have attempted such a thing the mansion before which the car stopped was well lighted music and laughter came faintly through the bright windows  a maid opened the door to lane and showed him into a drawingroom in a library beyond he saw women and men playing cards laughing and talking several old ladies were sitting close together whispering and nodding their heads a young fairhaired girl was playing the piano lane saw the maid advance and speak to a sharpfeatured man whom he recognized as hartley lane wanted to run out of the house but he clenched his teeth and swore he would go through with it  mr hartley began lane as the magistrate came through the curtained doorway i hope youll pardon my intrusion my errand is important ive come to ask you to marry me to a lady who is waiting outside  when hartley recognized his visitor he started back in astonishment then he laughed and looked more closely at lane it was a look that made lane wince for he understood it to relate to his mental condition  lane well by jove he exclaimed going to get married you honor me the regular fee which in my official capacity i must charge is one dollar if you can pay that i will marry you  i can pay replied lane quietly and his level steady gaze disconcerted hartley  wheres the woman  shes outside in a taxi  is she over eighteen  yes  lane expected the question as to who the woman was it was singular that the magistrate neglected to ask this the first query offered by every minister lane has visited  fetch her in he said  lane went outside and hesitated at the car door for he had an intuitive flash which made him doubtful but what if hartley did make a show of this marriage the marriage itself was the vital thing lane helped mel out of the car and led her up the icy steps the maid again opened the door  mr lane walk right in said hartley of course its natural for the lady to be a little shy but then if she wants to be married at this hour she must not mind my family and guests they can be witnesses  he spoke in a voice in which lanes ears detected insincerity be seated and wait until i get my book he continued and left the room  hartley had hardly glanced at mel and her veil had hidden her features he had gone toward his study rubbing his hands in a peculiar manner which lane remembered and which recalled the man as he had looked many a time in the bradford billiard room when a good joke was going the rounds lane saw him hurry from his study with pleasant words of invitation to his guests a mysterious air about him a light upon his face the ladies and gentlemen rose from their tables and advanced from the library to the door of the drawingroom a girl of striking figure seized hartleys arm and gesticulated almost wildly it was helen wrapp her husband laughed at her and waved a hand toward the drawingroom and his guests turning swiftly with tigerish grace she bent upon lane great green eyes whose strange expression he could not fathom what passionately curious eyes did she now fasten on his prospective bride  lane gripped mels hand he felt the horror of what might be coming what a blunder he had made  will the lady kindly remove her veil hartleys voice sounded queer his smile had vanished  as mel untied and thrust back the veil her fingers trembled the action disclosed a lovely face as white as snow  mel iden burst from the magistrate for a moment there was an intense silence then ill not marry you cried hartley vindictively  why not you said you would demanded lane  not to save your worthless lives hartley returned facing them with a dark meaning in his eyes  lane turned to mel and led her from the house and down to the curb without speaking once  once more they went out into the blinding snowstorm lane threw back his head and breathed the cold air what a relief to get out of that stifling room  mel im afraid its no use he said finally  we are finding what the world thinks of us replied mel tell the man to drive to 204 locust street  once more the driver headed his humming car into the white storm  once more lane sat silent with his heart raging once more mel peered out into the white turmoil of gloom  daren were going to dr wallace my old minister hell marry us she said presently  why didnt i think of him  i did answered mel in a low voice i know he would marry us he baptized me he has known and loved me all my life i used to sing in his choir and taught his sunday school for years  yet you let me go to those others why  because i shrank from going to him  once more the car lurched into the gutter and this time they both got out and mounted the high steps lane knocked they waited what appeared a long time before they heard some one fumbling with the lock just then the bell in the church tower nearby began chiming the midnight hour the door opened and doctor wallace himself admitted them  well whos this why if its not mel iden what a night to be out in he exclaimed he led them into a room evidently his study where a cheerful wood fire blazed there he took both her hands and looked from her to lane you look so white and distressed this late hourthis young man whom i know what has happened why do you come to methe first time in so many months  to ask you to marry us answered mel  to marry you is this the soldier who wronged you  no this is daren lane he wants to marry me to give my boy a name somehow he finally made me consent  well well here is a story come take off this snowy cloak and get nearer the fire your hands are like ice his voice was very calm and kind it soothed lanes strained nerves with what eagerness did he scrutinize the old ministers face he knew the penetrating eye the lofty brow and white hair the serious lined face sad in a noble austerity but the lips were kind with that softness and sweetness which comes from gentle words and frequent smiles lanes aroused antagonism vanished in the old mans presence  doctor wallace went on mel we have been to several ministers and to mr hartley the magistrate all refused to marry us so i came to my old friend youve known me all my life daren has at last convinced mebroke down my resistance soi askwill you marry us  doctor wallace was silent for many moments while he gazed into the fire and stroked her hand suddenly a smile broke over his fine face  you say you asked hartley to marry you  yes we went to him it was a reckless thing to do im sorry  to say the least it was original the old minister seemed to have difficulty in restraining a laugh then for a moment he pondered  my friends i am very old he said at length but you have taught me something i will marry you  it was a strange marriage behind mel and daren stood the redfaced grinning driver his coarse long coat covered with snow and the simpering housemaid respectful yet glorifying in her share in this midnight romance the old minister with his striking face and white hair gravely turned the leaves of his book no bridegroom ever wore such a stern haggard countenance the brides face might have been a happier one but it could not have been more beautiful  doctor wallaces voice was low and grave it quavered here and there in passages lanes was hardly audible mels rang deep and full  the witnesses signed their names husband and wife wrote theirs the minister filled out the license and the ceremony was over  then doctor wallace took a hand of each  mel and daren he said no human can read the secret ways of god but it seems there is divinity in you both you have been sacrificed to the war you are builders not destroyers you are christians not pagans you have a vision limned against the mystery of the future mammon seems now to rule civilization rocks on its foundations but the world will go on growing better peace on earth good will to men that is the ultimate it was christs teaching you two give me greater faith go now and face the world with heads erectwhatever you do meland however long you live daren who can tell what will happen but time proves all things and the blindness of people does not last forever you both belong to the kingdom of god  but few words were spoken by lane or mel on the ride home mel seemed lost in a trance she had one hand slipped under lanes arm the other clasped over it as for lane he had overestimated his strength a deadly numbness attacked his nerves and he had almost lost the sense of touch when they arrived at mels home the snowstorm had abated somewhat and the lighted windows of the cottage shone brightly  lane helped mel wade through the deep snow or he pretended to help her for in reality he needed her support more than she needed his they entered the warm little parlor some one had replenished the fire the clock pointed to the hour of one lane laid the marriage certificate on the open book mel had been reading mel threw off hat coat overshoes and gloves her hair was wet with melted snow  now daren lane she said softly now that you have made me your wife  up until then lane had been master of the situation he had thought no farther than this moment and now he weakened was this beautiful woman with head uplifted and eyes full of fire the mel iden of his school days now that he had made her his wife  mel theres no now for me he replied with a sad finality from this moment ill live in the past i have no future thank god you let me do what i could ill try to come again soon but i must go now im afraidi overtaxed my strength  oh you look soso she faltered stay darenand let me nurse you we have a little spare room warm cozy ill wait on you daren oh it would mean so much to menow i am your wife  the look of her the tones of her voice made him weak then he thought of his cold sordid lodgings and he realized that one more moment here alone with mel iden would make him a coward in his own eyes he thanked her and told her how impossible it was for him to stay and bidding her good night he reeled out into the white gloom at the gate he was already tired at the bridge he needed rest once more then he heard the imagined voices of the waters calling to him     chapter xviii   seldom did blair maynard ever trust himself any more in the presence of his mothers guests since mrs maynard had announced the engagement of his sister margaret to richard swann she had changed remarkably blair did not love her any the better for the change all his life as long as he could remember he and margaret had hated pretension and the littleness of living beyond their means but now with this one coup detat his mother had regained her position as the leader of middleville society haughty proud forever absorbed in the material side of everything she moved in a selfcreated atmosphere blair could not abide he went hungry many a time rather than sit at table with guests such as mrs maynard delighted to honor  blair and margaret had become estranged and blair spent most of his time alone reading or dreaming but mostly sleeping he knew he grew weaker every day and his weakness appeared to induce slumber  on new years day after dinner he fell asleep in a big chair across the hall from the drawingroom and when he awoke the drawingroom was full of people making new years calls if there was anything blair hated it was to thump on his crutch past curious coldeyed persons so he remained where he was hoping not to be seen but unfortunately for him he had exceedingly keen ears and exceedingly sensitive feelings  some of the guests he knew very well without having to see them the swanns and fanchon smith with her brother and mother gerald hartley and his bride helen wrapp and a number of others prominent as middlevilles elect were recognizable by their voices while he was sitting there trying not to hear what he could not help hearing a number more arrived  they talked it gradually dawned on blair that some gossip was rife anent a midnight marriage between his friend daren lane and mel iden blair was deeply shocked then his emotions never calm grew poignant he listened what he heard spoken of daren and mel made his blood boil sweet voices lowpitched wellmodulated with the intonation of culture made witty and scarcely veiled remarks of a suggestiveness that gave rise to laughter voices of men bland blase deriding daren lane blair listened and slowly his passion mounted to a white heat and then it seemed fate fully in a lull of the conversation some one remarked graciously to mrs maynard that it was a pity that blair had lost a leg in the war  blair thumped up on his crutch and thumped across the hall to confront this assembly  ladies and gentlemen pray pardon me he said in his highpitched tenor cold now and under perfect control i could not help hearing your conversation and i cannot help illuminating your minds it seems exceedingly strange to me that people of intelligence should make the blunders they do so strange that in the future i intend to take such as you have made as nothing but the plain cold fact of perversion of human nature daren lane is so far above your comprehension that it seems useless to defend him i have never done it before he would not thank me but this once i will speak in our group of service menso few of whom came homehe was a hero we all loved him and for soldiers at war that tribute is the greatest if there was a dirty job to be done daren lane volunteered for it if there was a comrade to be helped daren lane was the first to see it he never thought of himself the dregs of war did not engulf him as they did so many of us he was true to his ideal he would have been advanced for honors many a time but for the enmity of our captain he won the croix de guerre by as splendid a feat as i saw during the war thank god we had some officers who treated us like menwho were men themselves but for the majority we common soldiers were merely beasts of burden dogs to drive this captain of whom i speak was a padded shapeshirker from the front linea parader of his uniform before women and he is that todaya chaser of womengirlsgirls of fifteen yet he has the adulation of middleville while daren lane is an outcast my god is there no justice at home here daren lane has not done one thing that was not right some of the gossip about him is as false as hell he has tried to do noble things if he married mel iden as you say it was in some exalted mood to help her or to give his name to her poor little nameless boy  blair paused a moment in a deliberate speech that toward the end had grown breathless the faces before him seemed swaying in a mist  as for myself he continued in passionate hurry i did not lose my leg i sacrificed it i gave my career my youth my health my bodyand i will soon have given my lifefor my country and my people i was proud to do it never for a moment have i regretted it what i lostah what i lost was respect forblair chokedfor the institution that had deluded me what i lost was not my leg but my faith in god in my country in the gratitude of men left at home in the honor of women  friday the tenth of january dawned cold dark dreary and all day a dull clouded sky promised rain or snow from a brides point of view it was not a propitious day for a wedding a half hour before five oclock a stream of carriages began to flow toward st marks and promptly at five the door of the church shut upon a large and fashionable assembly  the swelling music of the wedding march pealed out the bridal party filed into the church the organ peals hushed the resonant voice of a minister with singsong solemnity began the marriage service  margaret maynard knew she stood there in the flesh yet the shimmering white satin the flowing veil covered some one who was a stranger to her  and this other this strange being who dominated her movements stood passively and willingly by while her despairing and truer self saw the shame and truth she was a lie the guests friends attendants bridesmaids the minister the father mother groomall were lies they expressed nothing of their true feelings  the unwelcomed curious who had crowded into the back of the church were the sincerest for in their eyes covetousness was openly unveiled the guests and friends wore the conventional shallow smiles of guests and friends they whispered to one anothera beautiful weddinga gorgeous gowna perfect bridea handsome groom and exclaimed in their hearts how sad the father how lofty proud exultant the mother how like her to move heaven and earth to make this marriage the attendants posed awkwardly a personification of the uselessness of their situation and they pitied the bride while they envied him for whose friendship they stood the bridesmaids graced their position and gloried in it and serenely smiled and thought that to be launched in life in such dazzling manner might be compensation for the loss of much he of the flowing robe of the saintly expression of the trained earnestness the minister who had power to unite these lives saw nothing behind that white veil saw only his fashionable audience while his resonant voice rolled down the aisles of the church who gives this woman to be wedded to this man the father answered and straightway the years rolled back to his youth to hope to himself as he stood at the altar with love and trust and then again to the present to the failure of health and love and life to the unalterable destiny accorded him to the one shame of an honest if unsuccessful lifethe countenancing of this marriage the worldly mother had for once a full and swelling heart for her this was the crowning moment in one sense this fashionable crowd had been pitted against her and she had won what to her had been the pleading of a daughter the importunity of a father the reasoning of a few oldfashioned friends the groom who represented so much and so little in this ceremony had entered the church with head held high had faced his bride with gratified smile and the altar with serene unconsciousness  margaret maynard saw all this saw even the bride with her splendidly regular loveliness and then out of heaven it seemed there thundered an awful command rolling the dream away striking terror to her heart  if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak or else hereafter for ever hold his peace  one long silent terrible moment would not an angel appear with flaming sword to smite her dead but the singsong voice went on like flowing silk  the last guest at mrs maynards reception had gone reluctantly out into the snow and the hostess sat in her drawingroom amid the ruins of flowers and palms she was alone with her triumph mr maynard and mr swann were smoking in the library owing to the storm and delicate health of the bride the wedding journey had been postponed  margaret was left alone at length in the little blueandwhite room which had known her as a child and maiden where she now sat as wife for weeks past she had been emotionless tonight with that trenchant command unanswered except in her heart a spasm of pain had broken the serenity of her calm and had left her quivering  it is done she whispered  the endless stream of congratulations meaningless and abhorrent to her the elaborate refreshments the warm embraces of old friends had greatly fatigued her but she could not rest she paced the little room she passed the beautiful white bridal finery so neatly folded by the bridesmaids and she averted her eyes she seemed not to hate her mother nor love her father she had no interest in her husband she was slipping back again into that creature apart from her real self  the house became very quiet the snow brushed softly against the windows  a step in the hall made margaret pause like a listening deer a tap sounded lightly on her door a voice awoke her at last to life and to torture  margaret may i come in  it was swanns voice a little softer than usual with a subtle eagerness  no answered margaret involuntarily  i beg your pardon ill wait swanns footsteps died away in the direction of the library  the spring of a panther was in margarets action as she began to repace the room all her blood quickened to the thought suggested by her husbands soft voice in the mirror she saw a crimsoned face and shamed eyes from which she turned away  all the pain and repression the fight and bitter resignation and trained indifference of the past months were as if they had never been this was her hour of real agony now was the time to pay the price pride honor love never smothered reserve rooted in the very core of a sensitive womans heart availed nothing once again catching sight of her reflection in the mirror she stopped before it and crossing her hands on her heaving breast she regarded herself with scorn she was false to her love she was false to herself false to the man to whom she had sold herself oh why did i yield she cried she was a coward she belonged to the luxurious class that would suffer anything rather than lose position fallen had she as low as any of them gold had been the price of her soul to keep her position she must marry one man when she loved another she cried out in her wretchedness she felt in her whole being a bitter humiliation she felt stir in her a terrible tumult  margaret wondered how many thousands of girls had been similarly placed and pitied them she thought of the atmosphere in which she lived where it seemed to her every mother was possessed singularly and entirely of one aim to marry her daughter as soon as possible to a man as rich as possible marrying well simply meant marrying money only a few days before her mother had come to her and said mrs fisher called and she was telling me about her daughter alice it seems alice is growing very pretty and very popular she said she was afraid alice had taken a liking to that brandeth fellow whos only a clerk so mrs fisher intends taking alice to the seashore this summer to an exclusive resort of course but one where there will be excitement and plenty of young gentlemen  at the remembrance margaret gave a little contemptuous laugh a year ago she would not have divined the real purport of her mothers words how easy that was now mrs fisher had decided that as alice was eighteen it was time a suitable husband was found for her poor alice balls parties receptions there would be and trips to the seashore and all the other society manoeuvers made ostensibly to introduce alice to the world but if the truth were told in cold blood all this was simply a parading of the girl before a number of rich and marriageable men poor harry brandeth  she recalled many marriages of friends and acquaintances with strange intensity of purpose she brought each one to mind and thought separately and earnestly over her what melancholy facts this exercise revealed she could not recall one girl who was happy perfectly happy unless it was jane silvey who ran off with and married a telegraph operator jane was still brighteyed and fresh happy no doubt in her little house with her work and her baby even though her people passed her by as if she were a stranger then margaret remembered with a little shock there was another friend a bride who had been found on her wedding night wandering in the fields there had been some talk quickly hushed of a drunken husband but it had never definitely transpired what had made her run out into the dark night margaret recollected the time she had seen this girls husband when he was drunk beat his dog brutally then margaret reflected on the gossip she never wanted to hear yet could not avoid hearing over her mothers teatable on the intimations and implications many things she would not otherwise have thought of again but they now recurred and added their significance to her awakening mind she was not keen nor analytical she possessed only an ordinary intelligence she could not trace her way through a labyrinth of perplexing problems still suffering had opened her eyes and she saw something terribly wrong in her mothers world  once more she stopped pacing her room for a step in the hall arrested her and made her stand quivering as if under the lash  i wont she breathed intensely swiftly and lightly she sped across her room opened a door leading to the balcony and went out closing the door behind her softly  mr maynard sat before the library fire with a neglected cigar between his fingers the events of the day had stirred him deeply the cold shock he had felt when he touched his daughters cheek in the accustomed goodnight kiss remained with him still chilled his lips for an hour he sat there motionless with his eyes fixed on the dying fire and in his mind hope doubt and remorse strangely mingled hope persuaded him that margaret was only a girl still sentimental and unpoised unquestionably she had made a good marriage her girlish notions about romance and love must give way to sane acceptance of real human life after all money meant a great deal she would come around to a sensible view and get that strange look out of her eyes that strained blighted look which hurt him then he writhed in his selfcontempt doubt routed all his hope and remorse made him miserable  a hurried step on the stairs aroused mr maynard swann came running into the library he was white his sharp featured face wore a combination of expressions alarm incredulity wonder were all visible there but the most striking was mortification  mr maynard margaret has left her room i cant find her anywhere  the father stared blankly at his soninlaw  swann repeated his statement  what all at once mr maynard sank helplessly into his chair in that moment certainty made him an old broken man  shes gone said swann in a shaken voice she has run off from me i knew she would i knew shed do something ive never been able to kiss heronly last night we quarreled about it i tell you its  pray do not get excited interrupted mr maynard bracing up im sure you exaggerate tell me what you know  i went to her room an hour two hours ago and knocked she was there but refused me admittance she spoke sharplyas ifas if she was afraid i went and knocked again long after she didnt answer i knocked again and again then i tried her door it was not locked i opened it she was not in the room i waited but she didnt come ii am afraid something iswrong  she might be with her mother faltered mr maynard  no im sure not asserted swann not tonight of all nights margaret has grownsomewhat cold toward her mother besides mrs maynard retired hours ago  the father and the husband stole noiselessly up the stairs and entered margarets room the light was turned on full the room was somewhat disordered bridal finery lay littered about a rug was crumpled a wicker basket overturned the fathers instinct was true his first move was to open the door leading out upon the balcony in the thin snow drifted upon this porch were the imprints of little feet  something gleamed pale blue in the light of the open door mr maynard picked it up and with a sigh that was a groan held it out to swann it was a blue satin slipper  heavens exclaimed swann shes run out in the snowshe might as well be barefooted  sshh warned mr maynard unhappy and excited as he was he did not forget mrs maynard let us not alarm any one  there see her footsteps down the stairs whispered swann i can see them clear to the ground  you stay here swann so in case mrs maynard or the servants awake you can prevent alarm we must think of that ill bring her back  mr maynard descended the narrow stairway to the lower porch and went out into the yard the storm had ceased a few inches of snow had fallen and in places was deeper in drifts the moon was out and shone down on a white world it was cold and quiet when mr maynard had trailed the footsteps across his wide lawn and saw them lead out into the street toward the park he fell against a tree unable for a moment to command himself hope he had none left nor a doubt on the other side of the park hardly a quarter of a mile away was the river margaret had gone straight toward it  outside in the middle of the street he found her other slipper she had not even stockings on now he could tell by the impressions of her feet in the snow he remembered quite mournfully how small margarets feet were how perfectly shaped he hurried into the park but was careful to obliterate every vestige of her trail by walking in the soft snow directly over her footprints a hope that she might have fainted before she could carry out her determination arose in him and gave him strength he kept on her trail led straight across the park in the short cut she had learned and run over hundreds of times when a little girl it was hastening her now to her death  at first her footsteps were clearcut distinct and wide apart soon they began to show evidences of weariness the stride shortened the imprints dragged here a great crushing in a snow drift showed where she had fallen  mr maynards hope revived he redoubled his efforts she could not be far how she dragged along then with a leap of his heart and a sob of thankfulness he found her with disheveled hair and face white as the snow where it rested sad and still in the moonlight     chapter xix   middleville was noted for its severe winters but this year the zero weather held off until late in january lane was peculiarly susceptible to the cold and he found himself facing a discomfort he knew he could not long endure every day he felt more and more that he should go to a warm and dry climate and yet he could not determine to leave middleville something held him  the warmth of bright hotel lobbies and theatres and restaurants uptown was no longer available for lane his money had dwindled beyond the possibility of luxury and besides he shrank now from meeting any one who knew him his life was empty dreary and comfortless  one wintry afternoon lane did not wander round as long as usual for the reason that his endurance was lessening he returned early to his new quarters and in the dim hallway he passed a slight pale girl who looked at him she seemed familiar but lane could not place her evidently she had a room in the building lane hated the big barnlike house and especially the bare cold room where he had to seek rest of late he had not eaten any dinner he usually remained in bed as long as he could and made a midday meal answer all requirements appetite like many other things was failing him this day he sat upon his bed in the abstraction of the lonely and unhappy until the cold forced him to get under the covers  his weary eyelids had just closed when he was awakened the confused sense of being torn from slumber gave way to a perception of a voice in the room next to his it was a mans voice rough with the huskiness lane recognized as peculiar to drunkards and the reply to it seemed to be a lowtoned appeal from a woman  playin off sick eh you dont want to work but youll get me some money girl dye hear  a door slammed rattling the thin partition between the two rooms and heavy footsteps dragged in the hall and on the stairway  sleep refused to come back to lane as he lay there he was surprised at the many sounds he heard the ramshackle old structure which he had supposed almost vacant was busy with life stealthy footfalls in the hallways passed and repassed a piano drummed somewhere a mans loud voice rang out and a womans laugh faint hollow and far away like the ghost of laughter returned in echo the musical clinking of glasses the ring of a cash register the rattling click of pool balls came up from below  presently lane remembered the nature of the place it was a house of night in daylight it was silent its inmates were asleep but as the darkness unfolded a cloak over it all the hidden springs of its obscure humanity began to flow lying there with the womans appeal haunting him and all those sounds in his ears he thought of their meaning the drunkard with his lust for money his moaning victim the discordant piano the man with the vacant laugh the lost hope and youth in the womans that echoed it the stealing slipping feet of those who must tread softlyall conveyed to lane that he had awakened in another world a world which shunned sunlight  toward morning he dozed off into a fitful sleep which lasted until ten oclock when he arose and dressed as he was about to go out a knock on the door of the room next to his recalled the incident of the night he listened another knock followed somewhat louder but no response came from within  say you in there cried a voice lane recognized as the landladys she rattled the doorknob  a girls voice answered weakly come in  lane heard the door open  i wants my room rent i cant get a dollar out of your drunken father will you pay its four weeks overdue  i have no money  then get out an leave me the room the landlady spoke angrily  im ill i cant get up the answer was faint  lane opened his door quickly and confronted the broad person of the landlady  how much does the woman owe he asked quietly  ahhuh the exclamation was trenchant with meaning twenty dollars if its anything to you  ill pay it i think i heard the woman say she was ill  she says she is  may i be of any assistance  ask her  lane glanced into the little room a counterpart of his but it was so dark he could see nothing distinctly  may i come in let me raise the blind there the sun is fine this morning now may i not  he looked down at a curly head and a sweet pretty face that he knew  i know you he said groping among past associations  i am rose clymer she whispered and a momentary color came into her wan cheeks  rose clymer bessy bells friend  yes mr lane im not so surprised as you i recognized you last night  then it was you who passed me in the hall  yes  well and youre ill what is the matter ah last nightit was youryour fatheri heard  yes she answered ive not been well sincefor a long time and i gave out last night  here i am talking when i might be of some use said lane and he hurried out of the room the landlady had discreetly retired to the other end of the hall he thrust some money into her hands  she seems pretty sick do all you can for her be kind to her ill pay im going for a doctor  he telephoned for doctor bronson  an hour later lane coming upstairs from his meal met the physician at roses door he looked strangely at lane and shook his head  daren how is it i find you here in this place  beggars cant be choosers answered lane with his old frank smile  humph exclaimed the doctor gruffly  how about the girl asked lane  shes in bad shape replied bronson lane are you aware of her condition  why shes illthats all i know replied lane slowly rose didnt tell me what ailed her i just found out she was here  doctor bronson looked at lane too bad you didnt find out sooner ill call again today and see her and say daren you look all in yourself  never mind me doctor its mighty good of you to look after rose i know youve more patients than you can take care of rose has nothing and her fathers a poor devil but ill pay you  never mind about money rejoined bronson turning to go  lane could learn little from rose questions seemed to make her shrink so lane refrained from them and tried to cheer her the landlady had taken a sudden liking to lane which evinced itself in her change of attitude toward rose and she was communicative she informed lane that the girl had been there about two months that her father had made her work till she dropped old clymer had often brought men to the hotel to drink and gamble and to the girls credit she had avoided them  for several days doctor bronson came twice daily to see rose he made little comment upon her condition except to state that she had developed peritonitis and he was not hopeful soon rose took a turn for the worse the doctor came to lanes room and told him the girl would not have the strength to go through with her ordeal lane was so shocked he could not speak dr bronsons shoulders sagged a little an unusual thing for him im sorry daren he said i know you wanted to help the poor girl out of this but too late i can ease her pain and thats all  strangely shaken and frightened lane lay down in the dark the partition between his room and roses might as well have been paper for all the sound it deadened he could have escaped that but he wanted to be near her and he listened to roses moans in the darkness lane shuddered there helpless suffering realizing then the foreboding silence became more dreadful than any sound it was terrible for lane that strange cold knot in his breast that coil of panic seemed to spring and tear quivering through all his body what had he known of torture of sacrifice of divine selflessness he understood now how the loved and guarded woman went down into the valley of the shadow for the sake of a man likewise he knew the infinite tragedy of a ruined girl who lay in agony gripped by relentless nature  lane was called into the hall by mrs obrien she was weeping bronson met him at the door  shes dying he whispered youd better come in ive phoned to doctor wallace  lane went in almost blinded the light seemed dim yet he saw rose with a luminous glow radiating from her white face  i feelso light she said with a wan smile  lane sat by the bed but he could not speak the moments dragged he had a feeling of their slow but remorseless certainty  then there were soft steps outsidemrs obrien opened the doorand doctor wallace entered the room  my child he gravely began bending over her  roses big eyes with their strained questioning gaze sought his face and doctor bronsons and lanes  roseare youin pain  the burnings gone she said  my child began doctor wallace again your pain is almost over will you not pray with me  no i never was twofaced replied rose with a weary shake of the tangled curls i wont show yellow now  lane turned away blindly it was terrible to think of her dying bitter unrepentant  oh if i could hope murmured rose to see my mother  then there were shuffling steps outside and voices the door was opened by mrs obrien old clymer crossed the threshold he was sober haggard grieved he had been told no one spoke as he approached roses bedside  lasslass he began brokenly  then he sought from the men confirmation of a fear borne by a glance into roses white still face and silence answered him  lass if youre gointell mewho was to blame  no onebut myselffather she replied  tell me who was to blame demanded clymer harshly  her pale lips curled a little bitterly and suddenly as a change seemed to come over her they set that way she looked up at lane with a different light in her eyes then she turned her face to the wall  lane left the room to pace up and down the hall outside his thoughts seemed deadlocked by and bye doctor bronson came out with doctor wallace who was evidently leaving  she is unconscious and dying said doctor bronson to lane and then bade the minister goodbye and returned to the room  how strangely bitter she was exclaimed doctor wallace to lane yet she seemed such a frank honest girl her attitude was an acknowledgment of sin but she did not believe it herself she seemed to have a terrible resentment not against one man or many persons but perhaps life itself she was beyond me a modern girla pagan but such a brave loyal generous little soul what a pity i find my religion at fault because it can accomplish nothing these days     chapter xx   lane took roses death to heart as if she had been his sister or sweetheart the exhaustion and exposure he was subjected to during these days dragged him farther down  one bitter february day he took refuge in the railroad station the old negro porter who had known lane since he was a boy evidently read the truth of lanes condition for he contrived to lead him back into a corner of the irregular room it was an obscure corner rather hidden by a supporting pillar and the projecting end of a news counter this seat was directly over the furnace in the cellar several pipes too hot to touch came up through the floor it was the warmest place lane had found and he sat there for hours he could see the people passing to and fro through the station arriving and leaving on trains without himself being seen that afternoon was good for him and he went back next day  but before he could get to the coveted seat he was accosted by blair maynard lane winced under blairs piercing gaze and the haggard face of his friend renewed lanes deadened pangs lane led blair to the warm corner and they sat down it had been many weeks since they had seen each other blair talked in one uninterrupted flow for an hour and so the life of the people lane had given up was once again open to him it was like the scoring of an old wound then lane told what little there was to tell about himself and the things he omitted blair divined after that they sat silent for a while  of course you knew mels boy died said blair presently  ohno exclaimed lane  hadnt you heard i thoughtof course you yes he died some time ago croup or flu i forget  dead whispered lane and he leaned forward to cover his face with his hands he had seemed so numb to feeling but now a storm shook him  dare its better for himand mel too said blair with a hand going to his friends shoulder that idea never occurred to me until day before yesterday when i ran into mel she lookedoh i cant tell you how but i got that strange impression  diddid she ask about me queried lane hoarsely as he uncovered his face and sat back  she certainly did replied blair warmly and i lied like a trooper i didnt know where you were or how you were but i pretended you were ok  and then asked lane breathlessly  she said tell daren i must see him i promised and set out to find you i was pretty lucky to run into you and now old sport let me get personal will you  go as far as you like replied lane in muffled voice  well i think mel loves you went on blair in hurried softness i always thought soeven when we were kids and now i know it and lord dare you just ought to see her now shes lovely and shes your wife  what if she isboth lovelyand my wife queried lane bitterly  if i were you id go to her id sure let her take care of me dare the way youre living is horrible i have a home such as it is my room is warm and clean and i can stay in it but youdare it hurts me to see youas you are  no interrupted lane passionately the temptation blair suggested was not to be borne  lane met blair the next afternoon at the station and again on the next that established a habit in which both found much comfort and some happiness thereafter they met every day at the same hour often for long they sat silent each occupied with his own thoughts occasionally blair would bring a package which contained food he had ransacked from the larder at home together they would fall upon it like two schoolboys but what lane was most grateful for was just blairs presence  it was distressing then after these meetings had extended over a period of two weeks to be confronted one afternoon by a new station agent who called blair and lane bums and ordered them out of the place  blair raised his crutch to knock the man down but lane intercepted it and got his friend out of the station it was late afternoon with the sun going down over the hill across the railroad yards blair stood a moment bareheaded with the light on his handsome haggard face how frail he seemedtoo frail of body for the magnificent spirit so flashing in his eyes so scathing on his bitter lips lane bade him goodbye and turned away with a strange intimation that this was the last time he would ever see blair alive  wretched and desperate lane bought drink and took it to his room with him on that dark winter night he sat by the window of his room insensible now to the cold to the wind moaning outside to the snow whirling against the pane he lived with phantoms to and fro to and fro glided the wraithforms vanishing and appearing the soft rustling sound of the snow was the rustle of their movements across the gleam of light streaking coldly through the pane flickering fitfully on the wall floated shadows and faces  he did not know when he succumbed to drowsy weakness but he awoke at daylight lying on the floor stiff with cold drink helped him to drag through that day then something happened to him and time meant nothing night and day were the same he did not eat when he lay back upon his bed he became irrational yet seemed to be conscious of it when he sat up his senses slowly righted but he preferred the spells of aberration sometimes he was possessed by hideous nightmares out of which he awoke with the terror of a child then he would have to sit up in the dark in a cold sweat and wait and wait until he dared to lie back again  in the daytime delusions grew upon him one was that he was always hearing the strange voices of the river and another that he was being pursued by an old woman clad in a flowing black mantle with a hood on her head and a crooked staff in her hand the voices and apparition came to him now in his waking hours they came suddenly without any prelude or warning he explained them as odd fancies resulting from strong drink they grew on him until his harsh laugh could not shake them off he managed occasionally to drag himself out of the house in the streets he felt this old black hag following him but later she came to him in the lonely silence of his room he never noticed her unless he glanced behind him and he was powerless to resist that impulse at length the dreary old woman who seemed to grow more gaunt and ghostly every day took the form in lanes disordered fancy of the misfortune that war had put upon him  lane dreamed once that it was a gray winter afternoon dark lowering clouds hung over the drabcolored hills and a chill north wind scurried over the bare meadows sending the dead leaves rustling over the heath and moaning through the leafless oaks what a sad day it was he thought as he faced the biting wind sad as was his life and a fitting one for the deed on which he had determined long since he had left the city and was on the country road he ascended a steep hill from its highest point he looked back toward the city he was leaving forever faint it lay in the distance only a few of its white spires shining out dimly from the purple haze  what was that dark shadow far down the winding road he discerned an object moving slowly up the hill closer he looked and trembled an old woman with flowing black robes was laboriously climbing the hill whirling he placed his hand on his breast firmly grasped something there and then strode onward soon he glanced over his shoulder yes there she came hobbling over the crest her bent form and long crooked staff clearly silhouetted against the gray background she raised the long staff and pointed it at him  now it seemed the day was waning deep shadows lay in the valleys and night already enveloped the forest through rents in the broken clouds a few pale stars twinkled fitfully soon dark cloud curtains scurried across these spaces shutting out the light  he plunged into the forest his footsteps made no sound on the soft moss as he glided through wooded aisles and under giant trees once well into the deep woods he turned to look behind him he saw a shadow blacker than the forestgloom stealthily slipping from tree to tree he looked no more for hours he traveled on and on never stopping never looking backward never listening intent only on placing a great distance between him and his pursuer  he came upon a swamp where his feet sank in the soft earth and through all the night with tireless strength and fateful resolve he toiled into this dreamy waste of woods and waters until at length a huge black rock loomed up in his way he ascended to its summit and looked beyond  it seemed now that he had reached his destination wood spirits and phantoms of night would mourn over him but they would keep his secret he peered across a shining lake and tried to pierce the gloom no living thing moved before his vision silver rippling waves shimmered under that starlit sky tall weird pines waved gently in the night breeze slender cedars resembling spectres reared their heads toward the blueblack vault of heaven he listened intently there was a faint rustling of the few leaves left upon the oaks the strange voices that had always haunted him the murmuring of river waters or whispering of maidens or muttering of women were now clear  suddenly two white forms came gliding across the waters the face of one was that of a young girl golden hair clustered round the face and over the fair brow the lips smiled with mournful sweetness the other form seemed instinct with life the face was that of a living breathing girl soulful passionate her arms outstretched her eyes shining with a strange hopeful light  down down down he fell and sank through chill depths falling slowly falling softly the cool waters passed he floated through misty shadowy space an infinitude of silence enclosed him then a dim and sullen roar of waters came to his ears borne faintly then stronger on a breeze that was not of earth anguish and despair tinged that sodden wind weird and terrible came a cry steaming boiling burning rumbling chaosa fearful rushing sullen water then a flash of light like a falling star sped out of the dark clouds  lane found himself sitting up in bed wet and shaking the room was dark some one was pounding on the door  hello lane are you there called a mans deep voice  yes whats wanted answered lane  the door opened wide impelled by a powerful arm light from the hallway streamed in over the burly form of a man in a heavy coat he stood in the doorway evidently trying to see  sick in bed hey he queried with gruff kind voice  i guess i am whore you  im joshua iden and ive come to pack you out of here he said  no protested lane faintly  your wife is downstairs in a taxi waiting went on his strange visitor  my wife whispered lane  yes mel iden my daughter youve forgotten maybe but she hasnt she learned today from doctor bronson how ill you were and so shes come to take you home  mel iden the name seemed a part of the past this was only another dream thought lane and slowly fell back upon his bed  say arent you able to sit up queried this visitor lane took for the spectre of a dream he advanced into the room he grasped lane with firm hand and then lane realized this was no nightmare he began to shake  sit up he echoed vaguely sure i can youre mels father  yes replied the other come get out of this well you havent much dressing to do and thats good steady there  as he rose lane would have fallen but for a quick move of idens  only shoes and coat said lane fumbling around theyre somewhere  here you are let me help there have you an overcoat  no replied lane  well theres a robe in the taxi come on now ill come back and pack your belongings  he put an arm under lanes and led him out into the hall and down the dim stairway to the street under the yellow light lane saw a cab toward which iden urged him lane knew that he moved but he seemed not to have any feeling in his legs the cabman put a hand back to open the door  mel here he is called out iden cheerfully  lane felt himself being pushed into the cab his knees failed and he sank forward even as he saw mels face  daren she cried and caught him  then all went black     chapter xxi   lanes return to consciousness was an awakening into what seemed as unreal and unbelievable as any of his morbid dreams  but he knew that his mind was clear it did not take him a moment to realize from the feel of his body and the fact that he could not lift his hand that he had been prostrate a long time  the room he lay in was strange to him it had a neatness and cleanliness that spoke of a womans care it had two small windows one of which was open sunshine flooded in and the twitter of swallows and hum of bees filled the air outside lane could scarcely believe his senses a warm fragrance floated in spring what struck lane then most singularly was the fact of the silence there were no city sounds this was not the iden home presently he heard soft footfalls downstairs and a low voice as of some one humming a tune what then had happened  as if in answer to his query there came from below a sound of heavy footfalls on a porch the opening and closing of a door a mans cheery voice and then steps on the stairs the door opened and doctor bronson entered  hello doc said lane in a very faint voice  well you son of a gun ejaculated the doctor in delight then he called down the stairs mel come up here quick  then came a low cry and a flying patter of light feet mel ran past the doctor into the room to lane she seemed to have grown along with the enchantments his old memories had invoked with parted lips eagereyed she flashed a look from lane to doctor bronson and back again then she fell upon her knees by the bed  do you know me she asked her voice tremulous  sure youre the wifeof a poor sick soldierdaren lane  oh doctor he has come to cried mel in rapture  fine ive been expecting it every day said doctor bronson rubbing his hands now daren you can listen all you want but dont try to talk youve really been improving ever since we got you out here to the country for a while i was worried about your mind lately though you showed signs of rationality and now alls ok in a few days well have you sitting up  doctor bronsons prophecy was more than fulfilled from the hour of lanes return to consciousness he made rapid improvement most of the time he slept and upon awakening he seemed to feel stronger lane had been ill often during the last eighteen months but after this illness there was a difference inasmuch as he began to make surprising strides toward recovery doctor bronson was nonplussed and elated mel seemed mute in her gratitude lane could have told them the reason for his improvement but it was a secret he hid in his heart  in less than a week he was up walking round his little room peering out of the windows  mel had told lane the circumstances attending his illness it had been late in february when she and her father had called for him at his lodgings he had collapsed in the cab they took him to the iden home where he was severely ill during march in april he began to improve although he did not come to his senses one day mr iden brought jacob lane an uncle of lanes to see him lanes uncle had been at odds with the family for many years there had been a time when he had cared much for his nephew daren the visit had evidently revived the old mans affection for the result was that jacob lane offered daren the use of a cottage and several acres of land on sycamore river just out of town joshua iden had seen to the overhauling of the cottage and as soon as the weather got warm doctor bronson had consented to lanes removal to the country and in a few days after his arrival at the cottage lane recovered consciousness  well this beats me said lane for the hundredth time uncle jake letting us have this farm i thought he hated us all  daren it was your going to warand coming backthat you were ill and fell to so sad a plight i think if your uncle had known hed have helped you  mel i couldnt ask anybody for help said lane dont you understand that  you were a stubborn fellow mused mel  me never im the meekest of mortals mel i know every rock along the river here this is just above where at flood time the sycamore cuts across that rocky flat below and makes a bad rapid theres a creek above and a big woods i used to fish and hunt there a good deal  two weeks passed by and daren felt himself slowly but surely getting stronger every morning when he came down to breakfast he felt a little better had a little more color in his pale cheeks at first he could not eat but as the days went by he regained an appetite which to mels delight manifestly grew stronger no woman could have been brighter and merrier she laughed at the expression on his face when he saw her hands red from hot dishwater and she would not allow him to help her the boast she had made to him of her housekeeping abilities had not been an idle one she prepared the meals and kept the cottage tidy and went about other duties in a manner that showed she was thoroughly conversant with them  the way in which she had absolutely put aside the past her witty sallies and her innocent humor her habit of singing while at work the depth of her earnest conversation in all the sweet wholesome strength and beauty of her nature had a remarkable effect on lane he began to live again it was simply impossible to be morbid in her presence while he was with her he escaped from himself  the day came when he felt strong enough to take a walk he labored up the hillside toward a wood thereafter he went every day and walked farther every time  with his returning strength there crept into his mind the dawning of a hope that he might get well at first he denied it denied even the conviction that he wished to live but not long the hope grew and soon he found himself deliberately trying to build up his health every day he put a greater test upon himself and as summer drew on he felt his strength gradually increasing against doctor bronsons advice he got an axe and set to work on the wood pile very cautiously at first  every day he wielded the axe until from sheer exhaustion he could not lift it then he would sit on a log and pant and scorn his weakness what a poor man it was who could not chop wood for ten minutes without getting out of breath this pile of logs became to him a serious and meaning obstacle every morning he went at it doggedly his back grew lame his arms sore his hands raw and blistered but he did not give up  mel seemed happy to see him so occupied and was loath to call him even when it was necessary after lunch it was his habit to walk in the woods unmindful of weather every day he climbed the hill plunged into the woods and tramped until late in the afternoon returning he usually slept until mel called him to dinner afterward they spent the evening in the little library the past seemed buried lanes curiosity as to family and friends had not reawakened  mel possessed a rich contralto voice which had been carefully cultivated every evening in the twilight with only the flickering of the wood fire in the room she would sit at the piano and sing lane would close his eyes and let the mellow voice charm his every sense it called up his highest feelings it lingered in his soul thrilled along his heart and played on the chords of love and hope it dispelled the heavy gloom that so often pressed down upon him it vanquished the depression that was the forerunner of his old terrible black mood  it came about that lane spent most of his time outdoors in the fields along the river on the wooded hills the morbid brooding lost its hold on his mind and in its place came memories dreams imaginations he walked those hills with phantoms of the past and phantoms of his fancy  the birds sang the leaves fluttered the wind rustled through the branches white clouds sailed across the blue sky a crow cawed from a hilltop a hawk screeched from above the roar of the river rapids came faintly upward and lane saw eyes gazing dreamily downward thoughtful at a word looking into life trying to pierce the veil it was all so beautifulso terrible  the peeping of frogs roused in lane sensations thrilling and strange the quick sharp notes were suggestive of cool nights of flooded streams and marshy places how often lane wandered in the dusk along the shore to listen to this chorus  at that hour twilight stole down the dark hills rose to the pale blue sky there was a fair star and a wisp of purple cloud and the shadowy waters gleamed breaking into the trill of the frogs came the song of a lonely whippoorwill  lane felt a better spirit resurging he felt the silence the beauty the mystery the eternal that was there all that was small and frail was passing from him there came a regurgitation of physical strengtha change of blood  the following morning while lane was laboring over his wood pile he thought he heard voices in the front yard and presently mel came around the walk accompanied by doctor wallace and doctor bronson  well lane glad to see you said doctor bronson in his hearty tones doctor wallace and i are on our way to the grange and thought wed stop off a minute  how are you mr lane i see youre taking work seriously put in doctor wallace in his kindly way  oh im coming round all right replied lane  he stood there with his shirt sleeves rolled up his face bronzed a little and now warm and moist from the exercise with something proven about him with a suggestion of a new force which made him different  there was an unmistakable kindliness in the regard of both men and a scarcely veiled fear lane was quick to read both men were afraid they would not find him as they had hoped to  mel youve chosen a charming location for a home observed doctor wallace  when mel was showing her old teacher and friend the garden and flowerbeds the practical doctor bronson asked lane did you chop all that wood  the doctor pointed to three long piles of wood composed of short pieces regularly stacked one upon another  i did  how long did it take you  ive been weeks at it thats a long time but you know doctor i was in pretty poor condition i had to go slow  well youve done wonders i want to tell you that i hardly knew you youre still thin but youre gaining i wont say now what i think be careful of sudden or violent exertion thats all youve done more than doctors can do     chapter xxii   mel come here called lane from the back porch who the deuce are those people coming down the hill  mel shaded her eyes from the glare of the bright morning sun the lady is miss hill my old schoolteacher id know her as far as i could see her look how she carries her left arm this is saturday for she has neither a lunch basket nor a prayer book in that outstretched hand if you see miss hill without either you can be certain its saturday as to the gentlemandaren can it possibly be colonel pepper  thats the colonel sure as youre alive declared lane with alacrity they must be coming here where else could they be making for but mel for them to be together why the colonels an old sport and shemelyou know miss hill  whereupon mel acquainted daren with the circumstances of a romance between miss hill and the gallant colonel  wellof all things gasped lane and straightway became speechless  youre right daren they are coming in isnt that nice of them now dont you dare show i told you anything miss hill is so easily embarrassed shes the most sensitive woman i ever knew  lane recovered in time to go through the cottage to the front porch and to hear miss hill greet mel affectionately and announce with the tone of a society woman that she had encountered colonel pepper on the way and had brought him along lane had met the little schoolteacher but did not remember her as she appeared now for she was no longer plain and there was life and color in her face and as for embarrassment not a trace of it was evident in her bearing according to mel the mere sight of man much less of one of such repute as colonel pepper would once have been sufficient to reduce miss hill to a trembling shadow  but the colonel none of his courage manifested an appearance now to lanes hearty welcome he mumbled some incoherent reply and mopped his moist red face he was wonderfully and gorgeously arrayed in a new suit of light check patent leather shoes a tie almost as bright as his complexion and he had a carnation in his buttonhole this last proof of the colonels mental condition was such an overwhelming shock to lane that all he could do for a moment was stare the colonel saw the stare and it rendered him helpless  miss hill came to the rescue with pleasant chat and most interesting news to the exiles she had intended coming out to the cottage for ever so long but the weather and one thing or another falling on a saturday had prevented until today how pretty the little home did not the colonel agree with her that it was so sweet so cosy and picturesquely situated did they have chickens what pleasure to have chickens and flowers too of course they had heard about mr harry white and the widow about the dissension in doctor wallaces church and margaret maynard was far from well and helen wrapp had gone back home to her mother and bessy bell had grown into a tall ravishingly beautiful girl and had distracted her mother by refusing a millionaire and seemed very much in love with young dalrymple  and ive the worst class of girls i ever had went on miss hill the one i had last year was a class of angels compared to what i have now i reproved one girl whose mother wrote me that as long as middleville had preachers like doctor wallace and teachers like myself there wasnt much chance of a girl being good so im going to give up teaching  the little schoolmistress straightened up in her chair and looked severe colonel pepper shifted uneasily bent his glance for the hundredth time on his shiny shoes and once more had recourse to his huge handkerchief and heated brow  well colonel it seems good to see you once more put in lane tell me about yourself how do you pass the time  same old story daren same old way a game of billiards now and then and a little game of cards but im more lonely than i used to be  why you never were lonely exclaimed lane  oh yes indeed i was always protested the colonel  a little game of cards mused lane how well i remember you used to have some pretty big games too  eryesyou seeonce in a while very seldom just for fun he replied  how about your old weakness hope youve conquered that went on lane mercilessly  the colonel was thrown into utter confusion and when miss hill turned terrible eyes upon him poor pepper looked as if he wanted to sink through the porch  lane took pity on him and carried him off to the garden and the river bank where he became himself again  they talked for a while but neither mentioned the subject that had once drawn them together for both of them a different life had begun  a little while afterward mel and lane watched the bright figure and the slight dark one go up the hillside cityward  what do you know about that ejaculated lane for the tenth time  hush said mel and she touched his lips with a soft exquisite gesture  at three oclock one june afternoon mel and daren were lounging on a mossy bank that lined the shady side of a clear rapidrunning brook a canoe was pulled up on the grass below them with an expression of utter content lane was leaning over the brook absorbed in the contemplation of a piece of thread which was tied to a crooked stick he held in his hand he had gone back to his boyhood days just then the greatest happiness on earth was the outwitting of brightsided minnows and golden flecked sunfish mel sat nearby with her lap full of flowers which she had gathered in the long grass and was now arranging she was dressed in blue a sunbonnet slipped back from her head her glossy hair waved in the breeze she looked as fresh as a violet  well daren we have spent four delightful happy hours how time flies but its growing late and we must go said mel  wait a minute or two replied lane ill catch this fellow see him bite hes cunning hes taken my bait time and again but ill get him there see him run with the line its a big sunfish  how do you know you havent seen him  i can tell by the way he bites ha ive got him now cried lane giving a quick jerk there was a splash and he pulled out a squirming eel  ugh the nasty thing cried mel jumping up lane had flung the eel back on the bank and it just missed falling into mels lap she screamed and then when safely out of the way she laughed at the disgust in his face  so it was a big sunfish my what a disillusion so much for a mans boastful knowledge  well if it isnt a slimy old eel there be off with you go back into the water said lane as he shook the eel free from the hook  come we must be starting  he pushed the canoe into the brook helped mel to a seat in the bow and shoved off in some places the stream was only a few feet wide but there was enough room and water for the light craft and it went skimming along the brook turned through the woods and twisted through the meadows sometimes lying cool and dark in the shade and again shining in the sunlight often lane would have to duck his head to get under the alders and willows here in an overshadowed bend of the stream a heron rose lumbering from his weedy retreat and winged his slow flight away out of sight a water wagtail that cunning sentinel of the brooks gave a startled tweet tweet and went flitting like a gray streak of light round the bend  daren please dont be so energetic said mel nervously  im strong as a horse now imhello whats that  i didnt hear anything  i imagined i heard a laugh or shout  the stream was widening now as it neared its mouth lane was sending the canoe along swiftly with vigorous strokes it passed under a watergate round a quick turn in the stream where a bridge spanned it and before lane had a suspicion of anything unusual he was right upon a merry picnic party there were young men and girls resting on the banks and several sitting on the bridge automobiles were parked back on the bank  lane swore under his breath he recognized margaret dick swann and several other oldtime acquaintances and friends of mels  who is it asked mel her back was turned she did not look round though she heard voices  it doesnt matter said lane calmly  he would have given the world to spare mel the ordeal before her but that was impossible he put more power into his stroke and the canoe shot ahead  it passed under the bridge not twenty feet from margaret swann there was a strange eager wondering look in margarets clear eyes as she recognized mel then she seemed to be swallowed up by the green willows  that was damned annoying muttered lane to himself he could have met them all face to face without being affected but he realized how painful this meeting must be to mel these were mels old friends he had caught margarets glance old memories came surging back his gaze returned to mel her face was grave and sad her eyes had darkened and there was a shadow in them his glance sought the greenlined channel ahead the canoe cut the placid water turned the last bend and glided into the swift river soon lane saw the little cottage shining white in the light of the setting sun  one afternoon as lane was returning from the woods he met a car coming out of the grassy road that led down to his cottage as he was about to step aside a gay voice hailed him he waited the car came on it contained holt dalrymple and bessy bell  say dont you dodge us called holt  daren lane screamed bessy  then the car halted and with two strides lane found himself face to face with the young friends he had not seen for months holt appeared a man now and bessyno longer with bobbed hairolder taller changed incalculably struck him as having fulfilled her girlish promise of character and beauty well its good to see you youngsters said lane as he shook hands with them  holt seemed trying to hide emotion but bessy after that first scream sat staring at lane with a growing comprehending light in her purple eyes  suddenly she burst out darenyoure well oh how glad i am holt just look at him  im looking bess and if hes really daren lane ill eat him responded holt  this is all i needed to make today the happiest day of my life said bessy with serious sweetness  this do you mean meeting me im greatly flattered bessy said lane with a smile  then both a blush and a glow made her radiant  daren im sixteen today holt and i arewere engaged i told mother and expected a row she was really pleased and then seeing you well again why daren youve actually got color then holt has been given a splendid business opportunity andoh its all too good to be true  well of all things cried lane when he had a chance to speak you two engaged ii could never tell you how glad i am lane felt that he could have hugged them both i congratulate you with all my heart now holtbessy make a go of it youre the luckiest kids in the world  daren weve both had our fling and weve both been hurt said bessy seriously and you bet we know how lucky we areand what we owe daren lane for our happiness today  bessy that means a great deal to me replied lane earnestly i know youll be happy you have everything to live for just be true to yourself  so the moment of feeling passed  we went down to your place said holt and stayed a while waiting for you  daren i think mel is lovely may i not come often to see you both added bessy  you know how pleased well be bessy do you ever see my sister lorna asked lane hesitantly  yes i see her now and then only the other day i met her in a store daren shes getting some sense she has a better position now and she said she was not going with any fellow but harry  and my mother lane went on  she is quite well lorna said and they are getting along well now lorna hinted that a relativean uncle i think was helping them  lane was silent a moment too stirred to trust his voice presently he said bessy your birthday has brought happiness to some one besides yourself  he bade them goodbye and strode on down the hill toward the cottage how strangely meetings changed the future holts pride of possession in bessy brought poignantly back to lane his own hidden love for mel and bessys rapture of amaze at his improvement in health put lane face to face with a possibility he had dreamed of but had never believed inthat he might live  that night was for lane a sleepless one he seemed to have traveled in a dreamy circle and was now returning to memories and pangs from which he had long been free  next morning without any hint to mel of his intentions he left the cottage and made his way into town almost he felt as he had upon his return from france he dropped in to see his mother and was happy to find her condition of mind and health improved she was overjoyed to see lane her surprise was pitiful she told him she was sure that he had recovered  it was this matter of his physical condition that had brought lane into middleville for many months he had resigned himself to death and now he could not deny even his morbid fancy that he felt stronger than at any time since he left france he had worked hard to try to get well but he had never in his heart believed that possible  lane called upon doctor bronson and asked to be thoroughly examined the doctor manifestly found the examination a task of mounting gratification at length he concluded  daren i told you over a year ago i didnt know of anything that could save your life he said i didnt but something has saved your life you are thirty pounds heavier and gaining fast that hole in your back is healed your lungs are nearly normal you have only to be careful of a very violent physical strain that weak place in your back seems gone youre going to live my boy there has been some magic at work im very happy about it how little doctors know  dazed and stunned by this intelligence lane left the doctors residence and turned through town on his way homeward as he plodded on he began to realize the marvelous truth what would blair say he hurried to a telephone exchange to acquaint his friend with the strange thing that had happened but blair had been taken to a sanitarium in the mountains lane hurried out of town into the country down the river road to the cottage there to burst in upon mel  daren she cried in alarm whats happened  she rose unsteadily her eyes dilating  doctor bronson saidi waswell panted lane  oh daren is that it she replied with a wonderful light coming to her face ive known that for weeks  after allim not goingto die my god  lane rushed out and strode along the river and followed the creek into the woods once hidden in the leafy recesses he abandoned himself to a frenzy of rapture what he had given up had come back to him life and he lay on his back with his senses magnified to an intense degree  the day was late in june and a rich thick amber light floated through the glades of the forest majestic white clouds sailed in the deep blue sky the sun shone hot down into the glades under the pines and maples there was a cool sweet shade wild flowers bloomed a fragrance of the woods came on the gentle breeze the leaves rustled the melancholy song of a hermit thrush pierced the stillness a crow cawed from a high oak the murmur of shallow water running over rocks came faintly to lanes ears  lane surrendered utterly to the sheer primitive exultation of life the supreme ecstasy of that hour could never have been experienced but for the long hopeless months which had preceded it for a long time he lay there in a transport of the senses without thinking as soon as thought regained dominance over his feelings there came a subtle change in his reaction to this situation  he had forgotten much he had lived in a dream he had unconsciously grown well he had been strangely unbelievably happy why mel iden had nursed him loved him inspired him back to health her very presence near him even unseen had been a profound happiness he made the astonishing discovery that for months he had thought of little else besides his wife he had lived a lonely life in his room and in the open but all of it had been dominated by his dreams and fancies and emotions about her he had roused from his last illness with the past apparently dead there was no future so he lived in the moment the hour while he lay awake in the silence of night or toiled over his wood pile or wandered by the brook under the trees his dreamy thoughts centered about her and now the truth burst upon him his love for her had been stronger than his ruined health and blasted life stronger than misfortune stronger than death it had made him well he had not now to face death but life and the revelation brought on shuddering dread  lane lingered in the woods until late afternoon then he felt forced to return to the cottage the look of the whole world seemed changed all was actual vivid striking mels loveliness burst upon him as new and strange and terrible as the fact of his recovery he had hidden his secret from her he had been like a brother kind thoughtful gay at times always helpful but he had remained aloof he had basked in the sunshine of her presence dreamily reveling in the consciousness of what she was to him that hour had passed forever  he saw her now as his wife a girl still one who had been cruelly wronged by life who had turned her back upon the past and who lived for him alone she had beauty and brains a wonderful voice and personality that might have fitted her for any career or station in life she thought only of him she had found content in ministering to him she was noble and good  in the light of these truths coming to him lane took stock of his love for mel it had come to be too mighty a thing to understand in a moment he lived with it in the darkness of midnight and in the loneliness of the hills he had never loved helen always he had loved mel idenall his life clear as a crystal he saw the truth the war with its ruin for both of them had only augmented the powers to love lanes year of agony in middleville had been the mere cradling of a mounting and passionate love he must face it now no longer in dreamy lulled unconsciousness but in all its insidious and complex meaning the spiritual side of it had not changed this girl with the bloom of womans loveliness upon her with her grace and sweetness and fire with the love that comes only once in life belonged to him was his wife she did not try to hide anything she was unconscious of appeal her wistfulness came from her lonely soul  the longer lane dwelt on this matter of his love for mel the deeper he found it the more inexplicable and alluring and when at last it stood out appallingly master of him so beautiful and strange and bitter he realized that between him and mel was an insurmountable and indestructible barrier  then came storm and strife of soul night and day the conflict went on outwardly he did not show much sign of his trouble though he often caught mels dark eyes upon him sadly conjecturing he worked in the garden he fished the creek and rowed miles on the river he wandered in the woods and the only change that seemed to rise out of his tumult was increasing love for this girl with whom his fate had been linked  so once more lane became a sufferer burdened by pangs a wanderer along the naked and lonely shore of grief his passion and his ideal were at odds unless he changed his nature his reverence for womanhood he could never realize the happiness that might become his all that he had sacrificed had indeed been in vain but he had been true to himself his pity for mel was supreme it was only by the most desperate selfcontrol that he could resist taking her in his arms confessing his love swearing with lying lips he had forgotten the wrong done her and asking her to face the future as his loving wife the thought was maddening it needed no pity for mel to strengthen it he needed love he needed to fulfill his life  but lane did not yield though he knew that if he continued to live with mel in time the sweetness and enchantment of her would be too great for him this he confessed  more and more he had to fight his jealousy and the treacherous imagination that would create for him scenes of torment he cursed himself as base and ignoble yet the truth was always there if mel had only loved the father of her childif she had only loved blindly and passionately as a womanit would have been different but her sacrifice had not been one of love it had been one of war it had the nobility of womans sacrifice to the race but as an individual she had perished     chapter xxiii   summer waned the long hot days dragged by the fading rushes along the river drooped wearily over their dry beds the yellowing leaves of the trees hung dejected they were mute petitioners for cool breezes and rain the grasshoppers chirped monotonously the locusts screeched shrilly both being products of the long hot summer and survivors of the heat inclined to voice their exultation far into the fall season  september yielded them full sway and burned away day by day week by week dusty and scorching without even a promise of rain october however dawned misty and dark the clouds crept up reluctantly at first and then as if to make amends for neglect trooped black and threatening toward the zenith storm followed storm and at evening after the violent crashing thunder and vivid lightning and driving torrents of rain had ceased a soft steady downpour persisted all night and all the next day  the drought was broken a rainy fall season was prophesied the old danger of the river rising in flood was feared  after the sear and lifeless color of the fields and forests what a welcome relief to daren lane were the freshened green the dawning red the tinging gold the forest on the hill was soft and warm and but for the gleams of autumn would have showed some of the tenderness of spring down in the lowlands a sea of color waved under a blue smoky melancholy haze  lane climbed high that sunday afternoon and penetrated deep into the woods  there was rest here the forest was rich warm with the scent of pine of arbor vitae there was the haunting promise of more brilliant hues thoughts swept through lanes mind the great striving world was out of sight here in the goldflecked shade under the murmuring pines and pattering poplars there was a world full of joy wise in its teaching significant of the glory that was fading but which would come again  lane loved the low hills the deep colorful woods in autumn there he lost himself he learned silence and solitude taught him from there he had vision of the horde of men righting down the false impossible trails of the world he felt the sweetness the frailty the dependence the glory and the doom of women battling with life he realized the hopeless traits of human nature like dead scales his egotism dropped from him he divined the weaving of chances the unknown and unnamed the pondering fates in store the dominance of pain over allthe wraith of the pastthe importunity of a future never to be gainedthe insistence of nature everpressing closer its ruthless claimsall these which became intelligible to lane could not keep life from looming sweet hopeful wonderful worthy mans best fight  and sometimes the old haunting voices whispered to him out of the river shadowsdeeper different strangely more unintelligible than ever before calling more to his soul  next morning lane got up at the usual hour and went outdoors but returned almost immediately  the river is rising fast listen hear that roar theres a regular old niagara just below  i imagined that roar was the wind  the water has come up three feet since daylight i guess ill go down now and pull in some driftwood  oh daren dont be so adventurous when the river is high theres a dangerous rapid below  youre right about that but i wont take any risks i can easily manage the boat and ill be careful  the following three days it rained incessantly outside on the gravel walks there was a ceaseless drip drip drip  friday evening the rain ceased the murky clouds cleared away and for a few moments a rainbow mingled its changing hues with the ruddy glow of the setting sun the next day dawned bright and dear  lane was indeed grateful for a change mel had been unaccountably depressed during those gloomy days and it worried him that this morning she did not appear her usual self  mel are you well he asked  yes i am perfectly well she replied i couldnt sleep much last night on account of that roar  dont wonder this flood will be the greatest ever known in middleville  yes and that makes more suffering for the poor  there are already many homeless its fortunate our cottage is situated on this high bank just look i declare jostling logs and whirling drifts theres a pen of some kind with an object upon it  its a pig oh poor piggy said mel compassionately  a hundred yards out in the rushing yellow current a small house or shed drifted swiftly down stream upon it stood a pig the animal seemed to be stolidly contemplating the turbid flood as if unaware of its danger  here the river was half a mile wide and full of trees stumps fences bridges shedsall kinds of drifts just below the cottage the river narrowed between two rocky cliffs and roared madly over reefs and rocks which at a low stage of water furnished a playground for children but now that space was terrible to look upon and the dull roar with a hollow boom at intervals was dreadful to hear  dareniive kept something from you said mel nervously i should have told you yesterday  what interrupted lane sharply  its this its about poor blair hehes dead  lane stared at her white face as if it were that of a ghost  blair you should have told me i must go to see him  it was not a long ride from the terminus of the car line to where the maynards lived yet measured by lanes growing distress of mind it seemed a neverending journey  he breathed a deep breath of relief when he got off the car and when the maynard homestead loomed up dark and silent he hung back slightly a maid admitted lane and informed him that mr maynard was ill and mrs maynard would not see any one margaret was not at home the maid led lane across the hall into the drawingroom and left him alone  in the middle of the room stood a long black clothcovered box lane stepped forward upon the dark background in striking contrast lay a white stern face marblelike in its stonecold rigidity blair his comrade  the moment lane saw the face his strange fear and old gloomy bitterness returned something shot through him which trembled in his soul to him the story of blairs sacrifice was there to read in his quiet face and with it was an expression he had never seen a faint wonder of relief which suggested peace  how strange to look upon blair and find him no longer responsive something splendid loyal generous loving had passed away gone was the vital spark that had quickened and glowed to noble thoughts gone was the strength that had been weakness gone the quick nervous highstrung spirit gone the love that had no recompense the drawn face told of physical suffering hard blair had found the world bitter the reward of the soldier wretched the unholy worship of money and luxury vain and hollow mockery the home of his boyhood  lane went down the path and out of the gate he had faint perceptions of the dark trees along the road he came to a little pine grove it was very quiet there was a hum of insects and the familiar sad everpresent swishing of the wind through the trees he listened to its soft moan and it eased the intensity of his feelings this emotion was new to him death however had touched him more than once well he remembered his stunned faculties the unintelligible mystery the awe and the grief consequent on the death of his first soldier comrade in france but this was different it was a strange disturbance of his heart oppression began to weight him down and a nameless fear  he had to cross the river on his way home to the cottage in the middle of the bridge he halted to watch the sliding flood go over the dam to see the yellow turgid threshing of waves below the mystic voices that had always assailed his ears were now roaring they had a message for him it was death had he not just looked upon the tragic face of his comrade out over the tumbling waters lanes strained gaze swept up and down to and fro while the agony in his heart reached its height the tumult of the flood resembled his soul he spent an hour there then turned slowly homeward  he stopped at the cottage gate it was now almost dark the evening star lonely and radiant peeped over the black hill with some strange working at his heart with some strange presence felt lane gazed at the brilliant star how often had he watched it out there in the gloom somewhere perhaps near at hand had lurked the grim enemy waiting for blair that now might be waiting for him he trembled the old morbidness knocked at his heart he shivered again and fought against something intangible the old conviction thrust itself upon him he had been marked by fate life war death he knew it he had only forgotten  daren daren  mels voice broke the spell lane made a savage gesture as if he were in the act of striking thought of mel recalled the stingingly sweet and bitter fact of his love and of life that called so imperiously     chapter xxiv   if amanda would only marry me sighed colonel a pepper as he stacked the few dishes on the cupboard shelf and surveyed his untidy little kitchen with disparaging eyes  the oncecontented colonel was being consumed by two great firesremorse and love for more years than he could remember he had been a victim of a deplorable habit then two soft eyes shone into his life and in their light he saw things differently and he tried to redeem himself  even good fortune in the shape of some halfforgotten meadow property suddenly becoming valuable had not revived his once genial spirits remorse was with him because miss hill refused to marry him till he overcame the habit which had earned him undesirable fame  so day by day poor colonel pepper grew sicker of his lonely rooms his lonely life and of himself  if amanda only would he murmured for the thousandth time and taking his hat he went out the sunshine was bright but did not give him the old pleasure he walked and walked taking no interest in anything presently he found himself on the outskirts of middleville within sound of the muffled roar of the flooded river and he wandered in its direction at sight of the old wooden bridge he remembered he had read that it was expected to give way to the pressure of the rushing water on the levee which protected the lowlying country above the city were crowds of people watching the river  yeve no rivers loike thot in garminy observed a halfdrunken irishman he and several more of his kind evidently were teasing a little german  colonel pepper had not stood there long before he heard a number of witticisms from these redfaced men  after the manner of his kind the german had stolidly swallowed the remarks about his big head and its shock of stubby hair and his checked buff trousers but at reference to his native country his little blue eyes snapped and he made a remark that this river was extremely like one in germany  at this the characteristic contrary spirit of the irishman burst forth  dutchy id loike ye to know yere exaggeratin he said garminy aint big enough for a river the loike o this an ill leave it to me intilligintlookin frind here  colonel pepper thus appealed to blushed looked embarrassed coughed and then replied that he thought germany was quite large enough for such a river  did ye study gographie questioned the irishman with fine scorn  colonel pepper retired within himself  the unsteady and excitable fellow had been crowded to the rear by his comrades who evidently wished to lessen in some degree the possibilities of a fight  phwats in thim rivers yere spoutin about asked one  vater ov course  me woodenshoed frind ye mane beerbeer  you insolt me you redheaded  was that dutchman addressin of me demanded the halfdrunken irishman trying to push by his friends  itd be a foiner river if it wasnt yaller said a peacemaker holding his comrade  in the slight scuffle which ensued one of the men unintentionally jostled the german his pipe fell to the ground he bent to recover it  through colonel peppers whole being shot the lightning of his strange impulse a tingling tremor ran over him a thousand giants lifted and swung his arm he fought to check it but in vain with his blood bursting with his strength expending itself in one irresistible effort with his soul expanding in fiendish unholy glee he brought his powerful hand down upon the bending german  there was a great shout of laughter  the german fell forward at length and knocked a man off the levee wall then the laughter changed to excited shouts  the wall was steep but not perfectly perpendicular several men made frantic grabs at the sliding figure they failed however to catch it then the man turned over and rolled into the river with a great splash cries of horror followed his disappearance in the muddy water and when an instant later his head bobbed up yells filled the air  no one had time to help him he tried ineffectually to reach the levee then the current whirled him away the crowd caught a glimpse of a white despairing face which rose on the crest of a muddy wave and then was lost  in the excitement of the moment the colonel hurried from the spot horror possessed him he felt no less than a murderer again he walked and walked retribution had overtaken him the accursed habit that had disgraced him for twenty years had wrought its punishment plunged into despair he plodded along the streets till at length out of his stupefaction came the questionwhat would amanda say  with that an overwhelming truth awakened him he was free he might have killed a man but he certainly had killed his habit he felt the thing dead within him wildly he gazed around to see where he was and thought it a deed of fate that he had unconsciously traveled toward the home of his love for there before his eyes was amandas cottage with the red geranium in her window he ran to the window and tapped mysteriously and peered within then he ran to the door and knocked it opened with a vigorous swing  mr pepper what do you meantapping on my window in such clandestine manner and in broad daylight too demanded miss hill with a stern voice none of her scholars had ever heard  amanda dear i am a murderer cried pepper in tones of unmistakable joy i am a murderer but ill never do it again  laws exclaimed miss hill  he pushed her aside and closed the door and got possession of her hands all the time pouring out incoherent speech in which only it was distinguishable  man alive are you crazy asked miss hill getting away from him into a corner but it happened to be a corner with a couch and when her trembling legs touched it she sat down  never never again will i do it cried the colonel with a grand gesture  can you talk sense faltered the schoolmistress  colonel pepper flung himself down beside her and with many breathless stops and repetitions and eloquent glances and applications of his bandana to his heated face he finally got his tragic story told  is that all inquired miss hill with a touch of sarcasm why youre not a

woods as he neared the flooded river he thought he heard a shout for help he hurried down to the bank and looked around him but saw no living thing then he was brought up sharply by a cry the unmistakable scream of a human being in distress it seemed to come from behind a boathouse running as far round the building as the water would permit he peered up and down the river in both directions  at first he saw only the halfsubmerged float the sunken hull of a launch the fastrunning river and across the wide expanse of muddy water the outline of the levee suddenly he spied out in the river a piece of driftwood to which a man was clinging  help help came faintly over the water  lane glanced quickly about him several boats were pulled up on the shore one of which evidently had been used by a boatman collecting driftwood that morning for it contained oars and a long pikepole the boat was long wide of beam and flat of bottom with a sharp bow and a blunt stern a craft such as experienced rivermen used for heavy work without a moments hesitation lane shoved it into the water and sprang aboard  meanwhile short though the time had been the log with its human freight had disappeared beyond the open space in the willows  although lane pulled a powerful stroke when he got out of the slack water into the current so swift was it that the boat sheered abruptly and went down stream with a sweep marking the piece of driftwood and aided by the swiftly running stream lane soon overhauled it  the log which the man appeared to be clutching was a square piece of timber probably a beam of a bridge for it was long and full of spikes when near enough lane saw that the fellow was not holding on but was helpless and fast on the spikes his head and arms were above water  lane steered the boat alongside and shouted to the man as he made no outcry or movement lane after shipping the oars reached over and grasped his collar steadying himself so as not to overturn the boat lane pulled him halfway over the gunwale and then with a second effort he dragged him into the boat  the man evidently had fainted after his last outcry his body slipped off the seat and flopped to the bottom of the boat where it lay with the white face fully exposed to the glare of the sun a broad scar now doubly sinister in the pallid face disfigured the brow  lane recoiled from the wellremembered features of richard swann  god almighty he cried and his caustic laughter rolled out over the whirling waters the boat now disengaged from the driftwood floated swiftly down the river  lane stared in bewilderment at swanns pale features his amazement at being brought so strangely face to face with this man made him deaf to the increasing roar of the waters and blind to the greater momentum of the boat  a heavy thump a grating sound and splintering of wood followed by a lurch of the boat and a splashing of cold water in his face brought lane back to a realization of the situation  he looked up from the white face of the unconscious man the boat had turned round he saw a huge stone that poked its ugly nose above the water he turned his face down stream a sea of irregular waves twisting currents dark dangerous rocks and patches of swirling foam met his gaze  when lane stood up with a boatmans instinct to see the water far ahead the spectacle thrilled him a yellow flood in changeful yet consistent action rolled and whirled down the wide incline between the stony banks and lost itself a mile below in a smoky veil of mist visions of past scenes whipped in and out his mind and he saw an ocean careening and frothing under a golden moon a tide sweeping down curdled with sand a grim stream of silt rushing on with the sullen sweep of doom and the wildfire of the prairie leaping cavorting reaching out turning and shooting irresistibly borne under the lash of the wind he saw in the current a live thing freeing itself in terror  a roar like the blending of a thousand storms among the pines filled his ears and muffled his sense of hearing and appalled him he sat down with his cheeks blanching his skin tightening his heart sinking for in that roar he heard death escape was impossible the end he had always expected was now at hand but he was not to meet it alone the man who had ruined his sister and so many others must go to render his accounting and in this justice of fate lane felt a wretched gratification  the boat glanced with a hard grind on a rock and shot down a long yellow incline a great curling wave whirled back on lane a heavy shock sent him flying from his seat a gurgling demoniacal roar deafened his ears and a cold eager flood engulfed him he was drawn under as the whirlpool sucks a feather he was tossed up as the wind throws a straw the boat bobbed upright near him he grasped the gunwale and held on  it bounced on the buffeting waves and rode the long swells like a cork it careened on the brink of falls and glided over them it thumped on hidden stones and floating logs it sped by blacknosed rocks it drifted through fogs of yellow mist it ran on piles of driftwood it trembled with the shock of beating waves and twisted with the swirling current  still lane held on with a viselike clutch  suddenly he seemed to feel some mighty propelling force under him he rose high with the stern of the boat then the bow pitched down into a yawning hole a long instant he and the boat slid down a glancing fallthen thunderous roarfurious contending wrestlecold yellow flying sprayicy immersing enveloping blackness  a giant tore his hands from the boat he whirled round and round as he sank a languid softness stole over him he saw the smile of his mother the schoolmate of his boyhood the old attic where he played on rainy days and the spotted cows in the pasture and the running brook he saw himself a tall young man favorite of all winning his way in life that was bright  then terrible blows of his heart hammered at his ribs throbs of mighty pain burst his brain great constrictions of his throat choked him he began fighting the encompassing waters with frenzied strength up and up he fought his way to see at last the light to gasp at the air but the flood sucked at him a weight pulled at his feet as he went down again something hard struck him with the last instinctive desperate love of life in his action he flung out his hand and grasped the saving thing it was the boat he hooked his elbow over the gunwale then darkness filmed over his eyes and he seemed to feel himself whirling round and round round and round a long time seemingly he whirled while the darkness before his eyes gave way to smoky light his dead ears awoke to confused blur of sound but the weight on his numb legs did not lessen  all at once the boat grated on a rock and his knees struck he lay there holding on while life and sense seemed to return something black and awful retreated then the rush and roar of the rapids was again about him he saw that he had drifted into a back eddy behind the ledge of rock and had whirled slowly round and round with a miscellaneous collection of driftwood  lane steadied himself on the slippery ledge and got to his feet the boat was half full of water out of which swarms ghastly face protruded by dint of great effort lane pulled it sideways on the ledge and turned most of the water out  swann lay limp and sodden but for his eyes he would have appeared dead and they shone with a conscious light of terror of passionate appeal and hope the look with which a man prayed for his life presently his lips moved imperceptibly save me for gods sake save me  shuddering emotion that had the shock of electricity shook lane in his ears again rang the sullen hollow reverberating boom of the flood here was the man who had done most to harm him begging to be saved swann poor wretch was afraid to die he feared the unknown he had a terror of that seething turmoil of waters he could not face the end of that cold ride why  fool lane cried glaring wildly about him was it another dream unreality swayed him again he heard the roar he saw the splitting whitecrested waves the clouds of yellow vapor he beat his numb legs and shook himself like a savage dog then he made a discoveryin some way he could not account for the oars had remained in the boat they had been loose in their oarlocks  questions formed in lanes mind questions that seemed put by a dawning significance why had he heard the cry for help why had he found the boat why had the drowning man proved to be one of two men on earth he hated one of the two men whom he wanted to kill why had he drifted into the rapids why had he come safely through a vortex of death why had swanns lips formed that prayer why had the oars remained in the boat  far below over the choppy sea of waves he saw a bridge it was his old familiar resting place through the white enveloping glow he seemed to see himself standing on that bridge then came to him a strange revelation yesterday he had stood on that bridge after seeing blair for the last time he had stood there while he lived through an hour of the keenest anguish that had come to him and in that agony he had watched the plunging river he had watched it with eyes that could never forget his mind exquisitely alive with the sensibility of a plexus of racked and broken nerves had taken up every line every channel and stone and rapid of that flood and had engraved them in ineffaceable characters with the unintelligible vagary of thought while his breast seemed crushed his heart broken he had imagined himself adrift on that surging river and he had planned his escape through the rapids  as lane stood on the ledge kneedeep in the water with the certainty that he had a perfect photograph of the field of tumbling waters below in his minds eye a strange voice seemed to whisper in his ear  this is your great trial  without further hesitation he shoved the boat off the ledge  round and round the back eddy he floated at the outlet on the downstream side where the gleaming line of foam marked the escape of water into the onrushing current he whirled his boat stern ahead down he shot with a plunge and then up with a rise racing on over the uneven swells he felt the hissing spray and the malignant tips of the waves that broke their fury on the boat and expended it in a shower of stinging drops the wind cut his face he rode a sea of foam then turgid rolling mounds of water that heaved him up and up and down long planes that laughed with hollow boom then into channels of smooth current where the torrent wreathed the black stones in yellowish white  lane saw the golden sun the blue sky the fleecy clouds the red and purple of the colored hills and felt his chest expand with the mounting glory of great effort the muscles of his back and arms strengthened by the long toil with his heavy axe rippled and swelled and burned and stretched like rubber cords and strung tight like steel bands the boat was a toy  he rodes the waves and threaded a labyrinth of ugly stones and shot an unobstructed channel and evaded a menacing drift the current carried him irresistibly onward when his keen eye caught danger ahead he sunk the oars deep and pulled back a powerful stroke made the boat pause another turned her bow to the right or left then the swift water hitting her obliquely sheered her in the safe direction so lane kept afloat through the spray that smelled fresh and dank through the crash and surge and roar and boom through the boiling caldron  the descent quickened on on he was borne with increasing velocity the yellow demons rose in fury boooom boooom the old river god voiced his remorseless roar the shrill screaming shriek of splitting water on sharp stones cut into the boom on on into the yellow mist that might have been smoke from hell streaked the boat out upon a curving billow then down down upon an upheaving curl of frothy water the river like a huge yellow mound hurled its mass at lane all was fog and steam and whistling spray and rumble  at length the boat swept out into the open with a long plunge over the last bit of roughened water here the current set in a curve to the left running off the rocky embankment into the natural channel of the river the dam was now only a couple of hundred yards distant the water was smooth and the drift had settled to a slow ponderous sliding movement  lane pulled powerfully against the current and toward the righthand shore that was closest besides he remembered a long sluice at the end of the dam where the water ran down as on a millrace if he could row into that  in front of lane extending some distance was a broad unbroken expanse of water leading to the dam a tremendous roar issued from that fall the muddy spray and mist rose high to drift over there would be fatal logs and pieces of debris were kept rolling there for hours before some vagary of current caught them and released them  lane calculated the distance with cunning eye he had been an expert boatman all his boyhood days by the expenditure of his last bit of reserve strength he could make the sluice and he redoubled his efforts to such an extent that the boat scarcely went down stream at all yet edged closer to the right hand shore lane saw a crowd of people on the bridge below the dam they were waving encouragement he saw men run down the steep river bank below the mill and he knew they were going to be ready to assist him if he were fortunate enough to ride down the sluice into the shallow backwater on that side  rowing now with the most powerful of strokes lane kept the bow of the boat upstream and a little to the right thus he gained more toward the shore but he must time the moment when it would be necessary to turn sharply  i canmakeit muttered lane he felt no excitement the thing had been given him to do his strokes were swift but there was no hurry  suddenly he felt a strange catching of breath in his lungs he coughed blood warm and salt welled up from his throat then his bitter strangled cry went out over the waters at last he understood the voices of the river  lane quickened his strokes he swung the bow in he pointed it shoreward straight for the opening of the sluice his last strokes were prodigious the boat swung the right way and shot into the channel lane dropped his oars he saw men below wading kneedeep in the water the boat rode the incline down to the long swell and curled yellow billows below where it was checked with violent shock lane felt himself propelled as if into darkness  when lane opened his eyes he recognized as through a veil the little parlor of the idens all about him seemed dim and far away faces and voices were there indistinguishable a dark cloud settled over his eyes he dreamed but could not understand the dreams the black veil came and went  what was the meaning of the numbness of his body the immense weight upon his breast then it seemed he saw better though he could not move sunlight streamed in at the window outside were maple leaves gold and red and purple swaying gently then a great roaring sound seemed to engulf him the rapids the voice of the river  then mel was there kneeling beside him all save her face grew vague  swann he whispered  you saved his life said mel  ah and straightway he forgot melwhatswrongwith me  mels face was like white marble and her hands on his trembled violently she could not answer but he knew there seemed to be a growing shadow in the room her eyes held a terrible darkness  mel inever toldyou he whispered i married youbecause i loved you but i wasjealous i hated i couldnt forgive i couldnt understand now i know theres a law no womancan transgress soul and love are the samein a woman they must be inviolable if i could have livedid have surrendered to you for i loved youbeyond words to tell it was love that made me well but we could not have been happy never with that spectre between us and soit must bealways in spite of warand wealthin spite of menwomen must rise  his voice failed and again the strange rush and roar enveloped him but it seemed internal dimmer and farther away mels face was fading she spoke and her words were sweet without meaning then the fading grayness merged into night   the end       theres more to follow          more stories of the sort you like more probably
